Long live Your Majesty!

21
00:02:35,741 --> 00:02:38,021
All of you
are the pillars of Southern Chen.

22
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,181
On this festive occasion,

23
00:02:40,781 --> 00:02:43,700
I'd like to thank you all
with this wine.

24
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:51,901
Your Majesty, we wish you
a long and happy life,

25
00:02:52,061 --> 00:02:55,021
and peace and prosperity
in Southern Chen.

26
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,461
Uncle.

27
00:03:32,781 --> 00:03:33,420
Your Majesty.

28
00:03:44,781 --> 00:03:45,341
Cheers.

29
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,540
Ms. Mu.

30
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,140
Cheers.

31
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,501
Your Majesty,

32
00:04:03,621 --> 00:04:05,501
it's time to propose a toast
to the Dowager Empress.

33
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:12,621
I have to deal with the girls again.

34
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,260
Uncle.

35
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,541
Let's go.

36
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,661
Come on.
Guys, Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

37
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,741
Greetings, Mother.

38
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,460
Rise.

39
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,061
Thank you, Mother.

40
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:24,741
Your Majesty.

41
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,301
Your Majesty.

42
00:05:58,981 --> 00:06:01,820
Are you not feeling well, Mother?

43
00:06:04,661 --> 00:06:07,621
All the prominent ladies
of the capital are here.

44
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:10,340
I wonder what kind of girl
can catch your eye.

45
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,101
Ms. Mu.

46
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:15,820
Cheers.

47
00:06:18,301 --> 00:06:19,421
(Why do I think of her?)

48
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,580
Your Majesty, do you already
have a crush on someone?

49
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,541
No.

50
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,101
Mother,

51
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,541
I have to go back to the imperial garden

52
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,780
to entertain the fellow officials.

53
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,421
I shall take my leave now.

54
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,981
Fine. Since you don't want to stay,

55
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,700
just leave.

56
00:06:50,861 --> 00:06:51,780
It's a pity

57
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:54,460
that the First Princess is sick,

58
00:06:55,101 --> 00:06:56,700
or the Mid-Autumn Festival banquet

59
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,820
would be more lively.

60
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:00,020
Your Majesty.

61
00:07:10,981 --> 00:07:13,260
I heard that today is an important day
in Southern Chen.

62
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,580
On behalf of Northern Liang,
I, Yemu Zhen, propose a toast to you.

63
00:07:23,061 --> 00:07:23,861
Your Majesty,

64
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,621
Jing'an is really thoughtful.

65
00:07:28,941 --> 00:07:30,140
You've taught her well.

66
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,061
I wouldn't dare take credit for that.

67
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,981
It's that Jing'an is smart.

68
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:39,340
Your Majesty.

69
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,140
Lord Ding,

70
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,700
I'd like to propose a toast to you.

71
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:11,380
Cheers.

72
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:17,460
Official Mu, please forgive me.

73
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,621
I was too careless.

74
00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:19,580
It's okay.

75
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,541
I can just wipe it off.

76
00:08:20,621 --> 00:08:22,181
Official Mu, did you get burned?

77
00:08:22,421 --> 00:08:24,260
It's okay.
Thank you for your concern, Shen.

78
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,820
I think I have another set of clothes
at the Ministry of Revenue.

79
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,621
I'll head there to get it for you
right away.

80
00:08:29,981 --> 00:08:32,381
But His Majesty could return
at any time.

81
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,340
If you don't mind,

82
00:08:33,421 --> 00:08:34,661
please come with me

83
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,460
to the guest room for a while

84
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,781
and change your clothes when I get them.

85
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,781
That's a good idea.

86
00:08:42,301 --> 00:08:42,820
Shen,

87
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:43,980
I'll be right back.

88
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:44,781
Okay.

89
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:05,860
Your Lordship,

90
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:08,141
I'd like to propose a toast to you too.

91
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,500
Official Shen,

92
00:09:18,261 --> 00:09:19,500
you have a talent for contributing
to the betterment of society

93
00:09:20,021 --> 00:09:21,421
and you shall use it well.

94
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,740
Thank you for the reminder,
Your Lordship.

95
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:53,580
Official Mu, this is the guest room.

96
00:09:54,941 --> 00:09:56,820
Take off this dirty robe

97
00:09:57,021 --> 00:09:58,421
and I'll get you a clean one.

98
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:01,580
All right. Thank you.

99
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,740
Have you seen Official Mu
from the Ministry of Revenue?

100
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:21,340
I think I saw Official Mu
heading that way.

101
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,460
Your Majesty,

102
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,661
are you all right?

103
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,220
Are you feeling unwell?

104
00:10:37,421 --> 00:10:38,141
I'm fine.

105
00:10:40,781 --> 00:10:42,061
I'm just a little drunk.

106
00:10:43,901 --> 00:10:44,620
Your Majesty,

107
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,740
that's the guest room up ahead.

108
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,220
Why don't I help you
to take a rest over there first,

109
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,901
and I'll get the imperial physician
to check on you?

110
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,500
Isn't that Official Mu?

111
00:11:11,301 --> 00:11:11,901
Your Majesty.

112
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,620
Your Majesty.

113
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,021
Your Majesty.

114
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,100
Your Majesty.

115
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,860
Your Majesty, be careful.

116
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,021
I'm fine.

117
00:11:44,061 --> 00:11:44,580
Your Majesty.

118
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,220
I...

119
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,860
I'm just a little drunk.

120
00:11:49,901 --> 00:11:51,340
Come on, have some water.

121
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,620
Your Majesty,

122
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:55,740
are you alright?

123
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,421
Your Majesty!

124
00:12:00,061 --> 00:12:00,661
Your Majesty,

125
00:12:00,661 --> 00:12:01,901
I'll get the imperial physician now.

126
00:12:08,901 --> 00:12:09,740
Is anyone there?

127
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:11,340
Is anyone there?

128
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:13,700
Get the imperial physician here now!

129
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,541
Guards!

130
00:12:30,941 --> 00:12:31,661
Your Lordship.

131
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:37,860
Your Lordship.

132
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:41,620
Let go.

133
00:12:43,141 --> 00:12:44,740
If you like Miss Mu,

134
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,980
you can marry her as your wife.

135
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,021
I...

136
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,700
I'm willing to be your concubine.

137
00:12:54,301 --> 00:12:55,141
Let go.

138
00:12:57,021 --> 00:12:58,901
How bad am I?

139
00:12:59,301 --> 00:13:00,301
Even if I am willing to be a concubine,

140
00:13:00,301 --> 00:13:01,740
I can't get you to agree to marry me.

141
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,141
It's because I don't want
to make her suffer.

142
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,220
Your Majesty!

143
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,541
Your Majesty!

144
00:13:37,421 --> 00:13:38,181
Your Majesty,

145
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,261
it's a good time
to appreciate the moon today.

146
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,941
With all the ladies with us,

147
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,181
why don't we

148
00:13:45,421 --> 00:13:47,340
take a walk
in the imperial garden together?

149
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,781
It's nice to appreciate
the flowers and the moon.

150
00:13:52,661 --> 00:13:54,301
That's a good idea.

151
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,661
Let's do as you suggest, then.

152
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:12,580
Your Majesty.

153
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,061
Stop there.

154
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,460
Your Majesty.

155
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,021
What's with the panic?

156
00:14:41,021 --> 00:14:41,901
In the guest room...

157
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,941
In the guest room,
there are a man and a woman

158
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,580
who are...

159
00:14:48,141 --> 00:14:49,460
I'd like to see

160
00:14:50,061 --> 00:14:51,700
who has the audacity

161
00:14:52,261 --> 00:14:53,620
to defy

162
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,340
the rules of the palace.

163
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,580
Outrageous!

164
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,781
Am I the Emperor or is he the Emperor?

165
00:15:07,301 --> 00:15:08,700
I just wanted a reply
from my subordinate,

166
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,460
but he came straight to the door
to question me.

167
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,580
Will he fight me head-on in the future?

168
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,381
Your Majesty, why are you so angry?

169
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22,261
Who is the one who is so bold

170
00:15:22,781 --> 00:15:24,421
as to defy you?

171
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,220
Who else in Southern Chen

172
00:15:29,141 --> 00:15:30,820
would dare talk back to His Majesty

173
00:15:31,301 --> 00:15:32,141
like that?

174
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,901
Liu Yan

175
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,541
is too cocky.

176
00:15:46,421 --> 00:15:47,781
It was a close call tonight.

177
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:49,381
Thankfully, you got there just in time.

178
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,460
You're too weak.

179
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,620
Save your strength.

180
00:15:57,941 --> 00:15:59,220
By the time I've regained my strength,

181
00:15:59,941 --> 00:16:01,901
that door won't be able to hold us back.

182
00:16:06,021 --> 00:16:08,381
By the time
you've regained your strength,

183
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,740
I'm afraid...

184
00:16:12,421 --> 00:16:14,541
I'm afraid those who want to
accuse us of having an affair

185
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,460
will be here.

186
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,460
I don't dare get involved
in any more scandals

187
00:16:22,021 --> 00:16:22,740
or...

188
00:16:25,021 --> 00:16:27,100
Or someone will get jealous.

189
00:16:32,421 --> 00:16:33,580
You've got a crush?

190
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,460
What kind

191
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,500
of a man is he?

192
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:48,021
Speaking of which,

193
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:49,820
actually...

194
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,421
Actually, I've long fallen for him.

195
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,781
At that time,

196
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:58,261
you thought

197
00:16:58,261 --> 00:17:00,500
I was just a smooth-talking candidate.

198
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,820
But he's different.

199
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,020
At first,

200
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,700
he didn't have a good impression of me,

201
00:17:09,381 --> 00:17:10,101
but

202
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,181
he never doubted my talent.

203
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:15,181
He thought

204
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,821
that one day,

205
00:17:17,181 --> 00:17:18,621
I would be able to gain a foothold

206
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:20,220
in the imperial court.

207
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,101
He's a nobleman,

208
00:17:23,621 --> 00:17:24,421
but

209
00:17:25,621 --> 00:17:27,700
he's very understanding
and knows me well.

210
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,020
He's so powerful,

211
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,661
but he never pushes me.

212
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,181
I think

213
00:17:38,821 --> 00:17:41,821
he's different
from all the other men in the world.

214
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,381
Just thinking of him

215
00:17:45,341 --> 00:17:46,421
makes me feel

216
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,341
that I can pull through
whatever difficulties

217
00:17:49,181 --> 00:17:50,460
come my way.

218
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,980
That person

219
00:17:57,546 --> 00:17:58,427
is...

220
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,661
My Lord.

221
00:18:06,941 --> 00:18:07,661
Uncle.

222
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,421
They're so bold.

223
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,780
How dare they use such underhand tactics

224
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,260
against His Majesty?

225
00:18:16,661 --> 00:18:18,141
This matter must be
investigated thoroughly.

226
00:18:19,421 --> 00:18:20,540
But it's not difficult to tell

227
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,181
who's behind this.

228
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,181
Today's incident

229
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,020
must have been planned a long time ago.

230
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,460
It's a common tactic used in the harem.

231
00:18:31,821 --> 00:18:33,101
But this time, it was designed

232
00:18:33,141 --> 00:18:34,381
for His Majesty and you.

233
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:38,220
Roujia wants the throne,

234
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,341
so she has to do anything

235
00:18:40,341 --> 00:18:41,941
to get rid of a stumbling block like me.

236
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,700
Last time, she used power
as an inducement.

237
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,300
This time, she used love as a strategy.

238
00:18:48,101 --> 00:18:50,700
It's all to put me at odds
with His Majesty.

239
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,260
However,

240
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,181
I'm afraid she won't stop

241
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:56,421
when her plans fail one after another.

242
00:19:17,101 --> 00:19:18,101
How dare you mess around

243
00:19:18,581 --> 00:19:19,621
at a royal banquet?

244
00:19:20,901 --> 00:19:21,661
Haven't you

245
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,740
always wanted
to keep your distance from me?

246
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,581
But today, you're not afraid to let others
know about our relationship?

247
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,821
Not bad for a mooncake of your choice.

248
00:19:32,901 --> 00:19:33,901
It tastes good.

249
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,300
"Actually,

250
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,980
I've long fallen for him."

251
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,740
"He's different
from all the other men in the world."

252
00:19:48,141 --> 00:19:49,220
"His existence makes me feel

253
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,260
that I can pull through
whatever difficulties

254
00:19:53,101 --> 00:19:54,220
come my way."

255
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,381
My Lord,

256
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,581
when did you hear that?

257
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,260
So,

258
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,740
you fell in love with me so long ago

259
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,260
that you want to be with me
all the time?

260
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,901
As if you don't want to.

261
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,300
I wonder

262
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,581
who used the royal family's splendor

263
00:20:18,861 --> 00:20:20,421
to get rid of Wen Shizong

264
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:22,861
in the first place.

265
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,621
When was I ever so petty?

266
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,020
Shall I

267
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,421
help you recall it?

268
00:20:29,421 --> 00:20:33,832

Mu Zhuohua was so lucky

278
00:21:08,941 --> 00:21:10,341
to get away with it last night.

279
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,381
If she's convicted
of having unethical conduct,

280
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,181
she would be too ashamed
to show up in the imperial court.

281
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,941
It was supposed to be
the best of both worlds.

282
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,700
First, it could fulfill
His Majesty's wish,

283
00:21:23,341 --> 00:21:25,700
and second, it could bring
you and Uncle back together.

284
00:21:27,181 --> 00:21:28,141
But in the end,

285
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,020
it's all for naught.

286
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,300
Nothing worked out.

287
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,621
It's such a pity.

288
00:21:55,621 --> 00:21:56,821
Are you really the one

289
00:21:58,621 --> 00:21:59,980
behind last night's incident
in the guest room?

290
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,540
Yes,

291
00:22:02,101 --> 00:22:02,821
it's me.

292
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:04,740
So what?

293
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,540
I only gave them a push.

294
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,421
If they don't have any ill intentions,

295
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:12,220
they'll be fine.

296
00:22:13,381 --> 00:22:14,581
It's up to them

297
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,500
to make their own choices.

298
00:22:31,621 --> 00:22:33,020
Is it because you can't bear

299
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,861
to see His Majesty
being disdained by the people?

300
00:22:37,421 --> 00:22:38,460
But we must

301
00:22:39,101 --> 00:22:40,581
sacrifice something now.

302
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,581
Have you forgotten our wish?

303
00:22:46,861 --> 00:22:48,621
To rid the imperial court
of any malpractice

304
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:51,341
and return peace to the people.

305
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:55,980
I think you're the one

306
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,341
who's forgotten first.

307
00:23:11,901 --> 00:23:12,861
Let's call it quits.

308
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,540
Let's stop going down
the wrong path, shall we?

309
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,740
What nonsense are you talking about?

310
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,141
Has what we're doing now

311
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,460
really changed Southern Chen
for the better?

312
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,300
I thought you were a man of vision,

313
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,581
not a man who would be so short-sighted.

314
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,060
So, your deliberation

315
00:23:38,621 --> 00:23:40,260
is to use everything within your reach,

316
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,500
including Mu Zhuohua?

317
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:52,980
I forgot

318
00:23:54,621 --> 00:23:55,780
it's not the first time

319
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,381
you've used her.

320
00:24:00,661 --> 00:24:02,260
I've come to the point

321
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:04,980
where it's

322
00:24:05,821 --> 00:24:06,700
make or break

323
00:24:07,141 --> 00:24:08,101
for me.

324
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,780
Don't you think it's childish of you

325
00:24:10,901 --> 00:24:12,341
to come here and tell me that?

326
00:24:28,101 --> 00:24:30,101
I didn't get to watch the show
in the palace,

327
00:24:30,141 --> 00:24:31,500
so now I've got to watch it
in the Princess's Residence.

328
00:24:32,901 --> 00:24:33,980
How interesting.

329
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,540
Which show do you mean?

330
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,341
I was just providing you

331
00:24:41,341 --> 00:24:42,941
with some convenience.

332
00:24:43,661 --> 00:24:44,861
Did I

333
00:24:45,581 --> 00:24:47,341
force you to set a trap for His Majesty?

334
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,460
Go ahead and stay clear of it.

335
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,700
I don't care about fame.

336
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,101
I admit what I did.

337
00:24:56,941 --> 00:24:58,260
You want Southern Chen to be in chaos.

338
00:24:59,107 --> 00:25:00,506
Northern Liang also wants
Southern Chen to be in chaos.

339
00:25:02,141 --> 00:25:03,780
Let's see

340
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,621
who will be the winner.

341
00:25:07,661 --> 00:25:09,220
Jinghong must have got mad.

342
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,460
I have to go comfort him.

343
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:33,381
Young Lady,

344
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,460
why haven't you eaten yet?

345
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,780
Young Lady.

346
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:40,821
Young Lady.

347
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,540
You're distracted
this early in the morning.

348
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,381
What's on your mind?

349
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,700
Juli,

350
00:25:45,181 --> 00:25:46,381
it's better sooner rather than later.

351
00:25:46,581 --> 00:25:48,980
Go and buy some wedding items
for me today

352
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,460
and clean up the courtyard.

353
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,540
I've decided

354
00:25:52,821 --> 00:25:54,060
to acknowledge His Lordship as my man.

355
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,540
All daily items are available here.

356
00:26:02,621 --> 00:26:03,621
Miss, what do you want?

357
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,980
It's handmade.

358
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,300
Come and take a look. All right.

359
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:10,861
Get me some more.

360
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,341
Come and take a look.

361
00:26:13,661 --> 00:26:14,220
Miss.

362
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:14,901
Can I have a look?

363
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:15,780
Sure.

364
00:26:16,381 --> 00:26:17,500
Is there going to be
a wedding in the house?

365
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:19,581
My young lady is getting married.

366
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,661
Get some brightly colored fabrics, then.

367
00:26:21,101 --> 00:26:21,421
Okay.

368
00:26:21,901 --> 00:26:22,300
Thank you.

369
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,060
All right. Take care.

370
00:26:23,141 --> 00:26:23,621
Okay.

371
00:26:23,621 --> 00:26:24,260
Please come again.

372
00:26:27,661 --> 00:26:29,421
I feel like something's missing.

373
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,861
A pair of swan geese.

374
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,260
The most important thing
in the bride price.

375
00:26:40,901 --> 00:26:41,700
Young Lady.

376
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,661
Young Lady, you're back.

377
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,581
Look.

378
00:26:46,581 --> 00:26:48,621
Didn't you say it's better
sooner rather than later?

379
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:50,341
I had nothing better to do,

380
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:51,740
so I bought everything back.

381
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,941
Well done, Juli.

382
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,181
That's a nice decoration.

383
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,220
I was called upon to help with

384
00:26:56,421 --> 00:26:57,181
so many of Old Master Mu's weddings

385
00:26:57,181 --> 00:26:58,260
as I'm strong.

386
00:26:58,421 --> 00:26:59,621
So I'm familiar with it.

387
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:03,141
Juli,

388
00:27:05,621 --> 00:27:07,101
are you going to cook
braised duck tonight?

389
00:27:07,421 --> 00:27:09,540
Young Lady, don't say that.

390
00:27:09,941 --> 00:27:11,101
The pair of swan geese
is part of the bride price.

391
00:27:12,621 --> 00:27:13,460
Swan geese?

392
00:27:14,581 --> 00:27:15,901
I was lucky enough to find

393
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:17,740
two ducks that look like swan geese.

394
00:27:17,821 --> 00:27:20,141
Do you think Prince Regent
has never seen swan geese?

395
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,861
We've promised not to get married,
so I don't think we need the swan geese.

396
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,141
I forgot about it, Young Lady.

397
00:27:30,661 --> 00:27:31,621
They're cute.

398
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:32,821
Young Lady,

399
00:27:32,821 --> 00:27:34,101
Prince Regent seems to have arrived.

400
00:27:36,853 --> 00:27:37,421
(Mu's Residence)

401
00:27:37,421 --> 00:27:38,101
My Lord.

402
00:27:39,101 --> 00:27:40,260
Something's come up at my home today.

403
00:27:40,421 --> 00:27:41,861
Please come again some other day.

404
00:27:45,661 --> 00:27:46,341
What's it?

405
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,341
Do you need me to help you?

406
00:27:48,621 --> 00:27:49,181
No.

407
00:27:49,181 --> 00:27:49,901
No, thanks

408
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,300
Did I just get kicked out?

409
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,780
Did the girl say anything?

410
00:28:20,821 --> 00:28:21,421
Let's go.

411
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,421
You really are

412
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,060
the best guqin player in the capital.

413
00:29:09,901 --> 00:29:11,060
Your Highness, you flatter me.

414
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,821
You're beautiful and talented.

415
00:29:15,581 --> 00:29:17,341
I'm sure no young men in Southern Chen

416
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,341
would not want to marry you.

417
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,020
It's a pity

418
00:29:23,621 --> 00:29:25,740
Uncle has poor taste

419
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,621
and treats that straw as a treasure.

420
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,341
Now,

421
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:31,341
he's being dragged down even further.

422
00:29:34,101 --> 00:29:35,621
Although he's His Majesty's uncle,

423
00:29:36,621 --> 00:29:38,621
His Majesty is still the Emperor,

424
00:29:39,181 --> 00:29:40,540
so how can anyone
contradict the Emperor?

425
00:29:43,661 --> 00:29:46,060
Mu Zhuohua is smooth-talking,

426
00:29:46,181 --> 00:29:47,260
cunning, and devious.

427
00:29:48,341 --> 00:29:50,220
His Lordship must have been
deceived by her.

428
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,540
As a female official,

429
00:29:52,661 --> 00:29:54,260
how could she be of such poor character

430
00:29:54,581 --> 00:29:55,821
and entangle herself with His Lordship?

431
00:29:58,581 --> 00:30:00,060
His Lordship may not be
a good judge of character,

432
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:01,980
but I can't sit by

433
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,181
and watch His Lordship down with her.

434
00:30:21,181 --> 00:30:21,901
Young Lady,

435
00:30:22,141 --> 00:30:23,780
are you sure you don't need my help?

436
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,220
Yes, I can do it myself.

437
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:31,861
Young Lady,

438
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,060
if you keep cutting it,
you won't have enough for a garment.

439
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,141
It seems like...

440
00:30:40,581 --> 00:30:41,460
This is okay, no?

441
00:30:44,821 --> 00:30:45,581
I'll get the door.

442
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,341
That's enough fabric for a pouch, right?

443
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,020
Where's Official Mu?

444
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,460
She's inside.

445
00:30:55,621 --> 00:30:56,421
Please come in.

446
00:31:02,421 --> 00:31:03,220
Official Mu.

447
00:31:03,581 --> 00:31:04,381
Chief Eunuch.

448
00:31:05,621 --> 00:31:07,141
His Majesty summons you to the palace.

449
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,581
Stop idling.

450
00:31:08,661 --> 00:31:09,780
Come with me now.

451
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,861
His Majesty summons me?

452
00:31:11,181 --> 00:31:11,901
Yes.

453
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,460
I heard that someone had complained
about you before His Majesty.

454
00:31:17,581 --> 00:31:18,421
Complained about me?

455
00:31:22,145 --> 00:31:23,300
(Wende Hall)

456
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,101
(Your Majesty,)

457
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,621
I've received a letter
from Sun Yunyun saying

458
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,421
that the Director of Revenue,
Mu Zhuohua,

459
00:31:28,421 --> 00:31:30,341
has a close relationship
with Prince Regent,

460
00:31:30,901 --> 00:31:32,060
and that they have been making
secret deals with each other.

461
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,901
Sun Yunyun is just
the daughter of a criminal.

462
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,780
Can she be trusted?

463
00:31:50,821 --> 00:31:51,540
Your Majesty,

464
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,141
I'm responsible for monitoring
all officials' conduct.

465
00:31:55,621 --> 00:31:56,780
Since there is a suspicion,

466
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:58,661
we must find out the truth

467
00:31:58,861 --> 00:32:00,421
and give everyone an explanation.

468
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:02,181
Official Mu,

469
00:32:03,141 --> 00:32:03,941
what do you think?

470
00:32:09,381 --> 00:32:12,260
Official Mu, are you admitting it?

471
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,381
Your Majesty, please look into it.

472
00:32:20,341 --> 00:32:20,980
Your Majesty,

473
00:32:22,381 --> 00:32:23,861
by the law of the nation,

474
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,740
a woman may serve as an official,

475
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:29,260
but she may not hold
an official position after her marriage.

476
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:30,780
Official Mu,

477
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,861
I admire your talents.

478
00:32:34,101 --> 00:32:37,260
But you can't have your cake
and eat it too.

479
00:32:37,861 --> 00:32:40,181
You'll have to make a decision
whether to resign your post

480
00:32:40,861 --> 00:32:43,181
or leave your personal feelings behind.

481
00:32:46,821 --> 00:32:47,941
Your Lordship,
something bad has come up.

482
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,421
Why the panic?

483
00:32:51,341 --> 00:32:52,980
Miss Sun and the Imperial Censor

484
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,141
are accusing Official Mu
of making secret deals with you.

485
00:32:57,661 --> 00:32:58,500
Where is she?

486
00:32:58,821 --> 00:32:59,540
She's confronting

487
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,421
the Imperial Censor in Wende Hall.

488
00:33:03,621 --> 00:33:04,980
Your Lordship.

489
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,980
Have you thought of a way to solve it?

490
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:08,700
No.

491
00:33:11,181 --> 00:33:14,740
Your Majesty, Official Mu
has deliberately violated the law

492
00:33:14,941 --> 00:33:16,141
and disrupted the orderly imperial court.

493
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:19,260
This must not be tolerated.

494
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:22,821
Your Majesty...

495
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:24,581
(Official Mu is still single.)

496
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,421
(How has she violated the law?)

497
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,421
Greetings, Your Majesty.

498
00:33:44,181 --> 00:33:46,661
Prince Regent, you may rise.

499
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,060
Prince Regent has arrived just in time.

500
00:33:51,421 --> 00:33:53,220
I'd like to ask if...

501
00:33:53,661 --> 00:33:54,581
Save it.

502
00:33:56,381 --> 00:34:00,060
I do have a relationship with Ms. Mu...

503
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,180
But I

504
00:34:09,301 --> 00:34:10,460
am her man out of wedlock.

505
00:34:23,701 --> 00:34:24,381
Yes.

506
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,901
Ms. Mu is unmarried.

507
00:34:28,301 --> 00:34:30,620
So which law has she violated?

508
00:34:39,941 --> 00:34:40,660
Your Majesty,

509
00:34:42,701 --> 00:34:44,381
as an official of the imperial court,

510
00:34:44,741 --> 00:34:46,221
I will never violate the law.

511
00:34:49,261 --> 00:34:51,580
As Prince Regent said,

512
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,781
I do have a relationship

513
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,580
with him.

514
00:34:57,381 --> 00:34:58,421
But we're not married.

515
00:35:00,701 --> 00:35:01,861
Fellow officials,

516
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,180
is there any law in our nation
that prohibits female officials

517
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,060
from having
a normal relationship with men?

518
00:35:08,421 --> 00:35:11,020
Official Mu, you're such a disgrace!

519
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,660
Your Majesty, Mu Zhuohua's character
is too rotten

520
00:35:14,701 --> 00:35:15,701
to be an official.

521
00:35:15,901 --> 00:35:17,261
