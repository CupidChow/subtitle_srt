(Adapted from "She Was Once
a Playful Soul" by Sui Yu Er An)

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
(This is a work of fiction.)

20
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,980
Greetings, Your Lordship.

21
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,579
Greetings, Your Highness.

22
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,219
Mu Zhuohua,

23
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,060
it seems like the remedy I sent you

24
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:03,260
has worked wonderfully on you.

25
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:06,139
You recovered faster than I did.

26
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:09,379
It's all thanks to you, Lord Ding.

27
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:14,939
Mu Zhuohua, I don't like you.

28
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,420
You should know that.

29
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,140
My duty called.

30
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:23,779
Others' preferences are not my concern.

31
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:27,860
No one knows you are a physician.

32
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:29,699
Even if you did not intervene,

33
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:31,180
no one would blame you for that.

34
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:35,060
If you put it that way,

35
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:37,819
allow me to tell you some facts, then.

36
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:40,740
If something happened to two princes

37
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,420
in my class,

38
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:44,979
I would be held accountable.

39
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:47,539
Therefore, I had to do everything I could
to save you.

40
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,939
That's just one of the reasons.

41
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,140
Besides, as a physician,

42
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,539
I couldn't stand idly by

43
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,979
and watch you suffer.

44
00:02:56,779 --> 00:02:57,580
You forgot

45
00:02:58,259 --> 00:02:59,379
to say that since you saved me,

46
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,900
I owe you a favor now.

47
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:03,259
Which means I have no choice
but to be nice to you.

48
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,819
That,

49
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:07,819
I dare not covet.

50
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:19,060
Mu Zhuohua.

51
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,340
Why did you come here?

52
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:24,860
Your Lordship,

53
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:27,460
I came to bid you farewell.

54
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,300
I have nearly recovered now,

55
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:32,140
so I shall not overstay my welcome.

56
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:36,499
All right.

57
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:38,699
Once you're home,

58
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,740
do rest well.

59
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,140
Thank you, Your Lordship.

60
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,140
I will.

61
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,779
I don't like to owe anyone.

62
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,699
You saved me, Mu Zhuohua.

63
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:53,379
I can grant you a wish.

64
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:55,420
Tell me what you want.

65
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,659
Your Highness,

66
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:02,420
I merely did what I was supposed to do.

67
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,979
That's all there is to it.

68
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,900
You sure look a gift horse in the mouth.

69
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,140
Mu Zhuohua.

70
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,860
I still need to discuss something
with the First Prince.

71
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:16,259
You may leave now.

72
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,660
Yes, My Lord.

73
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,980
She's acting all sanctimonious again.

74
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:34,100
Uncle,

75
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,660
she saved my life.

76
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,579
She could have obtained everything
she wanted.

77
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:42,579
Is she truly selfless,
or is she pretending?

78
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:47,939
Oh, Uncle.

79
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:49,780
Did you give

80
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:52,100
your jade pendant to Mu Zhuohua?

81
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:55,899
Yes. Why?

82
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,339
Why did you give it to her?

83
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,899
I asked for it several times,
but you never gave it to me.

84
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,300
How can she have it?

85
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:02,939
What gives?

86
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,379
You asked for many things from me.

87
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,579
I lost count.

88
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:13,780
How about this?

89
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:17,259
You fancy that Mingguang Armor,
don't you?

90
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,980
I'll have my servants pack it up.

91
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:22,980
You can take it from my storeroom.

92
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:25,860
Thanks, Uncle.

93
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:27,459
You're the best.

94
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:44,139
Shen went to the Ministry of Revenue.

95
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,180
Sun went to the Ministry of Works.

96
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:49,300
I'm the only hot potato left.

97
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,139
If Lord Ding won't take me in,

98
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,980
I can only return to the Hanlin Academy

99
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,180
and do a light-duty job there.

100
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:56,540
Hot potato?

101
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,060
Isn't that delicious?

102
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,620
Oh, naive girl.

103
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,459
A hot potato is delicious.

104
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,819
But it isn't pleasant

105
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:05,740
to hold it.

106
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:08,339
No, I will not waste food.

107
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:09,780
You...

108
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:16,620
Lord Ding only gave me 20 days.

109
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,660
He wants me to choose my battles

110
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,459
and not get too involved with him.

111
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,259
And I'm not quitting.

112
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,420
I will pass the assessment.

113
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,819
Young Lady,

114
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,379
don't you want to be an official?

115
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,899
Why didn't you tell the First Prince that

116
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:32,819
just now

117
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:33,860
when you saw him?

118
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,300
You fool.

119
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,699
His Highness doesn't like me.

120
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:40,180
If I ask for a lofty position,

121
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:41,379
he will say yes.

122
00:06:41,626 --> 00:06:42,986
But he will hold grudges

123
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,939
and

124
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:45,379
find a reason to demote me.

125
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:46,660
True.

126
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,540
Oh, Young Lady.

127
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:50,060
Do you think
you still can be an official?

128
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,139
Of course.

129
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,499
However,

130
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,540
I can't

131
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,339
rely on Lord Ding forever.

132
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:56,740
I should

133
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:58,339
strive for what I want.

134
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,019
I will become
a competent female official

135
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:03,060
to reduce Lord Ding's burden.

136
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,699
She said that?

137
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,660
Yes.

138
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:09,899
You may leave.

139
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,740
Uncle,

140
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:20,060
Mu Zhuohua

141
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:23,579
isn't as bad as I thought.

142
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,860
She is

143
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:31,660
sensible.

144
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,379
Here, Young Lady.

145
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:50,339
Juli, being home is the best,

146
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:51,180
isn't it?

147
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:53,300
But, Young Lady, you were at ease too

148
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,300
at Lord Ding's Residence.

149
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,579
I was not.

150
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,339
Look, Young Lady.

151
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:10,579
Someone from the Princess's Residence
sent you an invitation.

152
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,259
Princess Roujia invited me

153
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:19,459
to a tea party tomorrow.

154
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,859
Young Lady, the snacks are ready.

155
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,140
The hairpin Princess gave you
is so pretty.

156
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:42,739
It goes well with your attire.

157
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,660
Is that so?

158
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,060
I figure I should dress up before I go.

159
00:08:46,739 --> 00:08:47,260
Here.

160
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,500
Let's go.

161
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,140
Okay.

162
00:08:54,819 --> 00:08:56,540
Her Highness awaits you, Official Mu.

163
00:08:57,619 --> 00:08:59,060
Thank you for ushering me, Miss Man.

164
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,540
Your Highness, Official Mu is here.

165
00:09:04,939 --> 00:09:05,540
Greetings to Your Highness.

166
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,579
The apricot blossom hairpin
looks good on you.

167
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,300
It's thanks to your exquisite taste.

168
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:15,780
Take a seat.

169
00:09:20,939 --> 00:09:22,979
It's a private party.
Don't stand on ceremony.

170
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:24,739
You know

171
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,739
that I'm usually with my subjects.

172
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,180
I do not stick to the formalities
in the palace.

173
00:09:29,739 --> 00:09:30,699
Therefore,

174
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,739
forgo those formalities before me.

175
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,140
Yes, Your Highness.

176
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,900
Oh, Your Highness.

177
00:09:36,219 --> 00:09:37,219
Thank you

178
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,540
for putting in a good word
for me before the Dowager Empress.

179
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,780
I bought some snacks for you,

180
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,819
and I hope that they are to your liking.

181
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:45,660
You are too courteous.

182
00:09:57,219 --> 00:09:59,020
With these delicious snacks,

183
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:02,459
I shall not stash away
my delicious wine.

184
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:03,819
Man.

185
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,459
Bring me the collection Father gave me.

186
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:07,260
Noted.

187
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:13,979
I wanted to visit you several days ago.

188
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:16,699
However,
you were at my uncle's residence.

189
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:21,260
If I may talk to you
about the incident...

190
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,380
About their injuries?

191
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:29,459
The Dowager Empress
holds my brothers dearly.

192
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,819
They're old enough to seek a spouse now,

193
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:34,300
and the Dowager Empress already
has a few candidates in mind.

194
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,260
She heard that the First Prince
and the Third Prince

195
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,099
quarreled during your class.

196
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:40,579
She thought they were vying for you,

197
00:10:40,979 --> 00:10:41,979
so she punished you.

198
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,579
Please believe me

199
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:47,180
that this wasn't what happened at all.

200
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,979
I know you have a good moral character.

201
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:51,579
But the Dowager Empress doesn't.

202
00:10:51,979 --> 00:10:53,500
And she doesn't care
if she accuses the wrong person.

203
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,579
She wants her plan to go smoothly,

204
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,339
and you are the unfortunate
sacrificial piece.

205
00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:03,939
I don't feel that unfortunate anymore

206
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,859
now that I have your understanding,
Your Highness.

207
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,420
Thank you.

208
00:11:19,739 --> 00:11:22,420
Your Highness, allow me to make a toast

209
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:23,579
to you.

210
00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:40,819
In fact,

211
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,819
you are not from Yanzhou, are you?

212
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,619
You are from Huaizhou.

213
00:11:55,859 --> 00:11:57,140
During the Imperial Birthday,

214
00:11:57,619 --> 00:11:59,140
I asked if you came from Huaizhou.

215
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,819
You answered Yanzhou.

216
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,660
However, your reaction

217
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,500
betrayed your deception.

218
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:10,979
Your Highness, I...

219
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,420
I am indeed from Huaizhou.

220
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,060
So you already
knew the truth so long ago.

221
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,020
And you didn't expose me.

222
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,459
I am ashamed of myself.

223
00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:27,780
I know you have a reason to lie.

224
00:12:28,739 --> 00:12:30,819
It's not easy for a woman
to become an official.

225
00:12:31,739 --> 00:12:33,219
You are where you are

226
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,819
thanks to your own skills and knowledge.

227
00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:37,420
With that level of integrity,

228
00:12:37,979 --> 00:12:40,260
why would I nitpick?

229
00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:46,579
Your Highness.

230
00:12:47,219 --> 00:12:48,420
You're too kind.

231
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:50,459
Another toast to you.

232
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,219
We all

233
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,900
have our own challenges to face.

234
00:13:21,979 --> 00:13:24,099
I might be a princess,

235
00:13:24,939 --> 00:13:26,300
but I get bullied too.

236
00:13:27,859 --> 00:13:31,060
When I was three,

237
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,660
a child bit me.

238
00:13:33,739 --> 00:13:34,739
Oh, the scar...

239
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,020
It must have been a nasty bite.

240
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,819
Who dares to bully

241
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,260
a princess?

242
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,140
Zhuohua.

243
00:13:52,219 --> 00:13:53,979
Can I call you that?

244
00:13:54,939 --> 00:13:56,500
My pleasure, Your Highness.

245
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,619
Zhuohua, you're my friend,

246
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:00,979
so I will be frank.

247
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,020
When I was young,

248
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:05,939
I wasn't a princess.

249
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,979
My father hadn't acceded to the throne.

250
00:14:08,739 --> 00:14:11,819
And my mother was just an attendant
in the residence.

251
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:14,060
I wasn't born noble.

252
00:14:14,619 --> 00:14:15,739
This bite...

253
00:14:17,571 --> 00:14:18,851
It's been a long time,

254
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,099
so I don't remember who bit me.

255
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,699
Perhaps I was a naughty child,

256
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,380
and I was bullied

257
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:28,579
when I was playing with other kids.

258
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:30,819
I see.

259
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,140
So you had it rough

260
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:35,380
before you became a princess.

261
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:39,819
Despite your humble background,

262
00:14:40,939 --> 00:14:43,020
you fought your way here.

263
00:14:44,099 --> 00:14:46,300
I envy you, truth be told.

264
00:14:47,859 --> 00:14:49,459
You can do what you want

265
00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:51,180
based on your ability.

266
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:53,939
Unlike me,

267
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,260
caged by my identity.

268
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,780
I can't do much.

269
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,660
You are making me ashamed of myself.

270
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,459
You toil for your subjects.

271
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,180
You are our role model.

272
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:13,739
Enough about the past.

273
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,420
Being a female official
is an uphill battle.

274
00:15:17,979 --> 00:15:18,939
But I know

275
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,979
you have the tenacity for it.

276
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,380
With this cup of wine,
I'll give you my blessings.

277
00:15:27,859 --> 00:15:29,939
May you forge on

278
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,300
fearlessly and relentlessly.

279
00:15:31,939 --> 00:15:32,819
Thank you, Your Highness.

280
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,780
The Dowager Empress presides!

281
00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:46,579
- Greetings, Mother.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

282
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:50,780
Did I interrupt you?

283
00:15:52,099 --> 00:15:53,339
Not at all.

284
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,380
It's getting warm now.

285
00:15:55,979 --> 00:15:58,339
Do make sure you take care
of yourself, Mother.

286
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,579
Forgive me.

287
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,020
I should have gone to Ciming Hall
to pay you a visit.

288
00:16:04,939 --> 00:16:06,300
I am doing just fine.

289
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,739
But, Yan, you don't look that good.

290
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,979
Is there a lot of work
in the Ministry of Rites?

291
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,619
Thank you for your concern,
Your Majesty.

292
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,180
I can manage.

293
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:22,060
You always act tough.

294
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,900
Peilan.

295
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:28,420
Your Lordship,

296
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:31,300
Her Majesty
made these clothes for you personally.

297
00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:44,699
Oh, to have bothered you so,
Your Majesty,

298
00:16:45,619 --> 00:16:47,619
I am ashamed of myself.

299
00:16:50,939 --> 00:16:52,300
It's just a robe.

300
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:55,619
Not a huge project.

301
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,020
But you,

302
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:03,140
you shouldn't overwork.

303
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,859
About the rumor,

304
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:11,179
Roujia has told me the whole thing.

305
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,899
Mu Zhuohua is innocent.

306
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,260
Alas, men and women
should keep some distance.

307
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,859
As a female official,

308
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,780
it's inadequate for her

309
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:23,980
to teach the princes.

310
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,179
Why don't we

311
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:31,659
send her to tutor the daughters
of noble families?

312
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:35,220
That will stop the rumor.

313
00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:38,260
What do you think, Yan?

314
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:41,619
I appreciate

315
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:44,060
your proposition, Your Majesty.

316
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,220
Unfortunately,

317
00:17:47,619 --> 00:17:48,819
I have enlisted

318
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:50,780
Mu Zhuohua

319
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,339
as the ambassador to receive
the Northern Liang diplomatic corps.

320
00:17:55,139 --> 00:17:58,060
They are arriving soon,

321
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:01,940
so a sudden change of staff might...

322
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,659
An ambassador

323
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,780
represents our national image,

324
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,579
and it shall not be taken lightly.

325
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,260
Yan,

326
00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:13,139
just because she is

327
00:18:13,139 --> 00:18:15,579
the first female Tanhua

328
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,859
doesn't mean
you should make an exception for her.

329
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,540
Your Majesty,

330
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:25,859
I will not jeopardize
our national pride.

331
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:27,780
I nominated her

332
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:29,139
because

333
00:18:29,899 --> 00:18:32,060
she has proven to be quite capable.

334
00:18:35,139 --> 00:18:37,020
I'm just worried about you.

335
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,139
You're in charge
of the diplomatic reception.

336
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,780
Mu Zhuohua is inexperienced, after all.

337
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:45,339
If something goes awry,

338
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,940
you will be held liable too.

339
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,619
I understand.

340
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,460
My uncle traded his military feats

341
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,859
so that women were allowed
to partake in the examination again.

342
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,220
You worked tirelessly

343
00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:09,780
and became the Tanhua.

344
00:19:10,659 --> 00:19:11,619
Yet

345
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,300
everything went down the drain
because of this farce.

346
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,540
If it weren't for Lord Ding,

347
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,819
I wouldn't have had the chance
to take the examination.

348
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:22,859
I am already full of appreciation

349
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:25,460
that he was willing

350
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:27,500
to look past the gender difference.

351
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:29,619
If I can no longer be a teacher,

352
00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:31,659
so be it.

353
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:34,379
I will do my best to pass
the Ministry of Rites' examination

354
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,540
and serve our nation.

355
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,460
How wonderful.

356
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,980
I believe he is taking over
the Ministry of Rites for the moment

357
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,940
due to Northern Liang.

358
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:45,700
He's a staunch supporter
of female empowerment,

359
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:47,619
so he won't let the ministers
give you a hard time.

360
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,460
It's a pity

361
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:53,020
that I don't have any sisters.

362
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,899
How I wish to have a younger sister

363
00:19:55,899 --> 00:19:56,700
like you.

364
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,700
If you don't mind,

365
00:19:58,899 --> 00:19:59,899
you can view me as your younger sister.

366
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:02,339
I shall look up to you
as my elder sister.

367
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,579
No, even better
than a biological sister.

368
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,260
My other sisters

369
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,819
don't like me anyway.

370
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:12,220
Then call me Jiao.

371
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:13,540
I dare not.

372
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:15,659
If the Dowager Empress overhears that,

373
00:20:15,859 --> 00:20:17,659
she will think
that I'm currying favor with you.

374
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:21,659
The Dowager Empress

375
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,819
won't acknowledge anyone

376
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,619
without a noble title.

377
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,859
Your Highness.

378
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,579
Her Highness is getting inebriated.

379
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,579
It's getting late now.

380
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:42,139
Should I have the coachmen
send you back?

381
00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:44,419
No need, Miss Man.

382
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:46,300
The coachman I hired is right outside.

383
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:49,260
I should ask someone to escort you.

384
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:50,659
Thank you.

385
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,179
Are you all right, Young Lady?

386
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:53,980
Young Lady.

387
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,540
Isn't this supposed to be a tea party?

388
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,179
Why did you drink liquor?

389
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,179
You won't understand.

390
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,780
Tea

391
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:02,940
makes you sober.

392
00:21:03,579 --> 00:21:04,540
But liquor

393
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,859
makes you real.

394
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:07,819
Liquor

395
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,460
pulls us closer.

396
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,579
Young Lady.

397
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:14,419
His Lordship?

398
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:16,339
Your Lordship.

399
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,460
The indolence.

400
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,179
Your Lordship.

401
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,460
You imbibed?

402
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,300
I had a nice talk with Princess Roujia,

403
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,819
so I had a few too many.

404
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:33,740
So you drank your senses away

405
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,339
while His Lordship stuck his neck out
for you.

406
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:42,139
Your Lordship, I know

407
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:44,060
that you do look after me.

408
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,379
Let me treat you to a meal
as a thank-you.

409
00:21:47,659 --> 00:21:49,700
Your Lordship, give me a chance.

410
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,859
Come on, Your Lordship.

411
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,379
Juli, prepare a feast.

412
00:21:55,659 --> 00:21:56,460
And good wine too.

413
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,379
Come on, Your Lordship.

414
00:22:09,139 --> 00:22:11,700
Here, a toast to you, Your Lordship.

415
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,179
Thank you for what you've done for me.

416
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:27,700
Your Lordship,

417
00:22:28,099 --> 00:22:30,819
why the long face?

418
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,060
Make sure the reception
of the Northern Liang diplomatic corps

419
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:37,339
goes smoothly.

420
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,819
Don't make any mistake,

421
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,139
lest anyone make a fuss about it.

422
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,379
Worry not, Your Lordship.

423
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,260
I told you
that I would share your burden.

424
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,819
You have my word.

425
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:51,419
I have read Northern Liang's literature

426
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:53,540
and studied their language.

427
00:22:54,619 --> 00:22:58,260
Writing is still a challenge,

428
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,139
but I can read.

429
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:04,379
No need to go
to Hanlin Academy tomorrow.

430
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,740
Come to my place.

431
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,139
I shall tutor you in person.

432
00:23:10,819 --> 00:23:13,899
You will work as a political observer
in the Ministry of Rites.

433
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:16,780
If the reception
is a resounding success,

434
00:23:18,379 --> 00:23:21,659
you will be promoted
to Primary Sixth-Rank Administrator.

435
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,700
Your Lordship,

436
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,659
you're the best minister there is.

437
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,740
It is such an honor

438
00:23:39,139 --> 00:23:40,379
to work under you.

439
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,540
Here, a toast.

440
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:49,060
Just how much did you drink today?

441
00:23:52,179 --> 00:23:52,980
Your Lordship,

442
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,980
I know

443
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,859
you could have had an easier life.

444
00:23:59,220 --> 00:23:59,940
But to give

445
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:03,139
those 30,000 soldiers the truth
they were withheld,

446
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,300
you work day and night.

447
00:24:06,899 --> 00:24:08,099
Personally,

448
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:10,220
I don't have that level of courage.

449
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,020
That's why I admire you.

450
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,540
I want to help the people too.

451
00:24:18,819 --> 00:24:19,780
I guess

452
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,659
you could say
that we share the same goal.

453
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,740
Is this you speaking your mind
after a few drinks?

454
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:31,339
Your Lordship,

455
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,899
I have always been honest

456
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,220
with you.

457
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,339
No matter how rocky your path is,

458
00:24:39,899 --> 00:24:42,780
I will be there to walk it with you.

459
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,859
Here, Your Lordship.

460
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:54,379
You're still carrying

461
00:24:54,819 --> 00:24:56,060
the jade pendant.

462
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,179
It looks nice.

463
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,540
Just like

464
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:10,060
its former owner.

465
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:18,619
Your Lordship,

466
00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:19,819
there are scratches

467
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,220
on the pendant.

468
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,379
Did it...

469
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:27,179
Did it go to war with you?

470
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,899
Not only that.

471
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,659
It took an arrow for me once.

472
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,659
The scratches are the proof.

473
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,020
What a precious keepsake.

474
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,780
I will safeguard it.

475
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,700
Carry it with you.

476
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:49,139
It shall be your protective charm.

477
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,579
Okay.

478
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:07,540
Young Lady.

479
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:09,579
Here.

480
00:26:18,139 --> 00:26:19,020
Your Lordship.

481
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,379
You made this?

482
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:26,859
In this difficult life,

483
00:26:27,339 --> 00:26:29,379
we all need a little trick
to sweeten it.

484
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:31,859
Your Lordship, unbeknownst to you,

485
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,099
Juli likes snacks.

486
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,740
Back in my home,
she wouldn't have enough to eat.

487
00:26:37,379 --> 00:26:40,579
So we would smuggle some ingredients

488
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,500
and cook in our chamber.

489
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,099
I fancy myself

490
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,179
as someone

491
00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:48,819
competitive.

492
00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:50,179
So of course,

493
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:52,819
my cooking skill is above average.

494
00:26:53,859 --> 00:26:54,659
Here, Your Lordship.

495
00:26:55,819 --> 00:26:56,540
Try it.

496
00:27:17,859 --> 00:27:19,099
Afraid that it might be poisoned?

497
00:27:19,859 --> 00:27:21,020
I'll eat it first, then.

498
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:26,379
Yummy.

499
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,940
So yummy.

500
00:27:30,139 --> 00:27:31,260
Look, Your Lordship.

501
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,220
No poison.

502
00:27:34,659 --> 00:27:35,740
I'll help myself.

503
00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:37,819
Here you go.

504
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:46,139
Do you like it?

505
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,700
It's just as good
as those from Yipin Bakery, right?

506
00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:54,020
Juli told me

507
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,780
that if I ever wanted
to quit my position,

508
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,020
we could move to a rustic town

509
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,339
and open my own bakery.

510
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,339
I can feed myself with that.

511
00:28:04,339 --> 00:28:05,780
Did you study all these years

512
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:07,859
just to become a baker?

513
00:28:10,139 --> 00:28:11,579
When you returned,

514
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,780
you were holding a box.

515
00:28:14,619 --> 00:28:15,780
I suppose you brought snacks

516
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,220
to see Roujia.

517
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:20,659
She loved them.

518
00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:26,260
Her Highness and I
wish we had met sooner.

519
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:27,980
We get along so well.

520
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:30,220
Your Lordship,

521
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:32,540
let's drink.

522
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,540
Are you this casual too

523
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:45,780
in front of Princess Roujia?

524
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:49,139
Your Lordship,

525
00:28:49,899 --> 00:28:52,300
Her Highness is so down-to-earth.

526
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,220
Yet I respect her

527
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,300
a lot.

528
00:28:57,659 --> 00:28:58,780
I will not be frivolous.

529
00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:02,859
Maybe I am a touch frivolous

530
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,500
when I'm with you.

531
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,940
Just a touch.

532
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,579
That means you don't

533
00:29:15,819 --> 00:29:17,139
respect me at all?

534
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,859
No, not at all.

535
00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:20,980
No.

536
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:22,099
It's...

537
00:29:23,859 --> 00:29:24,899
It's just

538
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:28,500
friendly bantering.

539
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:30,859
Your Lordship,

540
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:34,139
if I ever behave something rude
in front of you,

541
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,139
that's because

542
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,220
you spoil me.

543
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,980
You're so nice.

544
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:48,700
Your Lordship.

545
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,619
You protect me, spoil me,

546
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,859
and give me money.

547
00:29:55,899 --> 00:29:57,139
You're so nice to me.

548
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,060
You're even better than my father!

549
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,659
I wouldn't want

550
00:30:05,659 --> 00:30:06,899
to have you as my daughter.

551
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,619
You want a daughter?

552
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:14,139
I can help you with that.

553
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:15,859
I can give you a daughter.
