a Playful Soul" by Sui Yu Er An)

=Episode 38=

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
(This is a work of fiction.)

20
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,949
It looks like
you aren't doing well, Uncle.

21
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:17,990
What are you doing?

22
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,990
Revealing your true colors?

23
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:26,430
Uncle, you're wrong.

24
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,349
It's not me
who revealed my true colors to you.

25
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:32,509
It's your nephew.

26
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:36,110
I'm willing to send you off, though.

27
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,830
Do you want a glass of liquor
to warm yourself up?

28
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,229
What's the rush?

29
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,550
Let's talk first.

30
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,110
Right.

31
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,110
I know

32
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,710
you'll have a lot of questions for me.

33
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,430
During the war at Juma River,

34
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,310
did you

35
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,590
intentionally tell Xue Xiaotang

36
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:22,069
about the spy from Northern Liang?

37
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:24,710
Yes, that was me.

38
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,430
The Grand Dowager Empress
was a vicious woman.

39
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,909
In her pursuit to end your life,

40
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,990
she disregarded
the lives of 30,000 soldiers

41
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:36,629
and sold your military deployment map
to Northern Liang.

42
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,789
I merely moved things along

43
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,469
and provided her

44
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:43,189
with a way to impart intelligence.

45
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,669
However,

46
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,629
it's too hard to kill you.

47
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,150
But I'm pleased

48
00:03:57,229 --> 00:03:58,509
you're still alive.

49
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:00,949
Without you,

50
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:03,349
I wouldn't be able

51
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:04,590
to successfully take down
that vicious woman.

52
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:09,629
As the Southern Chen Princess,

53
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,789
you naturally possess a noble status

54
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:16,469
and get to lead a luxurious life.

55
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:19,789
Why did you betray your country?

56
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,750
You truly embody dignity
and righteousness, Uncle.

57
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,549
I wonder if you've ever heard
of this saying.

58
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,390
“Don't judge someone

59
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,989
until you've walked a mile
in their shoes.”

60
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:41,429
Back then, the vicious woman
killed my mother.

61
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:45,669
Father was forced
to send me out of the capital.

62
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:49,429
I might be born into the royal family,

63
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,590
but I live in constant fear and anxiety,

64
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,710
unable to find peace in my daily life.

65
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,789
Every night,

66
00:04:57,989 --> 00:04:59,710
I would jolt awake
from disturbing nightmares.

67
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,750
Did you know

68
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:09,349
what I've been through?

69
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,229
My mother

70
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,469
was killed
by the Grand Dowager Empress as well.

71
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,469
While I may have grown up in the palace,

72
00:05:20,109 --> 00:05:21,549
since young,

73
00:05:22,549 --> 00:05:25,830
I lived amidst
her hatred and murderous intentions.

74
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,270
I escaped death many times.

75
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,030
I'm no better than you.

76
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,989
Roujia,

77
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,710
that is just

78
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,109
an excuse you came up with

79
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:51,070
to justify your greed and actions.

80
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:54,590
Yes.

81
00:05:58,429 --> 00:05:59,950
I planted the false testamentary edict.

82
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,562
I also instigated the conflict

83
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,070
between noble families
and Liu Chen.

84
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,510
Revenge isn't the only thing I want.

85
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,950
I want power.

86
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,349
I want to be the most powerful person
in Southern Chen.

87
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,950
Finally, you confessed.

88
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:44,109
Uncle, are you done
with your final words?

89
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,309
Is there anything
you want to tell Zhuohua?

90
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:51,229
Next time I see her,

91
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:53,669
I'll pass your message on to her.

92
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,950
(Jishan Hall)
Official Mu, we've diverted the guards.

93
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,510
(Hurry, go and find
the Border Defender Princess.)

94
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:03,909
Your Highness.

95
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:05,869

Your Highness.

98
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:16,750
Lord Ding has been falsely accused
and incarcerated.

99
00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:20,429
The Evil-erasing Sword
is his only chance of survival.

100
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:22,590
We need your help, Your Highness.

101
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,590
Are you saying that

102
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,710
Evil-erasing Sword is in the staff?

103
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,549
Go save Yan now.

104
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,070

If you mention her name again,

107
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,830
I'll break your neck.

108
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:14,229
Uncle, it's time for you
to drink the liquor.

109
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:33,669
Why?

110
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,789

we just received news from Jishan Hall.

149
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,060
Official Mu and her men took
the Border Defender Princess away.

I know.

00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,390
Should we go to Official Mu's house
to bring the Border Defender Princess...

152
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,180
No need.

153
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,510
I don't think Grandaunt wants to return
to the Princess's Residence anymore.

has been unsheathed.

I'm glad you like it.

Uncle,

171
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,270
where did you get this sword from?

172
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,230
Following our victory
against the Northern Liang Army,

173
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,630
I seized

174
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,630
several swords
crafted from meteoric iron.

175
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,630
I instructed my men to melt them down
and forge this new sword.

176
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,150
So you seized this
from the Northern Liang Army.

177
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,510
If so, I like it even more.

178
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,060
Uncle,

179
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,700
bring me along

180
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,660
on your next expedition.

181
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,420
I want to kill the enemies
on the battlefield, too.

182
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,580
I'll wait for you.

183
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,900
Your Majesty.

184
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:39,820
Your Majesty.

185
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,630
The guilty official, Liu Yan,
has been executed.

186
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,300
However, his body is still within
the Court of Judicial Review.

187
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,030
What about...

188
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,750
He's just a guilty official

189
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,270
and doesn't deserve a funeral.

190
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,780
Just bury him.

191
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:36,630
If only I could wed him,
I would be contented.

192
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,390
Even if he were to forsake me,

193
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,900
I would have no regrets whatsoever.

194
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,300
Where is my fan?

195
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,870
Where is my fan?

196
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,110
Well...

197
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:16,820
What are you doing?

198
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,580
My Lord.

199
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,470
Who is this crazy woman?

200
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:30,150
I'll be waiting for you to marry me.

201
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,470
Young Lady.

202
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:43,940
Young Lady.

203
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,270
Young Lady, you're finally awake.

204
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,900
You gave me a fright.

205
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,990
How long have I been unconscious?

206
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,230
Three days.

207
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,630
Imperial Physician Zhao said

208
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,300
if you continue to be unconscious,

209
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,780
you might not be able to wake up, ever.

210
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,580
What about His Lordship?

211
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,780
Three days ago,

212
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,910
His Lordship's body

213
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,270
was buried in the cemetery
at the foot of Fuyun Mountain.

214
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,190
That person said,

215
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,190
that as His Lordship
was a guilty official,

216
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,750
we weren't allowed
to hold a funeral for him.

217
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,030
He was buried in a simple manner.

218
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,780
His Lordship met an unjust demise.

219
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:36,910
I must

220
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:38,860
avenge him.

221
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,880
(Wende Hall)

222
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,300
Let's stop here today.

223
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,430
If there's nothing else,

224
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:17,990
you may leave now.

225
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,430
Mu, anything else?

226
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:37,780
Your Majesty,

227
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,510
I

228
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,030
would like to ask for a few days off.

My Lord.

Don't... Don't leave.

274
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,620
You can't leave me alone.

00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,060
Silly girl.

276
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,540
Weren't you once fearless

277
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,060
of everything?

278
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,950
In the past, you told me

279
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,510
that even without me,

280
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,060
you are strong enough
to survive on your own.

281
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,950
No, My Lord.

282
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,620
I... I was wrong.

283
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,750
I overestimated myself.

284
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,230
I can't live without you.

285
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,300
Don't leave me alone, please.

286
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:45,860
My Lord.

287
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,380
Juli!

288
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:14,780
Juli!

289
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,620
Young Lady.

290
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,430
Young Lady, you're awake.

291
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,100
Juli, pack up.

292
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,510
We're heading back to the capital.

293
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,230
(Department of State Affairs)

294
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,950
Isn't that Official Mu ahead there?

295
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,060
I heard that she fell severely ill

296
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,950
because of the death
of the Prince Regent.

297
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,380
What are you talking about?

298
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,780
His Majesty issued an imperial decree,

299
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,860
forbidding the holding of a funeral.

300
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,380
He could only be buried
as an ordinary citizen.

301
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,100
Did you forget about that?

302
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,300
Let's go.

303
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:49,510
Come on.

304
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,620
This is the list of the officials

305
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,340
who contacted the people
of Princess's Residence in recent days.

306
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:58,860
(Vice Minister of Personnel,
Director of the Ministry of Justice,)

307
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,387
(Vice Minister of Rites,)
I'm not sure

308
00:25:59,387 --> 00:25:59,780
(Administrator of Ministry of Personnel,)
I'm not sure

309
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,140
(Director of the Ministry of Personnel,
the Censorate,)

310
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,542
(Director of the Ministry of War,)
whether they have already chosen

311
00:26:01,542 --> 00:26:02,190
(Administrator of the Ministry of Justice)
to align with Princess Roujia.

312
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:03,780
Nevertheless, if 70% of them
choose to support her,

313
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,230
the influence of the Princess's Residence
will be significant.

314
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,140
I must admit, Princess Roujia is smart.

315
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,470
The list includes officials
from noble families

316
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,950
and officials from modest backgrounds.

317
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:18,780
Despite their opposing views,

318
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:21,380
she successfully united them

319
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:22,750
and garnered their support.

320
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:25,990
I used to think

321
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,030
she

322
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,540
is the kindest and purest person
in the world.

323
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,540
Now, it seems like

324
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,100
I never truly knew her.

325
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,030
Princess Roujia can act well.

326
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,300
Both you

327
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,630
and His Lordship got...

328
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,860
Previously, I read the memorial

329
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,140
written by the Court of Judicial Review
framing His Lordship.

330
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,190
I realized the evidence

331
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,620
was vulnerable.

332
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,140
It seems

333
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:59,470
that wasn't Princess Roujia's style.

334
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,380
Official Mu, are you saying

335
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,340
Princess Roujia did that on purpose?

336
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,670
I'm afraid framing His Lordship

337
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,300
was the first step in Roujia's plan.

338
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,670
Next,

339
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,750
she would use this

340
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,540
to redress his unjust case.

341
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,510
How is that possible?

342
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,990
Princess Roujia was the one
who framed His Lordship.

343
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,820
Why would she redress his case?

344
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,950
To the public,

345
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,030
it was His Majesty
who had put His Lordship to death.

346
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,470
Only His Majesty possesses

347
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,670
the authority to execute
the powerful Prince Regent.

348
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:36,100
As long as she exposes the discrepancies

349
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,340
and insists that His Lordship
had been framed,

350
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,910
she could establish that His Majesty

351
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,340
wrongly accused a loyal official.

352
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:46,230
Following that, she could isolate
and pressurize His Majesty,

353
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,430
shaking his foundation.

354
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,030
She wants to usurp the throne.

355
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,190
Her final goal is His Majesty.

356
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,230
I won't let her plan succeed.

357
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,300
Why?

358
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,950
Even if
this is Princess Roujia's conspiracy,

359
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,140
it was that person

360
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,510
who gave the decree
to take His Lordship's life.

361
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,670
Official Mu,
why are you still helping him?

362
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,380
Because this
is what His Lordship wanted.

363
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,950
I must

364
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,670
fulfill His Lordship's wish

365
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,750
no matter what.

366
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:23,950
Your Highness,

367
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,580
I've heard that Mu Zhuohua
has been acting unusually recently.

368
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,300
It seems like she's investigating you
in secret, Your Highness.

369
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,470
That's natural.

370
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,190
She and Uncle were close.

371
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,380
If she remains indifferent
after his death,

372
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,430
I'll be worried.

373
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,060
Everything has been set in stone.

374
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,950
Mu Zhuohua is too minor a figure
to affect anything.

375
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,190
I just think

376
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,860
Mu Zhuohua and Your Highness

377
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,270
are already at odds.

378
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,060
If this persists,

379
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,300
she might end up
being our biggest obstacle.

380
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,780
We used to be friends.

381
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,580
Since she wants to redress Uncle's case,

382
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,300
I'll make her wish come true.

383
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,950
Stalks are burnt to cook beans.

384
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,670
In the pot, the beans weep.

385
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:29,140
A treasured sword buries its grievances
in the prison.

386
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,140
- The nobles struggle to be close.
- What are they reciting?

387
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,190
I heard that His Majesty
put the Prince Regent to death.

388
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,990
The Prince Regent
tried to usurp the throne.

389
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,510
He deserved to get executed.

390
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,300
You don't get it.

391
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,315
The Prince Regent has military power

392
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:44,780
and has achieved great success
in warfare.

393
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,670
If he wanted to usurp the throne,

394
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,380
he would've done that
when the Emperor Emeritus passed away.

395
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,430
Why would he wait until now?

396
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,190
That makes sense.

397
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,780
But the Prince Regent

398
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,510
is His Majesty's uncle.

399
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,270
His Majesty wouldn't have
accused him wrongly, would he?

400
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,910
Who knows?

401
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,710
His Majesty's mind is unpredictable.

402
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,100
Back then, the Northern Liang went south

403
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,580
with great momentum.

404
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,190
Everywhere they went,

405
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,910
blood was spilled.

406
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,470
All generals in the court were afraid.

407
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:15,990
The Prince Regent
willingly assumed leadership

408
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,270
and received orders to go north.

409
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,950
He managed to stop
100,000 soldiers from Northern Liang.

410
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,100
Yes, you're right.

411
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,270
That battle

412
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:27,820
was frightening
and made the skies turn dark.

413
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,430
The Prince Regent gained renown
after winning the battle.

414
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,860
With his sword,

415
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:37,910
he safeguarded
the lands of Southern Chen.

416
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,510
Yes, the Prince Regent is innocent.

417
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,030
- Great!
- The Prince Regent is innocent.

418
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:41,910
Well said!

419
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,990
The new Emperor framed his uncle

420
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,300
and persecuted a loyal man.

421
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,540
He is ignorant

422
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,620
and doesn't deserve to be the Emperor!

423
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,710
How ignorant.

424
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,470
The new Emperor is a tyrant!

425
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,910
Ignorant and tyrannical!

426
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,780
Huaizhou suffered huge losses
in the disaster.

427
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,780
The people can barely feed themselves.

428
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:04,030
I am decreeing
a three-year tax exemption for Huaizhou.

429
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,030
Is there any objection to this?

430
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,430
Your Majesty, you might not be aware

431
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,780
that the prolonged wars
during the time of the Emperor Emeritus

432
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:18,910
nearly depleted the national treasury.

433
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,540
If you grant tax exemptions to Huaizhou,

434
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,750
will you also do the same
to Qingzhou and Huangzhou

435
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,750
if they face disasters?

436
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,270
If this continues,
the national treasury will be depleted.

437
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,580
How will we cover the expenses
for disaster relief

438
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,780
and military needs?

439
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,470
I agree with Official Zhou.

440
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:44,470
The national treasury is depleted,
so taxes cannot be exempted.

441
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,100
I second that.

442
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,430
We second that.

443
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,340
Your Majesty,

444
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:06,750
I believe that reducing
or exempting taxes is possible.

445
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,990
The disaster at Huaizhou
wasn't the people's fault.

446
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,860
Reducing or exempting taxes

447
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,470
would allow the people time
to recuperate

448
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,580
and display
the imperial court's benevolence.

449
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,860
It is nothing but beneficial.

450
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,230
Official Mu, you made it sound easy.

451
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,380
It is easy to reduce or exempt taxes,

452
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,860
but what about the depletion
of the national treasury?

453
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:31,230
Or are you capable

454
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,620
of making money appear magically?

455
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,670
If Northern Liang causes trouble again,

456
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,820
the military will need
several hundreds of thousands of taels.

457
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:38,910
Who is going to fork that?

458
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,470
As far as I'm aware,

459
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:44,140
the people of Huaizhou
have recently suffered from a disaster.

460
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,030
Even if they aren't
completely destitute,

461
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,300
they are in a state of poverty.

462
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,750
Official Zhou, even if you dig deep,

463
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:51,820
you won't find a lot of money.

464
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,910
Your family's wealth
far surpasses theirs.

465
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,910
Even a small amount
that escapes your grasp

466
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:00,540
is sufficient to sustain
the people of Huaizhou.

467
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,550
Official Zhou, if you are so concerned
about the national treasury's depletion,

468
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,950
why don't you contribute your own funds

469
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,470
to fill the gap?

470
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,620
How dare you?

471
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,340
Besides,

472
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:21,300
you are concerned that Northern Liang
might initiate a conflict.

473
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,340
Back when Lord Ding was imprisoned,

474
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,470
you insisted

475
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,750
on having him executed.

476
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:29,470
Why didn't that
cross your mind back then?

477
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,100
You...

478
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:40,230
Lord Ding's execution
was His Majesty's decree.

479
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:44,270
Official Mu, are you questioning
His Majesty's decision?

480
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,300
(I might hold authority)

481
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,620
(as the Emperor,)

482
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,620
(but I find myself
having to heed the counsel of others.)

483
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,030
(What kind of Emperor am I?)

484
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:20,510
Your Majesty.

485
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,390
Your Majesty.

486
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:37,830
Shen.

487
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,260
It's late.

488
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:42,910
Why are you here to see me?

489
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,220
I am here to deliver

490
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,066
the assessment results
of the Ministry of Personnel

491
00:34:47,066 --> 00:34:47,540
for the new year.

492
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:53,580
Leave it there.

493
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:55,990
Yes.

494
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:01,940
(Memorial)

495
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:27,830
You may leave now.

496
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:14,870
Zhimo.

497
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:15,930
(To Shen Jinghong)

498
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,660
Help me deliver this letter
to Shen Jinghong.

499
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,260
Tell him

500
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:25,350
I'd like to invite him
to Xiaoqin Pleasure House.

501
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,100
Zhuohua.

502
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,310
It has been a while
since your last visit.

503
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:41,660
Miss Song,

504
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,830
I've been busy lately.

505
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,260
I have invited Official Shen
to meet here today,

506
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:50,140
but it seems he isn't here yet.

507
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,310
It's fine.

508
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,660
As you wait for him,

509
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,990
you can have some snacks.

510
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,350
Eat up, Miss Song.

511
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,930
(Xiaoqin Pleasure House)

512
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:05,870
Well,

513
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,620
you've waited for over two hours.

514
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,180
Why isn't Official Shen here yet?

515
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,660
Perhaps something came up
and caused a delay.

516
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,100
Shen Jinghong

517
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,910
is hopeless.

518
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,260
Since he's ungrateful,

519
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:26,870
then don't hold me responsible
for disregarding our friendship.

520
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,140
Your Highness,

521
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,660
Official Shen never showed up.

522
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,430
What about Mu Zhuohua?

523
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,740
She waited for over two hours

524
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,470
before leaving angrily.

525
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:57,060
Recently, he kept avoiding me.

526
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,950
Clearly, he still feels reserved.

527
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:03,060
Forget it.

528
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,580

there's a growing divide

"The moon will rise,

598
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:41,950
This coincides with the woman's name.

599
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:43,350
She really has a thick skin.

600
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:44,990
That's right.

601
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:47,180

602
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:49,140
I can't believe
she's blowing her own trumpet.

00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:52,990
"The moon is shining brightly."

604
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:56,470
It implies
His Majesty is the setting sun.

605
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:00,910
She carefully planned step by step.

606
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:02,350
As a result,

607
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:03,910
His Majesty is now labeled
a fatuous Emperor.

608
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,990
Now that the children's folk rhyme
has been spread,

609
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:11,390
I believe she's gearing up
to accede to the throne.

610
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:13,830
(The moon will rise,)

611
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,390
(and the moon will fall.)

612
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:17,870
(Yuanguang's reincarnation)

613
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,660
(will turn the tables.)

614
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,220
Are you satisfied

615
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:25,220
with the gift?

616
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:48,830
Your Highness, this move

617
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:52,950
may appear to complicate the weiqi game.

618
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:55,100
However, in reality, it shatters

619
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,030
a longstanding stalemate.

620
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,700
What a brilliant move.

621
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:02,030
Think of it as a thank-you gift.

622
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:07,310
Your Highness,

623
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:09,870
the people have always praised you.

624
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:13,100
Now that His Majesty
is perceived as foolish and inept,

625
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:17,540
it will contrast with your favor
among the general public.

626
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,470
However, acquiring
a favorable reputation alone

627
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:24,100
won't suffice to enable her
to ascend the throne.

628
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:26,430
She requires something more substantial

629
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,510
to instill confidence in her reception
of the heavenly mandate.

630
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,430
Liu Chen is the Emperor Emeritus' son

631
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,870
and the rightful heir to the throne.

632
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:38,260
For his fate to be sealed,

633
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:40,100
heaven

634
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:42,470
must be angered by his deeds.

635
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:44,700
That way,

636
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:48,950
I can ascend to the throne rightfully.

637
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:52,510
Hence,

638
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:55,100
we need...

639
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:56,830
The Imperial Seal.

640
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:00,470
She has set her sights
on the Imperial Seal?

641
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:03,220
If she gets her hand
on the Imperial Seal,

642
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,830
both reputation and heavenly mandate

643
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,390
are on her side.

644
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:09,310
As a result,

645
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,660
she can officially force the Emperor
to abdicate the throne.

646
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:14,660
That isn't enough.

647
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:16,660
If she wants to force the Emperor
to abdicate the throne,

648
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:18,580
she must secure and control
the Imperial City.

649
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:21,390
The Zhou family who is in charge
of the imperial guards

650
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,060
can help her.

651
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,470
However, the imperial guards
can't leave the Imperial City,

652
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,260
and the Capital Region Army
may send over help anytime.

653
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:31,910
She doesn't have enough military power

654
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:33,580
to force the Emperor
to abdicate his throne.

655
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:36,910
But there are no other troops around.

656
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:38,910
She can't deploy troops
from the border, can she?

657
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:40,620
She doesn't have the authority to do so.

658
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:45,310
That's right.

659
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,540
Yemu Zhen has been staying
at the Princess's Residence.

660
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,580
Yemu Zhen

661
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:53,220
will be her best go-between.

662
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,430
The seal isn't enough.

663
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:57,470
I've struck a deal with Yemu Jing.

664
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,830
He will send his troops

665
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,910
to stop the Capital Region Army
from providing help.

666
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,350
After I ascend the throne,

667
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:07,950
I will permit cross-border trade,

668
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:09,700
display benevolence,

669
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:11,580
and lower border taxes.

670
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:25,260
Are you angry?

671
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,700
Yemu Jing is wildly ambitious

672
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:35,220
and greedy.

673
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:36,790
You...

674
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:37,660
Don't worry.

675
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:39,470
I got this.

676
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:42,470
I won't let him take advantage of me.

Colluding with Northern Liang

683
