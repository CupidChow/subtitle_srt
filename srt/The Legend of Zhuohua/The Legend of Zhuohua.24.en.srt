00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,860
(Adapted from "She Was Once
a Playful Soul" by Sui Yu Er An)

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,940
=Episode 24=

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
(This is a work of fiction.)

20
00:01:48,535 --> 00:01:49,815
If His Majesty were to know

21
00:01:49,815 --> 00:01:51,496
that she's a problematic person,

22
00:01:52,056 --> 00:01:54,375
I'm afraid she'll be removed.

23
00:01:56,136 --> 00:01:58,656
Lord Ding,
what are your thoughts on this?

24
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,255
Miss Sun.

25
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,615
What you did was unethical.

26
00:02:05,296 --> 00:02:07,175
Yet you dare to ask for my opinion.

27
00:02:11,775 --> 00:02:13,976
Your Majesty, I shall take my leave.

28
00:02:44,615 --> 00:02:47,655
Greetings, Your Majesty. I'm Mu Zhuohua,
the Director of the Ministry of Revenue.

29
00:02:48,256 --> 00:02:49,096
Mu Zhuohua.

30
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:50,775
Do you plead guilty?

31
00:02:53,655 --> 00:02:54,296
Your Majesty.

32
00:02:54,935 --> 00:02:56,895
What is it that I am guilty of?

33
00:02:59,215 --> 00:03:01,455
Observer Sun, tell her.

34
00:03:02,175 --> 00:03:04,096
What exactly is Mu Zhuohua guilty of?

35
00:03:04,655 --> 00:03:05,856
You changed your birthplace

36
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:07,256
from Huaizhou to Yanzhou.

37
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,696
Deceiving the Emperor
is a grave offense.

38
00:03:11,296 --> 00:03:12,055
Mu Zhuohua.

39
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:13,335
Drop your act.

40
00:03:14,296 --> 00:03:16,296
(My change of origins
was like a hanging knife.)

41
00:03:16,856 --> 00:03:18,416
(I didn't expect it
to fall on me today.)

42
00:03:22,615 --> 00:03:23,615
Mu Zhuohua.

43
00:03:24,335 --> 00:03:27,536
Last time, I gave you
30 floggings as punishment.

44
00:03:27,696 --> 00:03:30,016
How should I punish you this time?

45
00:03:30,536 --> 00:03:32,895
Do you have anything else to say?

46
00:03:36,976 --> 00:03:37,976
I...

47
00:03:39,935 --> 00:03:40,696
I...

48
00:03:41,335 --> 00:03:42,735
I have nothing to say.

49
00:03:43,696 --> 00:03:44,416
Guards!

50
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,335
Take her away!

51
00:03:50,376 --> 00:03:51,055
Wait!

52
00:04:03,495 --> 00:04:04,376
Down.

53
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:18,696
Greetings, Your Majesty, Lord Ding.

54
00:04:32,616 --> 00:04:33,335
Your Majesty.

55
00:04:33,936 --> 00:04:36,655
Mu Zhuohua is unworthy
of her title as Tanhua.

56
00:04:37,816 --> 00:04:39,736
She is originally
from Huaizhou, Jiangnan.

57
00:04:40,056 --> 00:04:43,136
She is the seventh daughter of Mu Rong,
whose family is the richest in Jiangnan.

58
00:04:43,215 --> 00:04:44,616
Her real name is Mu Qi.

59
00:04:45,455 --> 00:04:47,855
She took the metropolitan examination
by changing her birthplace.

60
00:04:49,215 --> 00:04:50,056
I can explain,

61
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:51,056
Your Majesties.

62
00:04:52,295 --> 00:04:54,736
I changed my birthplace
because I didn't have a choice.

63
00:04:55,736 --> 00:04:58,256
I am indeed from Huaizhou.

64
00:05:00,056 --> 00:05:02,215
At the time, I was forced
to marry Zhuang Wenfeng.

65
00:05:02,576 --> 00:05:03,496
I refused to do so.

66
00:05:04,376 --> 00:05:05,415
I was determined

67
00:05:05,496 --> 00:05:07,136
to pass the imperial examination

68
00:05:07,335 --> 00:05:08,415
and become a scholar.

69
00:05:09,295 --> 00:05:10,655
I only changed my birthplace to Yanzhou

70
00:05:11,455 --> 00:05:12,016
out...

71
00:05:12,816 --> 00:05:14,136
out of desperation.

72
00:05:14,616 --> 00:05:16,936
Even so, it is a crime
of deceiving the Emperor.

73
00:05:17,415 --> 00:05:18,855
Mu Zhuohua gained the title of Tanhua

74
00:05:19,136 --> 00:05:20,136
with her talents.

75
00:05:21,056 --> 00:05:22,376
But due to the change in her birthplace,

76
00:05:22,376 --> 00:05:23,496
she has been

77
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:26,208
walking on thin ice and living in fear.

78
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,975
She was afraid that if it got exposed,

79
00:05:28,136 --> 00:05:29,696
everything she did
for the people of Southern Chen

80
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,415
would go down the drain.

81
00:05:32,816 --> 00:05:34,095
What about you, Miss Sun?

82
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:36,655
You were born with advantages.

83
00:05:37,415 --> 00:05:40,376
You made it to a political observer
with the merits of your ancestors.

84
00:05:40,736 --> 00:05:42,176
However, you never thought of ways

85
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:43,576
to benefit the people.

86
00:05:44,455 --> 00:05:47,295
Instead, you are acting shamelessly
and meanly for your own gain.

87
00:05:48,256 --> 00:05:49,415
Miss Sun.

88
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,895
Do you feel worthy
of being a political observer

89
00:05:52,056 --> 00:05:53,376
in the Ministry of Revenue?

90
00:05:56,616 --> 00:05:57,535
Your Majesties.

91
00:05:58,016 --> 00:05:59,256
I gained this position

92
00:05:59,696 --> 00:06:01,535
according to the system of the court.

93
00:06:01,535 --> 00:06:02,895
I have never deceived the Emperor.

94
00:06:03,215 --> 00:06:03,895
That's enough!

95
00:06:05,095 --> 00:06:06,496
I was already aware that Mu Zhuohua

96
00:06:07,056 --> 00:06:08,295
changed her birthplace.

97
00:06:10,535 --> 00:06:11,696
How can that be?

98
00:06:15,736 --> 00:06:18,136
I am now clear
about Mu Zhuohua and the change

99
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,295
of her birthplace.

100
00:06:19,895 --> 00:06:22,895
Your Majesty,
how do you plan to punish her?

101
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:27,415
How do you want me to punish her?

102
00:06:31,215 --> 00:06:32,376
I dare not overstep my authority.

103
00:06:33,455 --> 00:06:34,215
It's just that

104
00:06:35,136 --> 00:06:36,376
passing the examination isn't easy

105
00:06:36,535 --> 00:06:37,335
for a lady.

106
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:40,455
Moreover, Mu Zhuohua has exceptional

107
00:06:41,016 --> 00:06:41,936
character and abilities.

108
00:06:42,855 --> 00:06:45,655
I hope you can forgive her.

109
00:06:49,215 --> 00:06:52,455
It is rare to see you
think so highly of someone.

110
00:06:54,376 --> 00:06:57,215
Mu Zhuohua's reason
for changing her birthplace

111
00:06:57,215 --> 00:06:58,176
is justified.

112
00:06:59,616 --> 00:07:00,415
Furthermore,

113
00:07:01,136 --> 00:07:03,335
she is the right-hand woman
whom I am planning to keep

114
00:07:03,696 --> 00:07:04,616
for the new emperor.

115
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:08,775
Don't worry.

116
00:07:09,376 --> 00:07:10,576
I value talent more than you do.

117
00:07:13,535 --> 00:07:15,016
I thank Your Majesty

118
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:16,655
on Mu Zhuohua's behalf.

119
00:07:18,895 --> 00:07:20,616
Lord Ding had informed me
of this matter long ago.

120
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:22,295
It was to show me

121
00:07:22,535 --> 00:07:23,335
if Tanhua Mu

122
00:07:23,335 --> 00:07:25,215
was really competent.

123
00:07:25,616 --> 00:07:27,535
The reason I sent her to Jiangnan

124
00:07:27,816 --> 00:07:28,775
was to see

125
00:07:28,975 --> 00:07:30,056
if she was able

126
00:07:30,056 --> 00:07:31,616
to turn the tide in her hometown.

127
00:07:31,895 --> 00:07:33,455
She has proven
that she is capable of it.

128
00:07:34,016 --> 00:07:34,775
But you?

129
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:38,816
If you really thought she deceived me,

130
00:07:39,655 --> 00:07:41,176
you should have come to me about it,

131
00:07:41,455 --> 00:07:42,496
but not the Dowager Empress.

132
00:07:43,975 --> 00:07:44,855
Don't forget

133
00:07:45,576 --> 00:07:47,535
that you are now not the Young Lady Sun

134
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:50,016
but a political observer
in the Ministry of Revenue.

135
00:07:53,655 --> 00:07:54,855
Please have mercy, Your Majesty!

136
00:07:55,816 --> 00:07:56,816
Have mercy?

137
00:07:57,256 --> 00:07:59,056
You have held this position for so long,

138
00:07:59,056 --> 00:08:00,775
yet you addressed yourself
as a common person.

139
00:08:01,295 --> 00:08:02,295
Miss Sun.

140
00:08:02,855 --> 00:08:04,496
If you don't intend to be an official,

141
00:08:05,136 --> 00:08:08,535
why take up the position
of a political observer?

142
00:08:12,376 --> 00:08:13,576
Yunyun was just...

143
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:18,176
Mother.

144
00:08:19,056 --> 00:08:21,335
Please stop interfering in politics.

145
00:08:24,936 --> 00:08:25,775
Sun Yunyun.

146
00:08:26,655 --> 00:08:28,376
Since you have no intention
to be an official,

147
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:29,936
you can go home

148
00:08:30,496 --> 00:08:32,376
and be the young lady of the Sun family.

149
00:08:39,456 --> 00:08:40,535
As for Ms. Mu,

150
00:08:41,016 --> 00:08:43,256
deceiving was not your intention,

151
00:08:43,575 --> 00:08:45,535
but it was still wrong
to change your birthplace.

152
00:08:45,815 --> 00:08:46,815
I'll deduct your salary for three months

153
00:08:47,535 --> 00:08:48,775
as your punishment.

154
00:08:49,736 --> 00:08:50,376
Yes, Your Majesty.

155
00:09:02,295 --> 00:09:03,256
I shall take my leave.

156
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:35,616
Still feeling scared?

157
00:09:39,096 --> 00:09:39,856
My Lord.

158
00:09:40,136 --> 00:09:42,535
Changing my birthplace
was enough to get me executed.

159
00:09:43,096 --> 00:09:45,295
I just came back from the gates of Hell.

160
00:09:45,655 --> 00:09:46,575
I'm obviously scared.

161
00:09:47,895 --> 00:09:49,055
I'm still feeling scared.

162
00:09:51,415 --> 00:09:52,175
My Lord.

163
00:09:52,295 --> 00:09:54,976
Why didn't you tell me

164
00:09:55,415 --> 00:09:57,736
that His Majesty was already

165
00:09:57,962 --> 00:09:58,921
aware of it?

166
00:10:00,216 --> 00:10:01,456
Only His Majesty needs to know.

167
00:10:02,295 --> 00:10:03,736
This matter cannot be disclosed.

168
00:10:04,856 --> 00:10:08,415
If it weren't for Miss Sun
picking a fight today,

169
00:10:09,136 --> 00:10:10,856
His Majesty and I would have planned

170
00:10:11,136 --> 00:10:13,856
to take it to our graves.

171
00:10:16,256 --> 00:10:16,935
You are right.

172
00:10:17,496 --> 00:10:19,655
After all, I wasn't honest about this.

173
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:22,856
I am really lucky

174
00:10:23,815 --> 00:10:25,016
that I am still alive.

175
00:10:27,216 --> 00:10:29,175
I can finally have a good sleep.

176
00:10:36,256 --> 00:10:37,055
Do you want to sleep?

177
00:10:42,216 --> 00:10:43,496
I won't sleep in your carriage.

178
00:10:53,175 --> 00:10:53,815
My Lord.

179
00:10:54,496 --> 00:10:55,815
Xue Xiaotang is having another relapse.

180
00:10:56,295 --> 00:10:57,616
He seems unlikely
to make it through this time.

181
00:10:57,895 --> 00:10:59,695
Imperial Physician Lu
is doing his best to save him.

182
00:11:02,055 --> 00:11:02,895
Quickly return.

183
00:11:03,055 --> 00:11:03,575
Yes, My Lord.

184
00:11:11,935 --> 00:11:12,935
Hold him down.

185
00:11:13,655 --> 00:11:14,216
Imperial Physician Lu.

186
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:14,695
I'll help you.

187
00:11:15,415 --> 00:11:16,136
Get the needle.

188
00:11:34,096 --> 00:11:35,575
He can't carry on like this.

189
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,055
Imperial Physician Lu.

190
00:11:37,256 --> 00:11:39,256
I heard the Imperial Academy of Medicine
has rare books.

191
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:41,376
Please try to find another cure.

192
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,535
Alright, I will look through them
right away.

193
00:12:06,256 --> 00:12:06,976
Miss Sun.

194
00:12:07,256 --> 00:12:07,976
Official Fang.

195
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,016
Are you going home?

196
00:12:10,456 --> 00:12:12,216
I'm waiting for someone.
You may go ahead.

197
00:12:12,976 --> 00:12:13,695
All right.

198
00:12:41,376 --> 00:12:43,216
Thank Official Mu for me.

199
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,336
Thank her for looking after me lately.

200
00:12:49,256 --> 00:12:50,096
It's just that

201
00:12:50,456 --> 00:12:52,895
dealing with so many men every day

202
00:12:53,016 --> 00:12:55,256
is not good for a lady's reputation.

203
00:12:56,295 --> 00:12:57,616
I didn't know any better at first

204
00:12:57,775 --> 00:12:58,775
and took the wrong path.

205
00:12:59,136 --> 00:13:00,336
Now that I've come to a realization,

206
00:13:00,575 --> 00:13:01,935
that means farewell.

207
00:13:08,336 --> 00:13:09,856
Stop, miss.

208
00:13:10,096 --> 00:13:11,055
No need to relay it.

209
00:13:14,256 --> 00:13:15,216
How many people

210
00:13:16,055 --> 00:13:18,096
have had a hard time walking

211
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,376
this short journey?

212
00:13:20,055 --> 00:13:21,815
(Department of State Affairs)
Some people go straight to the top

213
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:24,096
and still criticize others
with a petty heart.

214
00:13:24,256 --> 00:13:25,575
It is truly ridiculous

215
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,175
and pathetic.

216
00:13:30,415 --> 00:13:32,695
You are wrong, Official Mu.

217
00:13:33,415 --> 00:13:35,256
Even if a sparrow
has the ambition of a swan,

218
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:37,216
it won't be strong enough
to fly up high in the sky.

219
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,016
One's destiny is fixed.

220
00:13:39,456 --> 00:13:41,695
How can the silt rise above the clouds?

221
00:13:42,376 --> 00:13:43,055
Rise above?

222
00:13:44,055 --> 00:13:45,535
I'm afraid what you said was wrong.

223
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:46,775
Everything I have today

224
00:13:46,976 --> 00:13:48,295
was earned on my own.

225
00:13:48,655 --> 00:13:49,376
Besides,

226
00:13:50,055 --> 00:13:51,096
to me,

227
00:13:51,535 --> 00:13:52,575
my career as an official

228
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,935
always comes first.

229
00:13:57,535 --> 00:13:58,856
- Lord Ding.
- My Lord.

230
00:14:02,695 --> 00:14:03,695
I know

231
00:14:03,695 --> 00:14:05,295
that I have no place in your heart,

232
00:14:06,216 --> 00:14:07,415
but you don't have to emphasize it

233
00:14:07,415 --> 00:14:08,575
all the time.

234
00:14:48,695 --> 00:14:49,336
Official Mu.

235
00:14:50,175 --> 00:14:51,016
What a coincidence.

236
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,535
My Lord.

237
00:14:59,935 --> 00:15:02,256
We must set some rules from now on.

238
00:15:03,295 --> 00:15:04,016
All right.

239
00:15:05,175 --> 00:15:07,096
Act appropriately in front of others.

240
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:09,775
We can't let them
find out about our relationship.

241
00:15:10,055 --> 00:15:11,695
My Lord is so clever.

242
00:15:12,655 --> 00:15:13,616
I'm returning to my duty.

243
00:15:21,532 --> 00:15:23,827
(Department of State Affairs)

244
00:15:34,496 --> 00:15:35,895
Was this also sent to other places

245
00:15:37,016 --> 00:15:38,456
or am I the only one getting it?

246
00:15:39,216 --> 00:15:42,136
Officials of Six Ministries
don't have it, to say the least.

247
00:16:03,216 --> 00:16:03,895
Thank you.

248
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:11,655
My Lord.

249
00:16:12,655 --> 00:16:14,216
Ministry of Personnel
extended their thanks.

250
00:16:14,895 --> 00:16:17,336
Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Rites,

251
00:16:18,016 --> 00:16:19,096
Ministry of War, and Ministry of Works

252
00:16:19,216 --> 00:16:20,055
as well.

253
00:16:23,336 --> 00:16:24,295
And the Ministry of Revenue?

254
00:16:24,736 --> 00:16:26,016
Did they send someone to say thanks?

255
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,096
The cost of the ice

256
00:16:29,175 --> 00:16:30,616
was appropriated from them.

257
00:16:31,216 --> 00:16:32,415
Minister Xu feels upset over it.

258
00:16:33,223 --> 00:16:34,136
He probably won't come.

259
00:16:39,496 --> 00:16:41,736
Anything can be solved,
as danger is nothing to be afraid of.

260
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:43,096
Is this

261
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,655
what the Ministry of Revenue
thinks of the disaster in Jiangnan?

262
00:16:46,216 --> 00:16:47,295
Tell me what you think.

263
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,456
The locust plague was cruel,

264
00:16:51,336 --> 00:16:52,496
but you are wise, My Lord.

265
00:16:53,895 --> 00:16:55,935
You are not making any sense.

266
00:16:57,136 --> 00:16:57,736
Next.

267
00:16:58,815 --> 00:17:01,336
I think there is nothing wrong
with that remark.

268
00:17:02,096 --> 00:17:03,376
Thanks to your decisive judgment,

269
00:17:04,216 --> 00:17:06,176
we were able to overcome the crisis.

270
00:17:07,023 --> 00:17:09,582
It's also a blessing in disguise
for the people of Jiangnan.

271
00:17:10,615 --> 00:17:11,736
Full of flattery.

272
00:17:12,016 --> 00:17:13,095
Not a word is sincere.

273
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:15,216
Next.

274
00:17:16,896 --> 00:17:18,095
We will do

275
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,375
as you say, My Lord.

276
00:17:20,656 --> 00:17:21,535
No one

277
00:17:21,815 --> 00:17:24,055
from the Ministry of Revenue
can make things clear.

278
00:17:25,176 --> 00:17:25,976
I will go

279
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,575
and figure something out.

280
00:17:31,295 --> 00:17:32,736
What am I supposed to do?

281
00:17:33,775 --> 00:17:34,936
Official Li, how did it go?

282
00:17:34,976 --> 00:17:35,736
Is His Lordship happy?

283
00:17:36,016 --> 00:17:36,775
Happy?

284
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:37,855
Far from it!

285
00:17:57,615 --> 00:17:58,216
Official Li.

286
00:17:59,855 --> 00:18:00,496
Ms. Mu.

287
00:18:02,016 --> 00:18:03,256
The hopes of the Ministry of Revenue

288
00:18:04,135 --> 00:18:05,775
all lie with you now.

289
00:18:08,656 --> 00:18:09,216
I don't know

290
00:18:09,216 --> 00:18:11,176
what is going on with Lord Ding today.

291
00:18:11,656 --> 00:18:12,936
He's so cranky.

292
00:18:13,736 --> 00:18:15,055
He's unhappy with everything.

293
00:18:15,335 --> 00:18:17,095
He keeps torturing us.

294
00:18:18,335 --> 00:18:20,375
We have appropriated funds
for the ice today.

295
00:18:20,575 --> 00:18:22,976
Why is he always
giving us such a hard time?

296
00:18:24,496 --> 00:18:28,176
That's why we have no choice
but to send you to deal with him.

297
00:18:30,496 --> 00:18:31,936
Me?

298
00:18:32,834 --> 00:18:35,052
(Department of State Affairs)

299
00:18:39,055 --> 00:18:40,095
Is he in a bad mood?

300
00:19:00,456 --> 00:19:01,256
My Lord.

301
00:19:01,855 --> 00:19:02,855
It took them long enough

302
00:19:03,135 --> 00:19:04,615
to send you here.

303
00:19:05,696 --> 00:19:08,295
What are your thoughts
on the disaster relief for Jiangnan?

304
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,681
Disasters don't come out of nowhere.
Blessings don't fall from the sky.

305
00:19:15,456 --> 00:19:16,416
This is what I think.

306
00:19:16,936 --> 00:19:18,256
The disaster in Jiangnan

307
00:19:18,335 --> 00:19:20,256
was both natural and man-made.

308
00:19:20,736 --> 00:19:22,656
But isn't it a good thing for the people

309
00:19:22,656 --> 00:19:25,016
if corrupted and greedy officials

310
00:19:25,256 --> 00:19:26,216
were weeded out

311
00:19:26,496 --> 00:19:28,295
because of this?

312
00:19:35,815 --> 00:19:36,456
Yes.

313
00:19:37,216 --> 00:19:38,456
No one says it better than you.

314
00:19:40,295 --> 00:19:42,135
You have had a hard time
writing documents lately.

315
00:19:45,295 --> 00:19:45,775
Come.

316
00:19:46,095 --> 00:19:46,736
Come on.

317
00:19:50,696 --> 00:19:52,135
I've been waiting for you to eat.

318
00:19:53,295 --> 00:19:55,815
I'm still on duty.
I have to go back and tidy up.

319
00:19:56,335 --> 00:19:57,575
Eating is also an important matter.

320
00:19:59,896 --> 00:20:01,055
My Lord.

321
00:20:01,216 --> 00:20:02,256
You have caused

322
00:20:02,256 --> 00:20:04,176
the Ministry of Revenue
to be in a panic today.

323
00:20:04,535 --> 00:20:05,335
That's good.

324
00:20:05,855 --> 00:20:07,416
This way, they will learn

325
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,335
that brown-nosing
won't solve the problem.

326
00:20:09,736 --> 00:20:10,775
Then they will always send you here.

327
00:20:14,696 --> 00:20:17,295
After all, I am just your secret lover.

328
00:20:18,256 --> 00:20:19,936
I cannot be with you

329
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,375
in public.

330
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:26,656
All right. My Lord has suffered.

331
00:20:31,736 --> 00:20:32,535
Are you happy now?

332
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,135
I'm not upset anymore.

333
00:20:36,176 --> 00:20:36,976
Have some more.

334
00:21:01,936 --> 00:21:03,896
My Lord, I'm done eating.

335
00:21:04,216 --> 00:21:05,095
I have to go now.

336
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,416
So soon?

337
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:10,815
Once I am off duty,

338
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,176
I'll wait for you outside.

339
00:21:13,615 --> 00:21:14,976
I'll bring back the document,

340
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,176
tidy up for a bit, and come out.

341
00:21:34,976 --> 00:21:36,416
This step forward that His Lordship took

342
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:37,936
is such a big step.

343
00:21:38,055 --> 00:21:39,216
We should learn from him.

344
00:21:49,496 --> 00:21:50,335
Official Wen.

345
00:21:50,896 --> 00:21:51,736
It's been a while.

346
00:21:54,135 --> 00:21:57,016
What brings you
to the Ministry of Revenue?

347
00:21:58,456 --> 00:22:01,055
Not long ago, good scholars
were being appointed.

348
00:22:01,055 --> 00:22:03,656
I was chosen to be
a political observer here.

349
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,696
Well, not only are we
from the same batch,

350
00:22:06,736 --> 00:22:07,656
but we're also colleagues.

351
00:22:07,815 --> 00:22:09,375
Please look out for me in the future.

352
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,295
You're being too humble, Official Mu.

353
00:22:12,815 --> 00:22:15,176
Now, you are
the Director of the Ministry of Revenue,

354
00:22:15,696 --> 00:22:18,216
while I'm just a low-ranking
political observer.

355
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:19,855
I'm in no place to act superior.

356
00:22:20,176 --> 00:22:21,416
If that's the case,

357
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:22,416
not long ago,

358
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:23,976
I was a low-ranking
political observer, too.

359
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:25,055
I am ashamed of myself.

360
00:22:25,535 --> 00:22:26,535
Why are you ashamed?

361
00:22:26,896 --> 00:22:28,496
Because you are a man,

362
00:22:28,736 --> 00:22:31,176
but your ranking isn't as high as mine?

363
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:35,815
I...

364
00:22:36,615 --> 00:22:39,656
I was sort of pedantic in the past

365
00:22:39,815 --> 00:22:41,615
over the difference
between men and women.

366
00:22:42,216 --> 00:22:43,815
I am truly...

367
00:22:44,016 --> 00:22:45,656
Truly sorry.

368
00:22:46,496 --> 00:22:48,095
Just admit your wrongs and change.

369
00:22:48,095 --> 00:22:49,496
Bowing to me is unnecessary.

370
00:22:55,615 --> 00:22:57,095
I should get going.

371
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:58,976
Official Mu.

372
00:22:59,936 --> 00:23:00,696
Official Mu.

373
00:23:04,535 --> 00:23:06,896
Official Mu, are you married?

374
00:23:08,696 --> 00:23:10,656
She is really popular with men.

375
00:23:15,335 --> 00:23:17,016
According to the law of Southern Chen,

376
00:23:17,016 --> 00:23:19,216
women can marry once they are 16.

377
00:23:20,295 --> 00:23:22,016
Have your elders in the family

378
00:23:22,055 --> 00:23:23,095
made any arrangements for you?

379
00:23:26,496 --> 00:23:28,295
I'm dedicated to serving my nation

380
00:23:28,815 --> 00:23:29,696
with no intention to marry.

381
00:23:34,135 --> 00:23:36,535
In that case, I will be frank.

382
00:23:40,936 --> 00:23:45,055
What do you think of me?

383
00:23:51,176 --> 00:23:51,815
Well...

384
00:23:52,016 --> 00:23:53,896
You are a gentleman.

385
00:23:54,176 --> 00:23:56,375
I have always respected you

386
00:23:56,736 --> 00:23:58,295
like an elder brother.

387
00:23:59,615 --> 00:24:01,575
Indeed, I am slightly older than you.

388
00:24:02,216 --> 00:24:03,815
But I wouldn't claim myself
as your brother.

389
00:24:04,095 --> 00:24:08,256
A few days ago, I thought
you and Official Shen were...

390
00:24:10,295 --> 00:24:12,216
I found out
it was a misunderstanding later on.

391
00:24:13,016 --> 00:24:16,216
That's why I made

392
00:24:16,936 --> 00:24:18,615
a bold confession to you today.

393
00:24:19,775 --> 00:24:20,375
I...

394
00:24:25,656 --> 00:24:27,016
Greetings, Lord Ding.

395
00:24:27,055 --> 00:24:28,496
Greetings, Lord Ding.

396
00:24:29,016 --> 00:24:29,736
Be at ease.

397
00:24:32,176 --> 00:24:33,496
It's already late.

398
00:24:33,936 --> 00:24:36,496
Is the Ministry of Revenue
still working?

399
00:24:37,095 --> 00:24:38,256
Your Lordship,

400
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,016
we were just about to leave.

401
00:24:40,256 --> 00:24:40,976
You may leave first.

402
00:24:42,256 --> 00:24:44,256
I have something important
to discuss with Official Mu.

403
00:24:59,256 --> 00:24:59,896
My Lord.

404
00:25:00,295 --> 00:25:01,375
I didn't want this to happen.

405
00:25:02,216 --> 00:25:02,976
I know that.

406
00:25:07,896 --> 00:25:08,855
I have an idea.

407
00:25:09,335 --> 00:25:11,095
It will stop him from bothering you.

408
00:25:11,575 --> 00:25:12,456
What is it?

409
00:25:13,496 --> 00:25:14,815
Cater to his taste.

410
00:25:15,335 --> 00:25:16,615
Make him distant himself.

411
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:19,016
Well, I'm counting on you, My Lord.

412
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,393
(Department of State Affairs)

413
00:25:29,016 --> 00:25:29,815
Official Mu.

414
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:32,815
Official Mu.

415
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:38,176
Official Mu.

416
00:25:39,016 --> 00:25:41,855
Have you considered
what I said to you the other day?

417
00:25:42,335 --> 00:25:42,976
I...

418
00:25:43,736 --> 00:25:44,535
Official Wen.

419
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,736
I have made it clear that day.

420
00:25:48,615 --> 00:25:50,416
I really have no intention to marry.

421
00:25:52,055 --> 00:25:52,775
Look.

422
00:25:53,615 --> 00:25:55,936
Marriage is a natural thing.

423
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,575
How can a woman not marry?

424
00:25:59,216 --> 00:26:00,216
To tell you the truth,

425
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,535
the elders in the family often say

426
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:05,656
that a woman without talent is virtuous.

427
00:26:06,335 --> 00:26:07,896
I initially thought so, too.

428
00:26:08,855 --> 00:26:10,575
But ever since I heard of

429
00:26:10,575 --> 00:26:12,135
what you did in Jiangnan,

430
00:26:12,775 --> 00:26:13,976
I changed my mind.

431
00:26:15,535 --> 00:26:16,656
I think women

432
00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:19,535
should be like you.

433
00:26:20,135 --> 00:26:21,535
Well-educated and well-mannered.

434
00:26:21,775 --> 00:26:23,176
Be exceptional
in both appearance and intellect.

435
00:26:25,135 --> 00:26:27,416
You are fine-looking and talented.

436
00:26:27,736 --> 00:26:29,815
But I don't share your feelings.

437
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:33,375
I really have no intention to marry.

438
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:37,456
Official Mu.

439
00:26:38,535 --> 00:26:40,855
If you think
I'm not good enough for you,

440
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,535
just be frank with me.

441
00:26:42,696 --> 00:26:43,696
If I could improve it,

442
00:26:44,696 --> 00:26:45,936
I would change it for you.

443
00:26:45,936 --> 00:26:46,696
Not at all.

444
00:26:47,095 --> 00:26:48,656
You are not lacking in any way.

445
00:26:49,055 --> 00:26:50,976
It's just that I...

446
00:26:51,416 --> 00:26:53,295
I am not good enough for you.

447
00:26:53,416 --> 00:26:54,575
Not at all.

448
00:26:55,256 --> 00:26:56,295
I think...

449
00:26:57,696 --> 00:27:00,016
I think you are incredible.

450
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:03,095
If we get married,

451
00:27:03,335 --> 00:27:05,055
we can surely help each other.

452
00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:06,889
Greetings, Lord Ding.

453
00:27:07,095 --> 00:27:08,456
Greetings, Lord Ding.

454
00:27:09,896 --> 00:27:10,656
Official Mu.

455
00:27:12,936 --> 00:27:14,416
I have work to assign you.

456
00:27:15,656 --> 00:27:16,896
Come with me.

457
00:27:18,936 --> 00:27:19,736
Yes, My Lord.

458
00:27:33,896 --> 00:27:34,535
My Lord.

459
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:38,375
My Lord, I thought you said

460
00:27:38,696 --> 00:27:39,936
you had an idea

461
00:27:40,295 --> 00:27:41,736
to stop Wen Shizong from bothering me.

462
00:27:42,216 --> 00:27:43,335
What exactly is it?

463
00:27:46,295 --> 00:27:47,615
What if you have offended me?

464
00:27:49,936 --> 00:27:51,176
Will he dare marry you?

465
00:27:56,416 --> 00:27:58,256
You have shut the door so tightly.

466
00:27:59,216 --> 00:28:00,456
Others can barely see a thing.

467
00:28:02,335 --> 00:28:03,855
It'd better be.

468
00:28:07,815 --> 00:28:08,896
I think so, too.

Let's see who dares
to covet you from now on.

487
00:29:21,095 --> 00:29:21,775
My Lord.

488
00:29:22,335 --> 00:29:24,095
Official Xu, Minister of Revenue,
wants to see you.

489
00:29:28,176 --> 00:29:29,896
Please have mercy, My Lord!

490
00:29:31,456 --> 00:29:32,535
I was wrong.

491
00:29:36,176 --> 00:29:36,976
Were you?

492
00:29:38,496 --> 00:29:40,335
Do you know what you did wrong?

493
00:29:41,535 --> 00:29:42,256
I...

494
00:29:42,575 --> 00:29:44,256
I was wrong for...

495
00:29:44,696 --> 00:29:46,416
For...

496
00:29:47,575 --> 00:29:49,135
You are greedy and cowardly.

497
00:29:49,615 --> 00:29:50,855
You have a glib tongue.

498
00:29:50,936 --> 00:29:53,216
Bold as brass. Lack foresight.

499
00:29:55,615 --> 00:29:56,295
There's more.

500
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,416
You acted in bad faith

501
00:29:58,896 --> 00:30:01,295
and went around attracting bad admirers.

502
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:06,815
What? Bad admirers?

503
00:30:12,335 --> 00:30:13,176
Anyway,

504
00:30:14,095 --> 00:30:15,135
go back now

505
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:16,936
and reflect on yourself.

506
00:30:20,295 --> 00:30:20,936
Yes, My Lord.

507
00:30:20,936 --> 00:30:22,256
I shall take my leave.

508
00:30:34,055 --> 00:30:34,855
My Lord.

509
00:30:35,535 --> 00:30:38,375
Was it that bad?

510
00:30:41,135 --> 00:30:41,736
Yes.

511
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:44,615
He's so petty.

512
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,976
A mole that brings bad luck
to my husband?

513
00:30:47,295 --> 00:30:48,736
Aren't you jinxing yourself?

514
00:30:52,055 --> 00:30:53,216
He was furious?

515
00:30:53,216 --> 00:30:53,976
Yes.

516
00:30:54,768 --> 00:30:55,929
Think of something.

517
00:30:58,095 --> 00:30:58,815
Ms. Mu.

518
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:00,976
Official Mu.

519
00:31:01,936 --> 00:31:03,976
We heard
about what happened this morning.

520
00:31:04,936 --> 00:31:06,615
Though we haven't
worked together for long,

521
00:31:06,775 --> 00:31:07,696
all of us

522
00:31:07,896 --> 00:31:09,416
truly admire your abilities.

523
00:31:10,095 --> 00:31:11,615
How could you be so careless

524
00:31:11,815 --> 00:31:13,575
and end up offending Lord Ding?

525
00:31:13,936 --> 00:31:14,496
I...

526
00:31:14,896 --> 00:31:16,016
I find it strange.

527
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:20,896
Is it because of the documents
you worked on all day

528
00:31:20,936 --> 00:31:23,375
to make him approve
all the Ministry of Revenue documents?

529
00:31:24,095 --> 00:31:25,416
And that upset him?

530
00:31:27,896 --> 00:31:28,696
Exactly.

531
00:31:28,815 --> 00:31:30,416
I talked back to him that day

532
00:31:30,416 --> 00:31:31,936
so that I could get all the documents

533
00:31:33,135 --> 00:31:34,936
for the Ministry of Revenue.

534
00:31:36,216 --> 00:31:38,855
I guess I am getting
my retribution today.

535
00:31:39,295 --> 00:31:41,176
And I am panicking now.

536
00:31:41,736 --> 00:31:44,496
I just hope Lord Ding will forgive me

537
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,016
and show mercy.

538
00:31:47,496 --> 00:31:48,456
That's our fault.

539
00:31:49,216 --> 00:31:50,295
It's our fault!

540
00:31:50,936 --> 00:31:51,696
I'm sorry.

541
00:31:53,696 --> 00:31:54,416
Official Li.

542
00:31:54,815 --> 00:31:56,016
I need to be alone for a while.

543
00:31:56,176 --> 00:31:56,976
Please excuse me.

544
00:32:03,615 --> 00:32:04,775
I feel bad for Ms. Mu.

545
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:06,135
Yes.

546
00:32:08,496 --> 00:32:09,615
It's not easy for her.

547
00:32:10,335 --> 00:32:11,335
Let's go, Official Li.

548
00:32:20,295 --> 00:32:20,976
Uncle.

549
00:32:21,736 --> 00:32:23,736
I thought you've always
admired Mu Zhuohua.

550
00:32:23,936 --> 00:32:25,535
Why did you criticize her
so badly this time?

551
00:32:26,016 --> 00:32:27,335
What did she do wrong?

552
00:32:28,016 --> 00:32:30,016
You caught wind of it so quickly.

553
00:32:30,936 --> 00:32:31,696
That's for sure.

554
00:32:32,295 --> 00:32:33,815
After all, she and I have gone

555
00:32:33,815 --> 00:32:35,135
through thick and thin before.

556
00:32:36,016 --> 00:32:38,216
It's normal
that I am concerned about her.

557
00:32:39,016 --> 00:32:41,656
It was just a business trip to Jiangnan.

558
00:32:43,335 --> 00:32:45,375
That's barely thick and thin.

559
00:32:45,615 --> 00:32:46,615
How is it not?

560
00:32:47,696 --> 00:32:48,335
You see.

561
00:32:48,335 --> 00:32:50,456
The days we spent on disaster relief
were tough days.

562
00:32:51,256 --> 00:32:53,256
Returning to the capital
and being rewarded were good days.

563
00:32:57,936 --> 00:32:58,775
Uncle.

564
00:32:59,135 --> 00:33:00,615
You haven't answered me.

565
00:33:01,815 --> 00:33:03,416
You always admired

566
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:04,416
Mu Zhuohua's talents.

567
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:07,696
Why are you giving her a hard time now?

568
00:33:10,535 --> 00:33:11,615
When young people

569
00:33:12,295 --> 00:33:13,976
have made a bit of achievements,

570
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:17,055
they become impetuous and careless.

571
00:33:18,256 --> 00:33:19,656
I must humble her.

572
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,176
Uncle.

573
00:33:24,976 --> 00:33:27,016
I'm sure it was just a careless mistake.

574
00:33:28,016 --> 00:33:30,016
Don't be so hard on her.

575
00:33:30,615 --> 00:33:32,696
I heard that she cried
after getting scolded by you.

576
00:33:41,896 --> 00:33:44,095
Why are you looking at me like this?

577
00:33:44,896 --> 00:33:45,575
Chen.

578
00:33:47,535 --> 00:33:48,976
You are 21 now, no?

579
00:33:50,936 --> 00:33:52,736
At the palace banquet back then,

580
00:33:53,016 --> 00:33:54,896
was there any young lady
that caught your eye?

581
00:33:55,615 --> 00:33:58,016
His Majesty can arrange
the marriage for you.

582
00:33:59,256 --> 00:34:02,216
Uncle, stop making fun of me.

583
00:34:03,256 --> 00:34:04,615
Are these noble young ladies

584
00:34:04,696 --> 00:34:07,696
out of their minds?

585
00:34:08,095 --> 00:34:09,255
I have avoided them so hard,

586
00:34:09,896 --> 00:34:11,735
but they still keep coming to me.

587
00:34:18,376 --> 00:34:20,175
It is not that they are foolish.

588
00:34:20,735 --> 00:34:23,695
It is that their families are crafty.

589
00:34:26,175 --> 00:34:26,936
This won't do.

590
00:34:27,535 --> 00:34:28,296
It's terrifying.

591
00:34:28,456 --> 00:34:30,175
I can't even have a meal at ease.

592
00:34:32,215 --> 00:34:34,936
I must find a way
to end it once and for all.

593
00:34:37,896 --> 00:34:40,336
To be honest, if it is Mu Zhuohua,

594
00:34:41,535 --> 00:34:43,336
I think I can accept that.

595
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:52,936
Uncle.

596
00:34:53,695 --> 00:34:55,976
Why are you
staring at me like that again?

597
00:34:56,856 --> 00:34:57,655
She's not for you.

598
00:34:58,896 --> 00:34:59,655
I know that.

599
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:01,976
Mother and Grandmother

600
00:35:02,535 --> 00:35:03,735
have been nagging at me

601
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:05,175
since the coming-of-age ceremony.

602
00:35:06,055 --> 00:35:07,055
They said I must marry

603
00:35:07,055 --> 00:35:09,336
a noble daughter
as the Princess Consort.

604
00:35:09,735 --> 00:35:10,776
But I don't like it.

605
00:35:12,496 --> 00:35:13,416
Just like you, Uncle.

606
00:35:13,816 --> 00:35:15,055
You have remained unmarried.

607
00:35:15,936 --> 00:35:16,735
It's because you refuse

608
00:35:16,735 --> 00:35:18,416
to be controlled
by these noble families.

609
00:35:19,735 --> 00:35:21,535
If I don't marry, I won't have an heir.

610
00:35:23,016 --> 00:35:24,416
To some people,

611
00:35:25,615 --> 00:35:27,016
it is a good thing.

612
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:36,175
Do you have it ready?

613
00:35:38,655 --> 00:35:39,856
Look.

614
00:35:39,976 --> 00:35:41,816
Just fresh out of the bank.

615
00:35:47,776 --> 00:35:49,695
She just got scolded by Uncle.

616
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:51,456
She must be upset.

617
00:35:52,296 --> 00:35:53,055
If she sees this,

618
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:54,615
she will cheer up for sure.

619
00:35:55,016 --> 00:35:55,695
Come on.

620
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:00,336
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

621
00:36:01,655 --> 00:36:02,456
Yes, Your Highness.

622
00:36:12,535 --> 00:36:13,776
Greetings, Your Highness.

623
00:36:14,816 --> 00:36:16,296
Have you seen Ms. Mu?

624
00:36:16,976 --> 00:36:18,615
Ms. Mu left very early today.

625
00:36:19,175 --> 00:36:22,456
She said she was going to dine
with Mr. Shen at Xiaoqin Pleasure House.

626
00:36:23,135 --> 00:36:24,215
Xiaoqin Pleasure House again?

627
00:36:28,376 --> 00:36:29,456
She invited Jinghong

628
00:36:30,175 --> 00:36:31,215
but not me.

629
00:36:34,376 --> 00:36:35,255
Your Highness.

630
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:38,976
I've finally found you.

631
00:36:39,509 --> 00:36:41,068
His Majesty has summoned you
to Wende Hall

632
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:43,856
to discuss your visit
to the temporary imperial residence.

633
00:36:56,695 --> 00:36:57,496
Let's go.

634
00:36:57,726 --> 00:37:00,078
(Xiaoqin Pleasure House)

635
00:37:10,376 --> 00:37:12,095
Sun, what are you doing?

636
00:37:13,496 --> 00:37:14,456
Recently,

637
00:37:14,776 --> 00:37:15,896
Yunyun has acted out of line

638
00:37:16,336 --> 00:37:17,496
and caused you a lot of trouble.

639
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:21,296
I feel really sorry.

640
00:37:22,655 --> 00:37:23,416
I apologize to you

641
00:37:24,496 --> 00:37:25,416
on my sister's behalf.

642
00:37:26,655 --> 00:37:28,175
Sun, you don't have to do this.

643
00:37:28,376 --> 00:37:29,976
I'm not someone
who'd take it out on others.

644
00:37:30,336 --> 00:37:31,655
I'm too ashamed to face you.

645
00:37:32,575 --> 00:37:34,135
You and her aren't the same.

646
00:37:34,655 --> 00:37:35,296
Besides,

647
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:37,095
she has left the Ministry of Revenue.

648
00:37:37,376 --> 00:37:38,816
It's water under the bridge now.

649
00:37:41,735 --> 00:37:42,336
Come on, Sun.

650
00:37:42,336 --> 00:37:43,055
All right.

651
00:37:43,856 --> 00:37:44,695
Stop standing there.

652
00:37:45,135 --> 00:37:46,416
We are at a place of entertainment.

653
00:37:47,095 --> 00:37:49,255
Let's just talk
about entertaining things.

654
00:37:49,496 --> 00:37:50,336
Come on. Sit down.

655
00:37:50,416 --> 00:37:51,175
He's right.

656
00:37:53,175 --> 00:37:55,856
Shen, let's drink to Sun.

657
00:37:55,896 --> 00:37:56,336
Sure.

658
00:37:56,496 --> 00:37:56,936
Good.

659
00:37:57,095 --> 00:37:59,535
Then I shall drink to you two as well.

660
00:38:05,856 --> 00:38:08,655
Come on, we are not done drinking.

661
00:38:09,255 --> 00:38:10,376
- Drink up, Sun.
- Carry on.

662
00:38:19,416 --> 00:38:23,055
I knew you two would quickly
rise through the ranks.

663
00:38:23,376 --> 00:38:24,976
One is the Director
of the Ministry of Revenue.

664
00:38:25,735 --> 00:38:27,296
Another one is the Director
of the Ministry of Personnel.

665
00:38:29,976 --> 00:38:31,695
Among those from our batch,

666
00:38:31,695 --> 00:38:34,296
you two are the quickest to rise!

667
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:38,496
All right, Sun.

668
00:38:38,856 --> 00:38:39,936
Don't be self-deprecating.

669
00:38:40,496 --> 00:38:41,816
You have true talent and knowledge, too.

670
00:38:42,296 --> 00:38:43,456
You would've been successful like us

671
00:38:43,776 --> 00:38:45,655
if you hadn't been burdened
by your family.

672
00:38:47,336 --> 00:38:48,055
Shen.

673
00:38:49,296 --> 00:38:51,936
Are you talking about Jiangzuo?

674
00:38:53,816 --> 00:38:56,095
The Sun family already has Consort Shu

675
00:38:56,496 --> 00:38:57,456
and Minister of Works.

676
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:00,215
So they can't have
a director of the Ministry of Works.

677
00:39:02,856 --> 00:39:04,055
You know what?

678
00:39:05,055 --> 00:39:06,856
I am really willing

679
00:39:06,856 --> 00:39:09,496
to work as the administrator
of the Ministry of Works

680
00:39:10,016 --> 00:39:11,735
until I retire.

681
00:39:15,296 --> 00:39:16,055
I get it now.

682
00:39:17,816 --> 00:39:18,655
So do I.

683
00:39:19,135 --> 00:39:20,776
Sun, what do you get?

684
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:29,016
The edge of this table isn't straight.

685
00:39:30,376 --> 00:39:31,615
Bring me my ruler.

686
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:32,776
I'll straighten it out.

687
00:39:33,016 --> 00:39:34,896
Sun is delighted after having drinks.

688
00:39:35,976 --> 00:39:37,215
It's not cut straight.

689
00:39:37,215 --> 00:39:38,376
Here, Shen.

690
00:39:39,095 --> 00:39:40,135
Let's drink up.

691
00:39:40,695 --> 00:39:41,336
Cheers.

692
00:39:46,215 --> 00:39:46,856
My Lord.

693
00:39:48,255 --> 00:39:49,215
Why don't you join them?

694
00:39:50,976 --> 00:39:52,496
They are hanging out as peers.

695
00:39:53,135 --> 00:39:54,496
I shouldn't be a bother.

696
00:40:00,175 --> 00:40:03,175
While Official Mu is drinking
and chatting happily

697
00:40:03,416 --> 00:40:04,376
with other men,

698
00:40:05,016 --> 00:40:06,055
not only is His Lordship waiting alone,

699
00:40:06,615 --> 00:40:08,255
but he also has to secretly protect her.

700
00:40:16,976 --> 00:40:17,896
Drink another.

701
00:40:21,095 --> 00:40:22,615
Here. I'm feeding you.

702
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:25,535
Here.

703
00:40:32,936 --> 00:40:35,255
His Lordship is truly magnanimous.
