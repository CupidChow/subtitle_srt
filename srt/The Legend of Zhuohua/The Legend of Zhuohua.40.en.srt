96
00:07:05,081 --> 00:07:06,521
But I'll always remember

97
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:11,880
that in my darkest days,

98
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:15,000
she was the one who gave me the light,

99
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:18,201
pulled me out of the muck,

100
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,401
and showed me the path I had to take.

101
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:29,521
She's on the wrong track now,

102
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:34,880
but I don't want to see her perish.

103
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:39,041
This time,

104
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,480
I'll pull her out of the muck.

105
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,920
I don't believe it.

106
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,320
I don't believe a word of it.

107
00:08:16,081 --> 00:08:18,081
He's just a pawn of mine.

108
00:08:21,521 --> 00:08:23,800
How could he say he's going to save me?

109
00:08:25,761 --> 00:08:27,680
He has bitten off
more than he can chew.

110

Love?

111
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,600
I don't need it at all.

112
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,281
The only thing on my mind

113
00:08:55,445 --> 00:08:57,165
is the throne.

114
00:09:00,401 --> 00:09:01,041

115
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,840

116
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,881

117
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,121
All I've done

118
00:09:14,001 --> 00:09:16,041
is wish for the betterment
of this nation.

119
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,041
Tell me

120
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,920
what I can do.

121
00:09:24,401 --> 00:09:25,161
Your Highness,

122
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,881
you once asked me

123
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,361
if I thought I was on the right track.

124
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:35,840
Now,

125
00:09:37,361 --> 00:09:38,960
I'd like to ask you the same question.

126
00:09:45,521 --> 00:09:46,800
If you had helped me,

127
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:50,041
you wouldn't have had to ask me that.

128
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,200
I remember when I was little

129
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:00,001
and saw you for the first time,

130
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:03,200
you showed me a different picture,

131
00:10:04,361 --> 00:10:05,361
and made me determined

132
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:07,680
not to be a weak flower

133
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:09,800
but to be a fearless tree.

134
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,361
Then,

135
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,121
I came to the capital
in a terrible state.

136
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,521
When I was most helpless,

137
00:10:21,641 --> 00:10:22,401
you were

138
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,041
the first to lend me a helping hand.

139
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,840
Your encouragement

140
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,121
and trust

141
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,481
have given me great courage.

142
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,800
But later,

143
00:10:40,281 --> 00:10:41,960
you forgot your original intention,

144
00:10:44,241 --> 00:10:45,800
betrayed those who believed in you,

145
00:10:46,241 --> 00:10:47,560
and hurt innocent people.

146
00:10:49,521 --> 00:10:50,440
You told me

147
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,641
it's not easy being a woman,

148
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:56,001
and you want to make
Southern Chen a better place.

149
00:10:56,121 --> 00:10:59,281
You always say
you're doing it for others.

150
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,401
But now, it seems

151
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,361
you're doing everything

152
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,881
for yourself.

153
00:11:08,161 --> 00:11:10,320
Is this what you call the path
of becoming the Emperor?

154
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:13,080
Let me ask you.

155
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,881
If you were to save 10,000 people,

156
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,881
you had to kill 100 first.

157
00:11:20,481 --> 00:11:21,440
What would you do?

158
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,960
Your Highness,

159
00:11:26,241 --> 00:11:27,840
the fact
that you can ask such a question

160
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,481
means people of Southern Chen

161
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,761
are just the cornerstone
of your fame in the history

162
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:35,600
but not your people.

163
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:37,560
If that's the case,

164
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,960
how can you deserve to be the empress?

165
00:11:43,007 --> 00:11:44,566
It's easy for you onlookers
to make a comment.

166
00:11:46,241 --> 00:11:47,600
Have any emperors through the ages

167
00:11:49,641 --> 00:11:51,401
never sacrificed anyone else's life?

168
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:05,720
I have lost completely.

169
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:10,720
At this point,

170
00:12:13,161 --> 00:12:14,680
I have nothing else to say.

171
00:14:52,663 --> 00:14:57,218
(Lord Ding's Residence)

172
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:11,761
You're back.

173
00:15:20,121 --> 00:15:21,401
Your Lordship,

174
00:15:22,161 --> 00:15:23,560
I'm impressed

175
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,920
that you're setting an example

176
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,161
by working

177
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:30,161
while sick.

178
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,600
Look,

179
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,241
I'm feeling much better now.

180
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:50,481
That's good.

181
00:15:51,361 --> 00:15:54,440
It's about time for us
to settle some old scores.

182
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:02,720
Zhuohua,

183
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,440
you did find out about the jade pendant,

184
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,121
right?

185
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,840
(This is the jade pendant representing
love between me and His Lordship.)

186
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:26,881
(He promised me
that he'd take it with him all the time.)

187
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,200
(How could such an important item)

188
00:16:30,161 --> 00:16:31,080
(be left here?)

189
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,001
(Did he)

190
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,401
(leave it for me)

191
00:16:36,481 --> 00:16:37,200
(to tell me)

192
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,840
(he had another plan?)

193
00:16:39,881 --> 00:16:40,680
(That's great.)

194
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,161
(At least, he's still alive.)

195
00:16:44,161 --> 00:16:44,881
I knew

196
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:46,800
you'd realize my plan

197
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,881
when you saw the jade pendant.

198
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,600
Look,

199
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,440
we've

200
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,761
always shared the same mind.

201
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,001
So you and His Majesty

202
00:16:59,481 --> 00:17:02,161
started working together
after the Mid-Autumn Festival?

203
00:17:03,761 --> 00:17:04,441
Yes.

204
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:08,360
Your Majesty,

205
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,201
please play along with me.

206
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,640
I'll explain to you later.

207
00:17:19,481 --> 00:17:20,441
Greetings, Your Majesty.

208
00:17:20,921 --> 00:17:21,640
Uncle,

209
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:23,640
there's no one else here.

210
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,921
Just spare the formalities.

211
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:29,080
Uncle, why do you

212
00:17:29,241 --> 00:17:31,241
come to see me at this late hour?

213
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,560
Chen,

214
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:37,600
the death of your late father,

215
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,320
the death of the Grand Dowager Empress,

216
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,201
and the recent conflict
between you and the noble families

217
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:46,400
are all the result of someone
stirring up trouble behind your back

218
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,120
to seize the throne.

219
00:17:50,721 --> 00:17:51,560
Who is it?

220
00:17:54,521 --> 00:17:55,481
Your sister,

221
00:17:56,961 --> 00:17:58,241
Princess Roujia.

222
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,120
Are you kidding me?

223
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,800
On the night of your father's death,

224
00:18:17,921 --> 00:18:19,840
there was a mutiny in the palace.

225
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:24,320
So you've

226
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,761
suffered so much on your own.

227
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,080
Your Majesty,

228
00:18:31,001 --> 00:18:34,041
we need to stop Roujia
as soon as possible,

229
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,120
or there will be dire consequences.

230
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,080
Uncle,

231
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,201
what are you going to do?

232
00:18:43,241 --> 00:18:44,400
As before,

233
00:18:45,721 --> 00:18:47,320
you'll continue to work with me

234
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,320
to make it look like we're in conflict

235
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,880
and that we're not getting along,

236
00:18:52,521 --> 00:18:53,800
in order to get Roujia to drop her guard.

237
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,400
And those fights you had before

238
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,120
were all an act?

239
00:19:02,721 --> 00:19:03,441
Yes.

240
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,400
It's a pity that you aren't

241
00:19:08,761 --> 00:19:09,681
a stage actor.

242
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,001
It's fine for you to lie,

243
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,441
but even His Majesty has learned to lie.

244
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,360
When the time comes,

245
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,400
you'll put me in prison,

246
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,800
and then

247
00:19:28,721 --> 00:19:30,360
give me poisoned wine.

248
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,320
No way.

249
00:19:32,481 --> 00:19:34,400
How could I risk your life?

250
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,441
No way.

251
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,241
Roujia's got a lot of patience

252
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,721
and is cautious in everything she does.

253
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,721
If I don't die,

254
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:47,400
she won't make a move.

255
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,120
Your Majesty,

256
00:19:57,761 --> 00:19:58,921
this is Soul-deadening Powder.

257
00:19:59,921 --> 00:20:02,800
After taking it,
I'll be in a dying state.

258
00:20:03,281 --> 00:20:04,761
That will definitely fool Roujia.

259
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,840
This is too dangerous.

260
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,600
Your Majesty,

261
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:15,681
under such circumstances,

262
00:20:16,001 --> 00:20:17,400
we have no choice.

263
00:20:17,721 --> 00:20:19,120
It's a dangerous plan.

264
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,880
If something goes wrong,
it could cost me my life.

265
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:26,041
I'm sure Zhuohua won't
allow me to take the risk.

266
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,560
That's why

267
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,441
we can't tell her.

268
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,160
So when are you going to let her know?

269
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,400
I have my own way of reassuring her.

270
00:20:40,721 --> 00:20:41,521
Chen,

271
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,721
once this plan is implemented,

272
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,840
you'll lose all the men on your side.

273
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,961
Since you're not afraid,

274
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,041
what's there for me to be afraid of?

275
00:21:00,001 --> 00:21:02,800
There was Soul-deadening Powder
in the wine?

276
00:21:07,761 --> 00:21:08,761
I've read about Soul-deadening Powder

277
00:21:10,201 --> 00:21:12,080
in medical books before.

278
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,201
This drug is so strong

279
00:21:14,681 --> 00:21:15,800
that it will really make someone

280
00:21:16,961 --> 00:21:19,160
fall into a state of dying.

281
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,840
His whole body will be paralyzed,

282
00:21:21,441 --> 00:21:22,560
and he will lose all his breath.

283
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:24,281
And there's a good chance

284
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:26,160
that the person who takes it

285
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,921
won't wake up again.

286
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,320
Even if he does,

287
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,560
he'll be seriously injured.

288
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,041
How could you take such a bet?

289
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,320
Look,

290
00:21:45,201 --> 00:21:47,640
I won the bet.

291
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:50,640
After I faked my death,

292
00:21:51,281 --> 00:21:52,521
Roujia had no more scruples

293
00:21:53,481 --> 00:21:54,201
and became

294
00:21:55,001 --> 00:21:56,640
blatant in her actions.

295
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,880
She joined forces with the Zhou family
to force His Majesty to abdicate.

296
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:03,481
And it gave us a good reason
to send troops.

297
00:22:04,481 --> 00:22:07,360
Did His Majesty approve of your use
of the Soul-deadening Powder?

298
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,800
His Majesty had no choice.

299
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,281
Uncle,

300
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,120
why are your hands so cold?

301
00:22:18,961 --> 00:22:20,001
It's been three days.

302
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,521
Why haven't you woken up?

303
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,600
It's so dangerous.

304
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:31,241
I shouldn't have agreed with you

305
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,041
in the first place.

306
00:22:41,001 --> 00:22:41,761
Chen,

307
00:22:43,241 --> 00:22:44,120
don't cry.

308
00:22:46,201 --> 00:22:46,961
Uncle.

309
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:51,961
Uncle.

310
00:22:56,961 --> 00:22:58,880
What took you so long to wake up?

311
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,441
Let's not talk about that now.

312
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,921
Your Majesty,

313
00:23:10,481 --> 00:23:12,761
I'd appreciate it
if you'd arrange something for me.

314
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:17,120
I have to head to the camp
of Cangwu Army right away.

315
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:18,761
Uncle,

316
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,961
you should at least get some rest.

317
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,961
There's no time for that.

318
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,681
Do you know how worried I was about you?

319
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,241
So

320
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,761
I could only tell you

321
00:23:42,201 --> 00:23:43,360
that I was alive.

322
00:23:47,681 --> 00:23:49,441
You could call me paranoid.

323
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,600
What if His Majesty
believed Shen Jinghong,

324
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:54,921
was mad at you,
and wanted to kill you

325
00:23:55,681 --> 00:23:56,721
because of the late Emperor's death?

326
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,761
I watched him grow up.

327
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,320
He's arrogant and willful,

328
00:24:05,201 --> 00:24:06,721
but he's kind.

329
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,481
I trust him.

330
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,560
Besides,

331
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,840
I've escaped the jaws of death
more than once.

332
00:24:16,961 --> 00:24:18,761
But as long as you're with me,

333
00:24:19,481 --> 00:24:20,800
I'll come back safely.

334
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,241
You only live once,

335
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,921
but you bet your hat.

336
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,840
What if something went wrong?

337
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,201
Remember this.

338
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,880
If you ever

339
00:24:32,521 --> 00:24:34,800
risk your life again,

340
00:24:35,961 --> 00:24:37,241
I'll never forgive you.

341
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:38,921
I won't,

342
00:24:40,761 --> 00:24:41,721
and I dare not.

343
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,840
I hope

344
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,600
to spend the rest of my life

345
00:25:03,241 --> 00:25:04,521
with you.

346
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,921
What brings you here?

347
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,961
I have something to tell you.

348
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,160
You came to tell me...

349
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,880
I like you.

350
00:25:53,281 --> 00:25:54,241
Who likes me?

351
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,961
I mean me.

352
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,560
I like you.

353
00:25:59,201 --> 00:26:00,120
I know.

354
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,681
You knew?

355
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,041
I know.

356
00:26:04,201 --> 00:26:06,320
You like me as much as
His Lordship likes Young Lady.

357
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:07,800
I

358
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:09,840
will be nice to you.

359
00:26:11,481 --> 00:26:13,201
You're nice enough to me now.

360
00:26:13,961 --> 00:26:15,921
I'll be nicer to you.

361
00:26:17,241 --> 00:26:18,120
Much nicer.

362
00:26:19,281 --> 00:26:20,921
Then I'll be nicer to you, too.

363
00:26:21,721 --> 00:26:22,521
Much nicer.

364
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,721
Greetings, Your Majesty.

365
00:27:20,481 --> 00:27:24,160
Ms. Mu, you're so late.

366
00:27:25,681 --> 00:27:28,360
I'm not used to you being so respectful

367
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,560
of your teacher.

368
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,160
I didn't know you to be so vindictive.

369
00:27:40,681 --> 00:27:42,320
Looking back on the past,

370
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:45,721
don't you think
you went a little too far?

371
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,080
Yes, a little.

372
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,120
Only a little?

373
00:27:55,001 --> 00:27:55,840
I went too far.

374
00:27:58,201 --> 00:28:00,961
I was too young

375
00:28:01,521 --> 00:28:03,201
and foolish
to reflect on myself back then,

376
00:28:04,521 --> 00:28:05,681
and I'm ashamed

377
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,921
to recall it now.

378
00:28:10,001 --> 00:28:11,640
You've really matured.

379
00:28:15,681 --> 00:28:16,921
You and I

380
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,721
are first teacher and student,

381
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:23,800
then emperor and official.

382
00:28:25,201 --> 00:28:26,120
Now,

383
00:28:27,761 --> 00:28:28,600
I can't even see you

384
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:33,041
as my official.

385
00:28:37,201 --> 00:28:38,201
If I'm not an official of yours,

386
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:39,921
what am I?

387
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,080
Uncle has already submitted a request

388
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,880
to resign as Prince Regent,

389
00:28:50,761 --> 00:28:53,360
and your transfer papers
will be issued soon.

390
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,640
You're going to the border, aren't you?

391
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,320
Yes.

392
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,080
I plan to go to the fiefdom
with His Lordship

393
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:07,761
to try the policy
of strengthening the borders.

394
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,800
If this policy is really effective,

395
00:29:10,201 --> 00:29:11,400
it will solve a major problem
for Southern Chen

396
00:29:11,721 --> 00:29:13,640
without any bloodshed.

397
00:29:16,961 --> 00:29:18,241
If it works,

398
00:29:19,761 --> 00:29:21,001
you'll be the greatest contributor.

399
00:29:23,281 --> 00:29:24,640
I'm just a civil official.

400
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,120
If this policy

401
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,241
can really stop the war at the border

402
00:29:29,521 --> 00:29:30,521
and bring peace to the world,

403
00:29:31,441 --> 00:29:34,041
it's the credit of the people
at the border,

404
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:35,640
the officers' and soldiers',

405
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,880
as well as yours.

406
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,120
You don't have to drag me into this.

407
00:29:48,681 --> 00:29:49,400
Your Majesty,

408
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,681
you don't have to belittle yourself.

409
00:29:54,201 --> 00:29:56,241
In the case
of Princess Roujia's treason,

410
00:29:57,241 --> 00:29:58,360
everyone said

411
00:29:58,921 --> 00:30:01,101
that Prince Regent is
a man of great integrity

412
00:30:01,102 --> 00:30:02,201
who disregarded his safety.

413
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:08,360
But in my eyes,

414
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,560
you are also a man of honor and patience,

415
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,521
persevering for a greater good.

416
00:30:14,241 --> 00:30:15,360
You bode your time,

417
00:30:16,041 --> 00:30:17,120
pretended to be an incompetent ruler,

418
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,800
were spurned by the world,

419
00:30:19,241 --> 00:30:20,481
misunderstood by the people,

420
00:30:21,481 --> 00:30:22,521
and suffered

421
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:25,080
the pain of possibly losing your uncle.

422
00:30:26,441 --> 00:30:27,400
Please forgive me for being frank.

423
00:30:28,761 --> 00:30:29,880
In the past,

424
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,080
you might have been weak.

425
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,281
But now,

426
00:30:37,521 --> 00:30:38,681
you will certainly be a wise ruler.

427
00:30:47,761 --> 00:30:48,921
Are you

428
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,560
flattering me?

429
00:31:13,521 --> 00:31:14,281
Jiao,

430
00:31:17,761 --> 00:31:19,400
you and I went against each other.

431
00:31:22,241 --> 00:31:23,600
You lost and died,

432
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,640
but I

433
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,600
dare not call myself a winner.

434
00:31:31,521 --> 00:31:32,320
I

435
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,080
will choose
the right people for the job

436
00:31:37,441 --> 00:31:38,640
and rule the nation in order.

437
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,640
I don't wish to achieve

438
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,840
great things

439
00:31:52,281 --> 00:31:55,201
but only wish to live up
to the expectations of the people

440
00:31:58,521 --> 00:31:59,600
and the nation.

441
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:23,961
Jiao,

442
00:32:25,281 --> 00:32:28,560
I'm taking you home,

443
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,360
away from politics,

444
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,721
to be at peace,

445
00:32:35,761 --> 00:32:39,120
and to be with those you love.

446
00:32:51,281 --> 00:32:53,160
Why do you want to be by my side?

447
00:32:54,761 --> 00:32:56,041
I didn't have any plans

448
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,600
when I was following His Lordship.

449
00:32:58,481 --> 00:32:59,681
Everything was guided by him.

450
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,441
Now, I want to try to be on my own.

451
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:04,681
That's true.

452
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,800
Uncle and Zhimo have a lover by their side.
