=The Legend of Zhuohua=

17
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,860
(Adapted from "She Was Once
a Playful Soul" by Sui Yu Er An)

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,940
=Episode 8=

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
(This is a work of fiction.)

20
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,070
By the way,

21
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,630
back then, Xue Xiaotang
passed away unexpectedly

22
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,110
and you insisted on
being in mourning for him.

23
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,270
Now that the five-year mourning
is up soon,

24
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,990
what's your plan?

25
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:02,910
Father,

26
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,630
I suddenly remember

27
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,350
that tomorrow
is the Floral Poetry Gathering.

28
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,190
I need to go back and prepare.

29
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,270
All right.

30
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,190
You may go.

31
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,430
That was captivating.

32
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:53,910
Help yourselves to the food.

33
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,510
I feel honored to be able

34
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,990
to witness
their graceful dance performance.

35
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,270
Then drink more!

36
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,790
Here.

37
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,150
Let me pour you some more.

38
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:01,910
Come and enjoy the drinks.

39
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,190
- Drink up.
- Juli.

40
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,230
Drink up. You must drink.

41
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:04,750
Here.

42
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:05,830
- Congratulations!
- Cheers!

43
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,670
Congratulations to you.

44
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,630
Thank you. Thank you very much.

45
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,190
Congratulations.

46
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:08,910
Thank you very much.

47
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,550
Listen.

48
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,270
It's all thanks to you

49
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:21,590
that the value of my courtyard
is rising.

50
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,590
I can't take credit for that.

51
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,470
Look at Madam Lu.

52
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,830
She must be quite drunk.

53
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,310
Look how she's spilling her thoughts.

54
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,510
Come on, drink more.

55
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,070
It's such a joyful day.

56
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,190
Cheers.

57
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,550
(Mother, I've passed
the metropolitan examination.)

58
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,190
(Are you seeing this?)

59
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,630
(I am one step closer)

60
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,870
(to my dream.)

61
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:17,790
Young Lady,

62
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,950
someone's here.

63
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:21,910
All right.

64
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,470
You are...

65
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,870
Are you Miss Mu?

66
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:28,830
Yes, I am.

67
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,590
I'm Man. I serve Her Highness,
Princess Roujia.

68
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,670
Miss Mu,

69
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,750
the Princess is hosting
Floral Poetry Gathering

70
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,830
at the imperial garden tomorrow.

71
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,190
She heard you've brought honor to women

72
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,230
by ranking seventeenth
in the metropolitan examination.

73
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,230
She sent me here
to extend an invitation to you.

74
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,070
Accept it.

75
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,990
Thank you, miss.

76
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,590
- It's from Princess Roujia!
- An invitation from Princess Roujia!

77
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,510
Let's read what it says.

78
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:58,710
Young Lady.

79
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,910
(Invitation)

80
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:00,510
Young Lady,

81
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,190
do you think your poem

82
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,110
is up to par?

83
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,190
I...

84
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:10,950
You're right about that.

85
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,070
My poem is...

86
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,270
My Lord,

87
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,310
we obtained new clues
on the Revival Powder.

88
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,870
Fu Shengru, the former head
of the Imperial Academy of Medicine,

89
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,470
had developed a new medicine.

90
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,190
According to the records
of the Imperial Dispensary,

91
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,990
he used a significant amount
of Immortal Fruits.

92
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,110
Was Fu Shengru

93
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,030
the imperial physician
whose property was confiscated

94
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,390
after my mother's tragic death
during childbirth?

95
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:41,670
That's right.

96
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,830
He joined the Imperial Academy of Medicine
in the 25th year of the Yuanguang reign.

97
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,910
In the third year of the Tongtai reign,
he was promoted to the academy's head.

98
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,310
He later committed suicide
because his treatment of Consort Yun

99
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,270
was lacking.

100
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,350
After his death, his family's property
was also ransacked.

101
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,910
Why weren't the other
involved imperial physicians' properties

102
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,030
confiscated?

103
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,190
Perhaps, because he was the head,

104
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,190
he had to take
the primary responsibility.

105
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,550
Your reasoning makes sense.

106
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,110
However,

107
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,750
I think there's more

108
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,230
to this matter.

109
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,910
My Lord, are you suspecting

110
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,950
that the mastermind behind this
took advantage

111
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,550
of the late Emperor's fury
over Consort Yun's death

112
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,430
to hide some unspeakable secrets

113
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,190
and also destroy crucial evidence?

114
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,190
My Lord,

115
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,870
Mu Zhuohua's background
appears to be genuine.

116
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,550
There was nothing suspicious

117
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:43,950
during our trip to Tiantong Mountain.

118
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,350
Could it be that she has no connection
with the mastermind?

119
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,150
Do you actually

120
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,150
hope she's connected to the mastermind?

121
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,630
Well, I...

122
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,670
I only want

123
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,390
to find the mastermind quickly.

124
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:01,990
If she's an enemy,

125
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,790
we can gather clues from her.

126
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,910
She may not be directly involved in this.

127
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,950
But she has helped me clear up
quite a bit of confusion

128
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,070
and unravel the situation for me.

129
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,390
You're not really considering
having her work for you, are you?

130
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,390
I'm in a position
where dangers are everywhere.

131
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,070
And she's afraid of death.

132
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,670
So I won't.

133
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,510
Inform He Xin

134
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,190
to hasten

135
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,590
and personally go to Jiangnan.

136
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,350
Jinghong.

137
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,150
Sun.

138
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,510
Jinghong, you're finally here.

139
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,510
I'm Fang Zhiyuan.

140
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,550
I ranked tenth in this year's
national examination.

141
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,150
Shen, you ranked first in all subjects
and won first place.

142
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,270
I'm truly impressed.

143
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:18,990
You're flattering me, Fang.

144
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,350
Jinghong, let's sit over here.

145
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,190
I heard a group of matchmakers

146
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,630
were chasing you that day.

147
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,830
I wonder if you've picked
any matchmakers.

148
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,510
Please stop joking about this.

149
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,230
How can I consider getting married

150
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,430
when I haven't achieved success?

151
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,670
You achieved top scores
in two consecutive imperial exams.

152
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,470
How can you call that not a success?

153
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,990
I will not consider marriage

154
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,790
if I'm not a first-ranked official.

155
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,910
Oh, of course, your ambitions
are still sky-high.

156
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,430
It made us feel truly ashamed.

157
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,950
Stop joking about Shen already.

158
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,670
Jinghong, just ignore them.

159
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,390
Let's drink.

160
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,150
Everyone, enjoy your drinks.

161
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,390
He's nothing but an opportunist.

162
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,710
Sun Yunqian's father

163
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,430
is the Minister of Works, Sun Ru.

164
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,030
By the way,

165
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,910
have any of you seen
the other peculiar person on the list?

166
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,230
Are you referring

167
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,270
to Mu Zhuohua who ranked seventeenth?

168
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,110
Exactly.

169
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,750
This is the highest ranking
for a female participant

170
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,910
in the examination.

171
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,310
I remember Mu Zhuohua.

172
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,950
She excelled in the Classics subject
just like Shen.

173
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,150
The Classics?

174
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,750
But there were only two perfect papers
in the Classics.

175
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,470
Rote memorization
is enough for the Classics.

176
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,630
True talents

177
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,630
are shown in poetry
and political discourse.

178
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,710
Her poetry is average,

179
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,030
and her political discourse
are slightly above average.

180
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,030
There are one hundred candidates
this year.

181
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,550
Out of the one hundred candidates,

182
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,910
ninety-nine of them

183
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,430
advocated war.

184
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,710
They all answered,
"Eradicate enemies on the border."

185
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,710
But there's one paper
that scored as the second-highest tier

186
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,750
that advocates peace

187
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,470
and answered,
"Nurture enemies on the border."

188
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:10,830
Advocating peace?

189
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,790
With Northern Liang?

190
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,190
Northern Liang invades
our Southern Chen borders.

191
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,070
Their treacherous intentions
never cease.

192
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,470
How can we submit
to such humiliating negotiations?

193
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,270
How can such a paper

194
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,790
score the second-highest tier?

195
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,830
Don't you all agree?

196
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:22,710
Can someone like this

197
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,590
truly care about our country's future?

198
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,830
"Nurture enemies on the border"?

199
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,990
I can't believe she actually wrote this
as her answer.

200
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,670
That's how narrow-minded

201
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,750
an ordinary woman is.

202
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:39,590
Jinghong,

203
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,870
what do you think?

204
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,150
I think

205
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:46,150
Ms. Mu's essay is very interesting

206
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,030
and insightful too.

207
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,470
Jinghong, why would you say that?

208
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,110
Only those who fear death

209
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,070
would write such a strategy.

210
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,590
A true man

211
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,790
should stand upright.

212
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,950
Advocating peace
doesn't mean fear of death.

213
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,390
Appeasing others
without resorting to warfare

214
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,590
is the wisest course.

215
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,390
Those Northern Liang people

216
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,470
are resolute and willing to die
than submit.

217
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,070
For a woman,

218
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,550
fear to lose her life is common.

219
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,510
It's not surprising she advocates peace.

220
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,310
Women are born delicate and vulnerable.

221
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,430
This world of politics and warfare

222
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,150
has no place for them, to begin with.

223
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,550
Mu Zhuohua is probably

224
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,910
too afraid to come today.

225
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,630
With her poetic talent,

226
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,310
attending would likely
be an embarrassment.

227
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,950
A woman

228
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,070
(Nurture enemies on the border)
mingling with men,

229
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,670
that is truly inappropriate.

230
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,430
It will also compromise her virtue
as a woman.

231
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,790
- You're right.
- That's right.

232
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,190
What ill fortune.

233
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,510
Why worry about ill fortune
when you're not marrying her?

234
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,710
I heard Oriental magpies singing joyfully
early this morning.

235
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,910
I knew it was a sign of good news.

236
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:51,790
Indeed,

237
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,830
I could already hear people talking

238
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,390
about me from afar.

239
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,150
I, Mu Zhuohua,

240
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,830
am honored of meeting my peers.

241
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,510
Ms. Mu.

242
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:15,710
Shen,

243
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,870
congratulations
on securing the top rank.

244
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,990
In the Wenzheng Parlor,
I had the privilege

245
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,470
of witnessing your remarkable elegance.

246
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,590
Truly talented and remarkable,

247
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,750
unaffected by gossip,

248
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,070
and not conforming to mediocrity.

249
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,390
Truly admirable.

250
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,310
Ms. Mu, you're flattering me.

251
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,790
Ignorant woman.

252
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,070
Who are you calling mediocre?

253
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,430
She's on the list by pure luck.

254
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,710
Yet, she dares to boast in front of us.

255
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:44,670
I...

256
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,270
Do you think she'll lose to them?

257
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:53,910
Excuse me,

258
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,510
I was only complimenting Shen.

259
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:57,990
How come it's boasting?

260
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,510
I accept being called a woman.

261
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,350
But I'm puzzled

262
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,790
about being called ignorant.

263
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,030
I studied hard

264
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,190
and sit for the examination
with my ability.

265
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,270
After being evaluated
by the esteemed examiners,

266
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,270
I managed to pass the examination.

267
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,510
How can that be labeled as ignorance?

268
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,270
Oh, I get it now.

269
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,030
If you put it this way,

270
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:25,990
it seems I'm not a "master of both
literary and martial arts."

271
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,190
You...

272
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,550
Well said.

273
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,430
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Highness.

274
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,350
You may drop the formalities.

275
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,670
I'm not talented.

276
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,230
It's all thanks to your presence

277
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,190
that I'm able
to host the Floral Poetry Gathering.

278
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,830
Your Highness,
you possess both virtue and talent.

279
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,630
You're a model for women everywhere.

280
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,790
Do you know me that well?

281
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,550
All you did

282
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,670
is hear some things about me

283
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,150
and concluded

284
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,310
that I am virtuous and talented.

285
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,590
But when it comes to Miss Mu,

286
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,350
you assumed she lacked talent and virtue

287
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,550
when you heard that she's a woman

288
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,830
with a humble background.

289
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,310
- Forgive us, Your Highness.
- Forgive us, Your Highness.

290
00:14:58,990 --> 00:14:59,990
What is the level of your knowledge

291
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,030
compared to the examiners?

292
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,190
- We are inferior.
- We are inferior.

293
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,630
Since you're aware of that,

294
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,950
why do you question
the examiners' judgment?

295
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,070
In terms of talent,

296
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,870
I'm not comparable to all of you.

297
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,230
To avoid facing public criticism

298
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,310
and gossip,

299
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,590
I can step down from being the host.

300
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,630
You can consider me here
to enjoy the flowers.

301
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,550
The rest of you may carry on
as you wish.

302
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,470
Your Highness, please calm down.

303
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,030
The fault lies

304
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,350
with me today.

305
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:53,630
Indeed.

306
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,270
As the principal graduate,

307
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,190
you lead everyone.

308
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,630
If you were impartial

309
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,510
and set an example,

310
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,830
they wouldn't act improperly

311
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,750
and unjustly criticize a young lady.

312
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,910
Your Highness's advice is wise.

313
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,150
We read countless books

314
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,510
but cannot compare
to Your Highness's experiences.

315
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,070
We studied the words of sages.

316
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,790
Yet, we fail to comprehend
their meanings.

317
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,030
I'm fortunate to have learned
from Your Highness.

318
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,790
Your words hit me

319
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,030
like a wake-up call.

320
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,270
What Mu Zhuohua said earlier was true.

321
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,310
Your disrespect towards her

322
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,990
not only questions her talent

323
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,390
but also challenges
the examiners' integrity

324
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,750
and the court's fairness.

325
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,510
This Floral Poetry Gathering
is widely watched.

326
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,310
Do you really think
I'm the only one here today?

327
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,550
If this matter gets out,

328
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,830
what will become of your reputation

329
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,670
and future?

330
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:06,470
Chen,

331
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,030
don't forget.

332
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,950
We're just here to watch.

333
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,030
Jiao is biased
toward that female candidate.

334
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,430
I can't sit by and do nothing anymore.

335
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,390
The court is capable of tolerating
when being questioned.

336
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,510
Besides, Mu Zhuohua's ranking

337
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,750
is indeed debatable.

338
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,110
We're in luck.

339
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,830
First Prince and Lord Ding

340
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,070
are speaking up for us.

341
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,190
First Prince isn't siding with us.

342
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,070
He's clearly unhappy about Princess
criticizing Shen Jinghong.

343
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,830
Greetings, Your Highness.
Greetings, Lord Ding.

344
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,790
Since the rankings
have already been announced,

345
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,790
how can you say they're debatable?

346
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,590
Her essay

347
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,790
has poor intent

348
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:46,750
and is full of nonsense.

349
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,110
Greetings, Uncle.

350
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,670
Greetings, Lord Ding.

351
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,910
This is my answer.

352
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,190
(Isn't this the small fry
at Wenzheng Parlor)

353
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,030
(that Uncle was interested in?)

354
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,670
(Uncle seems to have
a special interest in her.)

355
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:28,510
Oh,

356
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,310
it's just during the grading,

357
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,430
a few examiners had some differences.

358
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,790
Isn't that right, Uncle?

359
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,310
You end what you started.

360
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,830
Don't drag me into this.

361
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,310
Today is the Floral Poetry Gathering.

362
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,110
You're all here to compose
and recite poems.

363
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,150
Don't let our presence

364
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,910
get in your fun.

365
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,390
If it weren't for your bias,

366
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,870
I wouldn't have come.

367
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,230
Who is biased?

368
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,990
They haven't even read her essay.

369
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,430
Yet, they criticize her gender

370
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:05,710
and background.

371
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:09,150
Do you think this is fair,
Your Highness?

372
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,390
These people are biased.

373
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,390
But Shen Jinghong didn't judge.

374
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,950
Why did you scold him so harshly?

375
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,230
As the top scorer,

376
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,510
he should set an example.

377
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,750
If he can't set an example,
then he's not worthy of being first.

378
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,750
Since he's in a high position,

379
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,990
it's natural
to have higher expectations.

380
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,790
You always have reasons for everything.

381
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:33,870
Uncle,

382
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,550
what do you think?

383
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,710
Human nature is naturally biased.

384
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,870
To see past someone's appearance

385
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:41,950
and identity

386
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,590
is indeed difficult.

387
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,270
Uncle's words make sense.

388
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,550
Previous Floral Poetry Gatherings
were about flowers.

389
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,710
Everyone composed poems individually

390
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,270
and was judged by people.

391
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,550
Then, some would ingratiate themselves
with influential people.

392
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,030
This also lacks fairness in judgment.

393
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,030
Today's event might be better
if we follow the examination format.

394
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,870
Everyone anonymously writes poems.

395
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,230
One person will read them

396
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,310
and let everyone judge.

397
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,350
What do you think?

398
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:13,630
Who's hosting this, you or me?

399
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,950
You, of course.

400
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,870
So, did you set these new rules

401
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,830
just for entertainment?

402
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,150
Since Uncle and I are here,

403
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,910
we'll naturally participate.

404
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,030
I'm just curious

405
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,430
about what rewards you prepared.

406
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,550
Do what you want.

407
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,630
I'm hosting the Floral Poetry Gathering.

408
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,750
Of course, I've prepared some rewards.

409
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,510
Everyone, please take your seats.

410
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:31,790
My Lord.

411
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,030
When one overachieves,
one will invite trouble.

412
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,910
Keep a low profile.

413
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,310
I shall remember Your Lordship's advice.

414
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,510
What's the matter?

415
00:21:59,190 --> 00:21:59,910
Uncle,

416
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,230
I'm going to prove

417
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:02,950
to you

418
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,030
that the person I've chosen

419
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,030
will be more exceptional than that girl.

420
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,750
I shall wait and see.

421
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,990
(With His Lordship's
striking appearance,)

422
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,790
(it wasn't my fault to mistake him)

423
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,270
(for a male prostitute back then.)

424
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,950
Today's poetry gathering's theme

425
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,630
is peonies.

426
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,230
The reward

427
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,870
shall be this
Green Dragon Rests in the Ink Pond.

428
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,910
As for the other reward,

429
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,190
it shall be

430
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,990
the "Chronicles of Cangling".

431
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,470
"Chronicles of Cangling"?

432
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,230
"Chronicles of Cangling"?

433
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:51,070
(It's the final work of Mr. Cangling.)

434
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:52,750
(There's only one copy in this world.)

435
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,790
(I can't believe
it's the reward for today.)

436
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,110
(If "Chronicles of Cangling"
is the reward,)

437
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,630
(I don't mind being like a bird
that dies in pursuit of food.)

438
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:08,590
Come here.

439
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:17,230
(My Lord, please forgive me.)

440
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,550
(I can't keep a low profile.)

441
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,310
Ms. Mu.

442
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,550
His Lordship says you'll write better
if you're not hungry.

443
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,190
Thank you.

444
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,990
(Just like a starving squirrel.)

445
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,710
(His Lordship and First Prince
sure have a lot of free time.)

446
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:25,950
(Their presence)

447
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,370
(has turned the poetry gathering)

448
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:28,790
(into the complex world
of government officials.)

449
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,030
(They're just making things worse.)

450
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,270
Time's up!

451
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,230
(I struggled to come up
with these four lines.)

452
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,750
(I really want to win
the "Chronicles of Cangling.")

453
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,950
(I must find a way.)

454
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:47,790
Thank you.

455
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,190
I'm sure

456
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,830
you'll win first place.

457
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,950
There are strengths and weaknesses
in everything.

458
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,750
One must remain humble
to have achievements.

459
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,230
Arrogance leads to failure
in most things.

460
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:08,550
Understanding others is wisdom,
and knowing oneself is enlightenment.

461
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,990
Did you write
that borderland poem today?

462
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,750
Today,

463
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,390
I wrote about
blooming Yulan magnolia flowers.

464
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,430
A good poem

465
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,270
needs the right person to read them

466
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,310
to truly appreciate their essence.

467
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:35,710
Then...

468
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,550
Mu Zhuohua,

469
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:40,870
why don't you do it?

470
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,630
Yes, Your Highness.

471
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:56,830
Your Highness.

472
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,030
I lack poetic talent

473
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,630
and cannot compose a good poem.

474
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,230
I'm here at Her Highness's command

475
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,230
to read a poem for everyone.

476
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,550
Number one.

477
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:21,150
"As peonies fade,
apricot blossoms bloom.

478
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:24,950
Peonies overshadow the green moss.

479
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:28,430
I resent the heartless willow trees.

480
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:33,230
Lonely mountains frequently
host monkeys at night".

481
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,710
Number five.

482
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,150
"Born with golden and jade-like petals.

483
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,870
Partial to the old village.

484
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,910
When will we reunite?

485
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:53,830
Safe within my thoughts of longing."

486
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,310
This one is good.

487
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,510
I wrote it.

488
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,030
Number fifteen.

489
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:19,030
"Rosy clouds accumulate like gold,

490
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,750
a cluster of red tassels

491
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,510
embellishes the landscape."

492
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,750
The choice of words
and sentence construction

493
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,750
is quite straightforward and rough.

494
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:35,590
- Indeed.
- It's not good enough.

495
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:41,030
"Facing hardships on horseback,

496
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:47,030
a clean administration brings peace."

497
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:51,710
Uncle.

498
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:55,830
It's nothing.

499
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,030
This is undoubtedly His Lordship's poem.

500
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,790
This is likely the first-ever

501
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,150
borderland peony poem in history.

502
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,230
Indeed.

503
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,190
This is groundbreaking,

504
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,310
creating a new style.

505
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:11,830
Absolutely.

506
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:18,630
Uncle,

507
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,150
is this poem really that good?

508
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,630
I somehow feel

509
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,830
it's not as good as the fifth one.

510
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,870
The one with "Born with golden
and jade-like petals."

511
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,110
Number thirteen.

512
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,870
"Countless flowers vie for beauty,

513
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:40,470
new branches are delicate
and pristine as frost."

514
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,910
Now, let's announce the voting results.

515
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,710
Number five.

516
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,670
Ms. Mu.

517
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:52,270
Number fifteen.

518
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,390
Reading the poems was quite a task.

519
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:56,670
Number fifteen.

520
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,030
Number one.

521
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:05,910
Number three.

522
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,470
- Number five.
- Please have some tea.

523
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,630
Number fifteen.

524
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,670
Thank you, My Lord.

525
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:20,990
Number fifteen.

526
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,230
Number five.

527
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:30,750
Number fifteen.

528
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:36,190
(Did he notice
that I took advantage of him?)

529
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,310
Number fifteen.

530
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,310
Number fifteen.

531
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,470
Number fifteen.

532
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:49,950
Number fifteen.

533
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:53,750
Number one.

534
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:56,710
Number thirteen.

535
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:01,510
Number fifteen.

536
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:09,870
We have the results.

537
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,350
The winner is the author
of poem number fifteen.

538
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,790
So now,

539
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:17,110
let's have the author
of this poem step forward.

540
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,070
It must be His Lordship's poem.

541
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,990
It has to be.

542
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,510
Yes, definitely His Lordship.

543
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:24,510
Uncle, you won.

544
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,910
Of course, it's the outcome I desired.

545
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:27,470
It doesn't matter.

546
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:31,110
But you don't usually
compose poems this bad, Uncle.

547
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:33,870
I wrote

548
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,590
that poem.

549
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:39,910
Mu Zhuohua?

550
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,030
How could this be?

551
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:43,950
How is that her poem?

552
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,030
Truly a talented woman.

553
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,510
Congratulations.

554
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,670
This year's winner
for Floral Poetry Gathering

555
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,910
is you.

556
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:58,030
The Green Dragon Ink Pool
and the "Chronicles of Cangling"

557
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,550
are yours.

558
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:02,710
Thank you, Your Highness.

559
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,190
Gosh, that's the "Chronicles of Cangling".

560
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,110
How could it...

561
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,830
How could this poem win first place?

562
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,630
Are these people blind or foolish?

563
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:21,470
Perhaps being too clever
has led them astray.

564
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:22,990
Don't you understand yet?

565
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,110
In fact,

566
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:27,950
we should've never come today.

567
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:30,870
To be honest,

568
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,510
it's truly hard to comprehend

569
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,110
that today's winner isn't you.

570
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,310
Circumstances and luck play a role.

571
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:36,830
Winning also depends on fate.

572
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,230
Congratulations, Ms. Mu.

573
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,150
Shen.

574
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,470
I envy you

575
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,110
for getting hold of the unique copy
of "Chronicles of Cangling".

576
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:54,550
Shen, rest assured.

577
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,950
I will lend it to you.

578
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,310
In that case,

579
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,310
I'll thank you in advance.

580
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,110
Shen,

581
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,510
I...

582
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,910
I wonder if I am the first person

583
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,310
who has won against you
in a poetry contest.

584
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,310
(How come she does not know)

585
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,470
(how she got)

586
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:11,390
(first place?)

587
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:12,590
Yes, you're the first.

588
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,310
You're a literary genius.

589
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,390
I'm truly impressed.

590
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:18,830
Really?

591
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,750
If so, it's indeed an honor.

592
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,110
Thank you, Shen.

593
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,630
This poetry contest today

594
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:37,670
is truly unfair.

595
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,790
Weren't the rules changed
according to your wishes?

596
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:41,830
But...

597
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,350
How could Mu Zhuohua win first place
with her talent and ability?

598
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,230
The people's choice.

599
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,030
We have to acknowledge it.

600
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,830
Uncle, say something.

601
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,350
This is a matter for you young folks.

602
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,830
What does it have to do with me?

603
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:04,230
You're so protective of Shen Jinghong.

604
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,950
Is it to let everyone know
he's under your wing?

605
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,190
What if they do know?

606
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:11,790
I know your love for talent.

607
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:15,910
But Shen Jinghong is wild and unruly.

608
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,750
You need to be cautious.

609
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,230
How is Shen Jinghong wild and unruly?

610
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:22,510
Jiao,

611
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,230
you misjudge people.

612
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:26,590
But Mu Zhuohua

613
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:28,710
can be considered a talented individual.

614
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,150
She has unique ideas

615
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:32,430
and eloquent speech.

616
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,190
In the palace examination,

617
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:37,150
she might even gain Father's favor

618
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,950
and be listed among the top scholars.

619
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:42,630
I didn't expect
that you actually admire her so much.

620
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:46,070
She has some likable cunning thoughts.

621
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,590
Indeed, she's quite endearing.

622
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,790
Even Shen Jinghong

623
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,790
treats her differently.

624
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:53,750
In my opinion,

625
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:55,670
her admission to the Hanlin Academy

626
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,630
is almost certain.

627
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,110
Mu Zhuohua is just being opportunistic
and playing it safe.

628
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,590
She's also fearful of death.

629
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,870
But you and Uncle...

630
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:14,630
Could I really have misjudged her?

631
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:16,670
Never mind.

632
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,350
You can value your Shen Jinghong.

633
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,550
But you shouldn't single out Mu Zhuohua.

634
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,950
You were born noble.

635
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,270
But you don't understand

636
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:30,150
how difficult it is for a woman like her

637
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:31,870
to have such an accomplishment.

638
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,110
Your Highness.

639
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:01,910
Mu Zhuohua took the examination
as a woman

640
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,550
and competed
with all those men for a place.

641
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,150
It was already incredibly challenging.

642
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,270
Today, I took her side

643
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,190
and criticized you harshly.

644
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,470
Please don't take it personally.

645
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,230
Your kindness and compassion
are renowned.

646
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,390
How could I ever mind such things?

647
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,510
What do you think
of her winning the poetry contest

648
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,350
today?

649
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,710
Some strive to win
by traveling far and wide.

650
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:37,270
Some strive to win
through intricate plans.

651
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,830
Some strive to win
by any means necessary.

652
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,030
Mu Zhuohua

653
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:45,110
displayed clever tactics in this matter,

654
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:46,510
which is truly admirable.

655
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,350
You do stand out from the norm.

656
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,430
Your insights are keen

657
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,030
and clear.

658
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,030
Your Highness,

659
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,870
someone left a painting here.

660
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:26,110
(Pure and Radiant Yulan Magnolia)

661
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,790
Have some water.

662
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,830
Princess Roujia sure is nice.

663
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:51,670
Guo Juli is also nice.

664
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,070
You sure are.

665
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,550
You're the closest person to me.

666
00:37:58,950 --> 00:37:59,590
Young Lady,

667
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,830
so is Lord Ding good or bad?

668
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,670
I don't yet know

669
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,030
about Lord Ding.

670
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,990
But I feel he doesn't trust me.

671
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,190
Guess what?

672
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,430
At the poetry gathering,

673
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,710
he poured a searing hot tea for me.

674
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:19,550
I think he was punishing me

675
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,230
for associating his name
with that lousy poem.

676
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:26,310
But he didn't expose it publicly.

677
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,950
So he's considered a decent person.

678
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,550
Look at these flowers.

679
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,350
You can show me around while at it.

680
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,670
My Lord, this courtyard
has been abandoned for a long time.

681
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:47,630
There is dust everywhere.

682
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,270
It's all right.

683
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,150
When Fu Shengru's properties
were seized,

684
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,390
only some worthless household items

685
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,470
and an aged yellowed medical book

686
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:55,150
were left behind.

687
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,950
There are also some moldy herbs
in the storage room.

688
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:21,390
My Lord,

689
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:22,990
I quickly searched through everything.

690
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,230
But I didn't find any clues related
to the Revival Powder.

691
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,030
Nothing here either.

692
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:32,030
My Lord,

693
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,470
how about asking Imperial Physician Zhao
to come and take a look?

694
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,910
Bring him here
after cleaning this place.

695
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:42,110
I want to inspect
Fu Shengru's belongings one by one.

696
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:43,830
Yes, My Lord.

697
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,510
(In the war at Juma River,)

698
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,550
(thirty thousand people died in vain.)

699
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,430
(The world fears me)

700
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,070
(and narrow-minded people resent me)

701
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,430
(because they believe
I have disloyal intentions.)

702
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,590
(I've always had a clear conscience.)

703
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,590
(But I never expected)

704
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:24,230
(even those close to me
would suspect me.)

705
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:27,230
(For this, they're even willing
to undermine the country's foundation)

706
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,270
(and sacrifice so many lives.)

707
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:36,910
Is it true

708
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:41,230
that there's no familial bond
within the royal family?

709
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:44,350
Familial bond?

710
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:45,470
Humph.

711
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,870
The Merciful One can see clearly.

712
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:52,630
I gave all my affection
to my own flesh and blood.

713
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,110
Why should I give any to others?

714
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,790
When I was young,

715
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:59,910
I was willing
to share my affection as well.

716
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,070
But what did that bring me?

717
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:06,990
Your Highness,

718
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:09,110
the investigator has returned
from Yanzhou.

719
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,190
I think there is nothing suspicious

720
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,190
about Mu Zhuohua's background.

721
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:21,430
(Mu Zhuohua Family Background)

722
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:22,630
She is from Yanzhou.

723
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:25,150
She's related to the Mu family
in Huaizhou.

724
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,910
Her family is pretty wealthy,

725
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:29,630
which gave her the chance to study
and take exams.

726
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:37,070
If she really has nothing to do
with the past events,

727
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:42,030
why did Liu Yan take her
to Tiantong Mountain?

728
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:43,470
I heard

729
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:46,670
she has an attractive face.

730
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:50,030
It looks like Lord Ding

731
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:53,830
is not immune
to feelings and desires, after all.

732
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,790
A young girl like her

733
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,910
probably can't cause much trouble.

734
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,110
But just to be safe,

735
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:04,910
keep an eye on her.

736
00:42:22,434 --> 00:42:25,994
♪Unceasing love stalks my mind♪

737
00:42:26,194 --> 00:42:29,474
♪Couldn't get over it♪

738
