(Adapted from "She Was Once
a Playful Soul" by Sui Yu Er An)

=Episode 4=

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,910
(This is a work of fiction.)

20
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,950
He's a nefarious demon
to Northern Liang

21
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,950
and the god of war to the Northern Chen.

22
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,100
Be that as it may,

23
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,870
some might think

24
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,180
his meritorious reputation
has surpassed the Emperor.

25
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,670
Lord Ding is scary.

26
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,590
He's like a tiger.

27
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,510
And worst, a giant tiger.

28
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:10,780
Young Lady,

29
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,710
you shouldn't get involved with him.

30
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,270
I think so too.

31
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,590
The capital sure
is a complicated place to stay.

32
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,710
There are dangers everywhere.

33
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,550
All we want is to make a decent living.

34
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,460
Miss, here are your dishes.

35
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,740
(Raising Tiger Is a Threat)

36
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,740
So who wants to answer?

37
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,740
I'll answer it.

38
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,460
He's Scholar Zong, who ranked second
in the literary examination.

39
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,110
Before Shen Jinghong arrived
in the capital,

40
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,390
he dominated the top of the list.

41
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,550
After that, he lost to Shen Jinghong
five times continuously.

42
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,390
Today, he still goes on the stage.

43
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,030
Leaving aside his literary talents...

44
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,740
(Wen Shizong, Scholar)

45
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,270
(Wen Shizong, Scholar)
he sure is mentally strong.

46
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,030
A tiger,

47
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,780
a fierce beast.

48
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,060
When raised, it becomes a danger.
So strive to eliminate it.

49
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,060
Mr. Wen has a point.

50
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,220
A sage has a compassionate heart,

51
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,180
and a virtuous person is righteous.

52
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,110
I, as a humble individual,

53
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,180
am only concerned
about upholding righteousness.

54
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,660
Thus achieving the utmost benevolence.

55
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,430
Why do we read

56
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,620
the books of sages and scholars?

57
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,900
It's learning how to serve the country

58
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,710
and share the Emperor's burdens.

59
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,180
- Nicely put!
- Well said!

60
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,390
- That's right!
- Mr. Wen, well said!

61
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,590
- Well said!
- Good!

62
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,430
To think a mere commoner

63
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,990
would dare to show such disrespect
to Lord Ding.

64
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,340
Perhaps,

65
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,590
he also knows
that the mighty tiger is injured.

66
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,220
The mighty tiger is injured?

67
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,900
How did it get injured?

68
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,620
Five years ago, at the Juma River.

69
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,390
Lord Ding faced off
against the Northern Liang Army.

70
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,780
He was trapped and surrounded.

71
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,430
Almost thirty thousand elite soldiers
were killed and injured.

72
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,180
And even Lord Ding's life
was hanging by a thread.

73
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,180
Fortunately,

74
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,990
First Prince led his troops
deep into enemy territory

75
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,340
and saved Lord Ding.

76
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:11,870
But it's said

77
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,030
that Lord Ding suffered serious injuries

78
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,270
from that battle.

79
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,070
So he handed over most
of his military power to First Prince.

80
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,660
How did Wen Shizong know

81
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,100
that First Prince and Lord Ding
aren't on the same side?

82
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,420
Don't they fear offending First Prince?

83
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,420
That was because you think too simply

84
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,540
and they overcomplicated it.

85
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,780
You know what?

86
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,390
They thought

87
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,220
Lord Ding lost the battle

88
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,390
because First Prince
obstructed in between

89
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,460
to seize power from Lord Ding.

90
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,460
They sure overthink this.

91
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,540
However, what the people know

92
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,150
about the war at Juma River

93
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,750
may not be the truth.

94
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,510
(Uncle seems to be paying attention
to this female provincial graduate.)

95
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,590
I'm only guessing.

96
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,590
During the battle in Yan City,

97
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,660
Lord Ding remained meticulous
and unparalleled

98
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,860
in his strategic brilliance.

99
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,630
But why did Lord Ding
become so ambitious and reckless

100
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,860
in the war at Juma River
three years later?

101
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,030
Young Lady, you're right.

102
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,270
How could someone's
skills possibly regress over time?

103
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:13,750
Look.

104
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,220
Lord Ding

105
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,070
already has such accomplishments,

106
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,900
why would he seek further recognition?

107
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,710
And what other recognition
he could seek?

108
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,900
That's my first point.

109
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,830
Lord Ding's understanding
of the people from Northern Liang

110
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,510
has reached a point
where he knows all strategies.

111
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,510
How could he easily

112
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,420
fall into the ambush

113
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,750
set by the Northern Liang people

114
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,590
in the war at Juma River?

115
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,830
That's my second point.

116
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,340
Yuan Chengming betrayed us!

117
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,420
We got ambushed!

118
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,780
There's one thing
that puzzles me the most.

119
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,150
It has already been five years
since that battle.

120
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,710
Yet why is there a rumor
still circulating among the people

121
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,460
that Lord Ding was greedy
for achievements, acted recklessly,

122
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,750
was arrogant,
and underestimated the enemy?

123
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,460
This is my third point.

124
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,460
I just can't figure that out.

125
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,220
Even a woman knows that.

126
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,030
Yet there's a bunch of ignorant fools

127
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,750
who constantly chatter
in front of Father.

128
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,660
Chen.

129
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,030
Young Lady.

130
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,830
Based on what you just said,

131
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,630
that means Lord Ding did nothing wrong.

132
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,340
He may not be greedy for achievements.

133
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,030
But there was a possibility
of recklessness.

134
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,860
I didn't know
you knew Lord Ding this well.

135
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,030
Oh, no. Not at all.

136
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,100
This woman's words are too one-sided.

137
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,460
Uncle, you lead by example,

138
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,420
unite the three armies.

139
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,390
You are a model in the hearts of many.

140
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,150
Speaking of which,

141
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,900
I came to watch Mr. Jinghong in action.

142
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,900
But he hasn't shown up yet.

143
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,220
Uncle,

144
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,070
who do you want to see today?

145
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,150
For

146
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:34,950
one small fry.

147
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:37,830
After hearing so many answers,

148
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,390
Wen Shizong's answer is still the best.

149
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,710
(Fang Zhiyuan, Scholar)
His answer is logical and well-founded.

150
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,750
You're flattering me.

151
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,190
I bet Shen Jinghong won't dare
to come anymore.

152
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,860
He definitely won't dare.

153
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,100
He wouldn't dare to come.

154
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,390
Since all of you miss me that much,

155
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,540
how can I disappoint all of you?

156
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,780
(Shen Jinghong, Gifted Scholar)

157
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,030
So it's him.

158
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,350
Young Lady, do you know him?

159
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,630
No, I don't.

160
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,700
Mr. Jinghong,
you took your time to show up.

161
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,350
You sure made us wait for quite a while.

162
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,230
I wonder what you have to say

163
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,420
about today's topic.

164
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:04,940
That's right.

165
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,060
Mr. Jinghong is meant
to be a Zhuangyuan.

166
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,350
I'm sure your insights
must be extraordinary.

167
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,150
Surely, you'll present us
with fresh perspectives.

168
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,470
- Yes.
- Indeed.

169
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,030
Tell us what you think.

170
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,110
Pardon me for making you wait.

171
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:21,940
Mr. Shen,

172
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,060
why were you late?

173
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,270
Don't tell us you were scared.

174
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,580
I had to help
an elderly cross the bridge.

175
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,750
That's why I was late.

176
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,660
Mr. Shen, are you joking?

177
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,780
I thought

178
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,350
you were joking, Fang.

179
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,470
Mr. Shen,

180
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,150
this place is for exchanging ideas,

181
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,660
not a place for joking around.

182
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,820
Wen, you spoke up just in time.

183
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,420
I have a question
I think you might be able to help.

184
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,660
Mr. Shen, please ask away.

185
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,660
The warm weather is changing
to the cold weather.

186
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,700
Wen, aren't you cold

187
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,180
from fanning yourself all the time?

188
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:01,990
You...

189
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,390
Wen, your literary talent
is exceptional.

190
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,270
Truly a master of both literary
and martial arts.

191
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,700
I feel inadequate in comparison.

192
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,060
Master of both literary
and martial arts?

193
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,270
The name Wen Shizong, indeed.
[*Wen, literary. Shi, soldier]

194
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,030
You bring shame to intellectuals.

195
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,150
Wen.

196
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,700
Juli, did you hear how he talks?

197
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,300
He's so mean.

198
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,630
From now on,

199
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,870
"Master of both literary
and martial arts"

200
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,780
might become a term of mockery.

201
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,780
Apart from anything else,

202
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:33,990
Shen Jinghong has a sharp tongue.

203
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,300
A perfect candidate
as an imperial censor.

204
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,990
His words sure are sharp enough.

205
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,660
Mr. Shen, since you're here
to answer the question,

206
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,300
why indulge in empty talk first?

207
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,540
- He's right, Mr. Shen.
- That's right.

208
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,300
- Answer the question.
- We're all waiting here.

209
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,900
Mr. Shen, hurry up and answer it.

210
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,110
Come on, Mr. Shen.

211
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,580
Since everyone is so eager,

212
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,230
I'll offer my humble answer.

213
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,870
Raising tiger is a threat.

214
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,150
The question is inappropriate.

215
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,300
That's quite audacious of you.

216
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,820
These topics are contributed
by masters of literature.

217
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,390
That's inaccurate.

218
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,270
Even in the literary world,
some deceive and steal fame.

219
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:42,330
(Use)

220
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,870
"Raising tiger as an asset?"

221
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,510
For the word "asset",

222
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,350
he uses bold and well-defined strokes.

223
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,630
This person truly has profound insights.

224
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,060
Astonishingly elegant.

225
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,700
Juli, bring me the brush and ink.

226
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,660
I want to answer the topic as well.

227
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,150
All right.

228
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,870
(Tiger)
"Raising tiger as an asset?"

229
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,580
What does that mean?

230
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,510
Since tigers are fierce,

231
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,820
how could they be an asset?

232
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,470
Mr. Shen, are you sensationalizing
your answer?

233
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,060
Ordinary people are timid.

234
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,750
So raising a tiger would naturally
be a threat to them.

235
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,580
His Majesty has no fear.

236
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,900
So naturally,
he can make use of the tiger.

237
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,780
But tigers are ferocious,

238
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,900
what if they hurt someone?

239
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,230
As long as the one who tames the tiger
possesses great wisdom and courage,

240
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,630
they can naturally subdue
the ferocious beast.

241
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,470
Just like Duke Huan of Qi,

242
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,470
who appointed Guan Zhong
who once injured him as his minister,

243
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,270
achieving prosperity and strength,

244
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,990
ultimately achieving hegemony.

245
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,060
Basically,

246
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,780
the fierceness of a tiger is its nature,

247
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,420
without a clear moral judgment.

248
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,750
It's the fear in people
that's misguided.

249
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,580
Being inadequate themselves,

250
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,300
yet speculating about His Majesty.

251
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,900
What purpose does this question serve?

252
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,390
- Well said.
- He's right.

253
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,750
He has a point.

254
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,350
(The Princess didn't come.)

255
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,610
(Man, Princess Roujia's Maidservant)

256
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,780
Why did Shen Jinghong

257
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,390
just leave like that?

258
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,510
Young Lady,

259
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,780
I thought you were preparing
to take the challenge as well.

260
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,420
Truly a person of remarkable demeanor.

261
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,350
It's just

262
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,510
a bit too good at flattery.

263
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,820
If no one opposes,

264
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,990
the one who holds
the top spot today is...

265
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,180
- Shen Jinghong!
- Shen Jinghong!

266
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,030
"Raising tiger as an asset"

267
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,940
manages to buy everyone's heart
all at once.

268
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,870
I'm really inferior compared to that.

269
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,660
Young Lady, don't say that.

270
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,060
You're quite skilled at flattery too.

271
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,630
You should improve your skills too.

272
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,150
Your flattery is too excessive.

273
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,110
Young Lady...

274
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,990
I won't take the challenge.

275
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,030
Wenzheng Parlor

276
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,820
might have some powerful backing.

277
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,630
Young Lady, I'm not that smart.

278
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,470
I really can't catch up to you.

279
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,270
That's all right.
You can take your time to catch up.

280
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,350
"Raising tiger is a threat."

281
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,350
It's too dangerous to come up

282
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,060
with such a topic.

283
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,870
Someone who dares to present this

284
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,540
must be someone with powerful backing.

285
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,150
It's also likely that the question

286
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,660
was given by someone's command.

287
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,230
No,

288
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,580
that's unlikely.

289
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,630
What benefit does it bring

290
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,030
to present such a topic?

291
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:20,580
Time to go.

292
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,030
(Wenzheng Parlor)

293
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,110
Even mantou at Wenzheng Parlor
is so expensive.

294
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,630
Next time, I won't buy it again.

295
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,820
- (This annoying person)
- Young Lady.

296
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,820
(is really difficult to deal with.)

297
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,270
Yesterday, I used Princess Roujia's
influence to scare him off.

298
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,870
I didn't expect him
to show up again today.

299
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,180
It's going to be troublesome.

300
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,510
Young Lady.

301
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,150
Don't get in my way.

302
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,230
Your Lordship.

303
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,390
I didn't expect

304
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,390
to run into you here, Your Lordship.

305
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,660
Sit down.

306
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,580
Put your cleverness to good use.

307
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,750
Lord Ding. Wait, Lord Ding.

308
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,350
The topic posed by Wenzheng Parlor
was quite audacious.

309
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,300
Earlier, I was puzzled
and couldn't understand it.

310
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,660
Suddenly, I have a sudden realization
at this moment.

311
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,630
You came to Wenzheng Parlor
but not taking the stage to speak.

312
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,820
This doesn't quite match

313
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,540
your pursuit of fame and profit, does it?

314
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,660
When the gods fight,
the innocent suffer.

315
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,900
I just want to climb the ranks
and get wealthy,

316
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,300
not get impacted.

317
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,660
Moreover,

318
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,780
now that Shen Jinghong
is a prominent figure in the capital,

319
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,670
it's difficult for others

320
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,670
to gain fame.

321
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,300
After failing to gain fame,

322
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,750
they might end up becoming "masters
of both literary and martial arts".

323
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,580
Did you catch up to me

324
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,380
just to talk about these things with me?

325
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:26,030
After all, I'm working for Your Lordship.

326
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,270
Drop the act.

327
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,030
Stop uttering nonsense.

328
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,860
Mu Zhuohua, will you ever stop lying?

329
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,780
You even claimed to be under me.

330
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,710
Are you even working for me?

331
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,820
I...

332
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,190
It was a misunderstanding.

333
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,510
Lord Ding.

334
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:10,860
Zhimo,

335
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,100
tell me.

336
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,620
What exactly is my uncle up to?

337
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:17,710
Did Zhijian

338
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:19,860
recruit that person too?

339
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:23,670
Fishing.

340
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,230
Over a small fry,

341
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,230
Uncle had to sacrifice to this extent.

342
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,710
He's truly yielding
for the greater good.

343
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,470
If it weren't for me finding out
about this person's whereabouts,

344
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,710
how would I know you're trying
to play up to me like this

345
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,540
for your own benefit?

346
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,860
You should keep
your ulterior motives away.

347
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:52,230
I won't use disloyal individuals.

348
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,030
Does pursuing one's own benefit

349
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,300
mean it's wrong?

350
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,750
Can't a woman strive for her aspirations

351
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,820
rather than being married off?

352
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,860
Lord Ding,

353
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,030
you proposed to allow females
to attend the examination.

354
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,990
But do you know that the female
provincial graduate in front of you

355
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,910
has already exhausted all her energy

356
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,140
just to arrive at Wenzheng Parlor?

357
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,910
Yes, a gentleman is truthful

358
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,990
and I'm often dishonest.

359
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,230
But is it wrong for me

360
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,470
to resort to any means

361
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,510
for the sake of survival?

362
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,540
You mentioned loyalty.

363
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,430
Look at the answer I prepared.

364
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,480
(Release the tiger back to the wild)

365
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,140
If one is reckless
for the sake of the country,

366
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,140
that is an act of unparalleled bravery.

367
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,540
A tiger's nature is brave.

368
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,780
Yet, it also serves the country
and the people.

369
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,910
Instead of keeping it captive,
why not let it return to the wild?

370
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,140
Keeping it around
puts other beasts under control.

371
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,270
Releasing it, it can deter threats.

372
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,190
This is how a tiger finds
its rightful place.

373
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:22,990
Aren't you reckless too?

374
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:29,540
Zhijian.

375
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,100
Yes, Your Lordship.

376
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,710
Escort them back.

377
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:33,340
Yes, Your Lordship.

378
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:50,710
Come on.

379
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,270
Butler Zhou.

380
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:58,430
Butler Zhou,

381
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,340
they're gone.

382
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,430
Butler Zhou,

383
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,190
what does Lord Ding mean by this?

384
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,950
Miss Seventh is indeed clever.

385
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,510
Follow them
and find out where she lives.

386
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:16,990
Let's go.

387
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,140
Let me see.

388
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:26,100
(Jishan Hall)

389
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,270
Please line up! Everyone has one.

390
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,620
Don't push! Everyone will have one!

391
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,780
Excuse me,

392
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,510
I just want something lightweight.

393
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,780
Can I have the one without cotton?

394
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,380
The price is already quite reasonable.

395
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,470
Besides, in a couple of days,

396
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,860
the weather will become chilly.

397
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,910
Don't you agree?

398
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,620
Yes, you're right about that.

399
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,060
I'll take two adult-sized ones.

400
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,230
All right.

401
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:49,300
Here you go.

402
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,230
For two adults, right?

403
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,820
Thank you very much.

404
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,030
Take care.

405
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,510
All right, next!

406
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:03,750
Mr. Tan.

407
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:09,580
(Father of Tan Lin of the Cangwu Army)

408
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,300
Oh, please don't address me that.

409
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,470
I'm a commoner.

410
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,710
I don't deserve to be addressed as such.

411
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,580
Why didn't you take
any children's clothes?

412
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,990
Hu...

413
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,230
Hu?

414
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,820
What's wrong with him?

415
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:32,430
Hu had typhoid fever.

416
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,100
He passed away

417
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,060
last month.

418
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:40,910
Why didn't you tell me?

419
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,230
Hu was Tan Lin's only child.

420
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,270
Go to you?

421
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,910
Why should I?

422
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:55,140
Didn't Tan Lin also die
after following you?

423
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,300
Your Lordship has elixirs.

424
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,190
Out of the thirty thousand soldiers
from Cangwu Army,

425
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,430
only you survived.

426
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,230
Before the expedition,

427
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,780
I was bedridden due to illness.

428
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,620
I told Tan Lin not to go.

429
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,540
But this child

430
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,820
insisted anyway.

431
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,380
I dragged my sick body
to your residence to beg you.

432
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,750
But what did you say?

433
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,780
You promised

434
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,780
to bring Tan Lin back to me
safe and sound.

435
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,580
But did he return safely?

436
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,820
Tan Lin was my only child.

437
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,510
Did you bring him back?

438
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,910
Did you?

439
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,580
Uncle.

440
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:36,910
Greetings, Uncle.

441
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,670
What brings you to Jishan Hall today?

442
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:44,990
I was passing by.

443
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:46,950
You can get back to your matters.

444
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,990
It seems Uncle
hasn't fully recovered yet.

445
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,990
Just like Father.

446
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,100
They all have troubled hearts.

447
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,430
I didn't expect
so many people would come for help

448
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,230
on the first day of the Jishan Hall
opening in the capital.

449
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:11,910
Next!

450
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,620
Your Highness,

451
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,510
the ledgers of Jishan Halls
from various regions

452
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,950
have been sent over.

453
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,270
Please take a look.

454
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:48,280
(Ledger)

455
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,270
All regions of Jishan Hall's

456
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,860
past year's expenditures of silver,

457
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,190
grains, wood, cloth,

458
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,670
paper, brush, and medicines

459
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:57,140
are all recorded.

460
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,990
We have provided aid
to more than three thousand people

461
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,820
and set up ten schools

462
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,340
with five hundred students enrolling
in the schools.

463
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,060
Your Highness,

464
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,140
the impoverished people
and students from humble backgrounds

465
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,190
who have received assistance

466
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,750
are deeply grateful to you.

467
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,620
There are countless poor people
in the world.

468
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,950
Jishan Hall merely helped
one-tenth of them.

469
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:24,430
Besides, I didn't do this alone.

470
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,030
So don't mention this again
in the future.

471
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:28,540
Yes, Your Highness.

472
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,380
We just set up
Jishan Hall in the capital.

473
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,750
So we are short of manpower.

474
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,620
You should recruit more people.

475
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,100
Yes, Your Highness.

476
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,860
We need more help
to teach children, write letters,

477
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,820
and do other heavy and arduous chores.

478
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,990
I'll put up more recruitment notices,

479
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,470
especially for teachers.

480
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,430
Currently, we have many children
in the side courtyard

481
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,910
who are learning to read and write.

482
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:51,710
Go home!

483
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,910
Father, please let me go to school!

484
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:54,430
Go home!

485
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,100
No! I don't want to go home!

486
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,780
Come home with me!

487
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,470
Father, please

488
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,430
let me go to school!

489
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,910
For what? We don't have money
to send you to school?

490
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:00,620
Come with me!

491
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,470
Let her stay.

492
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,780
You don't have to pay to study here.

493
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:06,990
A girl doesn't need to go to school.

494
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:07,990
She'll marry someone sooner or later.

495
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,540
She still has a lot of chores
to do back home.

496
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,470
I want to learn to read and write.

497
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,270
She stays. You can leave.

498
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,750
I want to give her a chance to study.

499
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,910
You're Princess Roujia?

500
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,580
You can stay at Jishan Hall.

501
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,060
You don't have to be afraid anymore.

502
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,190
Yes.

503
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:42,510
Take her with you.

504
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,470
Yes, Your Highness.

505
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,380
Come with me.

506
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,620
I saw a job advertisement here

507
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,710
and thought I'd give it a try.

508
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,670
I didn't expect

509
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:19,950
to be so lucky.

510
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,270
Your Highness.

511
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,060
(Young Shen Jinghong)

512
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,190
(Young Shen Jinghong)
When did you...

513
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:32,980
(Young Shen Jinghong)

514
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:44,620
Writing on sand is different

515
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,190
from writing on paper.

516
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,300
You don't need to be so frugal.

517
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,670
Jishan Hall has already helped me a lot.

518
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,540
Writing materials are not cheap.

519
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,780
So are you going to answer
your exams on the sand in the future?

520
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,470
Just come with me.

521
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,620
Next time, practice your writing
in the study room.

522
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,780
You're writing it wrongly.

523
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,380
It's been so long.

524
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,750
You've grown a lot.

525
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,300
It's been a while.

526
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,510
But Your Highness is still the same.

527
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,270
It still doesn't look right.

528
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,380
Your Highness,
it's been a while since you visited.

529
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:09,340
- We've missed you.
- We've missed you so much.

530
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,540
It's about time.

531
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:12,710
Time to go for your meal.

532
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:15,540
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

533
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,530
(Jiao)

534
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,030
I didn't expect

535
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,950
you would come and teach at Jishan Hall.

536
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,190
With the blessings of Your Highness

537
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,540
that I can come from that remote place

538
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,430
to the bustling capital city.

539
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:43,140
So I wanted to help others as well.

540
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,340
The metropolitan examination
is approaching.

541
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,100
You are meant to be a Zhuangyuan.

542
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,990
So focusing on your preparations
is important.

543
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,540
Please rest assured. It won't affect me.

544
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,990
I'll be waiting to see how you perform.

545
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,060
Your Highness,

546
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:05,060
Fuyun Temple will host a poetry event
the day after tomorrow.

547
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,270
May I be bold to invite Your Highness
to attend it with me?

548
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,190
Can I have the honor, Your Highness?

549
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,470
Considering the busy schedule
at Jishan Hall lately,

550
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,910
it shouldn't be a problem
if I have time.

551
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,950
Then I'll look forward
to your gracious presence.

552
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:27,660
(Flower Alley)

553
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,990
Young Lady, I'll go and open the door.

554
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:39,620
Young Lady.

555
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,910
Didn't Lord Ding tell you
to escort us home?

556
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:44,950
But we haven't reached home yet.

557
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,670
You're right about that.

558
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,620
Good intention always falls short.

559
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,620
It's not enough to just send you
to the doorstep.

560
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:56,190
Or you can have dinner before leaving.

561
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,510
Juli has excellent culinary skills.

562
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,140
What are you doing?

563
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,510
Yeah.

564
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,340
I'm just trying

565
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,300
to thank you for escorting us back.

566
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,820
Is there a need to wield your weapon?

567
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,820
Young Lady, don't be scared. I got you.

568
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:11,710
It's all right.

569
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,190
It's all right.

570
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,100
All right, then.

571
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,270
Now that

572
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,340
the sword is out of its sheath,

573
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,580
surely, you have something to say.

574
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,100
So speak.

575
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:23,950
Young Lady...

576
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,230
I hope you don't think

577
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,190
this will truly gain you favor
with His Lordship.

578
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,060
I advise you to be cautious

579
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:32,340
and not even try to take advantage
of His Lordship.

580
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,140
Although Zhimo looks fierce,

581
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,820
most of the time he's just trying
to intimidate people.

582
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,300
But I'm different.

583
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,100
I can really...

584
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:43,580
Young Lady.

585
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,540
I can really kill you.

586
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,750
That was terrifying.

587
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:56,710
Are you all right?

588
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,430
I'm fine. Young Lady.

589
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,100
I got you.

590
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,780
The people around Lord Ding

591
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,860
are indeed not to be taken lightly.

592
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,780
Let's hurry.

593
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,190
Don't forget the bag.

594
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,430
Young Lady, go inside first.

595
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,990
Mister, come and take a look
at these trinkets.

596
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,670
They are the latest trendy items.

597
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,340
(Where does this maidservant
get her strength from?)

598
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,430
(I almost couldn't hold out)

599
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:27,990
(and shame His Lordship.)

600
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,140
There, there. Don't be upset.

601
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,950
I'm going to tell Zhimo.

602
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,710
No, I'm telling Lord Ding.

603
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,190
You even want to tell on him.

604
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,710
Have you forgotten

605
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,230
how the public perceives Lord Ding?

606
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,670
They say he's not humane.

607
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,860
Young Lady. Young Lady,

608
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,430
what does "humane" mean?

609
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,860
You shouldn't listen to or speak
of inappropriate things.

610
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:03,510
Remember

611
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:06,510
not to spread such words.

612
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,260
You mustn't speak irresponsibly.

613
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:09,990
Do you remember that?

614
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:10,950
Yes.

615
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,830
A person like Lord Ding,

616
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:18,140
who has experienced life and death
on the battlefield

617
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:20,180
won't be fooled by my little tricks.

618
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,620
I never intended
to deceive him for long.

619
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:24,660
But, Juli,

620
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:26,220
I'm genuinely scared.

621
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,910
For a nobody like me,

622
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,870
I wouldn't want to die if I could live.

623
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,430
Forget it. As long as I can borrow
his influence

624
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,660
to solve my current problem,

625
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:35,740
it's already good enough.

626
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:37,660
So did you manage to borrow it?

627
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:38,740
Yes.

628
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:50,510
My Lord,

629
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:53,260
your health is not as good as before.

630
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,140
In the future, you mustn't get agitated
in any situation.

631
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:59,430
You must control your emotions.

632
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,390
The unresolved concerns are troublesome

633
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,740
but must be resolved.

634
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,390
Otherwise, how can I face

635
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,470
my 30,000 brothers again

636
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,510
after I die?

637
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,470
Also,

638
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:17,060
Zhijian once asked me something.

639
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,310
But I've been a physician for decades

640
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,620
and I've never heard of a medicine

641
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,870
called Revival Powder.

642
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:28,390
I know you attach great importance
to this matter.

643
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:31,030
I also indirectly asked
other imperial physicians,

644
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,310
and they all said

645
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,350
they had never heard of such a medicine.

646
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,910
Have you checked

647
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,470
all the medical records
of the Imperial Academy of Medicine?

648
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:43,540
I did, but there was no record of it.

649
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,910
Could Mu make it up?

650
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:49,540
How can the prescription be made up?

651
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,740
The proportions of the prescription

652
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,510
are supported by cases.

653
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,030
Then,

654
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,910
I'll leave it to you then,
Imperial Physician Zhao.

655
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,430
Zhimo,

656
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,350
help me see him off.

657
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,580
Please come this way.

658
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,660
Mu Zhuohua.

659
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:23,060
I didn't expect you to stay
at Flower Alley, Miss Seventh.

660
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,700
No wonder I couldn't find where you stay

661
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,100
even though I've checked everywhere
in the capital.

662
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:29,580
You really have a trick up your sleeve.

663
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:31,260
Butler Zhou,

664
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,540
I don't know what you're talking about.

665
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,470
I dare not probe

666
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,740
into your matters.

667
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,030
But after this,

668
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,350
you're going to sit
for the national examination.

669
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,140
So what should we do about the marriage?

670
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,870
Butler Zhou, you say you dare not ask.

671
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,540
But you ask anyway.

672
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,870
I dare not.

673
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,510
It's just that I need to report back
to my master.

674
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,740
Official Zhuang
is still waiting for news.

675
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,430
What news?

676
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:03,660
Is he waiting for me to achieve success
and return to my hometown,

677
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,580
or waiting for me
to serve the privileged

678
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,660
and rise to success?

679
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,470
Well... I...

680
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,540
I know you've been tailing me lately.

681
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,950
I'm sure you have questions too.

682
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,990
But you already saw what happened.

683
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,910
At the entrance of Wenzheng Parlor,

684
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,260
Lord Ding agreed

685
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:26,140
that I would work for him in the future,

686
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,870
which is why he instructed his people
to escort me back here.

687
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:32,220
If you can't even tell,

688
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,870
how can you gain trust

689
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,180
from Official Zhuang in the future?

690
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,700
In the past few days,
I've come to understand.

691
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,470
You're undoubtedly someone
who will achieve great things.

692
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,830
Of course.

693
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,580
Butler Zhou,

694
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,700
you're a clever person too.

695
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:55,140
I don't need to remind you more.

696
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,910
Between a mistress of a household

697
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,950
or the support of the imperial court,

698
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,260
I think

699
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,470
Official Zhuang knows
what's best for him.

700
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:06,870
Don't you agree?

701
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,910
Young Lady. Young Lady.

702
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,260
Do you think Butler Zhou

703
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,260
has really let us go?

704
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:24,950
Very likely.

705
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:26,740
Butler Zhou thinks

706
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,740
I'm working for Lord Ding.

707
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,540
So he naturally won't press us too hard.

708
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,700
Although my father
is the richest man in Jiangnan,

709
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,350
compared to these prominent figures
in the capital,

710
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,180
we're even less than ants.

711
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,580
Then will he go back
and say something reckless?

712
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,790
What Official Zhuang will hear

713
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,430
depends on
what Butler Zhou reports to him.

714
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:48,870
Juli,

715
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,060
go and bring out

716
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,910
the five silver ingots we got earlier.

717
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,990
Tomorrow morning, go to the inn

718
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,180
and give it to Butler Zhou.

719
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,180
Tell him to be careful with his words.

720
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,390
You can't, Young Lady.

721
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,790
You risked your life to earn this money.

722
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,350
Are you really going to give it
to Butler Zhou like that?

723
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:03,740
Yes.

724
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,220
Only after I give him the money

725
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,030
can I take the examination
without worries

726
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,430
and truly not be affected

727
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,470
by other distractions.

728
00:39:28,439 --> 00:39:31,999
♪Unceasing love stalks my mind♪

729
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:35,479
