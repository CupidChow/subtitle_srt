=The Legend of Zhuohua=

17
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,860
(Adapted from "She Was Once
a Playful Soul" by Sui Yu Er An)

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,940
=Episode 6=

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
(This is a work of fiction.)

20
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,951
Yun Xiangyue?

21
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,871
So,

22
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,351
after rescuing his wife and daughter,

23
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:02,151
he led the pursuers away.

24
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,151
It seems the person
using the hawk-claw-like weapon

25
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:09,430
had tried to capture him alive.

26
00:02:10,311 --> 00:02:12,870
The one using needles
wanted to kill him.

27
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:15,830
They are not from the same group.

28
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,270
Logically speaking,

29
00:02:18,311 --> 00:02:20,231
the human skull is quite tough.

30
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:23,311
Only a few weapons are capable

31
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,590
of piercing through the skull.

32
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,311
I heard

33
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,471
that the Tang Sect, known as the master
of hidden weapons in Shu,

34
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,150
has a similar weapon.

35
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:32,951
It's called...

36
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:35,631
It's called

37
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:37,870
Stormy Pear Blossom Needles.

38
00:02:38,511 --> 00:02:39,471
The needles are as fine as cow's hair,

39
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,710
too thin to be seen.

40
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:42,751
And it can pierce through bones.

41
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,791
But I've only read about all this
in books.

42
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:51,351
I don't know if it's true or not.

43
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,390
I've seen them before.

44
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,511
It's Wandering Needle,

45
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,270
the Imperial Shadow Guards'
unique and powerful weapon.

46
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,830
Don't speak recklessly.

47
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,351
Ju.

48
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,951
Ju?

49
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:32,791
(Young Liu Yan)

50
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,590
Ju, stop writing.

51
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,071
(Young Liu Ju)

52
00:03:35,071 --> 00:03:35,951
Let's go and play.

53
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:37,191
(Young Liu Ju)

54
00:03:37,191 --> 00:03:38,031
Just go without me.

55
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,870
What's this? Let me play with it.

56
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,791
Your Highness, this isn't a toy.

57
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,911
Let me play with it.

58
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:52,191
Just a little while.

59
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:52,751
You can't play with this.

60
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:53,390
Just let me pay with it.

61
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,031
Yan.

62
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:54,791
Yan.

63
00:03:56,031 --> 00:03:57,951
Ju, I want to play with it.

64
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,351
Yan,

65
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,351
that's the Imperial Shadow Guards'
Wandering Needle.

66
00:04:01,351 --> 00:04:02,231
It's a lethal weapon.

67
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:02,951
You can't play with it.

68
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:06,870
But if you like it,

69
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,951
I'll make one set for you

70
00:04:08,071 --> 00:04:09,710
when you grow up.

71
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,110
It can be kept as a self-defense weapon.

72
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:12,791
Fine,

73
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,231
all right.

74
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,830
Help!

75
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,071
Yan, hang in there!

76
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,830
Help!

77
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,511
Ju!

78
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,751
Your Majesty,

79
00:04:35,311 --> 00:04:37,511
the Crown Prince
has been in poor health.

80
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,991
I'm afraid it has damaged
his fundamental well-being this time.

81
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,871
In the future, he needs
to take extra care of himself.

82
00:04:43,311 --> 00:04:45,191
Any carelessness can lead to illness.

83
00:04:46,111 --> 00:04:48,470
We will make every effort
to maintain his health.

84
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:49,991
It's just

85
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,710
that His Highness has to suffer a lot.

86
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,710
Mother,

87
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,431
forgive me.

88
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:03,590
It was all my fault.

89
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,751
No, it's not.

90
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:15,871
Yan.

91
00:05:19,937 --> 00:05:20,631
Ju.

92
00:05:22,551 --> 00:05:23,311
Yan,

93
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,551
didn't you promise

94
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:27,910
not to be a crybaby anymore?

95
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:41,311
(I didn't expect
even the invincible Lord Ding)

96
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:43,350
(to be in this state.)

97
00:05:49,991 --> 00:05:51,111
Put the body away.

98
00:05:53,071 --> 00:05:53,910
We'll return to the capital.

99
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:09,511
Protect His Lordship.

100
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,191
My Lord, leave first.

101
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:53,910
My Lord, make way!

102
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,551
It's so high up.

103
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,751
Why do you have poison with you?

104
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:16,350
Poison?

105
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,671
Oh, you mean
the one I threw at the man just now?

106
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,390
That's not poison.

107
00:07:20,671 --> 00:07:21,790
It's lime powder.

108
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:23,710
Lime powder?

109
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:28,751
What's wrong?

110
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,470
I think I've caught a cold.

111
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,111
What should I do now?

112
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,470
The metropolitan examination
is around the corner.

113
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:51,551
Where are you going?

114
00:07:52,631 --> 00:07:53,631
Find His Lordship and Miss Mu.

115
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:54,951
His Lordship said

116
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,631
not only this operation aims
to expose the mastermind,

117
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,191
but it's also to test Miss Mu.

118
00:08:00,551 --> 00:08:01,511
We can't be present.

119
00:08:09,431 --> 00:08:10,311
Thank you, My Lord.

120
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:13,631
My Lord,

121
00:08:14,551 --> 00:08:15,230
I...

122
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,790
You have to be responsible for this.

123
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,511
Despite anything,
you're the chief examiner.

124
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:21,671
You see.

125
00:08:22,111 --> 00:08:24,631
It won't be too much to help me

126
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,030
secure a place

127
00:08:26,551 --> 00:08:27,751
through the back door, right?

128
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,390
I don't need a high rank.

129
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,111
Just as long as I can
take the palace examination.

130
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:33,830
You should learn how to treat

131
00:08:34,151 --> 00:08:35,630
your subordinate from First Prince.

132
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:38,870
I can't do that.

133
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,470
My Lord,

134
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:47,110
are you in a better mood now?

135
00:08:48,191 --> 00:08:49,911
Were you trying to please me?

136
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,071
Well, I dare not try to please you.

137
00:08:52,551 --> 00:08:55,431
But I noticed you were in a bad mood.

138
00:08:56,671 --> 00:08:57,630
The ones

139
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,510
who tried to kill you

140
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,031
didn't seem like
Shadow Guards, right?

141
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,031
If they were not Shadow Guards,

142
00:09:06,191 --> 00:09:07,391
who do you think they are?

143
00:09:08,391 --> 00:09:10,271
How... How would I know?

144
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:17,191
My Lord, are you suspecting me?

145
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:18,911
Your memory is really poor.

146
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,830
I just saved your life.

147
00:09:24,671 --> 00:09:25,870
I just think

148
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:29,870
that this Wandering Needle
is like a silent killer.

149
00:09:30,911 --> 00:09:32,110
If they were really Shadow Guards,

150
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,990
we would have been dead by now.

151
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,590
If Shadow Guards are really here,

152
00:09:37,031 --> 00:09:38,031
what will you do?

153
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,791
Mu Zhuohua.

154
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,071
My Lord, didn't you want
to lure the enemy into the trap?

155
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,470
So I'm doing you a favor here.

156
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,191
Five years ago,

157
00:09:57,671 --> 00:09:59,510
30,000 soldiers of the Cangwu Army
perished at Juma River.

158
00:10:00,151 --> 00:10:01,431
That included our father.

159
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:05,870
His Lordship has always believed
that he lives with shame.

160
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,710
That's why he does everything himself,

161
00:10:08,031 --> 00:10:09,071
never relying on others.

162
00:10:11,551 --> 00:10:12,951
I'm also a survivor.

163
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,271
The Falcon Squad consists
of former Cangwu Army members.

164
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,110
You would never disobey
His Lordship's orders.

165
00:10:22,431 --> 00:10:23,350
But we're different.

166
00:10:23,671 --> 00:10:25,391
My father traded his life
to save His Lordship.

167
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,031
So I won't allow anything
to happen to him.

168
00:10:32,271 --> 00:10:34,791
I shall entrust His Lordship's safety
to you two.

169
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,510
Let's go.

170
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,590
(What...)

171
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,151
(I thought he didn't have any urges
because he was injured.)

172
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,911
(I thought the rumor was true.)

173
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,431
(After all, Father said)

174
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,311
(all men have urges.)

175
00:11:01,311 --> 00:11:02,551
(Unless he's not a man.)

176
00:11:02,951 --> 00:11:05,630
(What's happening now?)

177
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,590
(What... What is he planning to do?)

178
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:25,951
(No, no, no.)

179
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,470
(I need to stay away from him.)

180
00:11:48,911 --> 00:11:49,350
(It's)

181
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,470
(a repeating crossbow?)

182
00:11:51,391 --> 00:11:52,630
(What was I thinking?)

183
00:11:57,031 --> 00:11:57,710
You

184
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,110
didn't even release the arrows.

185
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:00,750
How did they die?

186
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,110
This is...?

187
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,590
Wandering Needle.

188
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,951
Wandering Needle?

189
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,151
Where are we going?

190
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,551
This thing is indeed powerful.

191
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,311
My Lord.

192
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:46,951
(Imperial Shadow Guards)
We were late. Please leave first.

193
00:12:49,191 --> 00:12:49,710
Let's go.

194
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:52,630
Who's there?

195
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,810
(Ciming Hall)

196
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,031
You don't need to be too restrained.

197
00:13:11,671 --> 00:13:12,830
Based on seniority,

198
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,110
you should call me Great-grandaunt.

199
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,271
Your Majesty, it's very nice of you.

200
00:13:21,151 --> 00:13:22,791
(Peilan, Dowager Empress Zhou's maid)
I know my place.

201
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:23,590
(Peilan, Empress Dowager Zhou's maid)

202
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:26,311
I'm just an orphan
of the Zhou clan's collateral line.

203
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,271
It's all thanks to Your Majesty's care

204
00:13:28,271 --> 00:13:29,230
that I'm where I am today.

205
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,311
I dare not overstep my bounds.

206
00:13:32,671 --> 00:13:33,750
Well, well.

207
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,071
All of you can be excused.

208
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,191
Mother,

209
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:52,990
you promised me before.

210
00:13:53,271 --> 00:13:54,271
Why did you eat your words?

211
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,830
Do you think I'm willing to do this?

212
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,830
To harm your dear little brother?

213
00:14:03,271 --> 00:14:03,951
Your Majesty,

214
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,071
everything I've done

215
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,551
is for you.

216
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,271
Liu Yan holds great power and influence.

217
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,830
If he were to rebel one day,

218
00:14:20,431 --> 00:14:21,750
who could control him?

219
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:22,830
He would never do such a thing.

220
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,350
We've been brothers for many years.
I trust him.

221
00:14:27,391 --> 00:14:28,870
Then, what if he finds out

222
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:32,071
the truth behind the war
at Juma River five years ago?

223
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,671
What if he discovers

224
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,671
that I wanted him gone forever?

225
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,750
You plotted the war at Juma River

226
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:49,350
all by yourself back then.

227
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,630
I only learned about it afterward.

228
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,630
I helped you handle the aftermath
to protect you.

229
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:56,951
Deceiving Yan like this

230
00:14:56,951 --> 00:14:58,071
made me feel deep remorse.

231
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,791
But why do you still
have to take his life now?

232
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:04,031
He's the one
who doesn't want to let me go.

233
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:04,710
Mother, you...

234
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,401
That's why he discovered Yun Xiangyue
and Yuan Chengming.

235
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:09,071
Your Majesty,

236
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,350
only when he's dead

237
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,630
can you truly feel at ease.

238
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:15,671
Mother!

239
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,350
Yan has always considered you

240
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,031
his birth mother.

241
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,071
You protect him time and time again.

242
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:27,071
If he were to learn the truth
behind these events,

243
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:30,391
would he still remember
the sibling bond he shares with you?

244
00:15:30,551 --> 00:15:31,151
Yes.

245
00:15:32,671 --> 00:15:33,750
I believe he would.

246
00:15:40,191 --> 00:15:40,911
Mother,

247
00:15:41,951 --> 00:15:43,350
a mother's debt is repaid by her child.

248
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,710
Back then,

249
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,071
when you wanted Yan to drown,

250
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,071
I risked my life to save him.

251
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:50,271
And I ended up with a lifelong ailment.

252
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,230
Now,

253
00:15:53,311 --> 00:15:54,990
if you still want his life,

254
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,311
I

255
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,951
can only follow suit as I did back then.

256
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,671
Are you trying to threaten me?

257
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,470
I dare not.

258
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:38,071
My Lord, I lost your cloak.

259
00:16:38,071 --> 00:16:38,951
It's all right.

260
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,311
What is it again this time?

261
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,391
My Lord,

262
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,510
I've finally figured it out.

263
00:16:54,671 --> 00:16:57,110
The clues pointed to the Shadow Guards,

264
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,671
so

265
00:16:59,271 --> 00:17:00,710
you deliberately took this risk

266
00:17:01,071 --> 00:17:03,990
to see if His Majesty
would show up to save you.

267
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:10,230
Now that the Shadow Guards
have appeared,

268
00:17:11,191 --> 00:17:11,911
do you...

269
00:17:13,391 --> 00:17:16,270
Do you now believe
that it wasn't His Majesty?

270
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,631
The ones who can mobilize
the Shadow Guards

271
00:17:20,151 --> 00:17:23,510
can only be His Majesty or...

272
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,310
Mu Zhuohua.

273
00:17:28,591 --> 00:17:30,030
Are you truly that bold

274
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,631
or timid?

275
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,111
Forgive me for speaking out of turn.

276
00:17:48,831 --> 00:17:50,470
(Chen is honest and impulsive.)

277
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,391
(Roujia doesn't care
about worldly disputes.)

278
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,631
(The one who can mobilize
the Shadow Guards)

279
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,030
(and know my health condition)

280
00:17:56,831 --> 00:17:57,990
(could only be)

281
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,631
(Dowager Empress.)

282
00:18:01,191 --> 00:18:03,550
(Yet we have a strong bond
even if we're not biologically related.)

283
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,710
(Our mother-and-son bond
has lasted for thirty years.)

284
00:18:21,951 --> 00:18:24,911
My Lord, you can only drink it
after boiling it.

285
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,790
You'll get sick
if you drink it like this.

286
00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:34,070
We're on the run now.

287
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,230
So just make do with this.

288
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,631
What should I do now?

289
00:18:56,191 --> 00:18:58,351
I won't be able to make it
for the examination now.

290
00:18:59,351 --> 00:19:00,470
If so, sit for the next one.

291
00:19:02,671 --> 00:19:04,070
I can't wait until then.

292
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,070
I've been preparing for so many years.

293
00:19:07,671 --> 00:19:09,230
Let's hurry on with our journey, then.

294
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,631
I...

295
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:37,750
Get on.

296
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:46,990
I'll carry you.

297
00:19:48,151 --> 00:19:48,790
But...

298
00:19:49,191 --> 00:19:51,270
But it's not appropriate, My Lord.

299
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:52,351
I...

300
00:19:53,951 --> 00:19:55,070
I'll just rest here for a while.

301
00:19:56,351 --> 00:19:57,710
I'll be able to walk after resting.

302
00:19:58,151 --> 00:20:00,111
Just let me rest for a while.

303
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:03,990
Then, prepare to sit
for the exam next time.

304
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,391
But I still feel it's inappropriate,
My Lord.

305
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,310
Get on.

306
00:20:33,591 --> 00:20:34,591
Why are you so light?

307
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,070
My birth mother passed away
when I was young.

308
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,191
No one cared about me.

309
00:20:39,591 --> 00:20:41,710
They often bullied me
for being the illegitimate daughter.

310
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,030
They didn't give me enough food.

311
00:20:43,631 --> 00:20:46,111
That's why I've grown
so thin and petite.

312
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,351
I don't think the Mu family

313
00:20:48,351 --> 00:20:50,151
would go to the extent
of being stingy with food.

314
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:52,591
My Lord, you have no idea

315
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,871
servants in prominent households like this

316
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,550
tend to treat those
who are powerless with disdain.

317
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:59,431
It was because I never had enough
to eat as a child

318
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,911
that I made a vow.

319
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:01,990
When I grow up,

320
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,070
I must succeed
in the metropolitan examination

321
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,070
and make sure I get to eat my fill.

322
00:21:08,391 --> 00:21:09,671
Eat more from now on.

323
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,550
(His Lordship has a well-shaped head.)

324
00:21:32,871 --> 00:21:33,710
Don't kill me.

325
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:34,951
Please don't kill me.

326
00:21:36,951 --> 00:21:37,591
Don't kill me.

327
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:40,470
Please don't kill me.

328
00:21:42,391 --> 00:21:43,030
Don't kill me.

329
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:44,671
Stay away from me.

330
00:22:23,831 --> 00:22:24,591
Don't kill me.

331
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,631
Don't kill me!

332
00:22:30,671 --> 00:22:31,550
Please don't kill me.

333
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:32,831
Don't kill me.

334
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,391
Don't be scared.

335
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,871
My Lord! My Lord, are you all right?

336
00:22:43,911 --> 00:22:44,790
Don't kill me.

337
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,070
Looks like you're safe and sound.

338
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,710
We don't have to worry anymore.

339
00:22:48,151 --> 00:22:48,831
Let's go.

340
00:22:49,191 --> 00:22:50,351
No, don't kill me.

341
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,351
Don't kill me!

342
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,671
Go and decoct some medicine.

343
00:22:57,351 --> 00:22:58,111
Yes, Your Lordship.

344
00:23:03,151 --> 00:23:03,790
No...

345
00:23:23,671 --> 00:23:24,591
The decoction is ready.

346
00:23:25,151 --> 00:23:25,990
Why don't you deliver it?

347
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,191
Me?

348
00:23:29,351 --> 00:23:30,951
I lost my temper the other day

349
00:23:31,111 --> 00:23:32,111
and scared Miss Mu.

350
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:34,351
I didn't know
His Lordship still needed her.

351
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,391
I'm afraid I may mess it up for him.

352
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,030
Just go and do this favor for me.

353
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,631
Hurry. Go quickly.

354
00:23:45,351 --> 00:23:46,431
She has a fever.

355
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,351
Metropolitan examination.

356
00:23:49,431 --> 00:23:50,151
I'm going to be late.

357
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,671
I can't make it for the exam.

358
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,431
Here's the medicine.

359
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,391
Are you expecting me to feed her?

360
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,510
"The benevolent do not doubt;

361
00:24:10,911 --> 00:24:11,911
the wise do not worry,

362
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,111
the virtuous do not fear."

363
00:24:13,831 --> 00:24:15,111
What... What does that mean?

364
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,111
"The virtuous do not fear."

365
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:18,951
She's reciting scriptures

366
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,111
to prepare
for the metropolitan examination.

367
00:24:20,631 --> 00:24:21,671
"The benevolent do not doubt."

368
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:24,911
Don't...

369
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,310
Don't you know how to feed someone?

370
00:24:29,871 --> 00:24:30,790
Zhijian does.

371
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,070
Then, tell him to come inside now.

372
00:24:34,671 --> 00:24:34,951
He...

373
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:36,790
He's

374
00:24:37,431 --> 00:24:38,230
upset.

375
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:39,671
Zhijian

376
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,310
seems cheerful.

377
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,710
But he tends to overthink things.

378
00:24:45,671 --> 00:24:46,671
Let me do it, then.

379
00:24:47,431 --> 00:24:49,070
You can go and comfort him.

380
00:25:01,631 --> 00:25:03,191
Just say it
if you have something to say.

381
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,710
Stop flipping through your notes.

382
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:05,831
Or I'll ignore you.

383
00:25:06,431 --> 00:25:08,351
I'm looking for a phrase

384
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,790
to comfort you.

385
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,871
His Lordship refuses

386
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:25,151
to believe that His Majesty
is behind all this.

387
00:25:26,111 --> 00:25:27,550
He's even willing
to put his life at risk

388
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,351
as a stake.

389
00:25:29,191 --> 00:25:30,270
Fortunately, it ended well.

390
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,230
His Majesty really sent his men
to protect His Lordship.

391
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,510
But this time,

392
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,831
our investigation is in vain again.

393
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,671
We'll get to the bottom eventually.

394
00:25:44,911 --> 00:25:47,191
After news that our father and brothers
had died on the battlefield reached us,

395
00:25:48,351 --> 00:25:49,951
our relatives were too busy
fighting over the family wealth

396
00:25:51,671 --> 00:25:53,191
to care about our lives.

397
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,470
It was His Lordship

398
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,310
who stormed into the residence
on a rainy night

399
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:00,831
and took us both away,

400
00:26:02,871 --> 00:26:04,431
giving us a chance to survive.

401
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:08,671
From that night on,

402
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,191
you could no longer speak,

403
00:26:13,151 --> 00:26:14,151
and I lost my heart.

404
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,030
Yes.

405
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,550
But I never thought about

406
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,671
what His Lordship had lost.

407
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,111
Everything.

408
00:27:16,191 --> 00:27:17,710
My Lord, let me feed her the medicine.

409
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:33,750
Which of you two

410
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,391
can come and feed her?

411
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:41,631
Come here.

412
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:53,550
"It is said..."

413
00:27:54,351 --> 00:27:55,030
"It is said in history,

414
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:58,510
a wise person should speak
and act with caution."

415
00:27:59,591 --> 00:28:00,871
But you're far from cautious
in your words.

416
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,831
Your talk is full of nonsense.

417
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:05,510
"It is said,

418
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,710
to trust the capable without doubt."

419
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,230
"T-Trust the capable without doubt."

420
00:28:20,871 --> 00:28:22,671
How can you still think of currying favor
when having a fever?

421
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,030
This phrase has a well-known meaning.

422
00:28:25,431 --> 00:28:28,310
It indicates that one should trust

423
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,790
and utilize capable individuals
without hesitation.

424
00:28:29,871 --> 00:28:30,631
But, My Lord,

425
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,431
she sounds

426
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:34,111
like she's ironically criticizing.

427
00:28:34,911 --> 00:28:36,671
It sounds like she's saying
that you are...

428
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:37,951
Enough.

429
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,710
Can you stop talking nonsense

430
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:41,871
and focus on feeding her the medicine?

431
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,111
"It is said..."

432
00:28:45,351 --> 00:28:46,030
"It is said,

433
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:49,310
a wise person should speak
and act with caution.

434
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,871
The benevolent do not doubt,

435
00:28:52,391 --> 00:28:53,391
the wise do not worry,

436
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:55,191
the virtuous do not fear."

437
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,470
All right, I get it.

438
00:28:56,671 --> 00:28:57,431
Just drink your medicine.

439
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,911
(Are you sure you want)

440
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,951
to use the rewards granted to you

441
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,191
in exchange for allowing females
to attend the imperial exam?

442
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:18,230
Yes.

443
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:20,030
When I was among the common people,

444
00:29:20,351 --> 00:29:22,790
I witnessed women
with extraordinary talents,

445
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,310
strong character, and determination.

446
00:29:24,391 --> 00:29:25,310
They're no less knowledgeable than men.

447
00:29:25,871 --> 00:29:27,750
But due to outdated beliefs,

448
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,030
they couldn't take an exam

449
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,911
and contribute to the country.

450
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:34,951
Their lives are not easy.

451
00:29:35,391 --> 00:29:36,391
I believe

452
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:39,790
if knowledgeable women
can stand in the court

453
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,591
based on their abilities,

454
00:29:41,591 --> 00:29:43,191
they will be like a flag

455
00:29:43,671 --> 00:29:45,191
for the world to see

456
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,470
and remember.

457
00:29:47,631 --> 00:29:50,631
Over time, their mindset
will gradually change.

458
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:55,470
I ask that you give
women all over the nation a chance

459
00:29:55,671 --> 00:29:57,111
to prove themselves

460
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,631
by allowing them
to attend the imperial exam.

461
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:12,990
(The path of the imperial exams)

462
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:15,631
(is like the rivers and seas
with undercurrents.)

463
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:19,070
(You think that passing the exams
might change your destiny.)

464
00:30:19,671 --> 00:30:22,990
(Yet none of these paths
will be like a stroll.)

465
00:30:30,951 --> 00:30:31,750
Mother?

466
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:39,871
Mother.

467
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:43,270
Mother!

468
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:51,191
Mother,

469
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:54,351
I miss you so much.

470
00:30:57,391 --> 00:30:58,111
Mother,

471
00:30:59,351 --> 00:31:00,270
you were right.

472
00:31:01,191 --> 00:31:02,151
You told me

473
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:03,990
that I must study.

474
00:31:05,151 --> 00:31:05,911
After studying,

475
00:31:06,111 --> 00:31:07,431
I would gain knowledge,

476
00:31:07,871 --> 00:31:09,111
and my understanding will expand.

477
00:31:10,671 --> 00:31:13,351
You also said
that medical knowledge was beneficial.

478
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,750
Even if we can't save anyone's life,

479
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,831
we can still save ourselves
at a critical moment.

480
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:25,831
Mother.

481
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,631
Mother!

482
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,270
Mother!

483
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,310
Mother.

484
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:38,871
Mother.

485
00:31:40,911 --> 00:31:41,671
Mother.

486
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:44,631
I failed to save you.

487
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:47,270
But you saved me.

488
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,550
(I'm your mother.)

489
00:31:50,351 --> 00:31:51,750
(I can even trade my life for you.)

490
00:31:53,351 --> 00:31:54,591
(I was incompetent)

491
00:31:55,671 --> 00:31:57,391
(that you have to strive
for your future on your own.)

492
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,750
(Every parent would plan everything)

493
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,750
(for their children.)

494
00:32:01,911 --> 00:32:02,750
Mother.

495
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:05,790
Mother!

496
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,351
Mother!

497
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,270
Mother,

498
00:32:18,951 --> 00:32:21,831
I will grow up someday.

499
00:32:22,591 --> 00:32:25,951
And I will be a parent someday.

500
00:32:26,591 --> 00:32:28,831
So I must strive for my future myself.

501
00:32:29,871 --> 00:32:30,631
Look at me now.

502
00:32:30,831 --> 00:32:32,790
Am I not in the capital now?

503
00:32:33,431 --> 00:32:35,191
I'll sit
for the metropolitan examination soon.

504
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:36,470
The metropolitan examination...

505
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,510
The metropolitan examination.

506
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,151
I'm going to miss it.

507
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,470
I'm going to miss it.

508
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:42,510
Metropolitan examination!

509
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,191
The metropolitan examination.

510
00:32:47,151 --> 00:32:48,750
We're already on our way back
to the capital.

511
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,911
We're, My Lord?

512
00:33:02,351 --> 00:33:02,710
Hyah!

513
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:03,550
Hyah!

514
00:33:07,911 --> 00:33:08,710
That's great.

515
00:33:09,191 --> 00:33:09,911
That's great.

516
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:11,710
My Lord,

517
00:33:13,631 --> 00:33:14,510
thank you.

518
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:15,790
Thank you very much.

519
00:33:29,151 --> 00:33:30,030
(Could it be)

520
00:33:30,151 --> 00:33:34,230
(that His Lordship looked after me
for the past two days?)

521
00:33:34,871 --> 00:33:35,790
(That's impossible.)

522
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,391
(What virtues or abilities
do I even possess to deserve that?)

523
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:40,911
(The dignified,)

524
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,030
(prestigious,)

525
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,750
(and approachable Lord Ding)

526
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,550
(isn't as arrogant and cruel)

527
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,191
(as rumored.)

528
00:33:54,671 --> 00:33:55,750
(What are you going to do now,)

529
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,710
(Mu Xiaoqi?)

530
00:33:59,111 --> 00:34:00,510
(You even told Mother in your dream)

531
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,111
(that you'd strive
for your own future.)

532
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:06,111
(How can you think
about relying on him now?)

533
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,630
(I used to consider First Prince)

534
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,351
(would be the perfect candidate
for the throne.)

535
00:34:13,271 --> 00:34:15,711
(Lord Ding and First Prince
have a good relationship.)

536
00:34:16,231 --> 00:34:19,630
(Then, Lord Ding
must be a stable support for me.)

537
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:21,231
(But)

538
00:34:21,871 --> 00:34:23,751
(I've overheard shocking secrets)

539
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,831
(and run into powerful individuals)

540
00:34:25,871 --> 00:34:27,271
(who want to take Lord Ding's life.)

541
00:34:28,751 --> 00:34:30,271
(Even if it weren't His Majesty,)

542
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:32,311
(it must be someone prominent.)

543
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:37,030
(So should I rely on him or not?)

544
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,751
(If he abandoned me
in the woods back there,)

545
00:34:43,751 --> 00:34:45,431
(I would betray him without hesitation.)

546
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,470
(But Lord Ding)

547
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,951
(never abandoned me.)

548
00:34:51,911 --> 00:34:53,871
(He even carried me on his back)

549
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,510
(and took care of me in person.)

550
00:34:59,871 --> 00:35:00,751
(Wake up!)

551
00:35:01,231 --> 00:35:04,391
(Come on, don't be soft-hearted.)

552
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:18,351
It looks like you've almost recovered.

553
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,150
My Lord,

554
00:35:24,751 --> 00:35:26,911
we can arrive at the examination hall
on time, right?

555
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:31,070
My Lord, you're the examiner.

556
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,110
So,

557
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,670
you'll definitely
be there on time, right?

558
00:35:35,751 --> 00:35:37,150
I am the examiner,

559
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,070
but if I have another engagement,

560
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,510
I can find someone else to replace me.

561
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,070
So you're not going?

562
00:35:44,951 --> 00:35:45,990
That won't do.

563
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,110
Then, I must get off the carriage

564
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,630
and ride a horse back.

565
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,351
Calm down.

566
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,190
My Lord...

567
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,911
We have one day left. We'll make it.

568
00:35:54,351 --> 00:35:55,150
Wait, My Lord.

569
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,470
If I didn't make it in time
for the examination,

570
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,391
what should I do?

571
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,510
You can sit for the next one.

572
00:36:00,711 --> 00:36:01,670
The next one?

573
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,351
My Lord,

574
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,590
have you ever heard of a folk tale

575
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:13,590
about Cao Cao and Hua Tuo?

576
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:15,590
Yes, I've heard of it.

577
00:36:16,271 --> 00:36:17,831
Do you know the lesson from that story?

578
00:36:18,351 --> 00:36:21,030
Helping others doesn't always lead
to a good outcome.

579
00:36:21,676 --> 00:36:22,357
Enough.

580
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,911
Stop trying to feel me out.

581
00:36:26,231 --> 00:36:27,271
If you fail the examination,

582
00:36:28,351 --> 00:36:29,391
I'll support you for three years.

583
00:36:29,951 --> 00:36:31,871
But what if I can never make it?

584
00:36:32,351 --> 00:36:34,311
Then, I might as well support you
for a lifetime.

585
00:36:40,751 --> 00:36:42,311
What if I do well in the exam?

586
00:36:45,391 --> 00:36:47,751
Then, I'll reward you with a gift.

587
00:36:48,431 --> 00:36:49,550
I get a gift for doing well?

588
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,431
What gift do you want?

589
00:36:51,791 --> 00:36:52,231
I...

590
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,311
Can I have this jade pendant?

591
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,231
Sure.

592
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,470
We shall see how well you do, then.

593
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:09,951
Hyah!

594
00:37:31,035 --> 00:37:33,560
(One day to go)

595
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:37,391
(Metropolitan Examination)

596
00:37:37,391 --> 00:37:38,311
What should I do?

597
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,311
Why is Young Lady not back yet?

598
00:37:45,911 --> 00:37:46,791
This is bad. This is really bad.

599
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:14,835
(Jishan Hall)

600
00:38:17,831 --> 00:38:18,791
Mr. Shen.

601
00:38:25,311 --> 00:38:27,470
Is there anything I can help you with,
Your Highness?

602
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:30,351
It's an important day
for the imperial exam.

603
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,150
I can't ask you to do anything for me.

604
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,391
I'm giving you the Four Treasures
of the Study from Qingzhou

605
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,470
for your exam.

606
00:38:37,711 --> 00:38:38,510
May everything go smoothly.

607
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,070
Your Highness, please rest assured.

608
00:38:45,751 --> 00:38:46,670
For this examination,

609
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,070
I shall not disappoint you.
