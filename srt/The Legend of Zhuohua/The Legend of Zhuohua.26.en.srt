(Adapted from "She Was Once
a Playful Soul" by Sui Yu Er An)

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,940
=Episode 26=

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
(This is a work of fiction.)

20
00:01:51,985 --> 00:01:53,665
What are you and Yan talking about?

21
00:01:55,344 --> 00:01:55,985
Your Majesty?

22
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,144
Your Majesty.

23
00:02:04,545 --> 00:02:06,704
Aren't you supposed to be resting
at your temporary imperial residence?

24
00:02:07,665 --> 00:02:09,385
Why did you suddenly return
at this late hour?

25
00:02:11,424 --> 00:02:13,744
I suddenly remembered
I had forgotten something important.

26
00:02:13,945 --> 00:02:15,024
So I came back to retrieve them.

27
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:17,184
Ridiculous.

28
00:02:18,624 --> 00:02:20,144
If you forgot something,

29
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:23,584
couldn't you have the eunuchs
or the palace maids retrieve it for you?

30
00:02:23,864 --> 00:02:24,864
I was afraid
you wouldn't give it to them

31
00:02:25,225 --> 00:02:26,024
if they came to retrieve it.

32
00:02:30,385 --> 00:02:31,225
Mother,

33
00:02:31,904 --> 00:02:34,105
Yan and I have important matters
to discuss.

34
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,704
We will take our leave first.

35
00:02:37,945 --> 00:02:39,024
Both of you, stop right there.

36
00:02:47,144 --> 00:02:48,945
Since you've already returned,

37
00:02:48,945 --> 00:02:50,505
why are you in such a hurry
to retrieve it?

38
00:02:51,825 --> 00:02:53,624
Now that you're here,

39
00:02:54,864 --> 00:02:57,424
we can see Lord Ding off together.

40
00:02:57,545 --> 00:02:58,225
Mother!

41
00:03:00,424 --> 00:03:01,904
You promised me!

42
00:03:03,304 --> 00:03:05,265
The imperial physician said
you mustn't get agitated.

43
00:03:06,424 --> 00:03:07,105
Your Majesty.

44
00:03:07,545 --> 00:03:09,864
Someone,
summon the imperial physician at once.

45
00:03:10,105 --> 00:03:11,024
No need.

46
00:03:12,505 --> 00:03:13,785
Mother, don't trouble yourself.

47
00:03:14,584 --> 00:03:15,945
What are you saying?

48
00:03:16,744 --> 00:03:19,345
You kept telling me not to get agitated.

49
00:03:20,945 --> 00:03:22,024
But have you thought

50
00:03:23,424 --> 00:03:24,265
where this agitation

51
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,371
comes from?

52
00:03:34,184 --> 00:03:36,505
Heaven watches everything we do.

53
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,385
Nothing can escape the eyes of Heaven.

54
00:03:48,584 --> 00:03:50,065
Your illness is causing you

55
00:03:51,704 --> 00:03:53,505
to speak nonsense.

56
00:03:54,304 --> 00:03:55,024
Your Majesty,

57
00:03:56,345 --> 00:03:58,184
who do you think
Your Majesty is doing this for?

58
00:04:00,545 --> 00:04:02,464
Then, who am I doing it for?

59
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:03,825
For me.

60
00:04:05,105 --> 00:04:05,864
Am I right?

61
00:04:10,904 --> 00:04:12,505
If you didn't return to the palace,

62
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,585
he would have died by now.

63
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:18,905
You were away from the palace

64
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,624
when Lord Ding met a sudden death.

65
00:04:21,944 --> 00:04:23,944
He already has old illnesses.

66
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:27,545
People wouldn't suspect
you were behind it.

67
00:04:30,264 --> 00:04:31,105
Your Majesty,

68
00:04:32,824 --> 00:04:34,384
you finally admitted it.

69
00:04:41,624 --> 00:04:44,264
So what if I was behind it?

70
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,545
You should have died long ago.

71
00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:50,504
If Consort Yun

72
00:04:51,705 --> 00:04:54,465
hadn't cut her belly to give birth
30 years ago,

73
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,145
the one who should've died is you.

74
00:04:59,064 --> 00:05:00,105
If Chen hadn't saved you

75
00:05:00,905 --> 00:05:02,504
five years ago,

76
00:05:02,504 --> 00:05:04,025
you should've died as well.

77
00:05:05,184 --> 00:05:06,905
Why aren't you dead?

78
00:05:12,744 --> 00:05:14,064
He's my younger brother

79
00:05:14,985 --> 00:05:17,264
and the son you raised.

80
00:05:18,424 --> 00:05:19,264
After so many years,

81
00:05:20,345 --> 00:05:21,064
don't you

82
00:05:21,064 --> 00:05:22,705
have even a shred of affection for him?

83
00:05:26,705 --> 00:05:27,424
I don't.

84
00:05:29,264 --> 00:05:30,944
Why would I have any affection for him?

85
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:36,025
His mother

86
00:05:36,824 --> 00:05:38,345
took my husband away.

87
00:05:40,944 --> 00:05:42,585
She finally died.

88
00:05:44,304 --> 00:05:45,585
But your father

89
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:48,145
still wanted to follow her.

90
00:05:49,624 --> 00:05:51,985
If it weren't for the sake
of keeping the late Emperor alive,

91
00:05:53,064 --> 00:05:54,864
I wouldn't have let him live.

92
00:05:57,145 --> 00:05:58,905
So when Father passed away,

93
00:06:00,264 --> 00:06:02,985
you couldn't wait to have Yan dead.

94
00:06:03,624 --> 00:06:05,304
He was only six years old back then.

95
00:06:06,744 --> 00:06:07,864
How could you be so heartless
to have someone

96
00:06:07,864 --> 00:06:10,145
push such a young child
into a cold pond?

97
00:06:16,624 --> 00:06:17,504
Ju.

98
00:06:20,304 --> 00:06:21,864
You're my son.

99
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:26,424
Why do you always side with him
in everything?

100
00:06:27,744 --> 00:06:28,944
In this world,

101
00:06:31,545 --> 00:06:34,705
we can only rely on each other now.

102
00:06:37,424 --> 00:06:38,665
You, your father,

103
00:06:39,864 --> 00:06:41,105
and Chen.

104
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,624
All of you take his side.

105
00:06:45,545 --> 00:06:46,665
Am I doing this...

106
00:06:47,145 --> 00:06:48,504
Am I doing all of this

107
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:51,345
for myself?

108
00:06:53,145 --> 00:06:54,145
But, Mother,

109
00:06:55,944 --> 00:06:57,545
even if you have hatred,

110
00:06:58,944 --> 00:07:01,264
Consort Yun and Father are already dead.

111
00:07:02,424 --> 00:07:04,064
Yan is innocent.

112
00:07:06,624 --> 00:07:07,424
Mother.

113
00:07:13,824 --> 00:07:14,985
So I deserve it?

114
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:19,944
Do I deserve to suffer like this?

115
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:33,384
I had a husband.

116
00:07:34,545 --> 00:07:35,905
Before he died,

117
00:07:37,585 --> 00:07:39,545
his last word for me

118
00:07:41,705 --> 00:07:43,785
was to take care of Liu Yan.

119
00:07:45,345 --> 00:07:46,624
Then he left.

120
00:07:48,025 --> 00:07:49,064
He has found peace

121
00:07:49,985 --> 00:07:51,944
and gone to find his beloved woman.

122
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,105
I treated him as my husband.

123
00:08:02,225 --> 00:08:03,504
But in his heart,

124
00:08:05,145 --> 00:08:06,864
I was just an empress.

125
00:08:07,785 --> 00:08:08,705
I

126
00:08:10,145 --> 00:08:11,985
was never his wife.

127
00:08:19,744 --> 00:08:21,624
If you really love Father,

128
00:08:23,905 --> 00:08:26,384
you shouldn't have killed
the person he cared the most.

129
00:08:40,945 --> 00:08:43,144
When the person
he cared for the most died,

130
00:08:48,345 --> 00:08:50,744
should he also die with her?

131
00:08:53,185 --> 00:08:54,705
Is there nothing else in this world

132
00:08:55,544 --> 00:08:57,105
besides love?

133
00:09:00,264 --> 00:09:01,624
I loved him so much.

134
00:09:03,345 --> 00:09:04,784
But he died.

135
00:09:06,185 --> 00:09:07,985
Yet, I have to keep living

136
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,311
while carrying the burden
of his responsibilities.

137
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:25,945
Not only do I hate him,

138
00:09:27,664 --> 00:09:29,225
but I also look down on him.

139
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,710
(Liu Xi, Late Emperor of Southern Chen)

140
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,624
(Father sent his men multiple times
to make me act.)

141
00:09:41,465 --> 00:09:43,544
(Now she's about to give birth,)

142
00:09:44,185 --> 00:09:45,985
(it's the last chance.)

143
00:09:46,985 --> 00:09:48,544
(His Majesty loved her so dearly.)

144
00:09:49,264 --> 00:09:51,264
(If her son is born,)

145
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:54,784
(won't Ju lose his chance
to become the Crown Prince?)

146
00:09:56,664 --> 00:09:59,425
(But she's also my friend.)

147
00:10:00,465 --> 00:10:02,024
(How could I bear to hurt her?)

148
00:10:13,744 --> 00:10:16,504
(I never thought Father would secretly)

149
00:10:16,504 --> 00:10:18,664
(use Fu Shengru's medicine
behind my back.)

150
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,744
(After Consort Yun died,)

151
00:10:21,384 --> 00:10:24,144
(I was completely pushed
onto a path of no return.)

152
00:10:29,345 --> 00:10:31,585
You could've hated
the late Emperor and Consort Yun

153
00:10:33,225 --> 00:10:34,705
or blamed me.

154
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:36,784
But

155
00:10:37,784 --> 00:10:39,065
you should have never,

156
00:10:39,664 --> 00:10:41,065
ever let your selfishness

157
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:43,305
cause the death of 30,000 soldiers

158
00:10:43,544 --> 00:10:45,425
and shake the foundation
of Southern Chen.

159
00:10:47,264 --> 00:10:48,264
No matter what,

160
00:10:49,345 --> 00:10:50,225
today,

161
00:10:51,305 --> 00:10:52,864
I'm going to seek justice

162
00:10:53,144 --> 00:10:54,384
for the thirty thousand souls
who perished.

163
00:10:56,305 --> 00:10:57,384
Do you have evidence?

164
00:10:59,185 --> 00:11:01,864
Accusing me without proof

165
00:11:02,384 --> 00:11:04,264
is treason.

166
00:11:07,345 --> 00:11:08,105
Your Majesty,

167
00:11:11,744 --> 00:11:13,225
(Edict)
don't you even recognize

168
00:11:13,225 --> 00:11:14,305
your command badge?

169
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,140
(Edict)

170
00:11:42,945 --> 00:11:45,024
It was their fault
for being your subordinates.

171
00:11:49,544 --> 00:11:51,624
They all died because of you.

172
00:11:53,065 --> 00:11:55,185
I had a hold of the map
of your marching route,

173
00:11:55,264 --> 00:11:56,904
and I was struggling to send it out.

174
00:11:57,024 --> 00:11:58,305
But Heaven was on my side.

175
00:12:00,264 --> 00:12:03,225
Xue Xiaotang captured a spy
from Northern Liang.

176
00:12:04,784 --> 00:12:05,945
The map of the marching route

177
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:08,825
still ended up in the hands
of the Northern Liang people.

178
00:12:09,904 --> 00:12:10,784
Tell me.

179
00:12:12,185 --> 00:12:13,784
Is this not fate?

180
00:12:24,825 --> 00:12:25,585
Mother,

181
00:12:27,504 --> 00:12:28,504
just let it go.

182
00:12:29,024 --> 00:12:30,225
At this point,

183
00:12:32,825 --> 00:12:34,384
if I were to back down,

184
00:12:35,185 --> 00:12:37,185
would Liu Yan let me go?

185
00:12:39,144 --> 00:12:41,144
Instead of waiting to be killed,

186
00:12:43,425 --> 00:12:44,985
it's better to eliminate
hidden danger permanently.

187
00:12:48,544 --> 00:12:50,384
You could try that.

188
00:12:55,624 --> 00:12:56,544
There's no need for that anymore.

189
00:12:57,945 --> 00:12:58,904
I've told

190
00:13:01,425 --> 00:13:02,544
all of your men to leave.

191
00:13:08,225 --> 00:13:09,024
Back then,

192
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,784
I was afraid of facing
a situation like today.

193
00:13:15,065 --> 00:13:16,504
So I sent out the Imperial Shadow Guards

194
00:13:18,504 --> 00:13:20,345
to silence anyone

195
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:24,544
who knew the truth.

196
00:13:28,744 --> 00:13:30,544
I'm not a benevolent ruler.

197
00:13:31,705 --> 00:13:34,225
I'm just a selfish
and despicable person.

198
00:13:36,544 --> 00:13:39,024
To protect my closest kin,

199
00:13:39,024 --> 00:13:40,744
I could only pick up the butcher's knife

200
00:13:42,784 --> 00:13:44,384
and kill innocent people.

201
00:14:06,664 --> 00:14:07,465
Mother,

202
00:14:10,345 --> 00:14:13,664
you and Yan
are my most important family.

203
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,904
I can't watch you kill Yan.

204
00:14:16,264 --> 00:14:17,504
But I also don't want Yan
to seek revenge

205
00:14:17,504 --> 00:14:19,664
after knowing the truth.

206
00:14:20,024 --> 00:14:20,705
Mother...

207
00:14:28,225 --> 00:14:28,945
Yan,

208
00:14:31,144 --> 00:14:32,225
can you forgive her?

209
00:14:38,465 --> 00:14:40,105
She killed my mother

210
00:14:41,264 --> 00:14:42,945
and so many people.

211
00:14:44,624 --> 00:14:46,664
Their blood and hatred

212
00:14:47,825 --> 00:14:49,945
are flowing in my veins.

213
00:14:51,384 --> 00:14:52,624
Can I forgive?

214
00:14:53,825 --> 00:14:55,624
Who am I to forgive?

215
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:00,784
Your Majesty,

216
00:15:02,544 --> 00:15:03,744
go and ask those

217
00:15:05,065 --> 00:15:06,705
who are already dead.

218
00:15:24,904 --> 00:15:25,904
You're right.

219
00:15:27,465 --> 00:15:28,904
What right do I have

220
00:15:30,624 --> 00:15:32,425
to tell you to stop your hatred?

221
00:15:41,425 --> 00:15:41,904
Your Majesty!

222
00:15:41,904 --> 00:15:42,345
Ju!

223
00:15:44,784 --> 00:15:45,544
Your Majesty!

224
00:15:45,864 --> 00:15:46,624
Ju!

225
00:15:47,225 --> 00:15:47,904
Ju!

226
00:15:52,945 --> 00:15:53,544
Ju!

227
00:15:53,624 --> 00:15:54,225
Your Majesty.

228
00:15:54,664 --> 00:15:57,985
Ju, what's wrong with you?

229
00:15:58,345 --> 00:15:59,664
I will go
and call the imperial physician.

230
00:16:00,144 --> 00:16:01,585
I'll go and get the imperial physician.

231
00:16:02,425 --> 00:16:03,225
It's already too late.

232
00:16:11,465 --> 00:16:12,305
Yan,

233
00:16:14,384 --> 00:16:15,465
I'm entrusting

234
00:16:16,985 --> 00:16:19,425
both Southern Chen
and my children to you.

235
00:16:21,024 --> 00:16:22,105
Spare Mother.

236
00:16:24,465 --> 00:16:27,544
You must live on.

237
00:16:28,065 --> 00:16:29,144
Ju...

238
00:16:30,225 --> 00:16:30,904
Your Majesty.

239
00:17:02,185 --> 00:17:04,985
(Ciming Hall)

240
00:17:30,385 --> 00:17:31,104
My Lord!

241
00:17:31,665 --> 00:17:32,304
My Lord.

242
00:17:47,104 --> 00:17:48,064
Your Highness.

243
00:18:17,185 --> 00:18:18,064
Your Highness.

244
00:18:20,185 --> 00:18:21,104
Xiaotang.

245
00:18:25,024 --> 00:18:26,544
She's calling my name.

246
00:18:27,905 --> 00:18:29,544
Your Highness... Your Highness!

247
00:18:42,185 --> 00:18:43,744
I never thought

248
00:18:46,465 --> 00:18:49,425
that one day I would be able to meet you

249
00:18:50,385 --> 00:18:52,145
and hold you in my arms openly.

250
00:18:54,504 --> 00:18:57,064
I thought it was something
that'd only happen in dreams.

251
00:18:57,784 --> 00:18:58,584
Rest assured,

252
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:00,824
it's not a dream.

253
00:19:02,425 --> 00:19:03,344
I'm right here.

254
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:06,905
You no longer have to be afraid anymore

255
00:19:08,905 --> 00:19:10,744
because Dowager Empress has confessed...

256
00:19:34,304 --> 00:19:35,665
When we were betrothed,

257
00:19:36,504 --> 00:19:37,945
you said you were willing
to give up your life for me.

258
00:19:39,104 --> 00:19:39,945
Now,

259
00:19:41,504 --> 00:19:42,945
I will fulfill your wish.

260
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:57,344
(Thank you for everything
you've done for me over these years.)

261
00:20:03,705 --> 00:20:04,344
(All these years,)

262
00:20:04,905 --> 00:20:06,344
(you and the Dowager Empress
have colluded together,)

263
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:09,145
(causing countless innocent lives
to suffer.)

264
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,304
(Now, you've come to this ending,)

265
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,264
(you could say it's not unjust.)

266
00:20:45,705 --> 00:20:46,385
My Lord!

267
00:20:46,744 --> 00:20:47,344
My Lord!

268
00:20:51,104 --> 00:20:51,905
How is His Lordship?

269
00:20:53,344 --> 00:20:54,905
Hurry, someone come quickly!
Save His Majesty!

270
00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:56,145
Something happened in the main hall!

271
00:20:56,705 --> 00:20:57,544
Fast, come to His Majesty's aid!

272
00:20:57,665 --> 00:21:00,705
- Save His Majesty!
- Save His Majesty at the main hall!

273
00:21:01,304 --> 00:21:02,024
Someone is heading this way.

274
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:03,504
If they discover us at this moment,

275
00:21:03,784 --> 00:21:04,905
it will be hard for His Lordship

276
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,104
to justify the crime of regicide.

277
00:21:06,225 --> 00:21:08,145
Something happened in the main hall!
Quick, save His Majesty!

278
00:21:08,504 --> 00:21:11,064
Hurry! Save His Majesty!

279
00:21:18,425 --> 00:21:19,064
Your Majesty.

280
00:21:24,865 --> 00:21:25,504
Dowager Empress?

281
00:21:28,064 --> 00:21:28,665
Your Majesty.

282
00:21:39,744 --> 00:21:40,385
Your Majesty...

283
00:21:42,304 --> 00:21:42,985
Your Majesty!

284
00:21:43,465 --> 00:21:46,905
His Majesty has left us!

285
00:21:48,705 --> 00:21:51,665
His Majesty has passed away!

286
00:22:30,584 --> 00:22:31,625
Father?

287
00:22:35,824 --> 00:22:36,824
Father...

288
00:22:42,385 --> 00:22:43,625
Father!

289
00:22:57,225 --> 00:22:58,185
(His Lordship once said)

290
00:22:58,665 --> 00:23:00,425
(the water in the back garden
of Ciming Hall)

291
00:23:00,865 --> 00:23:01,824
(flows to the moat.)

292
00:23:02,705 --> 00:23:03,905
(Under the cover of night,)

293
00:23:04,145 --> 00:23:05,544
(we should be able to make our escape.)

294
00:23:55,585 --> 00:23:58,085
(Ciming Hall)

295
00:24:15,145 --> 00:24:15,985
Ju...

296
00:24:20,185 --> 00:24:21,024
Ju...

297
00:24:25,784 --> 00:24:26,744
Grandmother.

298
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:30,584
Father is gone.

299
00:24:31,024 --> 00:24:32,024
Insolence!

300
00:24:38,304 --> 00:24:39,985
My son isn't dead.

301
00:24:43,784 --> 00:24:45,064
He's still alive.

302
00:24:47,665 --> 00:24:48,625
Grandmother,

303
00:24:50,385 --> 00:24:51,945
stop deceiving yourself.

304
00:24:53,064 --> 00:24:54,504
Father is already gone.

305
00:24:56,104 --> 00:24:57,744
He died because of you.

306
00:24:59,744 --> 00:25:00,824
How dare you?

307
00:25:01,064 --> 00:25:02,104
How insolent...

308
00:25:05,185 --> 00:25:07,304
Father died because of you,

309
00:25:08,225 --> 00:25:09,104
Grandmother.

310
00:25:16,945 --> 00:25:18,024
I see.

311
00:25:20,784 --> 00:25:22,945
Your obedience all this time

312
00:25:24,465 --> 00:25:26,145
was just a pretense.

313
00:25:27,665 --> 00:25:29,465
I've really misjudged the situation.

314
00:25:42,024 --> 00:25:42,865
You wicked child.

315
00:25:48,584 --> 00:25:49,385
Peilan,

316
00:25:50,985 --> 00:25:53,465
drag this wicked child out of here.

317
00:26:15,225 --> 00:26:16,225
Greetings, Your Highness.

318
00:26:17,865 --> 00:26:18,544
You...

319
00:26:28,104 --> 00:26:29,024
The two of you...

320
00:26:29,665 --> 00:26:30,504
Grandmother,

321
00:26:31,905 --> 00:26:33,304
your most trusted Peilan

322
00:26:34,584 --> 00:26:35,824
actually works for me.

323
00:26:45,865 --> 00:26:48,945
Weren't you the orphan
from the Zhou family's branch?

324
00:26:49,385 --> 00:26:51,064
I've always been working for Jishan Hall.

325
00:26:52,225 --> 00:26:52,985
Back then,

326
00:26:53,064 --> 00:26:55,344
if Princess Roujia hadn't taken me in,

327
00:26:56,024 --> 00:26:57,465
I would have been dead now.

328
00:26:58,584 --> 00:26:59,744
You can leave now.

329
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,824
Let me have a proper conversation

330
00:27:03,905 --> 00:27:05,344
with my grandmother.

331
00:27:06,744 --> 00:27:07,304
Yes, Your Highness.

332
00:27:12,985 --> 00:27:14,425
You wicked child.

333
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:16,584
What are you planning to do?

334
00:27:18,225 --> 00:27:19,225
I'm going to...

335
00:27:19,264 --> 00:27:20,104
Going to what?

336
00:27:21,824 --> 00:27:22,985
Execute me?

337
00:27:24,865 --> 00:27:25,784
Grandmother,

338
00:27:26,465 --> 00:27:28,665
you're as heartless as ever.

339
00:27:30,064 --> 00:27:30,985
But I understand why.

340
00:27:31,865 --> 00:27:33,104
If you weren't heartless,

341
00:27:34,385 --> 00:27:35,865
you wouldn't have plotted

342
00:27:36,385 --> 00:27:39,225
to let Uncle die on the battlefield
at Juma River.

343
00:27:46,104 --> 00:27:46,865
Why?

344
00:27:48,945 --> 00:27:50,705
You don't think
I should know about this, right?

345
00:27:54,385 --> 00:27:55,304
Grandmother,

346
00:27:56,185 --> 00:27:58,185
you thought you were the strategist.

347
00:27:59,064 --> 00:28:00,064
But little do you know

348
00:28:01,385 --> 00:28:02,425
that you're merely

349
00:28:03,304 --> 00:28:05,544
a pawn in my hands.

350
00:28:10,705 --> 00:28:12,824
Do you still remember
the spy of Northern Liang?

351
00:28:13,824 --> 00:28:14,824
It was you?

352
00:28:18,344 --> 00:28:19,544
Did you intentionally leak

353
00:28:19,544 --> 00:28:21,104
the information
about the spy of Northern Liang

354
00:28:21,104 --> 00:28:22,824
to me?

355
00:28:23,784 --> 00:28:24,665
Yes, it was me.

356
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,625
I used the intelligence network
of Jishan Hall

357
00:28:29,385 --> 00:28:31,504
to find clues
about the spy of Northern Liang

358
00:28:31,784 --> 00:28:33,104
and informed Xue Xiaotang.

359
00:28:34,064 --> 00:28:35,185
Otherwise, do you think

360
00:28:35,705 --> 00:28:37,145
you could have easily

361
00:28:37,145 --> 00:28:38,865
injured Uncle so severely?

362
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:42,824
Why did you do that?

363
00:28:44,225 --> 00:28:45,304
What do you think?

364
00:28:50,024 --> 00:28:51,145
Over the past five years,

365
00:28:53,185 --> 00:28:55,145
could you have been having nightmares?

366
00:28:58,064 --> 00:29:01,584
Nightmares about unjust spirits
seeking vengeance from you?

367
00:29:05,784 --> 00:29:06,865
In your dreams,

368
00:29:09,304 --> 00:29:10,425
do you see Xing?

369
00:29:16,865 --> 00:29:17,625
Why?

370
00:29:20,185 --> 00:29:21,064
Did you forget?

371
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:30,465
But Xing's daughter remembers everything
very clearly.

372
00:29:43,304 --> 00:29:44,304
Your Majesty,

373
00:29:45,145 --> 00:29:46,504
will the Crown Prince blame me for this

374
00:29:47,264 --> 00:29:48,304
when he returns?

375
00:29:51,784 --> 00:29:54,544
It's just the death
of a lowly maidservant.

376
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,665
(Xing, Princess Roujia's birth mother)

377
00:29:55,665 --> 00:29:56,824
(Xing, Princess Roujia's birth mother)
He'll understand.

378
00:29:56,824 --> 00:29:57,824
(Xing, Princess Roujia's birth mother)

379
00:29:57,824 --> 00:29:59,064
(Xing, Princess Roujia's birth mother)
Compared to a nobody,

380
00:30:00,178 --> 00:30:02,898
the power of noble families
matters the most.

381
00:30:03,145 --> 00:30:03,865
Yes, Your Majesty.

382
00:30:08,584 --> 00:30:09,784
(Back then,)

383
00:30:09,784 --> 00:30:11,385
(to secure Father's position
as Crown Prince,)

384
00:30:12,385 --> 00:30:14,064
(you arranged a high-born lady
for him to marry.)

385
00:30:15,504 --> 00:30:16,945
(You could have arranged it.)

386
00:30:18,225 --> 00:30:20,024
Was my mother in your way?

387
00:30:22,744 --> 00:30:23,985
Just because she was favored?

388
00:30:25,145 --> 00:30:26,945
That's why you heartlessly killed her?

389
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:41,304
It was cramped and dark in the cabinet.

390
00:30:43,225 --> 00:30:44,465
I didn't dare make a sound.

391
00:31:07,304 --> 00:31:08,905
(My mother sacrificed herself
to protect me.)

392
00:31:10,985 --> 00:31:13,584
(How could I
let her earnest efforts go in vain?)

393
00:31:17,225 --> 00:31:18,185
Grandmother,

394
00:31:20,225 --> 00:31:21,705
you made me realize

395
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:25,544
how important power is.

396
00:31:26,905 --> 00:31:28,264
Only when you stand in a high place

397
00:31:29,824 --> 00:31:31,425
can you avoid being bullied.

398
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:34,185
But back then,

399
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:37,744
I didn't even have the ability
to protect myself.

400
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,985
(Mingde Gate)

401
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:44,744
(Father feared I'd meet a tragic end.)

402
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:48,304
(So he asked Grandaunt
to take me to Jiangnan.)

403
00:31:56,865 --> 00:31:57,584
Jiao,

404
00:31:58,145 --> 00:32:01,304
I'm taking you to Jiangnan.

405
00:32:02,425 --> 00:32:04,744
It's much more fun there

406
00:32:05,905 --> 00:32:07,824
with its beautiful mountains
and rivers than in the capital.

407
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:13,024
Stop the carriage.

408
00:32:37,865 --> 00:32:38,784
Come here, my dear.

409
00:32:40,824 --> 00:32:43,104
(Do you know why I grabbed
that handful of soil?)

410
00:32:44,425 --> 00:32:46,145
(It's not an attachment
to the homeland.)

411
00:32:48,145 --> 00:32:50,744
(It's to constantly remind myself)

412
00:32:51,905 --> 00:32:53,304
(that my enemies are here.)

413
00:32:54,385 --> 00:32:55,865
I wanted to come back and seek revenge.

414
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,905
I wanted to make sure
those who treat others as nothing

415
00:33:02,024 --> 00:33:03,544
and bully the weak

416
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:06,504
receive their rightful punishment.

417
00:33:08,225 --> 00:33:10,185
(With the support
of Grandaunt's influence,)

418
00:33:10,577 --> 00:33:11,817
(I established Jishan Hall)

419
00:33:12,665 --> 00:33:15,024
(and helped many unfortunate people
like me.)

420
00:33:15,985 --> 00:33:18,705
(When they hailed me
as a reincarnated goddess,)

421
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:21,584
(I became even more resolute)

422
00:33:22,706 --> 00:33:24,584
to become the ruler of this country.

423
00:33:26,385 --> 00:33:27,784
I want to save more people

424
00:33:29,104 --> 00:33:30,905
and make this country better.

425
00:33:34,824 --> 00:33:36,544
But I've never forgotten

426
00:33:37,945 --> 00:33:39,865
to avenge my poor mother.

427
00:33:44,185 --> 00:33:45,344
After Father ascended the throne,

428
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:47,304
he didn't summon me back to the capital.

429
00:33:49,185 --> 00:33:50,665
After sitting on the throne,

430
00:33:51,425 --> 00:33:52,425
perhaps he had forgotten

431
00:33:52,425 --> 00:33:53,905
he had a daughter like me.

432
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,705
So I had to find my own way.

433
00:34:02,104 --> 00:34:03,024
(That's why)

434
00:34:03,504 --> 00:34:04,665
(I wrote a letter)

435
00:34:05,905 --> 00:34:07,985
(and sent it along
with that handful of soil.)

436
00:34:10,024 --> 00:34:11,265
(After being apart for many years,)

437
00:34:12,345 --> 00:34:14,704
(I missed my beloved family
in the capital.)

438
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:17,345
(How could he refuse)

439
00:34:17,345 --> 00:34:19,504
(my longing as a daughter?)

440
00:34:28,745 --> 00:34:30,024
(You should remember, right?)

441
00:34:31,305 --> 00:34:33,504
(Peilan came to you)

442
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:34,704
(that year.)

443
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:39,745
I released the venomous snake
in the back mountains of Huguo Temple.

444
00:34:40,905 --> 00:34:42,385
It was all to have Peilan

445
00:34:42,985 --> 00:34:44,624
save you from danger.

446
00:34:45,905 --> 00:34:47,504
You've always had deep suspicions

447
00:34:48,385 --> 00:34:50,584
and disdain for the poor.

448
00:34:51,425 --> 00:34:52,184
So,

449
00:34:53,184 --> 00:34:54,985
I had to fabricate a story

450
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:57,985
about her being an orphan
of the Zhou family's branch.

451
00:34:59,385 --> 00:35:00,624
(As expected, you put your guard down)

452
00:35:00,624 --> 00:35:02,224
(and kept her by your side.)

453
00:35:02,905 --> 00:35:03,945
(This way,)

454
00:35:04,825 --> 00:35:07,664
(I had my informant by your side.)

455
00:35:07,825 --> 00:35:09,945
(Whenever there's any unusual movement
from you,)

456
00:35:10,265 --> 00:35:11,865
(Peilan would let me know.)

457
00:35:15,825 --> 00:35:16,745
Grandmother.

458
00:35:17,985 --> 00:35:20,024
To secure Father's position
as the ruler,

459
00:35:20,865 --> 00:35:22,465
you truly resorted to any means.

460
00:35:24,345 --> 00:35:25,144
You even plotted

461
00:35:25,144 --> 00:35:27,064
to have Uncle die on the battlefield

462
00:35:27,664 --> 00:35:29,425
during his war campaign
against Northern Liang.

463
00:35:32,345 --> 00:35:33,825
But I still need to thank you.

464
00:35:34,825 --> 00:35:37,624
(I was worried about not finding
an opportunity for revenge.)

465
00:35:38,785 --> 00:35:42,425
(I heard Xue Xiaotang
has always admired me.)

466
00:35:43,624 --> 00:35:44,345
(Indeed,)

467
00:35:44,905 --> 00:35:46,465
(I only used a little trick,)

468
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:48,104
(and he took the bait.)

469
00:35:53,465 --> 00:35:56,865
Are you satisfied with him, Roujia?

470
00:36:00,104 --> 00:36:01,745
(According to
Jishan Hall's intelligence,)

471
00:36:02,825 --> 00:36:04,224
(I learned that Xue Xiaotang)

472
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:07,184
(has been colluding with you
and the Zhou family.)

473
00:36:08,785 --> 00:36:11,704
All the dirty deals have never stopped.

474
00:36:13,544 --> 00:36:14,745
Only this time,

475
00:36:15,865 --> 00:36:19,385
your pawn became mine.

476
00:36:21,184 --> 00:36:24,024
(Upon hearing about
my mother's tragic death at your hands,)

477
00:36:24,785 --> 00:36:28,024
(he willingly became the blade
in my hand.)

478
00:36:30,624 --> 00:36:31,985
The Dowager Empress summoned me
to the palace today.

479
00:36:34,184 --> 00:36:35,425
She ordered me to kill Lord Ding...

480
00:36:39,504 --> 00:36:41,104
and not to stay on the battlefield.

481
00:36:44,104 --> 00:36:45,265
(He told me)

482
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:48,024
(about your conspiracy to kill Uncle)

483
00:36:48,825 --> 00:36:51,144
(and bury the thirty thousand soldiers
along with him.)

484
00:36:53,584 --> 00:36:55,064
But you had no way

485
00:36:55,664 --> 00:36:58,184
to deliver the map of the marching route
to Northern Liang.

486
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:00,425
So,

487
00:37:01,104 --> 00:37:03,064
I could only lend you a hand.

488
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,704
After Jishan Hall discovered
the spy of Northern Liang,

489
00:37:09,425 --> 00:37:10,664
I concealed the matter

490
00:37:11,704 --> 00:37:13,504
and secretly informed Xue Xiaotang.

491
00:37:14,945 --> 00:37:15,745
As expected,

492
00:37:16,305 --> 00:37:17,825
you thought Heaven was on your side

493
00:37:18,385 --> 00:37:21,345
and you successfully delivered the map
to Northern Liang.

494
00:37:23,425 --> 00:37:24,905
Xue Xiaotang also promised me

495
00:37:25,985 --> 00:37:27,385
that after it was all over,

496
00:37:27,985 --> 00:37:29,345
he would testify against you.

497
00:37:30,425 --> 00:37:31,345
Even if

498
00:37:32,704 --> 00:37:34,745
Father wanted to protect you,

499
00:37:35,745 --> 00:37:37,024
the crime of treason

500
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:40,210
would be hard to conceal.

501
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,865
If it weren't for your deep sins,

502
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:50,544
those thirty thousand soldiers
wouldn't have died.

503
00:37:56,985 --> 00:37:58,825
With this token,

504
00:37:59,905 --> 00:38:03,504
the Zhou family will be
at your beck and call.

505
00:38:07,865 --> 00:38:09,144
Originally,

506
00:38:09,305 --> 00:38:11,305
I had everything under control.

507
00:38:12,985 --> 00:38:13,985
Unexpectedly...

508
00:38:17,584 --> 00:38:18,544
It was such a pity.

509
00:38:20,184 --> 00:38:21,825
To protect you,

510
00:38:23,024 --> 00:38:25,504
Father sent the Imperial Shadow Guards
to silence Xue Xiaotang

511
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:29,745
to cover up your crimes,

512
00:38:30,425 --> 00:38:31,865
leaving no traces behind.

513
00:38:33,024 --> 00:38:36,905
And Uncle miraculously survived.

514
00:38:38,624 --> 00:38:39,624
Everything was ruined.

515
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:41,865
So I could only return to Jiangnan

516
00:38:42,584 --> 00:38:43,544
(Mingde Gate)
(to lay low.)

517
00:38:47,064 --> 00:38:49,184
(Under the pretext
of mourning for Xue Xiaotang)

518
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,785
(and not wanting to be reminded
of past memories,)

519
00:38:52,544 --> 00:38:53,905
(I returned to Jiangnan again.)
