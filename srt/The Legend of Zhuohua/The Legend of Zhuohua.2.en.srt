(Adapted from "She Was Once
a Playful Soul" by Sui Yu Er An)

=Episode 2=

19
00:01:44,935 --> 00:01:47,910
(This is a work of fiction.)

20
00:01:54,235 --> 00:01:56,474
Young Lady, are you sure this will work?

21
00:01:56,754 --> 00:01:57,435
Yes.

22
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:02,354
All right.

23
00:02:13,474 --> 00:02:14,514
Greetings, mister.

24
00:02:17,395 --> 00:02:17,954
Wait.

25
00:02:19,354 --> 00:02:21,555
Please get Miss Yun and me some tea.

26
00:02:29,995 --> 00:02:31,155
Mister, please have a seat.

27
00:02:31,914 --> 00:02:32,674
You can drop the formalities.

28
00:03:04,674 --> 00:03:07,595
This tea

29
00:03:08,035 --> 00:03:09,474
smells like the tender buds of Banta.

30
00:03:09,794 --> 00:03:12,514
I'm surprised you know this tea
from the remote countryside.

31
00:03:12,995 --> 00:03:14,995
It's my second time drinking this tea.

32
00:03:17,995 --> 00:03:19,234
I still remember back

33
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,835
when my close friend
had a birthday feast.

34
00:03:22,555 --> 00:03:23,835
He poured tea for me

35
00:03:24,634 --> 00:03:25,875
and said

36
00:03:26,194 --> 00:03:27,674
all he wanted in this life

37
00:03:28,514 --> 00:03:29,595
was to have his wife
and daughter by his side

38
00:03:29,954 --> 00:03:31,115
and achievements to his name.

39
00:03:31,954 --> 00:03:35,354
This friend seems to
hold great importance to you.

40
00:03:39,674 --> 00:03:41,155
I thought I'd never get to

41
00:03:41,395 --> 00:03:43,194
drink this tea again in my life.

42
00:03:45,674 --> 00:03:47,474
Miss, are you not curious

43
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:50,754
about my friend's name?

44
00:03:52,354 --> 00:03:54,595
May I know what is his name?

45
00:03:57,074 --> 00:03:58,354
His last name is Yuan.

46
00:04:04,754 --> 00:04:05,354
Young Lady,

47
00:04:05,674 --> 00:04:07,995
I'll go to the kitchen
and check on those dishes.

48
00:04:18,994 --> 00:04:19,914
Miss Yuan,

49
00:04:20,755 --> 00:04:21,835
I hope you're well.

50
00:04:23,674 --> 00:04:25,155
Since you came for me,

51
00:04:26,674 --> 00:04:28,354
there's no need to involve others.

52
00:04:48,395 --> 00:04:49,474
Lord Ding.

53
00:04:51,434 --> 00:04:52,994
Your tactics

54
00:04:53,474 --> 00:04:54,515
are clever.

55
00:04:55,474 --> 00:04:58,075
But hiding out like this

56
00:04:58,794 --> 00:05:00,674
isn't a good long-term strategy.

57
00:05:01,354 --> 00:05:02,674
As long as I can survive,

58
00:05:04,075 --> 00:05:05,114
that's the best strategy.

59
00:05:09,715 --> 00:05:11,595
The thirty thousand soldiers
from five years ago

60
00:05:12,554 --> 00:05:14,075
also wanted to survive.

61
00:05:15,395 --> 00:05:17,314
What happened five years ago
has nothing to do with me.

62
00:05:18,955 --> 00:05:20,515
I'm just a courtesan,

63
00:05:21,595 --> 00:05:22,955
less than a dog.

64
00:05:24,794 --> 00:05:26,314
Why won't you leave me alone?

65
00:05:26,595 --> 00:05:27,715
It's not that I won't.

66
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:29,755
But I can't.

67
00:05:32,474 --> 00:05:34,195
Someone else is responsible for this.

68
00:05:35,354 --> 00:05:37,195
Lord Ding, you've got the wrong person.

69
00:05:38,874 --> 00:05:40,275
Even ants strive to live.

70
00:05:41,234 --> 00:05:42,195
If you want to survive,

71
00:05:44,474 --> 00:05:45,755
of course, it's fine.

72
00:05:48,195 --> 00:05:49,635
I don't think I'm the only one

73
00:05:51,234 --> 00:05:52,635
who's desperately trying
to survive here.

74
00:05:55,794 --> 00:05:57,395
(Tan Lin)
Take His Lordship and go!

75
00:05:57,395 --> 00:05:58,155
(Deputy General
of the Southern Chen Cangwu Army)

76
00:05:58,155 --> 00:05:58,835
Tan Lin.

77
00:06:03,635 --> 00:06:04,554
My Lord,

78
00:06:05,474 --> 00:06:06,635
you must stay alive.

79
00:06:12,234 --> 00:06:13,234
You're right.

80
00:06:14,075 --> 00:06:16,755
Isn't it laughable
for someone of your high status

81
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:18,794
to accuse me like this?

82
00:06:19,314 --> 00:06:21,554
Whether it's funny or desperate,

83
00:06:23,155 --> 00:06:24,354
I will make sure

84
00:06:24,955 --> 00:06:26,275
to seek the justice that's due.

85
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,314
If Yuan Chengming was wronged,

86
00:06:30,755 --> 00:06:32,914
I will seek justice for him.

87
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:36,155
And your mother, Ms. Zhao.

88
00:06:37,515 --> 00:06:39,035
I will find her for you as well.

89
00:06:43,515 --> 00:06:44,195
All right.

90
00:06:46,554 --> 00:06:47,515
I'll tell you.

91
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:52,874
My father was loyal and brave
all his life.

92
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:55,794
He would never betray his country.

93
00:06:57,114 --> 00:06:59,515
Someone used my mother
and my life to threaten him.

94
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:10,314
My Lord!

95
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:24,114
Help me.

96
00:07:25,354 --> 00:07:26,195
Help me.

97
00:07:26,635 --> 00:07:28,234
I don't want to die.

98
00:07:28,955 --> 00:07:29,914
I don't want to...

99
00:07:36,715 --> 00:07:37,515
Yun Xiangyue.

100
00:07:44,674 --> 00:07:45,554
(She was poisoned.)

101
00:07:48,354 --> 00:07:48,794
My Lord.

102
00:07:50,874 --> 00:07:51,554
You should leave first.

103
00:07:52,994 --> 00:07:55,114
Guard Yun Xiangyue's body

104
00:07:56,554 --> 00:07:58,674
and don't touch her blood.

105
00:07:58,955 --> 00:07:59,434
Yes, My Lord.

106
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:57,475
I... I am a physician.

107
00:08:57,475 --> 00:08:58,834
Please don't kill me!

108
00:08:58,834 --> 00:08:59,475
I'm a physician

109
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:00,794
who can treat you.

110
00:09:02,995 --> 00:09:03,794
Please don't kill me.

111
00:09:34,515 --> 00:09:35,594
His qi and blood are surging.

112
00:09:37,554 --> 00:09:39,155
Seems like he's under the effect
of an aphrodisiac.

113
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:41,475
Many meridians are congested,

114
00:09:42,794 --> 00:09:45,115
like old ailments.

115
00:09:48,275 --> 00:09:50,475
Xiaoqin Pleasure House's madam
sure is inhumane.

116
00:09:51,155 --> 00:09:52,914
Despite your old age and weak vitality,

117
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:55,035
she even made you take an aphrodisiac
to serve your guests.

118
00:10:02,794 --> 00:10:04,314
Sniff this first.

119
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,475
It can relieve the heat in your body

120
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,155
and help you fall asleep.

121
00:10:17,035 --> 00:10:19,395
This pill can generate body fluids,
reduce heat,

122
00:10:19,395 --> 00:10:20,275
nourish Yin, and replenish qi.

123
00:10:20,714 --> 00:10:21,714
It targets your symptoms.

124
00:10:22,235 --> 00:10:22,834
Eat it.

125
00:10:29,235 --> 00:10:30,355
It's your life.

126
00:10:30,395 --> 00:10:31,275
Forget it if you don't want it.

127
00:10:50,314 --> 00:10:51,714
Consider yourself lucky

128
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,314
to run into someone as kind as me.

129
00:10:57,674 --> 00:10:58,794
Look at this. Look.

130
00:10:59,275 --> 00:10:59,995
Look.

131
00:11:04,194 --> 00:11:05,194
Stop being suspicious.

132
00:11:05,475 --> 00:11:06,395
Can you trust me now?

133
00:11:06,954 --> 00:11:07,554
Here.

134
00:11:07,794 --> 00:11:08,475
Eat it.

135
00:11:12,275 --> 00:11:13,834
Remove your inner clothing.
I'll give you acupuncture.

136
00:11:22,035 --> 00:11:22,954
Why aren't you undressing?

137
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,035
Your customers can see your body,

138
00:11:33,074 --> 00:11:34,275
but not a physician?

139
00:11:35,035 --> 00:11:36,515
Treat me as a customer, then.

140
00:11:42,395 --> 00:11:43,954
Come on, I'll perform acupuncture.

141
00:11:57,074 --> 00:11:58,155
(Undergarment?)

142
00:12:09,235 --> 00:12:09,995
I...

143
00:12:11,594 --> 00:12:12,155
You...

144
00:12:12,834 --> 00:12:15,035
Please bear with it a bit
and try not to move.

145
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:16,954
I'll be gentle.

146
00:12:22,194 --> 00:12:23,755
It might hurt a bit.

147
00:12:23,995 --> 00:12:25,194
Bear with it a little.

148
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,035
Did that hurt you?

149
00:12:37,554 --> 00:12:38,794
I'll be gentler.

150
00:12:39,035 --> 00:12:39,954
I'll be gentler.

151
00:12:54,755 --> 00:12:57,755
We can remove the needles
after one hour.

152
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,135
(He Xin, Captain of the Falcon Squad)

153
00:13:24,914 --> 00:13:26,434
Guard her.
I'll go and find His Lordship.

154
00:13:38,714 --> 00:13:41,155
If you follow this prescription
and take it for half a month,

155
00:13:41,235 --> 00:13:42,235
it will show improvement.

156
00:13:42,954 --> 00:13:44,155
Do your old injuries

157
00:13:44,434 --> 00:13:45,434
cause your joints to ache

158
00:13:45,714 --> 00:13:47,275
when it rains or snows?

159
00:13:48,115 --> 00:13:50,355
You must always make sure
to keep yourself warm.

160
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,155
The needle marks might hurt a bit.

161
00:13:57,515 --> 00:13:58,635
But it'll be fine by tomorrow.

162
00:14:09,554 --> 00:14:11,635
If you have health issues,

163
00:14:12,035 --> 00:14:13,235
you can find me at Flower Alley.

164
00:14:14,194 --> 00:14:15,875
Miss Song Yun knows where I live.

165
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:30,554
My Lord.

166
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:36,594
Forgive me for coming late.

167
00:14:37,635 --> 00:14:38,434
I had no idea

168
00:14:39,314 --> 00:14:41,714
I looked like a male prostitute.

169
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:45,914
Did the person who just left say that?

170
00:14:46,794 --> 00:14:47,635
I'll go and kill her.

171
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:48,755
Come back.

172
00:14:53,155 --> 00:14:53,794
My Lord,

173
00:14:54,635 --> 00:14:57,594
the assassins killed themselves
with poison.

174
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:02,035
Suicide warriors.

175
00:15:03,395 --> 00:15:04,995
We've been searching for Yuan Chengming
for so many years.

176
00:15:05,314 --> 00:15:06,554
We finally obtained some clues.

177
00:15:07,434 --> 00:15:08,875
But the clues directed us

178
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,155
to the suicide warriors' ambush.

179
00:15:11,395 --> 00:15:12,635
This strange thing
is when Your Lordship left,

180
00:15:12,674 --> 00:15:13,995
they didn't pursue you.

181
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:15,515
Instead, they were focused

182
00:15:15,635 --> 00:15:16,995
on taking Yun Xiangyue's body.

183
00:15:17,115 --> 00:15:19,355
It wasn't the assassins
who wanted to kill me,

184
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:22,554
but the poison on Yun Xiangyue's body.

185
00:15:33,714 --> 00:15:34,914
You didn't allow us to touch

186
00:15:34,914 --> 00:15:35,875
Yun Xiangyue's body.

187
00:15:36,755 --> 00:15:39,635
Could the poison on her body
be transmitted through blood?

188
00:15:40,235 --> 00:15:42,115
Could finding out how she was poisoned

189
00:15:42,434 --> 00:15:43,515
lead us to new clues?

190
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:48,755
Never mind that.

191
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:50,995
Let's return to the residence for now.

192
00:15:51,515 --> 00:15:52,635
What about Yun Xiangyue's body?

193
00:15:55,314 --> 00:15:55,995
Leave it.

194
00:15:58,275 --> 00:16:00,314
Tell the Capital Governor
to investigate those

195
00:16:00,515 --> 00:16:02,554
who have visited Xiaoqin Pleasure House.

196
00:16:04,115 --> 00:16:06,275
It's easier for him
to investigate it compared to us.

197
00:16:07,035 --> 00:16:07,674
Also,

198
00:16:08,914 --> 00:16:11,115
search Yun Xiangyue's room

199
00:16:11,235 --> 00:16:12,475
to see if there are any clues.

200
00:16:12,954 --> 00:16:13,594
Yes, My Lord.

201
00:16:16,395 --> 00:16:19,035
That female physician
saved my life just now.

202
00:16:20,475 --> 00:16:22,314
She came in a timely manner.

203
00:16:23,794 --> 00:16:25,194
We need to investigate

204
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:26,355
if she's really a physician

205
00:16:26,794 --> 00:16:28,155
or part of the plot.

206
00:16:29,314 --> 00:16:29,875
Zhimo,

207
00:16:30,635 --> 00:16:31,875
I'm assigning this task to you.

208
00:16:49,714 --> 00:16:50,395
Juli,

209
00:16:50,954 --> 00:16:52,395
how did you fall asleep standing here?

210
00:16:53,434 --> 00:16:55,475
Young Lady, you're finally back.

211
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:57,194
Have you been standing here
the whole time?

212
00:16:58,155 --> 00:16:59,115
Didn't you tell me

213
00:16:59,115 --> 00:17:00,395
to stand still here?

214
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:01,155
Silly girl,

215
00:17:01,155 --> 00:17:02,074
you can move now.

216
00:17:02,235 --> 00:17:02,755
Come on, let's go.

217
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:03,475
That's great.

218
00:17:04,074 --> 00:17:04,554
Come.

219
00:17:04,554 --> 00:17:05,915
I was standing here without moving.

220
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:07,594
- You can move now.
- I couldn't even find you.

221
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:08,715
Everything's fine now.

222
00:17:08,915 --> 00:17:10,074
I was so worried.

223
00:17:10,235 --> 00:17:11,074
Sit down.

224
00:17:11,995 --> 00:17:13,634
I want to show you

225
00:17:13,675 --> 00:17:15,675
something nice.

226
00:17:18,435 --> 00:17:19,195
What is this?

227
00:17:19,195 --> 00:17:20,314
It's a silver ingot.

228
00:17:21,114 --> 00:17:21,915
Young Lady,

229
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,755
you got money when you went out.

230
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:24,634
We have money now.

231
00:17:24,634 --> 00:17:25,594
We have money.

232
00:17:27,275 --> 00:17:28,035
Young Lady,

233
00:17:28,435 --> 00:17:30,074
why do you still have this mole?

234
00:17:31,755 --> 00:17:32,794
I forgot to wipe it off just now.

235
00:17:33,675 --> 00:17:34,394
This won't do.

236
00:17:34,475 --> 00:17:35,915
I'll go and get some water
for you to wipe it off.

237
00:17:36,235 --> 00:17:38,554
What if this unlucky mole affects me?

238
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:40,515
It's a mole that brings ill fate
to the husband.

239
00:17:40,874 --> 00:17:41,874
Are you my husband?

240
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:43,354
Silly girl.

241
00:17:44,554 --> 00:17:46,394
I'll go get some water
for you to wash up, then.

242
00:17:46,394 --> 00:17:47,235
It must be tiring for you.

243
00:17:47,235 --> 00:17:48,195
Be careful.

244
00:17:50,915 --> 00:17:51,755
Don't run.

245
00:17:52,035 --> 00:17:52,794
Okay.

246
00:18:08,435 --> 00:18:09,834
(It was such a restless night.)

247
00:18:18,074 --> 00:18:18,675
My Lord,

248
00:18:19,594 --> 00:18:20,435
put on a cloak.

249
00:18:20,955 --> 00:18:21,715
Don't catch a cold.

250
00:18:24,475 --> 00:18:26,114
How's the situation in Zhuozhou?

251
00:18:26,834 --> 00:18:29,114
He Xin has led the Falcon Squad
to Tiantong Mountain.

252
00:18:29,435 --> 00:18:30,634
We should receive news soon.

253
00:18:33,035 --> 00:18:33,995
There is another thing.

254
00:18:35,874 --> 00:18:36,834
Fifteen minutes ago,

255
00:18:37,195 --> 00:18:39,594
Yun Xiangyue's maid
suddenly spat blood and died.

256
00:18:41,195 --> 00:18:43,195
Her symptoms indicate poisoning.

257
00:18:46,235 --> 00:18:47,554
They sure are ruthless.

258
00:18:48,675 --> 00:18:50,114
They did not even spare her.

259
00:19:35,314 --> 00:19:37,554
(This stone is not heavy at all.)

260
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:12,515
(All right.)

261
00:20:14,915 --> 00:20:15,874
(My pastry is ready.)

262
00:20:45,354 --> 00:20:46,275
Are you hurt?

263
00:20:49,074 --> 00:20:50,834
I was not attracted to your looks.

264
00:20:51,235 --> 00:20:52,675
I was trying to save you.

265
00:20:52,955 --> 00:20:53,834
I... I was saving you.

266
00:20:55,874 --> 00:20:56,715
Is it time for breakfast?

267
00:21:01,515 --> 00:21:02,154
Juli,

268
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,554
someone's knocking on the door.
Go get the door.

269
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,394
Coming!

270
00:21:09,275 --> 00:21:10,074
Coming.

271
00:21:13,394 --> 00:21:14,554
You are...?

272
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:15,834
Is Mu Zhuohua staying here?

273
00:21:18,755 --> 00:21:19,394
Sir,

274
00:21:19,874 --> 00:21:21,874
I... I am Mu Zhuohua.

275
00:21:22,154 --> 00:21:23,554
All right, come with us.

276
00:21:25,794 --> 00:21:26,475
Get out of the way.

277
00:21:27,675 --> 00:21:29,035
Why are you arresting her for no reason?

278
00:21:29,035 --> 00:21:30,114
We didn't do anything wrong.

279
00:21:31,394 --> 00:21:33,394
Last night, there was a murder
at Xiaoqin Pleasure House.

280
00:21:33,634 --> 00:21:34,675
Everyone who was there

281
00:21:34,675 --> 00:21:35,594
needs to be questioned.

282
00:21:37,354 --> 00:21:38,915
It's all right. Don't worry.

283
00:21:39,475 --> 00:21:41,475
I'm just going to cooperate
with the investigation,

284
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:43,435
and I'll come back
after answering some questions.

285
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:44,035
Young Lady,

286
00:21:44,235 --> 00:21:46,114
you must be careful by yourself.

287
00:21:47,834 --> 00:21:50,715
Official investigations
are fair and impartial.

288
00:21:50,755 --> 00:21:51,475
Am I right?

289
00:21:51,955 --> 00:21:52,874
I'll be back very soon.

290
00:21:53,394 --> 00:21:53,995
Don't worry.

291
00:21:58,335 --> 00:22:00,074
(Imperial Physician Zhao,
Southern Chen's Imperial Physician)

292
00:22:00,074 --> 00:22:03,394
The poison has been suppressed.

293
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:04,915
You are fine now.

294
00:22:05,715 --> 00:22:06,715
Thank you, Imperial Physician Zhao.

295
00:22:08,554 --> 00:22:09,955
I slept well last night.

296
00:22:12,794 --> 00:22:13,715
I wonder

297
00:22:14,314 --> 00:22:16,554
if it's because of this sachet.

298
00:22:22,915 --> 00:22:26,955
Besides the usual sandalwood,

299
00:22:27,114 --> 00:22:28,074
this sachet

300
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:30,955
also contains cloves, acorus gramineus,
and borneol.

301
00:22:31,314 --> 00:22:33,515
It not only soothes the mind

302
00:22:33,955 --> 00:22:36,634
but also helps with sleep.

303
00:22:37,035 --> 00:22:40,074
My Lord, you can use it without worries.

304
00:22:41,154 --> 00:22:41,874
All right.

305
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,410
(Capital Governor's Residence)

306
00:22:49,755 --> 00:22:51,275
(Capital Governor)
You're also a provincial graduate, huh?

307
00:22:51,435 --> 00:22:52,634
Yes, sir.

308
00:22:52,874 --> 00:22:54,594
You're a scholar, huh?

309
00:22:55,275 --> 00:22:56,515
As a lady,

310
00:22:56,755 --> 00:22:58,314
why are you at Xiaoqin Pleasure House
at that hour?

311
00:22:58,834 --> 00:22:59,794
Sir,

312
00:23:00,955 --> 00:23:02,594
I was there for a medical visit.

313
00:23:02,955 --> 00:23:04,475
Miss Song Yun
from Xiaoqin Pleasure House

314
00:23:04,475 --> 00:23:05,475
can testify.

315
00:23:06,035 --> 00:23:08,235
After you tell me what happened that day

316
00:23:08,634 --> 00:23:09,915
and if there's nothing suspicious,

317
00:23:10,235 --> 00:23:11,874
I would naturally not
make things difficult for you.

318
00:23:13,834 --> 00:23:15,634
Around 7 PM last night,

319
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:19,035
Miss Song Yun of Xiaoqin Pleasure House
came to me for help.

320
00:23:19,354 --> 00:23:20,554
So I packed my medical box

321
00:23:20,794 --> 00:23:21,915
and went with her.

322
00:23:22,195 --> 00:23:23,515
It takes about a quarter of an hour

323
00:23:23,515 --> 00:23:24,675
to walk from where I stay

324
00:23:24,874 --> 00:23:27,074
to Xiaoqin Pleasure House.

325
00:23:28,515 --> 00:23:29,634
(Adviser)
Well, did you know

326
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:32,195
(Southern Chen's Capital Prefecture)
Miss Yun Xiangyue, who you had treated,

327
00:23:32,435 --> 00:23:33,834
died from poison last night?

328
00:23:38,035 --> 00:23:38,794
Miss Yun...

329
00:23:41,314 --> 00:23:42,554
She's dead?

330
00:23:45,035 --> 00:23:46,314
The timing is quite coincidental.

331
00:23:46,594 --> 00:23:48,394
Did you poison her
during this opportune moment?

332
00:23:51,915 --> 00:23:53,955
They choose a top courtesan every year.

333
00:23:54,394 --> 00:23:55,515
But your health...

334
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:56,995
Yes, they choose
a top courtesan every year.

335
00:23:58,035 --> 00:23:59,995
But the chance to be the top courtesan
for the month

336
00:24:01,715 --> 00:24:02,834
comes only once.

337
00:24:03,834 --> 00:24:04,594
Ms. Mu,

338
00:24:04,955 --> 00:24:06,074
are you the killer?

339
00:24:07,794 --> 00:24:08,715
Sir, please investigate this wisely.

340
00:24:08,915 --> 00:24:11,475
I traveled far from home
to sit for the imperial examination.

341
00:24:11,715 --> 00:24:13,755
It's also my first time in the capital.

342
00:24:13,955 --> 00:24:15,035
And I only

343
00:24:15,114 --> 00:24:16,955
met Miss Yun yesterday.

344
00:24:17,074 --> 00:24:18,114
We have no grudges or conflicts.

345
00:24:18,114 --> 00:24:19,475
I have no reason to harm her.

346
00:24:21,475 --> 00:24:24,035
Then, did you see anyone suspicious

347
00:24:24,515 --> 00:24:25,995
or hear anything suspicious?

348
00:24:38,114 --> 00:24:41,715
I wouldn't dare to pry
in a place like that.

349
00:24:42,235 --> 00:24:43,554
If it weren't to treat someone,

350
00:24:44,435 --> 00:24:46,114
I wouldn't go to such a place.

351
00:24:52,035 --> 00:24:52,995
Imperial Physician Zhao,

352
00:24:54,154 --> 00:24:56,794
please take a look at the prescription
I have here.

353
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:03,554
Brilliant.

354
00:25:03,874 --> 00:25:04,354
Absolutely brilliant.

355
00:25:05,394 --> 00:25:08,154
This physician is bold
in the use of medicine.

356
00:25:08,435 --> 00:25:10,554
The dosage is absolutely precise.

357
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:11,794
A little less would be ineffective.

358
00:25:12,354 --> 00:25:13,874
A little more
would be harmful to health.

359
00:25:14,874 --> 00:25:15,475
My Lord,

360
00:25:16,794 --> 00:25:19,675
you've encountered
an incredible healer.

361
00:25:21,275 --> 00:25:22,755
Just by pure coincidence.

362
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:26,834
I shall take my leave, then.

363
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:35,715
It looks like this prescription

364
00:25:36,955 --> 00:25:41,114
uses the Imperial Academy of Medicine's
method back then.

365
00:25:41,755 --> 00:25:42,834
You mean

366
00:25:43,634 --> 00:25:46,035
the decapitated incompetent physicians

367
00:25:47,275 --> 00:25:48,834
who failed to save your mother?

368
00:25:51,275 --> 00:25:52,074
Chen,

369
00:25:53,314 --> 00:25:56,275
you tend to be extreme
in your judgments.

370
00:25:58,114 --> 00:26:01,114
A healer should be bold yet careful.

371
00:26:01,515 --> 00:26:03,354
If one is overly cautious

372
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,955
and uses only mild remedies,

373
00:26:06,554 --> 00:26:07,515
it works for minor illnesses.

374
00:26:08,475 --> 00:26:09,475
But

375
00:26:09,874 --> 00:26:11,035
what about serious illness?

376
00:26:13,535 --> 00:26:18,995
(Capital Governor's Residence)

377
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:19,675
Young Lady.

378
00:26:20,634 --> 00:26:21,675
Young Lady, I was worried sick.

379
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:22,794
Are you all right?

380
00:26:22,794 --> 00:26:23,634
I'm fine.

381
00:26:23,755 --> 00:26:25,435
I was worried
they might punish you severely.

382
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:26,435
No, they won't.

383
00:26:26,634 --> 00:26:27,995
I'm at least a scholar

384
00:26:27,995 --> 00:26:29,515
who doesn't kneel
before officials easily.

385
00:26:29,634 --> 00:26:31,195
They won't resort to torture easily.

386
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:32,794
They just called me in

387
00:26:32,955 --> 00:26:35,035
to ask some questions. So don't worry.

388
00:26:35,154 --> 00:26:35,915
I'm glad to hear that.

389
00:26:51,354 --> 00:26:52,074
Young Lady.

390
00:26:53,275 --> 00:26:53,955
Young Lady,

391
00:26:54,554 --> 00:26:55,154
here.

392
00:26:55,394 --> 00:26:57,154
Eat something to get rid of bad luck.

393
00:26:57,634 --> 00:26:59,915
The capital's pork trotter noodles
are particularly delicious.

394
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,435
They taste different
from the Huaizhou flavor.

395
00:27:01,435 --> 00:27:02,715
Come and try them.

396
00:27:05,955 --> 00:27:07,154
What's wrong, Young Lady?

397
00:27:07,675 --> 00:27:09,955
You haven't been yourself
since leaving the yamen today.

398
00:27:12,314 --> 00:27:13,475
I was just thinking

399
00:27:14,475 --> 00:27:17,515
about how Yun Xiangyue
must have fought hard to survive

400
00:27:18,515 --> 00:27:20,915
even at the brothel.

401
00:27:21,554 --> 00:27:22,354
But in the end,

402
00:27:25,154 --> 00:27:26,515
she didn't even get a chance
to plead for herself.

403
00:27:27,394 --> 00:27:28,314
Young Lady,

404
00:27:28,675 --> 00:27:29,834
did you really see her?

405
00:27:36,314 --> 00:27:37,275
She had a tough life.

406
00:27:38,554 --> 00:27:39,235
Young Lady,

407
00:27:39,394 --> 00:27:41,314
do you know
who killed the top courtesan?

408
00:27:43,114 --> 00:27:44,035
Listen.

409
00:27:58,185 --> 00:28:00,154
(Pretend to understand,
someone is on the roof.)

410
00:28:00,154 --> 00:28:02,995
Juli, what was your question just now?

411
00:28:04,554 --> 00:28:05,275
Young Lady,

412
00:28:05,275 --> 00:28:07,634
can you tell me
who killed the top courtesan?

413
00:28:08,235 --> 00:28:09,114
Come closer to me.

414
00:28:13,675 --> 00:28:14,915
You must never tell anyone about this.

415
00:28:50,675 --> 00:28:52,874
Juli, get some rest.

416
00:28:53,794 --> 00:28:55,755
No, I must protect you.

417
00:28:55,755 --> 00:28:57,114
What if something happens?

418
00:29:11,874 --> 00:29:13,594
Miss Mu, please come with me.

419
00:29:13,834 --> 00:29:14,755
You have a patient waiting for you.

420
00:29:15,074 --> 00:29:15,915
Who are you?

421
00:29:16,195 --> 00:29:17,834
Why should she go with you?

422
00:29:18,594 --> 00:29:20,314
Juli, I think it's going
to be all right this time.

423
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:23,394
I'm ready. We can go now.

424
00:29:24,154 --> 00:29:24,995
No, Young Lady.

425
00:29:25,435 --> 00:29:26,475
Take me with you.

426
00:29:26,554 --> 00:29:27,354
I'll protect you.

427
00:29:27,354 --> 00:29:27,995
I'm very strong.

428
00:29:27,995 --> 00:29:29,435
You'll be safer with me around.

429
00:29:29,874 --> 00:29:30,874
Okay, you must listen to me, then.

430
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:31,594
Follow me.

431
00:29:31,594 --> 00:29:32,675
Okay, I'll follow you.

432
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:37,634
Don't you want to know
where you're going?

433
00:29:39,354 --> 00:29:40,394
I'll go anywhere

434
00:29:40,554 --> 00:29:42,435
as long as a patient is waiting for me.

435
00:29:43,394 --> 00:29:44,675
Don't you want to know
who that patient is?

436
00:29:45,874 --> 00:29:46,874
I don't discriminate
against my patients.

437
00:29:49,475 --> 00:29:50,755
Aren't you afraid it's a trap?

438
00:29:52,235 --> 00:29:54,275
I'm penniless and unarmed.

439
00:29:54,354 --> 00:29:55,554
If you had any ill intentions,

440
00:29:55,755 --> 00:29:56,675
you would have acted already.

441
00:30:04,794 --> 00:30:06,874
Don't you have anything to ask me?

442
00:30:08,955 --> 00:30:10,154
Even if I do,

443
00:30:10,715 --> 00:30:12,114
you wouldn't tell me.

444
00:30:13,834 --> 00:30:14,554
Let's go.

445
00:30:14,874 --> 00:30:15,594
He's so fierce.

446
00:30:19,135 --> 00:30:21,985
(Lord Ding's Residence)

447
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:32,834
Juli, wait for me here.

448
00:30:43,154 --> 00:30:45,114
My Lord, please spare me.

449
00:30:46,235 --> 00:30:48,554
When did you find out about my identity?

450
00:30:50,035 --> 00:30:51,035
Your Lordship,

451
00:30:52,634 --> 00:30:54,074
I found out last night.

452
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:59,154
What gave my identity away?

453
00:31:06,235 --> 00:31:07,195
Well, Your Lordship.

454
00:31:08,554 --> 00:31:09,435
First of all,

455
00:31:10,074 --> 00:31:11,874
it was the calluses on your hands.

456
00:31:12,755 --> 00:31:15,755
They're on the purlicues and palms,

457
00:31:16,235 --> 00:31:18,955
and these marks are left
by years of using weapons

458
00:31:19,275 --> 00:31:20,554
like spears, blades, and bows.

459
00:31:21,354 --> 00:31:23,435
Your Lordship's finger joints
are strong.

460
00:31:24,314 --> 00:31:25,515
Though the calluses are still there,

461
00:31:25,794 --> 00:31:28,314
they've clearly thinned.

462
00:31:29,275 --> 00:31:31,035
This shows exceptional martial skills
in the past.

463
00:31:32,235 --> 00:31:33,314
But it's been a while
since they were practiced.

464
00:31:35,314 --> 00:31:36,235
Secondly,

465
00:31:37,035 --> 00:31:39,634
there's a grim scar
on Your Lordship's back.

466
00:31:40,074 --> 00:31:42,634
(It indicates a deep wound.)

467
00:31:43,874 --> 00:31:45,114
(But it has healed remarkably well,)

468
00:31:45,834 --> 00:31:48,074
(leaving only a faint mark.)

469
00:31:48,554 --> 00:31:50,195
Such effects are rarely achieved
without extraordinary medicine.

470
00:31:51,275 --> 00:31:52,794
To use such good medicine,

471
00:31:54,074 --> 00:31:55,554
one must have a high status.

472
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:58,475
Thirdly,

473
00:31:59,235 --> 00:32:02,435
the clothes Your Lordship wore
didn't fit.

474
00:32:02,915 --> 00:32:04,554
They were obviously not yours.

475
00:32:05,634 --> 00:32:07,955
And the attire that truly belongs to you

476
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:10,515
is...

477
00:32:11,394 --> 00:32:12,515
It's...

478
00:32:12,675 --> 00:32:13,594
What?

479
00:32:15,554 --> 00:32:16,475
Undergarment.

480
00:32:32,074 --> 00:32:32,955
Keep talking.

481
00:32:35,035 --> 00:32:38,554
The fabric used
for your undergarment is a tribute.

482
00:32:40,354 --> 00:32:41,955
It's produced
by a Jiangnan silk workshop.

483
00:32:42,435 --> 00:32:44,035
Only a few can afford such material.

484
00:32:44,715 --> 00:32:46,195
And the fragrance on you

485
00:32:46,594 --> 00:32:48,314
is the priceless agarwood scent.

486
00:32:48,955 --> 00:32:49,955
It's a rare treasure
from the Southern Dynasties

487
00:32:50,074 --> 00:32:51,195
that can soothe and relieve pain.

488
00:32:52,235 --> 00:32:53,275
Taking all

489
00:32:54,154 --> 00:32:55,394
of these four points into account,

490
00:32:55,634 --> 00:32:56,634
there's only one person
in the entire world

491
00:32:58,594 --> 00:32:59,874
who matches these descriptions.

492
00:33:00,995 --> 00:33:01,915
In that case,

493
00:33:03,995 --> 00:33:06,035
you recognized me long ago.

494
00:33:07,634 --> 00:33:10,675
Yet, you deliberately
put on an act before me.

495
00:33:18,554 --> 00:33:20,154
A commoner like me fears death

496
00:33:20,394 --> 00:33:21,794
and wants to escape trouble.

497
00:33:22,755 --> 00:33:26,235
It seems Your Lordship is kind-hearted.

498
00:33:26,475 --> 00:33:28,515
You wouldn't execute

499
00:33:28,515 --> 00:33:29,675
a kind-hearted physician.

500
00:33:34,035 --> 00:33:35,354
Did you say a kind physician

501
00:33:35,354 --> 00:33:36,995
who fears death?

502
00:33:38,114 --> 00:33:39,715
Why didn't you add

503
00:33:40,074 --> 00:33:43,154
eloquence and audacious behavior?

504
00:33:46,435 --> 00:33:48,594
Since you acted
as if you didn't recognize me,

505
00:33:49,675 --> 00:33:53,074
why did you deliberately hide the truth

506
00:33:53,634 --> 00:33:55,114
of seeing me in the woodshed

507
00:33:55,475 --> 00:33:57,154
when the Capital Governor
was questioning you?

508
00:33:58,154 --> 00:33:59,634
I presumed

509
00:33:59,995 --> 00:34:01,475
your men were observing secretly

510
00:34:01,675 --> 00:34:02,634
when the Capital Governor

511
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:04,435
was questioning me.

512
00:34:05,035 --> 00:34:06,035
If I had told the truth

513
00:34:06,435 --> 00:34:08,274
about encountering
an injured man that day,

514
00:34:08,554 --> 00:34:09,234
first of all,

515
00:34:09,475 --> 00:34:11,274
Xiaoqin Pleasure House wouldn't be able
to find out who that was.

516
00:34:11,554 --> 00:34:12,754
I wouldn't be able to explain it.

517
00:34:13,315 --> 00:34:14,035
Secondly,

518
00:34:14,714 --> 00:34:16,995
your men might have killed me

519
00:34:17,395 --> 00:34:19,795
from the shadow

520
00:34:19,835 --> 00:34:20,754
before I could finish my sentence.

521
00:34:21,634 --> 00:34:23,114
And since I didn't say anything,

522
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:25,714
your men would probably know

523
00:34:25,835 --> 00:34:27,515
that I had already recognized
Your Lordship.

524
00:34:28,074 --> 00:34:28,795
At the same time,

525
00:34:30,594 --> 00:34:32,515
it would attract deadly consequences.

526
00:34:32,995 --> 00:34:34,274
So after you returned,

527
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:37,274
you pretended to tell your maidservant

528
00:34:39,435 --> 00:34:40,875
that you knew who the murderer was.

529
00:34:42,154 --> 00:34:42,995
Yes.

530
00:34:43,835 --> 00:34:45,194
To find out the murderer's identity,

531
00:34:45,435 --> 00:34:46,274
your men

532
00:34:46,395 --> 00:34:48,035
wouldn't kill me on the spot.

533
00:34:48,714 --> 00:34:50,754
Once I get to meet Your Lordship,

534
00:34:51,315 --> 00:34:53,395
I'd have

535
00:34:54,315 --> 00:34:55,194
a glimmer of hope.

536
00:34:55,554 --> 00:34:57,634
Why do you think
your life will be spared

537
00:34:58,154 --> 00:34:59,395
after meeting me?

538
00:35:03,074 --> 00:35:04,875
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

539
00:35:05,674 --> 00:35:08,234
Although my life is of little value,

540
00:35:08,435 --> 00:35:11,114
I still wanted to take a chance.

541
00:35:17,435 --> 00:35:18,915
Since you're so clever,

542
00:35:19,194 --> 00:35:20,194
why not guess

543
00:35:21,674 --> 00:35:23,475
whether you can
leave this place alive today?

544
00:35:25,194 --> 00:35:27,194
Your Lordship didn't kill me yesterday.

545
00:35:27,355 --> 00:35:30,594
So I know you're a compassionate person.

546
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:34,634
I... I'm an honest person.

547
00:35:35,114 --> 00:35:36,315
I go to Xiaoqin Pleasure House

548
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,554
just to make a living.

549
00:35:39,234 --> 00:35:40,835
You were stationed at the border
for many years.

550
00:35:41,114 --> 00:35:42,194
You know the hardships
of the common people.

551
00:35:42,754 --> 00:35:44,315
I'm sure you'll understand my plight.

552
00:35:49,234 --> 00:35:51,554
You might be able
to deceive the Capital Governor.

553
00:35:52,475 --> 00:35:53,915
But you can't fool me

554
00:35:54,114 --> 00:35:55,194
that easily.

555
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:56,995
Every word I say is true.

556
00:35:56,995 --> 00:35:58,154
I have no intention to deceive you.

557
00:36:04,035 --> 00:36:06,435
I can tell from your complexion

558
00:36:06,754 --> 00:36:09,274
that you seem a bit better
than yesterday.

559
00:36:10,274 --> 00:36:13,795
Perhaps the medicine I gave you did work.

560
00:36:16,554 --> 00:36:18,194
If you don't mind,

561
00:36:18,435 --> 00:36:20,674
I'm willing to work hard to serve you.

562
00:36:21,995 --> 00:36:23,035
Work hard to serve me?

563
00:36:25,835 --> 00:36:26,835
Do you know

564
00:36:27,995 --> 00:36:30,315
once you're associated with me...

565
00:36:38,274 --> 00:36:39,714
My Lord. My Lord.

566
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:43,674
My Lord,

567
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:45,915
pressing the acupoint in your chest area

568
00:36:46,154 --> 00:36:48,395
can temporarily relieve your cough
and chest pain.

569
00:37:01,355 --> 00:37:02,594
Combining it with the acupoint
between your thumb and forefinger

570
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:06,074
can temporarily alleviate
your current discomfort.

571
00:37:18,114 --> 00:37:19,634
You're indeed a compassionate physician

572
00:37:22,154 --> 00:37:23,714
who doesn't care about worldly norms.

573
00:37:25,835 --> 00:37:26,955
If I cared about worldly norms

574
00:37:27,315 --> 00:37:29,355
in the woodshed yesterday,

575
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,395
I'm afraid

576
00:37:31,754 --> 00:37:33,955
you wouldn't have the energy
to interrogate me.

577
00:37:50,915 --> 00:37:52,475
(The legend says
Lord Ding is as wise as a fox,)

578
00:37:53,114 --> 00:37:55,835
(proud and aloof as a wolf,
and steadfast as a tiger.)

579
00:37:56,355 --> 00:37:58,035
(I didn't expect him to be so dashing.)

580
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:12,875
What were you thinking about?

581
00:38:13,435 --> 00:38:14,035
I...

582
00:38:15,475 --> 00:38:17,035
I wasn't thinking about anything.

583
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,634
Don't try to do anything funny
in front of me.

584
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:23,754
Or you'll lose your head.

585
00:38:27,355 --> 00:38:28,435
I was just thinking

586
00:38:29,955 --> 00:38:30,754
that

587
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:33,835
you're good-looking.

588
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:38,995
Forgive me for being ignorant.

589
00:38:39,754 --> 00:38:40,835
What a smooth-talker.

590
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:44,035
You have an honest appearance.

591
00:38:44,674 --> 00:38:45,754
But you're pretty cunning.

592
00:38:48,795 --> 00:38:50,634
That's because you don't know me.

593
00:38:50,955 --> 00:38:52,234
You'll know soon enough

594
00:38:52,674 --> 00:38:53,955
that I'm an honest person

595
00:38:54,154 --> 00:38:55,554
both inside and out.

596
00:38:56,475 --> 00:38:58,554
I may be cunning.

597
00:38:59,274 --> 00:39:01,395
But I have a pretty good heart.

598
00:39:06,035 --> 00:39:06,875
