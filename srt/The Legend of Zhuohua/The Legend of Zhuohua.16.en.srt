(Xiaoqin Pleasure House)

21
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,800
Gentlemen,

22
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,640
it wasn't us
who couldn't afford to lose,

23
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,520
but Southern Chen.

24
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,680
Northern Liang will definitely win.

25
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,960
Northern Liang will triumph!

26
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,080
Lord Ding,

27
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,000
you came uninvited
and disrupted our merriment.

28
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,960
Is this how Southern Chen
treats its guests?

29
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,560
Why?

30
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,680
Prince Yemu,
you were usually keen to see

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,040
if I would still be good
at drinking and combat.

32
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,920
I have specially come
to invite you for a drink today.

33
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,840
Yet, you seem disinterested.

34
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,240
Ladies,

35
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,440
let's go.

36
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,040
Prince Yemu,

37
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,520
don't you want to ask

38
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,280
why I've come to you today?

39
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,120
I would never imagine

40
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,680
there would be a day
when you and I share a drink like this.

41
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,520
You were poisoned with Yuanluo Flower.

42
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,480
Yet, you managed to survive.

43
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,320
Southern Chen is vast

44
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,040
and filled
with countless skilled physicians.

45
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,160
The mere Yuanluo Flower poison
is nothing.

46
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,200
Seeing that I'm still alive,

47
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,560
it must be truly

48
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,920
disappointing to you.

49
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,640
Haha!

50
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,080
Why would I be disappointed?

51
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,760
I'm only a little surprised.

52
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,000
I've always thought the generals
of Southern Chen

53
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,360
were valiant

54
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,840
and would rather die than be dishonored.

55
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,840
However, you shamelessly live
until today

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,440
when all your trusted elite soldiers

57
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,640
perished long ago.

58
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,520
When we faced each other back then,

59
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,200
I saw you bravely slaying enemies
without regard for your life.

60
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,520
But now,

61
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,520
you value your life so much, Lord Ding.

62
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,160
Prince Yemu,

63
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,440
have you ever tasted human blood?

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,080
You've asked the right person.

65
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,880
Of course, I have.

66
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,960
Me too.

67
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,200
It was scalding hot,

68
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,520
carrying the scent of iron and rust.

69
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,200
He was my subordinate

70
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,440
and my mentor.

71
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,240
I remember from the first day
I joined the army,

72
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,520
it was him

73
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,880
who led me

74
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,680
and guided me.

75
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,480
At that time,

76
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,800
he cut his own wrist.

77
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,880
He squeezed my cheek,

78
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,960
and his blood flowed

79
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,600
into my mouth.

80
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,040
When his blood had cooled down,

81
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,320
another comrade came.

82
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,560
On the battlefield,

83
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,920
he could entrust his back to me.

84
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,520
(In the face of life and death,)

85
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,720
(he chose to entrust his life to me.)

86
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,880
(After that,)

87
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,440
(I lost consciousness.)

88
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,600
(I can't recall)

89
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,920
how many of them
had offered their blood and lives

90
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,880
to me.

91
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,560
Prince Yemu,

92
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,600
if you carried the weight

93
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,560
of so many lives on your shoulders,

94
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,360
you wouldn't be willing to die either.

95
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,160
You've seen through my strategy

96
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,680
and laid an ambush for me.

97
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,200
Someone within the army
must have tipped you off.

98
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,280
And this person holds a high position.

99
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,440
Later,

100
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,920
I was unconscious with severe injuries.

101
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,320
The morale of our army was low.

102
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,120
But you didn't seize the opportunity

103
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,080
to launch a counterattack

104
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,000
and achieve a major victory
by attacking us from both sides.

105
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,400
This could have been used
as a bargaining chip

106
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,600
to negotiate for more favorable terms.

107
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,480
So I believe the person

108
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,360
who tipped you off

109
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,040
wasn't under your control.

110
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,800
It's even possible

111
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,840
that you don't know who the guy was.

112
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,280
Prince Yemu,

113
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,720
let's make a deal.

114
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,560
If you tell me everything you know,

115
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,080
I promise

116
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,560
not to invade Northern Liang
for ten years.

117
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,720
What kind of deal is this?

118
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,640
Do you think I'll be afraid

119
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,880
if you invade us?

120
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,000
Well, I believe

121
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,120
you will be afraid.

122
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,600
Lord Ding

123
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,560
didn't age

124
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,720
as you hoped.

125
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,400
And our First Prince

126
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,160
is young

127
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,920
and hostile toward Northern Liang.

128
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,680
Moreover,

129
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,120
Your Highness

130
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,080
seems eager to return to Northern Liang.

131
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,920
What do you mean?

132
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,480
Has something significant happened

133
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,680
in the royal camp of Northern Liang?

134
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,360
Or else, why would you

135
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,960
be in such a hurry
to pack your belongings?

136
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,400
You're currently here.

137
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,680
Inside the royal camp,

138
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,960
only the First Prince
and the Second Prince are present.

139
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,880
This is a very unfavorable situation

140
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,280
for you.

141
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,280
Lord Ding, since you are so magnanimous,

142
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,160
I might as well make a deal with you.

143
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,400
The person who tipped me off

144
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,000
was Xue Xiaotang.

145
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,880
He has been hiding in Northern Liang.

146
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,120
Up until this peace negotiation,

147
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,400
he disguised himself as a mute slave
and stayed by my side.

148
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,640
Lord Ding,

149
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,600
are you satisfied

150
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,000
with this great gift?

151
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,040
Haha!

152
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,720
My Lord,

153
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,440
it's clear that Yemu Jing
doesn't really want to make a deal.

154
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,760
But he wants to disrupt Southern Chen's
internal affairs on purpose.

155
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,560
You've also noticed that?

156
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,080
This person is ambitious

157
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,200
and is not someone who advocates peace.

158
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,640
I don't trust him.

159
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,360
He wants to return and fight for power
with two of his elder brothers.

160
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,760
But he couldn't
let Southern Chen become stronger.

161
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,840
That's why he mentioned Xue Xiaotang,

162
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,880
hoping to sow discord
within Southern Chen.

163
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,400
But how could I
grant his wish?

164
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,680
My Lord, I'm glad

165
00:11:44,146 --> 00:11:45,226
you're sensible about this.

166
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,400
At least this matter

167
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,800
has some initial results.

168
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,600
Now, it seems

169
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,640
that Xue Xiaotang
is one of the main culprits

170
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,040
behind the war at Juma River.

171
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,880
He's the Grand General of the Nation.

172
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,840
In Southern Chen, his prestige
was extremely high.

173
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,640
Back then, he went to war with me
to fight against Northern Liang.

174
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,080
The reason the Northern Liang Army

175
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,920
was able to ambush us unexpectedly

176
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,000
must have been
because he threatened Yuan Chengming

177
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,360
to obtain the marching map,

178
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,240
leading to our defeat.

179
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,520
My Lord,

180
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,320
the political scene is clear,
and the world is at peace.

181
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,360
All hidden matters

182
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,040
will eventually come to light

183
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,200
as long as you don't give up.

184
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,120
My Lord,

185
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,240
you've already done a great job.

186
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,880
What he betrayed

187
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,880
was his dignity as a human.

188
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,040
It's not related to you.

189
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,240
The peace negotiation
will definitely succeed after today.

190
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,080
I'm genuinely happy for you.

191
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,800
Since I'm done with my task,

192
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,880
I shall take my leave now.

193
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,000
Why are you trying to run off again?

194
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,040
You've been avoiding me lately.

195
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,960
Am I a terrifying beast?

196
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,240
You're not a terrifying beast.

197
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,480
You just make me feel restless.

198
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,520
What?

199
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,760
Nothing. Nothing, My Lord.

200
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,640
It's just that I need some quiet time

201
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,440
to calm down.

202
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,160
My Lord, farewell.

203
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,520
Restless?

204
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,920
(Why is she avoiding me?)

205
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,430
(Laiyuan Relay Station)

206
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,400
Jing,

207
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,160
are you really going back?

208
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,320
If I don't return,

209
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,920
I'm afraid I won't even
have a chance to compete.

210
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:38,793
But we've gained nothing

211
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,440
from this peace negotiation.

212
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,240
I've already lit the fire.

213
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,040
Remember

214
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,320
to add fuel to the fire
at the right moment.

215
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,760
We must let the fire burn
hotter and hotter

216
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,880
until it's uncontrollable.

217
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,120
Jing, are you talking
about the mute slave?

218
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,480
I understand it now.

219
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,960
You've been living comfortably
in Southern Chen.

220
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,720
But never forget our people

221
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,680
who suffer back home.

222
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,920
I won't forget.

223
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,440
But...

224
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,240
As long as we can ignite this fire,

225
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,600
the type of fuel

226
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,520
doesn't matter, right?

227
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,360
Of course.

228
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,600
That scoundrel Yemu Jing

229
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,480
has finally dragged himself back
to Northern Liang with his lackeys.

230
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,480
You're Southern Chen's Crown Prince.

231
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,240
Mind your language
when speaking in public.

232
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,840
If not for Southern Chen's dignity,

233
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,640
I would have surely

234
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,640
knocked his teeth out.

235
00:16:06,193 --> 00:16:08,673
Now that Southern Chen
and Northern Liang have formed an alliance

236
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,120
and ceased hostilities,

237
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,000
the people at the border

238
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,960
can finally enjoy peaceful days.

239
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,240
You're right.

240
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,520
Lord Ding is indeed ingenious

241
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,920
to disrupt Yemu Jing's negotiations

242
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,440
by using the King
of Northern Liang's illness.

243
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,040
By creating this distraction,

244
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,000
Yemu Jing became restless

245
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,800
and eager to leave.

246
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,280
Surely, he would have to agree

247
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,880
to all the conditions proposed
by Southern Chen.

248
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,720
Lord Ding is truly skilled

249
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,400
at making people restless.

250
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,800
Jinghong? Ms. Mu?

251
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,040
(Oh, no. What should I do?)

252
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,720
- Greetings, Lord Ding, Your Highness.
- Greetings, Lord Ding, Your Highness.

253
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,080
(To block a formidable opponent,)

254
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,920
(I can only seek help
from another formidable figure.)

255
00:16:59,193 --> 00:17:02,033
Your Highness, how is your leg injury?

256
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,840
It's a lot better now.

257
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,560
Thank you for asking.

258
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,920
Ms. Mu, your medical skills
are truly remarkable.

259
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,160
Why have you been avoiding me?

260
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,840
I...

261
00:17:34,913 --> 00:17:35,793
I haven't been avoiding you.

262
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,320
Uncle, when has she ever avoided you?

263
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,280
By the way,

264
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,720
I have something
to discuss with you, Ms. Mu.

265
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,360
Grandmother had Father

266
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,600
remove your teaching position.

267
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,880
His Majesty knows

268
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,320
I've been busy entertaining
the diplomatic corps

269
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,520
and was being considerate of me.

270
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,560
That's why His Majesty relieved me
from such duties.

271
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,400
Mr. Shen.

272
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,520
I have to discuss
an important matter with you.

273
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,120
Come with me.

274
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,480
Your Highness,
I'll take my leave for now.

275
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,400
You don't always have to
be considerate of others

276
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,120
or speak up for others.

277
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,720
Your Highness, I'm flattered.

278
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,080
I'm not a revengeful
or ungrateful person.

279
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,360
About the previous incident,

280
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,120
I've misunderstood you.

281
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,120
I also know

282
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,000
the teaching position
holds great importance for officials.

283
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,280
I've discussed it with Father.

284
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,160
You can return
to continue teaching anytime.

285
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,520
Your Highness, you...

286
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,360
What about me?

287
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,560
Your Highness,
you treat others sincerely.

288
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,960
It is an honor for me

289
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
and a blessing for the world.

290
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,240
(So this is the reason
why you're distancing yourself from me.)

291
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,520
My Lord, what is it that you wanted
to discuss with me?

292
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,760
Never mind.
We'll discuss it another day.

293
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,320
Uncle, she complimented me.

294
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,600
Mu Zhuohua said

295
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,400
I always treat people sincerely.

296
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,280
When have you not
treated people sincerely?

297
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,480
Uncle, you were right.

298
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,360
Mu Zhuohua does have great potential.

299
00:20:41,193 --> 00:20:42,193
She truly understands me.

300
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,200
I'm not like that two-faced Liu Yu.

301
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,360
During the peace negotiation
with Northern Liang,

302
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,360
she contributed a lot.

303
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,800
So I asked Father

304
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,560
to resume Mu Zhuohua's
teaching position.

305
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,640
Did she agree?

306
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,440
I think so.

307
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,800
It's not a bad thing, after all.

308
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,280
Uncle,

309
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,000
Mu Zhuohua found a clue
about Yemu Jing's intentions to leave.

310
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,160
Aren't you planning

311
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,360
to reward her in some way?

312
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,720
No.

313
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,440
"Official Shen Jinghong
of the Ministry of Revenue

314
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,280
shall be promoted
to Primary Fifth-Rank Director.

315
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,760
This decree takes effect

316
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,480
on the 27th day of the 4th month,
the 24th year of the Zhaoming Reign.

317
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,680
Granted by His Majesty."

318
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,760
My thanks for His Majesty's benevolence.

319
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,320
"Official Mu Zhuohua
of the Ministry of Rites

320
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,000
shall be promoted
to Primary Sixth-Rank Administrator.

321
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,720
This decree takes effect

322
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,120
on the 27th day of the 4th month,
the 24th year of the Zhaoming Reign.

323
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,040
Granted by His Majesty."

324
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,480
My thanks for His Majesty's benevolence.

325
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,520
Ms. Mu, your promotion

326
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
wouldn't have happened
without Lord Ding's support.

327
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,320
I understand.

328
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,040
Thank you for reminding me, sir.

329
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,680
You sure pick up fast.

330
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,680
By the way,

331
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,920
tomorrow is Lord Ding's rest day.

332
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,600
It's a perfect chance for you to visit
and thank him in person.

333
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,680
I will.

334
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,840
My Lord,

335
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,200
since it's your rest day,

336
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,440
why not take a herbal bath later?

337
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,720
All right.

338
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,680
My Lord,

339
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,360
Mu wishes to see you.

340
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,200
No.

341
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,000
Yes.

342
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,120
Wait.

343
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,280
Let her in.

344
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,200
Let's see what excuse

345
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,640
she'll come up with this time.

346
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,400
Greetings,

347
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,000
My Lord.

348
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,200
Nowadays,

349
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,800
you don't visit me
unless there's something important.

350
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,760
I'm here to thank Your Lordship
for helping me develop my potential.

351
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,080
But I don't know how to repay you.

352
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,800
I remember

353
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,360
you appreciate calligraphy,

354
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,400
and I've heard that Wenxin Pavilion

355
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,360
has stocked up a batch
of extremely precious ink stones.

356
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,080
So I bought one as a gift for you.

357
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,160
Please accept it, My Lord.

358
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,720
I'm sure you spent a fortune on this.

359
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,400
But it's rare for you to do this.

360
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,560
I feel grateful to you, My Lord.

361
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,920
This ink stone is just
a small token of appreciation.

362
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,360
A few days ago,

363
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,960
First Prince mentioned to me

364
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,440
about requesting you

365
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,160
to resume your teaching duties.

366
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,840
What are your thoughts?

367
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,000
Whether I leave or stay,

368
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,320
I shall let Your Lordship
and His Highness decide.

369
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,480
I've already told you

370
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,080
not to get involved
in the princes' conflicts.

371
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,800
Why won't you remember?

372
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,520
I do remember.

373
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,320
You're aware

374
00:25:36,806 --> 00:25:39,126
that First Prince is most likely
to succeed to the throne.

375
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,080
So you approach him,
trying to please him.

376
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,720
Haven't you learned your lesson

377
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,120
after the fight
between the princes back then?

378
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,160
If you get close to First Prince,

379
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,320
the other two princes will target you.

380
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,200
At that time,

381
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,640
your life will always be in danger.

382
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,680
(I know it's dangerous.)

383
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,280
(But I'm more afraid of losing myself
because of you.)

384
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,280
My Lord, you're right.

385
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,760
So...

386
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,000
You still insist on resuming
your teaching position?

387
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,880
(How can I tell you)

388
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,080
(the reason I want to keep
this teaching position)

389
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,920
(is to stay away from you?)

390
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,800
Why?

391
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,240
You don't even dare to answer now?

392
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,400
(I just don't know how to answer.)

393
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,400
(I'm afraid of being troubled by this
and affecting my future.)

394
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,800
It looks like

395
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,600
you've already made up your mind.

396
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,640
My Lord,

397
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,120
- I...
- Never mind.

398
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,000
You may go now.

399
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,440
I don't want to say anything more.

400
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,960
Young Lady, you're back.

401
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,760
By the way,

402
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,360
have you thanked Lord Ding?

403
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,560
I did.

404
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,440
But...

405
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,560
But what?

406
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,240
I get so restless whenever I see him.

407
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,440
My thoughts are all over the place.

408
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,360
I can't understand anything,

409
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,760
nor can I do anything well.

410
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,120
Tell me, how would I dare go near him?

411
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,040
Men

412
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,520
are so terrifying.

413
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,080
What a distraction to my future.

414
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,000
That won't do, Young Lady.

415
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,400
How could you make Lord Ding angry?

416
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,520
Aren't you afraid your current behavior

417
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,160
might affect your future?

418
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,400
He already said

419
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,800
he wouldn't blame me.

420
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,960
But

421
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,040
you don't seem very happy today.

422
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,800
It's because Lord Ding seemed upset.

423
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,080
What should I do?

424
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,920
Young Lady,

425
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,080
Lord Ding is a forgiving person.

426
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,920
He wouldn't hold a grudge.

427
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,120
Maybe I should prepare

428
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,720
some sincere gifts

429
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,640
and visit him tomorrow.

430
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,560
And I'll explain it to him.

431
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,840
It's all my fault.

432
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,360
It's all my fault for being so inept.

433
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,920
Juli, let's go
and deliver this to Lord Ding.

434
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,080
Young Lady, why isn't there anyone
at Lord Ding's Residence?

435
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:43,840
It seems

436
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,880
Lord Ding is truly angry with me.

437
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,920
That's not good.

438
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,880
By the way,

439
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,720
you used to say that Lord Ding

440
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,280
is a person of...

441
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,240
A person of noble character.

442
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,640
In any case, he's definitely
the forgiving type.

443
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,760
I think as long as
we show a good attitude,

444
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,200
he will forgive us.

445
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,160
Let's go to Lord Ding's Residence.

446
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,120
Miss Mu.

447
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,560
Miss Mu,

448
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,240
I'm not getting in your way on purpose.

449
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,840
His Lordship

450
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,520
is already resting.

451
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,000
Maybe you can come another day?

452
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,440
All right.

453
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,920
Could you please give this
to His Lordship?

00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,040
Have some warm water.

466
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,800
The weather can be unpredictable.

467
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,600
Lord Ding didn't look
too good last night.

468
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,640
Today, Butler Zhang said he's unwell.

469
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,480
Do you think...

470
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,680
Could Lord Ding have caught a cold?

471
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,400
I was wrong before.

472
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,480
How could the miss vanish

473
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,360
just because we are far apart?

474
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,840
He doesn't seem to be angry now.

475
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,560
But he refuses to see me now.

476
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,320
It seems like he knows
what's on my mind.

477
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,480
But for some reason,

478
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,360

First, there was a drought in Jiangnan.

490
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,600
After the eager expectation,

491
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,160
the heavy rain
finally brought sprouts of crops,

492
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,040
and it attracted swarms of locusts
that covered the sky.

493
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,640
The scout reported

494
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,760
that the locusts covered the sky.

495
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,840
They devoured the crops,
leaving the land barren by evening.

496
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,600
The people are struggling
to find enough to eat.

497
00:33:50,666 --> 00:33:51,626
Oh, Heaven.

498
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,980
You're really causing me distress.

499
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,000
Father.

500
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,560
The King of Northern Liang
is seriously ill.

501
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,760
I feel like my strength
is dwindling too.

502
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,160
In recent days,

503
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,400
even your uncle has been feeling ill.

504
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,640
The peace talks

505
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,360
can at least ensure stability
along the borders for several years.

506
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,440
But these internal issues...

507
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,240
When I think
of the Jiangnan people suffering,

508
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,280
it feels like

509
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,240
a fire scorching within me,

510
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,240
and my heart feels like
it's being cut by a knife.

511
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,920
Father,

512
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,200
please take care of your health.

513
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,800
Uncle should focus on nursing himself.

514
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,760
I'm not a child anymore.

515
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,680
I would like to share
the burden with the elders.

516
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:00,800
Father,

517
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,680
I request permission

518
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,040
to go to Jiangnan
to assist in disaster relief

519
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,000
and help the people settle down.

520
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,040
Good.

521
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,960
Your trip to Jiangnan

522
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,720
will encounter challenges
and difficulties.

523
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,040
It will be a great experience for you.

524
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,240
But I won't

525
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,840
let you go alone.

526
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,600
How about this?

527
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,320
I'll send you two assistants.

528
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,920
They will surely be able to aid you.

529
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,200
Do you mean...

530
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,880
Mu Zhuohua and Shen Jinghong, of course.

531
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,240
Both of them

532
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,600
will be a sheath and a sword.

533
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,800
If they can complement each other,

534
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,560
they'll surely achieve great things.

535
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,320
Father, I...

536
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:48,960
Chen,

537
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,200
Mu Zhuohua may be a woman.

538
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,360
But she's intelligent, perceptive,

539
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,520
and possesses great foresight.

540
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,640
She's a true talent.

541
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,440
You mustn't underestimate her.

542
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,920
I've witnessed

543
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,320
Official Mu's abilities firsthand.

544
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,040
I no longer hold
any prejudice against her.

545
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,120
Speaking of which,

546
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,400
it was Uncle's keen eye

547
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,880
that first recognized this hidden gem.

548
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,000
I'm fortunate enough

549
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,400
that I didn't miss out either.

550
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,260
(The locust plague in Jiangnan
leads to famine.)

551
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,810
(Jishan Hall's efforts fall short,
seeking Your Highness' instruction.)

552
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,680
Your Highness,
are you reading the letter

553
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,560
from Jishan Hall in Jiangnan?

554
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,000
Yes.

555
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,080
The famine is widespread
around Huaizhou.

556
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,560
And Jiangnan Jishan Hall's food reserves

557
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,440
won't last much longer.

558
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,920
Speaking of the disaster,

559
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,040
I heard His Majesty
has entrusted Jiangnan's disaster relief

560
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,200
to First Prince.

561
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,800
He's going to the south soon.

562
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,480
I've heard of it too.

563
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,120
Well, Official Shen
will likely travel with him.

564
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,360
After all, His Highness
has always valued him.

565
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,920
Go and pack up some belongings.

566
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,040
I'm going to Jiangnan.

567
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,000
Now?

568
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,720
We must act fast to solve this.

569
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,800
I can't rest assured

570
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,160
unless I take a look myself.

571
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,480
Yes.

572
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,360
Traveling with His Highness

573
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,840
can save a lot of trouble.

574
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,640
Moreover, with Mr. Shen around, he can...

575
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,480
Bring along General Xue's portrait too.

576
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,200
Yes, I'll go and make the preparations.

577
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:38,560
(Zhixing College)

578
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,520
Your Highnesses,
do you still have any questions

579
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,800
that I need to answer?

580
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,920
After I return, I'll revise the lessons,

581
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,640
and I'll ask Ms. Mu for guidance
in the next class.

582
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,600
I'm afraid you might be disappointed.

583
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,880
There might not be a next time for now.

584
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,400
What do you mean?

585
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,800
Are you planning
to cause trouble for Ms. Mu again?

586
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,280
Do you think
I have nothing better to do like you?

587
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,800
That makes sense.

588
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,800
You will depart for Jiangnan
for disaster relief.

589
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,480
I wonder

590
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,040
if Ms. Mu is joining too.

591
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,840
Yes.

592
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,840
You're exceptionally talented,

593
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,520
and you're from Jiangnan.

594
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,440
Are you willing to join me
on this trip?

595
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,040
I shall comply.

596
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,040
You didn't let me down.

597
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,120
Your Highness,

598
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,360
has Lord Ding replied

599
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,840
to the official document yet?

600
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:55,720
Why?

601
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,600
Are you worried Uncle won't approve it?

602
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,160
(I'm just worried
he'll approve it too quickly.)

603
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,000
(Mu Zhuohua is to join the journey.)
My Lord, here are today's documents.

604
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,280
The one on top is from First Prince.

605
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,320
He said it was somewhat urgent.

606
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,160
I shall take my leave.

607
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,000
(Department of State Affairs)
Lord Ding went to visit His Majesty.

608
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,000
He hasn't returned yet.

609
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,200
He's not available again?

610
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,240
Looks like I won't be able
to bid farewell to him.

611
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,840
If it's something urgent,

612
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,160
perhaps you can...

613
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,360
It's all right. I'll just wait

614
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,320
for Lord Ding here.

615
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,360
Thank you.

616
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:13,920
Ms. Mu,

617
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,520
do you still plan on waiting?

618
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,160
I have to set out now.

619
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,760
Please convey this to Lord Ding

620
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,600
that Mu Zhuohua is about to set off
for Jiangnan for disaster relief

621
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,800
and came to bid farewell.

622
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,400
Yes, Ms. Mu.

623
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,040
Thank you.

624
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,120
My Lord,

625
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,800
Official Mu came by earlier.

626
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,000
She wished to have a word with you.

627
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,040
Why did she come to me again?

628
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,120
No idea.

629
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,040
Everyone knows
you haven't been valuing her lately.

630
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:05,800
My Lord,

631
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,520
I heard that Official Mu
has already gone to Jiangnan

632
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,480
for disaster relief with First Prince.

633
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,720
It seems she won't be bothering you
for the next few days.

634
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,680
Jiangnan? Disaster relief?

635
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,560
Yes.

636
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,720
