- Fuyun Temple.

- No, I don't want to.
- Hurry up.

We're running late.

00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,050

I can't believe Shen Jinghong

65
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,520
actually composed such an amorous poem.

66
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,840
And yet people revered him
as Mr. Jinghong.

67
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:49,960
My, my.

68
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,360
This is disgraceful.

69
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:52,730
Young Lady.

70
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,640
But you were reading his poem
with such zeal.

71
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,570
Because

72
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,290
I'm not a demure lady

73
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,570
like others.

74
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,010
You keep mentioning

75
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,680
how much
you appreciate Mr. Jinghong too.

76
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,290
Well, because Mr. Jinghong

77
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,120
is our cash cow.

78
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,730
Naturally, I admire him.

79
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,960
There's no way
I'm mistreating my cash cow.

80
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,490
Why do you take me here to Fuyun Temple

81
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,370
this early morning?

82
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,130
It's said that prayers made here
will be answered.

83
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,600
Today's the Buddha's birthday.

84
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,210

come here to offer incense

in the examination.

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,450
Everyone comes seeking blessings
from Bodhisattva,

87
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,930
but only limited
qualification spots exist.

88
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,520
Which one should
Bodhisattva give her blessing to?

89
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,010
You have given Bodhisattva a hard time,
you know?

90
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,480
Needless to say,
the most sincere believer will be blessed.

91
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,770
By the way, Young Lady,

92
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:37,720
you must watch your words

93
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,210
when we pray before Bodhisattva.

94
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,330
People know that fame is nothing
but immaterial.

95
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,770
Still, everyone yearns for it.

96
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,210
The more, the better.

97
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,400
Praying for nothing at Fuyun Temple.
[*"Nothing" and "fuyun" are homophones.]

98
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,960
What a unique turn of mind.

99
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:07,640
Young Lady.

100
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,210
Kneel at the center

101
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,210
so that Bodhisattva
can see you right away.

102
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,450
Merciful Bodhisattva,

103
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,370
please bless Young Lady

104
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,720
with the top place in the examination.

105
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,890
If not, the second place is good too.

106
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,480
Also, please bless her

107
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,890
with a healthy, safe, and long life.

108
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,280
May she lead a happy life.

109
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,130
Isn't that too much to ask

110
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,640
with your paltry offering?

111
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,520
It's greedy, though.

112
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,770
Merciful Bodhisattva,
I don't have much money.

113
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,330
But as long as you can bless Young Lady,

114
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,250
I can do anything for you.

115
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,480
Young Lady, what wish did you make
to Bodhisattva?

116
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,570
Everyone here seeks blessings
from Bodhisattva.

117
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,960
And she has to respond to each of them.

118
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,840
I wish Bodhisattva
to be happy every day.

119
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,450
Young Lady, Madam Lu told me

120
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,890
there will be a Fuyun Poetry Gathering

121
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,280
at Liuyun Pavilion later.

122
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,480
Perhaps we get to witness

123
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,600
Mr. Jinghong
with his marvelous poems here.

124
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,930
So I'm bringing you here.

125
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,130
You can memorize all his poems

126
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,690
and transcribe them
into another collection for sale.

127
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,480
Juli, I'll leave this task to you.

128
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,210
My stomach hurts.

129
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:32,930
I got a stomach ache.

130
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,010
- You have to handle this now.
- Young Lady, wait.

131
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:34,690
Young Lady!

132
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,130
Greetings, My Lord.

133
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,330
Why are you here?

134
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,130
Did you hint me to come
to the back mountain

135
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,250
when you showed the back of your head

136
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,690
to me just now?

137
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,960
Did I guess wrong?

138
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,890
Your explanation is unconvincing.

139
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,690
Well, then.

140
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,520
Because I think

141
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,210
everywhere else is crowded,
except for the back mountain.

142
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,330
Maybe you wouldn't want
to speak with me

143
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,450
in a crowded place.

144
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,520
That's why I came here to try my luck.

145
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,640
And I'm truly lucky.

146
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,600
Do you even believe in luck?

147
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,280
You didn't show any sign of sincerity

148
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,130
before Bodhisattva just now.

149
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,250
People seek blessings from Bodhisattva,

150
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:52,040
but I wish her a happy life.

151
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,160
In that case,

152
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,840
aren't I the one
who treats Bodhisattva the best?

153
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,570
Why didn't you seek blessings

154
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,160
like others did?

155
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:01,960
I'd rather seek blessings from you

156
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,400
than from Bodhisattva.

157
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,210
The examiner is right in front of me.

158
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,450
I mustn't waste the chance
that's nearer to me.

159
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,240
Please, Wen.

160
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,050
Thank you.

161
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,880
My Lord.

162
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,650
Why did you want to see me?

163
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,450
Where did you learn

164
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,410
about the Revival Powder?

165
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,880
My mother told me when I was little.

166
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,360
However, she only knew

167
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,930
a few ingredients
like the Immortal Fruit.

168
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,960
She had no idea
about the complete prescription.

169
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,330
I've sent men to ask all famous physicians
in the capital about it,

170
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,480
but no one heard
about the Revival Powder.

171
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,120
Not even the Imperial Academy of Medicine?

172
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,450
Why are you so sure

173
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,350
that it's from
the Imperial Academy of Medicine?

174
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,450
Ingredients of the Revival Powder
are precious,

175
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,360
especially the Immortal Fruit,

176
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,600
which is outrageously hefty.

177
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,530
I couldn't think of anyone else except for
the Imperial Academy of Medicine

178
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,330
to afford such precious herbs.

179
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,840
Besides,

180
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,930
I haven't heard about this prescription
from the commoners.

181
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,650
I've already looked into
the Imperial Academy of Medicine,

182
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,210
but nothing has been found.

183
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,960
Did your mother

184
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,000
make a mistake on this?

185
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,410
My Lord, let me tell you this.

186
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,170
My mother

187
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,480
didn't remember much

188
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:00,880
about her childhood times.

189
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,290
However, she had deep impressions
on particular memories

190
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,290
she had,

191
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,000
especially the Immortal Fruit.

192
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,720
Oh, right.

193
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,360
The Immortal Fruit.

194
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,720
My Lord,

195
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,690
you should look into its origin

196
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,600
and consumption

197
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,650
if you found nothing
about the prescription.

198
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,360
Immortal Fruit is a precious ingredient.

199
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,480
I suppose

200
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,600
only the royal families
of various nations have them.

201
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,210
In that case,

202
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,690
how did you identify the smell

203
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,240
on Yun Xiangyue's garment
as the Immortal Fruit?

204
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,760
Well...

205
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,810
My father heard

206
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,360
that the Immortal Fruit could help...

207
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,050
It could help to boost a man's vigor.

208
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,760
So he spent a fortune
to obtain one before

209
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,000
and recruited a famous physician
to study it.

210
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,530
I've seen it before
in my family's medical room.

211
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,080
It seems

212
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,210
that you got to witness
all kinds of exotic treasures

213
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,410
because of the affluent Mu family
in Jiangnan.

214
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,480
You flatter me.

215
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,000
My Lord.

216
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,760
You might find some clues

217
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,690
by looking into
the origin and consumption

218
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,810
of the Immortal Fruit.

219
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,050
This is a useful lead.

220
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,080
I will look into it.

221
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,760
However...

222
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,650
You are still suspicious.

223
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,840
(It's bound to happen, anyway.)

224
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,050
Bravo!

225
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,170
The affair of Jishan Hall
has been keeping me busy lately.

226
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,120
I will come if I have time.

227
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,810
Well played.

228
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,360
It's been some time since I played this.

229
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:28,530
Shen.

230
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,170
Is Shen going to make a performance too?

231
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,000
Maybe.

232
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,290
I don't know much about guqin.

233
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,960
However, the melody gave me

234
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,450
a sense of carefreeness

235
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,600
and boundlessness.

236
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,530
Greetings, Your Highness.

237
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,050
You flatter me,

238
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,760
Your Highness.

239
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,330
No need to feel constrained.

240
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,050
Please continue.

241
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,450
Be relaxed.

242
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,530
I came here to learn something too.

243
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:19,960
My Lord.

244
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,170
If the Revival Powder

245
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,080
is a unique prescription,

246
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,120
why would I dig my own grave

247
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,720
by revealing it to you?

248
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,170
Only you

249
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,960
and your mother know about this.

250
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,840
By any chance,

251
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,080
your mother created this?

252
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,450
My Lord.

253
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,360
It seems that you've run
a thorough background check on me.

254
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,720
I came from the Mu family in Jiangnan.

255
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,410
My mother was sold
into a house of ill repute

256
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,330
because of the family's downfall
in her early years.

257
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:57,120
She couldn't remember
her parents' names,

258
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,840
so she gave herself a name.

259
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,450
Afterward, my father
gave her a new name,

260
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,000
Gu Yixiao.

261
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,810
Mother, I read a poem today.
"Reminiscing my earlier time

262
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:12,930
when I departed, the willow
was drifting along with the breeze."

263
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,330
Mother, can you tell me

264
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,570
where you are from?

265
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,210
Like the fallen petals
from an unknown tree

266
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,410
outside the window,

267
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,720
I don't know where I came from.

268
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,840
The metropolitan examination

269
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,360
isn't your only goal
to come to the capital, right?

270
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:51,240
You seem to have known everything.

271
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,000
Why bother asking me?

272
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,360
That's your personal affair.

273
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,080
I wouldn't pry.

274
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,600
But

275
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,810
you should know

276
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,240
what I want.

277
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,050
My Lord.

278
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,530
I know about Revival Powder

279
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,450
because of my mother.

280
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,930
But as for how she came

281
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,600
to know about it,

282
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,480
I'm finding it

283
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,360
bizarre too.

284
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:23,080
Since I was little,
she taught me how to read, write.

285
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,690
She taught me medical skills

286
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,880
and life principles.

287
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,120
However, I'm clueless

288
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,290
about how she knew so much knowledge.

289
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,290
As of now,

290
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,690
she's buried six feet underground.

291
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,210
Where she came from

292
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,080
remains mysterious to me.

293
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,210
I'll be grateful to you

294
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,000
if you can find the answer for me.

295
00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,570
All right.

296
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,930
My Lord.

297
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:05,130
Do I have your trust now?

298
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:06,850
No.

299
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,520
But I trust

300
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,610
the sincere love of the children
for their parents.

301
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,720
So, do you believe me or not?

302
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,210
"Like a homeless wayfarer,

303
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,690
I have nowhere to make port.

304
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,610
Eager to earn myself a great name,

305
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,370
yet times have failed me."

306
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,040
Well done!

307
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,280
This poem is good

308
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
and artistic.

309
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,130
However,

310
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,410
a hesitant man

311
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,210
wouldn't achieve something big.

312
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,090
Your Highness...

313
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,650
Come.

314
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,330
I heard that you're renowned

315
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,410
for your poetry talent in the capital,
Mr. Jinghong.

316
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,960
Why don't you grace us

317
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,280
with your new poems today?

318
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,690
Shizong.

319
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,720
I believe the First Prince came here

320
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,280
to help Shen Jinghong
garner more attention.

321
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,040
No need to be mad. Here.

322
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,520
I guess he's going to secure his place

323
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,040
on the top rank this year.

324
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:38,650
"My aspirations never once swayed
despite meritorious achievements.

325
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,090
Thousand years of history
have been left in oblivion.

326
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,930
I shall stand down
as the nation nestles in peace.

327
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,240
Triumphing above all names of this era."

328
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,930
What a marvelous one!

329
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,450
"Upon withered grass and frosty sand,

330
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,960
warriors are rapturous in bloodshed.

331
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,960
Yet Yin Mountain is shielded
from the clamor of war,

332
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,480
surrounded by clover meadows
with a serene moon on high."

333
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,760
Well said! Nice poem!

334
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,800
"Drunk in a dream, losing direction,

335
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,930
sunset is cut short
as Chinese francolins cry.

336
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,090
Gentle spring showers
fall onto the river,

337
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:37,040
I bid farewell to my friends
as red maple leaves pile up high."

338
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,410
Great poem!

339
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,000
Excellent!

340
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,890
"Low clouds urge the sun to set

341
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,370
and strong gusts curl the flags up.

342
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,560
- Wailing of swan geese at boundary halt,
- It's Mr. Jinghong.

343
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,930
I savor tea in the southern garden
peacefully.

344
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,320
A calm plume of smoke
around the amber sky,

345
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,720
- garrison stays guard at the frontier.
- Come with me.

346
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,610
And the expanse of the horizon

347
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,040
- appears serene and harmonious.
- Come on.

348
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,480
The lonely cloud astonishes the moon
from afar.

349
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,800
The old heroes now have grizzled hair."

350
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,170
His Lordship still wants
to meet Miss Mu,

351
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,690
which means they're still helpful to us.

352
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:17,690
Go with her and see
what she wants to say.

353
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:20,610
- "Never has he forgotten the great vow,
- Go.

354
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:26,760
- shan't return until peace is secured."
- Are you good at making mental notes?

355
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,480
Do you remember everything

356
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,450
Mr. Jinghong said just now?

357
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,370
Can you transcribe them for me?

358
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,410
I need them.

359
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,210
But

360
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,240
my handwriting is ugly.

361
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,450
It's fine, as long as
you can record everything.

362
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,930
Please. Please help me.

363
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,800
One more, Shen.

364
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,240
That's right. One more, Shen.

365
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,960
"Three thousand iron-armored knights,

366
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,930
a million war-flagged armies,

367
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,960
and sturdy soldiers

368
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,560
are ready to depart as the drum sounds.

369
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,760
An imposing valiance held within

370
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,800
and boasted with brilliant strategies.

371
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,800
Righteous loyalists stand tall

372
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,850
even though they are not young anymore."

373
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:29,130
"Gunpowder rampages cities
and walls collapse.

374
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,930
Embers reflect on war-hardened armors
lonely in the dead of night."

375
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,410
"White bones repose underneath the sand
along the homeward road.

376
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:47,760
The sound of the war bell
and temple drum heralds news of victory."

377
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:55,760
Did I write anything wrong?

378
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,680
No.

379
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,120
Did I miss out on something?

380
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,840
No.

381
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,760
But it hurts my eyes

382
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,360
to read your handwriting.

383
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,450
(Upon withered grass and cold sand,
warriors fight in bloodshed.)

384
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,280
I'm impressed by your
"Righteous loyalists stand tall

385
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,920
even though they are not young anymore."

386
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,920
I have indeed chosen the right person.

387
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,600
It was a reckless

388
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,000
and poor performance, Your Highness.

389
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,000
I prefer recklessness

390
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,120
over those feeble

391
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,560
and pretentious complaints.

392
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,720
Composing poetry
is just a trivial skill

393
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,200
for entertainment.

394
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:42,960
You're right.

395
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,520
I can tell you're ambitious

396
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,080
and patriotic.

397
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,840
You must be the pillar of the nation
in the future.

398
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,680
The metropolitan examination
is around the corner.

399
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,640
I shall look forward
to your performance.

400
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,760
Much obliged, Your Highness.

401
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,160
I didn't expect the First Prince
to be here.

402
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,240
I heard that His Highness
is interested in poetry,

403
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,160
especially borderland poems.

404
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,680
Besides, he likes martial arts
and is intrepid.

405
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,320
That's why he's close to you.

406
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,840
Everyone knows

407
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,760
that you treat the three princess

408
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,960
equally.

409
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:44,960
My Lord.

410
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,640
But Shen Jinghong
has a flawed reputation

411
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,600
recently.

412
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,240
Why did you bring him up
all of a sudden?

413
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,520
Shen Jinghong does make a name
for himself in the capital,

414
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,880
but he has made the scholars mortified.

415
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,920
He isn't well-regarded in the circle.

416
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,080
If His Highness intends
to help him develop his potential,

417
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,800
it's best if he can help him

418
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,280
to restore his reputation first.

419
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,640
How?

420
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,800
Even though Shen Jinghong's
literary talent

421
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,040
is known to the entire capital,

422
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,480
he lacks

423
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,640
some good lofty reputation.

424
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,720
Not only that,

425
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,880
many of his poems

426
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,120
only circulated among theaters.

427
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,960
But given his ambitious poems

428
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,320
about the borderland today,

429
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,120
he managed to ignite passion
and a sense of admiration

430
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,440
of those listeners.

431
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,400
What do all these

432
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,440
have to do with me?

433
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,880
My Lord.

434
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,160
His Highness cares about his man.

435
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,240
Could you please

436
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,360
be nice to me too?

437
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,760
Who sent you here?

438
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,960
Well,

439
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,560
I am always on your side, My Lord.

440
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,360
What do you want me to do?

441
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,080
My Lord.

442
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,240
There's been a price hike
in the capital recently,

443
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,840
especially for writing supplies.

444
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,840
Though I come from the Mu family,

445
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,880
I'm just an undesirable daughter
of a concubine.

446
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,280
I didn't bring much money

447
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,680
when I came to the capital.

448
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,680
Well,

449
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,440
I've been helping you a little

450
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,320
these days, right?

451
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,680
Truth be told,

452
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,680
even ladies in Xiaoqin Pleasure House

453
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,000
paid me two sycees for my treatment.

454
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,600
That day...

455
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,960
During the literary gathering
in Wenzheng Parlor,

456
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,560
I sat beside your table.

457
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,560
Do you remember what you said?

458
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,880
Did you

459
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,320
hear everything?

460
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,440
I did.

461
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,720
I know I've spoken my heart out

462
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,280
about my admiration for you.

463
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,400
Why do you ask

464
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,880
since you've heard it?

465
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,480
I feel shy.

466
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,040
Did you really speak your heart out?

467
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,800
Certainly.

468
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,600
My admiration and loyalty to you

469
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,080
are genuine.

470
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,320
The whole world can bear witness to it.

471
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,880
Do you admire me because I'm reckless,
and I took undeserved credit?

472
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,080
Well...

473
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,240
I thought

474
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,640
you were planning to lure the enemy
with yourself.

475
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,800
As the old saying goes,

476
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,920
the distinguished ones shouldn't
expose themselves in a vulnerable place.

477
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,960
I was worried about you.

478
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,920
Thank you, My Lord!

479
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,480
This is great!

480
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,480
Zhimo, you're so kind.

481
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,640
Zhimo!

482
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,840
Why...

483
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,520
I'm sorry.

484
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,840
I lost control of myself.

485
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,320
Does it hurt?

486
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,160
I didn't mean to sprain your arm.

487
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,640
I must send you to see a physician now.

488
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,280
Did you reattach your arm?

489
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,760
Zhimo, how brilliant of you!

490
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,200
My Lord.

491
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,200
Weirdly, Mu Zhuohua shows up here
at this time.

492
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,640
Besides,

493
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,000
she knows the secret
about the Revival Powder.

494
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,200
She's suspicious.

495
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,440
This matter

496
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,960
concerns the lives of 30,000 soldiers.

497
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,520
We need to test her again.

498
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,160
Understood.

499
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,280
Tonight, go and fetch Mu Zhuohua.

500
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,760
We're taking her

501
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,600
to Tiantong Mountain.

502
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,920
Are you suspecting

503
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,600
that she has something to do
with the mastermind behind it?

504
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,560
I'd like to find out

505
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,840
if this person

506
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,600
matches my suspicions.

507
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,480
I see, you're luring her into the trap

508
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,680
to kill two birds with one stone.

509
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,280
This is wise, My Lord.

510
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,570
(Jishan Hall)

511
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,320
Greetings, Your Highness.

512
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,920
I heard that you composed great poems

513
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,080
in Fuyun Poetry Gathering.

514
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,360
Your poetic talent
has greatly pleased my brother.

515
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,520
It's a pity that you weren't there,
Your Highness.

516
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,480
I was occupied with the affairs
of Jishan Hall,

517
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,480
and I couldn't make it this morning.

518
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,840
You must be tired, Your Highness.

519
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,440
Chen has a discerning eye

520
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,680
for talents.

521
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,880
It's not a bad thing

522
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,560
being noticed by him.

523
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,920
I should congratulate you.

524
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,920
After today's Fuyun Poetry Gathering,

525
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,720
you'll likely make a name for yourself.

526
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,400
It's because of your advice,
Your Highness.

527
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,480
Mr. Shen, you're a man of great talent.

528
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,240
I have plenty of collections
in my study.

529
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,400
You can read them

530
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,680
if you want.

531
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,200
Hopefully, you can triumph
in the examination

532
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,920
and represent scholars
from humble roots.

533
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,280
I appreciate that, Your Highness.

534
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,520
But concerning the current situation,

535
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,520
the tide of humble scholars

536
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,520
can't be turned by my effort alone.

537
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,520
But surely that's all the more reason
you should stand up first.

538
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,560
Someone has to take the first step

539
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,720
to inspire others to follow
in their footsteps.

540
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,800
I agree with you.

541
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,800
Your Highness.

542
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,000
Were you playing
the Immortal Seeking game?

543
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,520
Do you know this?

544
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,960
Not much.

545
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,760
Would you like to have a round with me?

546
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,720
I will,

547
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,360
as long as you wish.

548
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,800
Be honest with me.

549
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,600
Why did Lord Ding give you
so much money?

550
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,920
Did you curry favor with him?

551
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,440
I don't have the guts.

552
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,360
I just tricked him a little.

553
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,440
You see, Lord Ding

554
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,840
is a dangerous character

555
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,040
who doesn't trust others easily.

556
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,440
But the problem is,

557
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,360
we have to meet him

558
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,800
because of the Revival Powder.

559
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,640
What can I do, then?

560
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,160
You must gain his trust.

561
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,480
I realized

562
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,480
that although he's known
as the nefarious demon,

563
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,000
he's not homicidal

564
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,680
but an easy touch.

565
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,080
So,

566
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,080
I employed a bit of my wit today.

567
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,400
You managed to earn 500 taels today.

568
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,680
It's not merely wit.

569
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,640
It's wisdom.

570
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,040
Dealing with a dangerous

571
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,480
and strong opponent,

572
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,600
not only should I show my strength

573
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,600
but also some weaknesses.

574
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,720
A capable

575
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,040
but greedy subordinate

576
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,400
is more manageable.

577
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,040
If so, does Lord Ding trust you now?

578
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,640
How is that possible?

579
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,960
People who have experienced death

580
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,280
on the battlefield like him

581
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,280
won't place trust in others easily.

582
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,800
Therefore,

583
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,000
doing business with him

584
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,480
is the best way to deal with him.

585
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,000
However, the Revival Powder

586
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,400
really bugs me big time.

587
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,680
You assist him and he pays you money.

588
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,840
Why are you troubled?

589
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,880
I guess

590
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,240
he's investigating three leads now.

591
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,200
First, the record of the Immortal Fruit.

592
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,040
Second,

593
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,760
my mother's origin.

594
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,920
Third,

595
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,960
the body of Deputy General Yuan.

596
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,720
Juli, you know what?

597
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,400
My mother told me

598
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,640
that my grandfather used to serve
at the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

599
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,760
The record of the Revival Powder,

600
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,880
which even Lord Ding couldn't trace,

601
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,600
has appeared

602
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,360
in the medical book
left by my grandfather.

603
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,920
Could it be that this Revival Powder

604
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,320
was created by him?

605
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,560
That's quite possible.

606
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,160
Perhaps this is a secret prescription.

607
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,120
Oh no, this is bad.

608
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,280
What if Lord Ding gets revenge on me

609
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,720
once he discovers this?

610
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,960
This can't be.

611
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,040
Get revenge on you?

612
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,720
What should you do?
Why must he blame you

613
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,120
for the past grievances?

614
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,400
You said Lord Ding
has a coital difficulty.

615
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,880
You can treat his problem, so he can...

616
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,320
You must bite your tongue.

617
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,880
Last time,

618
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,440
Lord Ding was sitting beside us
at Wenzheng Parlor.

619
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,480
Well...

620
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,600
Can't we even talk here?

621
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,120
No.

622
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,200
We must watch our words

623
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,360
even when we're at home.

624
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,640
Who knows

625
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,360
if someone's eavesdropping on us now?

626
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,680
There is really someone outside.

627
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,960
Young Lady. Don't be afraid.
I'll check it out.

628
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,680
Go now.

629
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,360
We... We didn't badmouth Lord Ding!

630
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,280
Take the broom away.

631
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,240
Are you going to kill us
with your sword again?

632
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,480
Even if I do so,

633
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,080
the broom won't help much.

634
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:23,880
True, though.

635
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,000
What do you come here for?

636
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,720
You want my Young Lady
to treat His Lordship again?

637
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:28,760
Why?

638
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,280
Does Lord Ding not deserve this?

639
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,200
Of course, Lord Ding deserves it.

640
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,800
Of course, he does.

641
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:34,920
Juli.

642
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,120
Stay at home.

643
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,080
I go with him.

644
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:37,840
No.

645
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,120
I must tag along.

646
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,160
The horse is ready.

647
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,000
Do I have to ride a horse?

648
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,480
You can't ride a horse, so stay.

649
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,000
I can hold onto you.

650
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,840
The latest poetry collection
by Shen Jinghong will be printed soon.

651
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,080
Someone from the printing house

652
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,360
will send them over at any time.

653
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,440
You can't leave at this moment.

654
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,160
It'll be bad
if Mr. Shen loses his popularity

655
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,760
and his poetry collection
becomes unmarketable.

656
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,000
Will Mr. Jinghong lose his popularity
in such a short time?

657
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,280
After I top the examination,

658
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,440
he'll lose his popularity by then.

659
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,360
You're right, Young Lady.

660
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,720
You must be careful.

661
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,240
Come home early.
The examination is approaching.

662
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,480
Take care of our home.

663
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,280
Coming.

664
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,160
You must be very careful, Young Lady.

665
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:14,920
Take care of our house.

666
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:15,960
Let's go.

667
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,240
Slow down!

668
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,720
My Lord, here she is.

669
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,680
I didn't tell you to bring her here

670
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,720
in this way.

671
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,360
Isn't she great?

672
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,360
I bet she can ride a horse.

673
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,240
Just drop the act.

674
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,400
I can't ride a horse.

675
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,440
I really can't.

676
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,280
Forget it.

677
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,880
Pass your medicine chest to Zhimo.

678
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,040
You'll ride with me.

679
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,320
What?

680
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,000
Pass me the medicine chest.

681
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,320
All right.

682
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,760
Come on.

683
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,160
What...

684
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,320
What?

685
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,480
Come on.

686
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,080
I...

687
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,360
My Lord. My legs...

688
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,080
My legs are numb.

689
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,000
I'm having a cramp.

690
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,760
My Lord.

691
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,960
Where are we going?

692
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,840
I need you to check on

693
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,160
a dead body.

694
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,400
I'll double the reward.

695
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,880
My Lord, must I really go there?

696
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,920
The metropolitan examination
is around the corner.

697
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,600
I plan to study at home these days.

698
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,720
Besides,

699
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,320
I'm not a coroner.

700
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,240
Well,

701
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,200
this is beyond my knowledge...

702
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,520
Because I think

703
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,800
there is something on the body

704
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,040
that ordinary coroners can't identify.

705
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,880
You know something
about the Revival Powder, after all.

706
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,360
My Lord.

707
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,280
I'm afraid I might waste time

708
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,280
traveling back and forth,

709
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,590
and it may affect my performance
in the metropolitan examination.

710
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,600
We will get there in a day
if we ride faster.

711
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,120
In a day?

712
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,840
Why?

713
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:36,680
But...

714
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,200
If you're really that anxious,

715
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,920
we should depart now.

716
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,320
No, My Lord.

717
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,360
Can we

718
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,320
talk this out?

719
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,360
Please.

720
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,080
I mean

721
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,920
we must ride faster. Even faster.

722
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,120
Mu Zhuohua seems so unreliable.

723
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,680
It's His Lordship's order.

724
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,520
I know.

725
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,840
I doubt if she can help His Lordship.

726
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,320
She's so timid.

727
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,040
I bet she'll be trembling in her boots
when she sees the body,

728
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,520
let alone examine the body.

729
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,120
I think she's capable of that.

730
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,600
What if she's not?

731
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,640
She hides her skill.

732
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,000
You seem to believe her, though.

733
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,400
We should go now.

734
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,680
Hyah!

735
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,160
Hyah!

736
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,120
Greetings, My Lord.

737
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,200
Where's the body?

738
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,920
It's inside.

739
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,600
Show me the way.

740
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,760
Only skeletons are left.

741
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,360
My Lord.

742
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,000
We found a badge beside him

743
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,640
and it verifies the identity
of Deputy General Yuan.

744
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,240
(My father)

745
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,680
was loyal and brave all his life.
He would never betray his country.

746
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,600
Someone used my mother's
and my life to threaten him.

747
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,600
Come here.

748
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,120
This person has been dead
for more than five years.

749
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,160
There are a total of thirteen injuries
on the remains,

750
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,200
five of which are fractures.

751
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,320
They were caused
by a fall from a height.

752
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,680
Besides, there are eight scratches

753
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:54,730
that are deep into the bones

754
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,880
and contracted inwardly.

755
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,280
Possibly, it's caused by an iron weapon

756
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,600
resembling a hawk's claw.

757
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,560
Did you find anything?

758
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,000
My Lord.

759
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,080
Most of the wounds and scars

760
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,760
aren't fatal.

761
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,280
Are you saying

762
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,360
that you've found the fatal wound?

763
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,280
Look at it here, My Lord.

764
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,560
A needle mark.

765
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,000
I just saw this now.

766
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,000
You're thorough.

767
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,960
I'm ashamed of my mistake.

768
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,600
Please don't say that, sir.

769
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,080
It's likely to overlook this

770
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,960
since there are so many injuries.

771
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,480
I learned acupuncture techniques before.

772
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,840
Thus, I pay particular attention
to needle marks.

773
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,360
Please look over here, My Lord.

774
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,720
Another needle mark here.

775
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,040
It pierced from the frontal bone
to the occipital bone.

776
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,520
This is fatal.

777
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,280
Therefore,

778
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,440
this man was initially injured

779
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,200
by a hawk-claw-like weapon

780
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,600
and then pierced by a needle.

781
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,320
He fell off the cliff

782
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,760
and died

783
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,120
after suffering severe injuries.

784
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,920
The murderer had chased him tightly

785
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,960
and determined to kill him.

786
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,440
My Lord, I dare to ask,

787
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,200
who's this Deputy General Yuan?

788
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:47,920
Five years ago,

789
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,840
he sent me fake intelligence

790
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,720
during the war at Juma River.

791
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,280
Afterward,

792
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,520
his whereabouts were unknown.

793
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,720
A few days ago,

794
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,680
I tracked his daughter down.

795
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,440
I was told

796
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,640
that someone coerced him
with his wife and daughter.

797
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,760
And he was forced
to send out fake intelligence.

798
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,120
Yun Xiangyue is his daughter.

799
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,280
