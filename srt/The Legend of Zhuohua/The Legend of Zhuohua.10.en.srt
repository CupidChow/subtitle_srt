(Adapted from "She Was Once
a Playful Soul" by Sui Yu Er An)

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,940
=Episode 10=

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
(This is a work of fiction.)

20
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,185
(Jishan Hall)

21
00:01:54,735 --> 00:01:56,095
The porridge is too watery.

22
00:01:56,895 --> 00:01:58,255
The kids are growing.

23
00:01:59,095 --> 00:02:00,255
Put more rice into this.

24
00:02:02,134 --> 00:02:04,535
Your Highness,
the rice price is on the rise.

25
00:02:05,214 --> 00:02:07,054
The Jishan Hall in the capital
opened not long ago.

26
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,535
We don't have an abundance of money

27
00:02:10,174 --> 00:02:11,215
or rice.

28
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:16,574
I received
a handsome reward at the palace.

29
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:17,975
We'll put that to use.

30
00:02:19,414 --> 00:02:20,174
Yes.

31
00:02:24,975 --> 00:02:26,134
Is there anything else?

32
00:02:27,535 --> 00:02:30,414
I'm afraid Official Shen
won't be here again.

33
00:02:30,815 --> 00:02:33,495
After all, you refused to marry him
in front of everyone.

34
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:35,335
Mr. Shen,

35
00:02:35,734 --> 00:02:37,454
what does your name mean?

36
00:02:44,055 --> 00:02:46,454
Jinghong Yipie?

37
00:02:46,495 --> 00:02:47,894
Isn't this your name?

38
00:02:49,414 --> 00:02:50,454
This line

39
00:02:50,815 --> 00:02:51,815
is an idiom.

40
00:02:52,535 --> 00:02:54,935
(Jinghong Yipie)
It means a great wonder

41
00:02:55,414 --> 00:02:56,734
that is transient

42
00:02:57,614 --> 00:02:59,255
but not easily forgotten.

43
00:02:59,894 --> 00:03:01,014
It stays in your memory.

44
00:03:03,854 --> 00:03:04,574
Understood?

45
00:03:04,694 --> 00:03:05,454
Yes.

46
00:03:35,134 --> 00:03:36,215
I've been searching all day.

47
00:03:36,335 --> 00:03:38,055
There you are, our Zhuangyuan.

48
00:03:38,894 --> 00:03:40,055
Time to receive your decree.

49
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:42,614
The imperial decree arrives!

50
00:03:50,134 --> 00:03:52,935
Shen Jinghong of Huaizhou,

51
00:03:53,294 --> 00:03:56,614
the Zhuangyuan
of the 24th year of the Zhaoming Reign,

52
00:03:56,614 --> 00:04:00,014
will hereby receive the Primary
Six-Rank position of editor,

53
00:04:00,134 --> 00:04:01,734
implemented by the head of Hanlin Academy.

54
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:05,221
The 24th year of the Zhaoming Reign,
on the fifth day of the third month.

55
00:04:05,614 --> 00:04:07,255
The end.

56
00:04:07,535 --> 00:04:08,655
I'm grateful for His Majesty.

57
00:04:35,535 --> 00:04:36,494
I am here

58
00:04:36,895 --> 00:04:39,015
to congratulate you
on winning first place.

59
00:04:39,975 --> 00:04:41,174
I was waiting at your home,

60
00:04:41,174 --> 00:04:42,335
but you never showed up.

61
00:04:43,015 --> 00:04:43,854
As it turned out,

62
00:04:44,374 --> 00:04:46,095
you're at my sister's place.

63
00:04:46,575 --> 00:04:47,854
My apologies, Your Highness.

64
00:04:48,494 --> 00:04:49,054
Well,

65
00:04:49,374 --> 00:04:51,054
I'm not that petty of a person.

66
00:04:51,494 --> 00:04:53,135
Chen, it's not Mr. Shen's fault.

67
00:04:53,614 --> 00:04:55,695
He's been helping out
at Jishan Hall lately.

68
00:04:56,174 --> 00:04:57,575
The kids love him.

69
00:04:59,494 --> 00:05:00,854
You're kind as ever.

70
00:05:02,575 --> 00:05:05,054
If Jishan Hall needs anything,

71
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:05,895
let me know.

72
00:05:06,575 --> 00:05:08,655
Chen, you have my thanks.

73
00:05:09,374 --> 00:05:10,975
Don't mention it, Jiao.

74
00:05:12,015 --> 00:05:13,854
I was going to celebrate for you,

75
00:05:13,934 --> 00:05:15,254
but it seems

76
00:05:15,734 --> 00:05:17,054
you have work at hand.

77
00:05:17,374 --> 00:05:18,775
I appreciate the thought, Your Highness.

78
00:05:19,095 --> 00:05:19,934
However,

79
00:05:20,135 --> 00:05:21,374
I promised the children

80
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:22,734
to give them a lesson.

81
00:05:23,095 --> 00:05:23,775
It's all right.

82
00:05:23,934 --> 00:05:25,254
We can meet up later.

83
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:27,934
Jiao, I take my leave now.

84
00:05:29,294 --> 00:05:30,895
See His Highness off for me.

85
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:31,734
Yes.

86
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,174
Come with me.

87
00:05:48,374 --> 00:05:49,015
Yes.

88
00:05:52,135 --> 00:05:54,254
Becoming the Zhuangyuan
is worth celebrating.

89
00:05:54,814 --> 00:05:56,695
I have a book
titled "Records of Governance".

90
00:05:57,294 --> 00:05:58,414
It's my gift to you.

91
00:06:00,135 --> 00:06:01,374
The court is unpredictable.

92
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:02,895
A great duty warrants a long journey.

93
00:06:03,015 --> 00:06:04,254
Do not give up halfway.

94
00:06:05,095 --> 00:06:05,814
I'll remember that.

95
00:06:34,814 --> 00:06:36,494
The First Prince
has high expectations of you.

96
00:06:36,614 --> 00:06:37,895
Your career should be your priority.

97
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,575
Do your best as his aide.

98
00:06:40,174 --> 00:06:42,695
Do not waste your time and effort

99
00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:43,734
on distractions.

100
00:06:48,095 --> 00:06:51,215
An officer must serve the people.

101
00:06:52,294 --> 00:06:53,975
What I did today

102
00:06:54,575 --> 00:06:55,895
is a service for the people.

103
00:07:24,135 --> 00:07:26,374
Young Lady, everything is packed up.

104
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:29,614
Housing in Zhuque Street
comes with too steep a price.

105
00:07:30,734 --> 00:07:31,934
We barely have money left

106
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:33,414
after we pay the rent.

107
00:07:34,814 --> 00:07:35,655
Don't worry.

108
00:07:36,814 --> 00:07:39,215
I will do my best to make more money.

109
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:40,708
I won't let you starve.

110
00:07:41,374 --> 00:07:42,614
None of us should starve.

111
00:07:43,414 --> 00:07:45,575
Indeed. No one will be starved.

112
00:07:49,934 --> 00:07:50,655
By the way, Juli,

113
00:07:50,814 --> 00:07:52,695
pack these herbs up for me.

114
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:54,494
Send them to Madam Lu

115
00:07:54,494 --> 00:07:55,535
and Miss Song.

116
00:07:56,015 --> 00:07:57,494
After we move to Zhuque Street,

117
00:07:57,494 --> 00:07:59,414
we'll live pretty far from Flower Alley.

118
00:07:59,734 --> 00:08:01,975
Commuting won't be as easy as now.

119
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:04,655
Save the frequently used herbs for them

120
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,775
in case of an emergency.

121
00:08:05,854 --> 00:08:06,535

128
00:08:29,535 --> 00:08:32,175
Yeah. This house is so spacious.

129
00:08:32,734 --> 00:08:34,815
Young Lady, that house is gorgeous.

130
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,815

(Young Lady, our new home is amazing.)

137
00:09:05,494 --> 00:09:08,014
It's much bigger than the house
in Flower Alley.

138
00:09:08,654 --> 00:09:10,335
But the rent is a bit pricey.

139
00:09:10,815 --> 00:09:12,254
We could get tons of
marinated trotters with it.

140
00:09:12,614 --> 00:09:13,854
But for Third Madam,

141
00:09:13,935 --> 00:09:14,854
it's worth every penny.

142
00:09:15,215 --> 00:09:15,614
Yes.

143
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,014
Now, I have a job

144
00:09:19,374 --> 00:09:20,374
and we have a place to stay.

145
00:09:21,095 --> 00:09:22,335
When we get the day off,

146
00:09:22,415 --> 00:09:23,935
we must start looking for the place

147
00:09:23,935 --> 00:09:25,374
where my mother once lived.

148
00:09:25,374 --> 00:09:25,774
Yes.

149
00:09:26,575 --> 00:09:28,295
When I learn the truth
about my mother's past

150
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:29,854
and get promoted at work,

151
00:09:30,095 --> 00:09:31,295
I'll get a substantial raise.

152
00:09:31,575 --> 00:09:33,695
You can get as many trotters

153
00:09:33,734 --> 00:09:34,695
as you want then.

154
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,095
How nice of you.

155
00:09:36,614 --> 00:09:38,335
Young Lady, what would you like to have?

156
00:09:38,854 --> 00:09:41,055
Is food all you can think about?

157
00:09:41,134 --> 00:09:42,654
Food is bliss.

158
00:09:43,014 --> 00:09:45,055
But dinner tonight was a bit too salty.

159
00:09:45,575 --> 00:09:47,295
I'll ease up on the seasoning next time.

160
00:09:47,335 --> 00:09:47,734
OK.

161
00:09:48,695 --> 00:09:49,534
Go to sleep.

162
00:09:49,654 --> 00:09:50,575
I must report

163
00:09:50,575 --> 00:09:52,095
to Hanlin Academy tomorrow morning.

164
00:10:01,215 --> 00:10:02,654
You're already asleep?

165
00:10:03,654 --> 00:10:05,014
What a silly girl.

166
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:22,215
(From now on,)

167
00:10:23,215 --> 00:10:24,734
(I must never place my fate)

168
00:10:25,295 --> 00:10:26,415
(in another's hand.)

169
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:29,614
(I must walk this path on my own.)

170
00:11:02,815 --> 00:11:03,654
Who is there?

171
00:11:10,134 --> 00:11:11,254
No one's here.

172
00:11:23,618 --> 00:11:27,472
(Ciming Hall)

173
00:11:38,494 --> 00:11:40,734
I was told
that you and that female Tanhua

174
00:11:41,374 --> 00:11:42,534
have been very close.

175
00:11:45,215 --> 00:11:47,055
We don't always get female scholars.

176
00:11:47,734 --> 00:11:49,534
I admire her talents.

177
00:11:49,894 --> 00:11:52,095
So I thought I should help her out.

178
00:11:59,374 --> 00:12:00,175
You

179
00:12:00,935 --> 00:12:02,654
are always too kind.

180
00:12:06,695 --> 00:12:09,095
You've only known her for a few days.

181
00:12:10,695 --> 00:12:14,295
I bet you don't even know
where she comes from.

182
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,014
You've enlightened me

183
00:12:19,374 --> 00:12:20,854
when I was little, Your Highness.

184
00:12:22,295 --> 00:12:23,614
How fated we are.

185
00:12:24,335 --> 00:12:25,335
Was it in Jiangnan?

186
00:12:26,134 --> 00:12:26,894
Your Highness.

187
00:12:27,254 --> 00:12:28,215
Do you remember that?

188
00:12:28,494 --> 00:12:30,014
Your accent

189
00:12:30,415 --> 00:12:32,374
sounds like folks
from Huaizhou, Jiangnan.

190
00:12:34,455 --> 00:12:36,734
I am from Yanzhou, actually.

191
00:12:39,654 --> 00:12:41,175
I do know where she is from.

192
00:12:41,975 --> 00:12:43,654
She was born in Yanzhou of Jiangnan.

193
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,734
She passed the imperial examination
in spite of her young age.

194
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:48,935
She has outstanding talents.

195
00:12:51,614 --> 00:12:52,374
All right.

196
00:12:53,134 --> 00:12:55,815
You've been serving me for long enough.

197
00:12:55,815 --> 00:12:56,734
You must be tired.

198
00:12:56,854 --> 00:12:57,734
You may go back now.

199
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,654
Grandmother, rest well.

200
00:13:13,774 --> 00:13:14,494
Your Majesty.

201
00:13:15,935 --> 00:13:18,215
I've been watching Mu Zhuohua for days.

202
00:13:18,415 --> 00:13:19,374
There's nothing unusual.

203
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:21,494
Except for...

204
00:13:21,894 --> 00:13:22,774
What is it?

205
00:13:24,134 --> 00:13:25,374
She moved to a new house.

206
00:13:26,254 --> 00:13:27,575
She is now an official, after all.

207
00:13:27,695 --> 00:13:29,815
It may not be suitable for her
to live on Flower Alley anymore.

208
00:13:30,215 --> 00:13:31,534
It's normal if she wants to live closer

209
00:13:31,534 --> 00:13:32,614
to where she works.

210
00:13:35,854 --> 00:13:37,055
If there's nothing unusual,

211
00:13:38,975 --> 00:13:41,815
stop wasting your time on this woman.

212
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,374
Yes. I understand.

213
00:14:07,215 --> 00:14:07,935
Juli!

214
00:14:09,095 --> 00:14:10,614
Juli, it's time to wake up.

215
00:14:11,654 --> 00:14:12,415
Wake up!

216
00:14:14,815 --> 00:14:15,654
How do I look?

217
00:14:18,654 --> 00:14:19,415
Young Lady.

218
00:14:19,534 --> 00:14:21,254
Why are you up so early?

219
00:14:21,575 --> 00:14:23,774
We did cleaning
and moved house yesterday.

220
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:25,335
Aren't you tired at all?

221
00:14:25,335 --> 00:14:26,134
Not at all.

222
00:14:26,295 --> 00:14:27,894
This is my first day at work.

223
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:29,175
I must embrace

224
00:14:29,175 --> 00:14:30,894
this new chapter of life
in my best condition.

225
00:14:35,885 --> 00:14:38,753
(Hanlin Academy)

226
00:14:39,774 --> 00:14:41,175
Here at Hanlin Academy,

227
00:14:41,654 --> 00:14:43,614
we write books and record history,

228
00:14:43,614 --> 00:14:45,215
(Official Wang of Hanlin Academy)
and we compose the edicts.

229
00:14:45,215 --> 00:14:45,975
(Official Wang of Hanlin Academy)

230
00:14:45,975 --> 00:14:48,335
We may not hold high ranks here,

231
00:14:48,534 --> 00:14:52,014
but this place grooms great leaders.

232
00:14:53,215 --> 00:14:54,935
What you're seeing

233
00:14:55,134 --> 00:14:56,614
is where we write books
and record history.

234
00:14:56,935 --> 00:15:00,175
This shall be your workplace
from now on.

235
00:15:01,175 --> 00:15:02,614
These tasks may look simple.

236
00:15:02,854 --> 00:15:04,975
But they require
great wisdom and knowledge.

237
00:15:06,534 --> 00:15:07,215
Official Sun.

238
00:15:07,935 --> 00:15:08,654
By the way,

239
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:12,854
if there is anything you need help with,

240
00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:14,654
feel free to ask me.

241
00:15:16,175 --> 00:15:17,415
Much obliged, sir.

242
00:15:17,415 --> 00:15:18,055
You're welcome.

243
00:15:18,215 --> 00:15:19,455
Here, let's go inside.

244
00:15:20,774 --> 00:15:21,254
Come on.

245
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:28,654
For the first time,

246
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,095
there is a female officer
in Hanlin Academy!

247
00:15:31,494 --> 00:15:32,695
That is your desk.

248
00:15:33,854 --> 00:15:35,935
This is Ms. Mu's desk.

249
00:15:36,295 --> 00:15:37,095
Look at her.

250
00:15:38,055 --> 00:15:39,774
The uniform looks preposterous

251
00:15:40,295 --> 00:15:41,335
on a woman!

252
00:15:41,534 --> 00:15:42,335
A lady

253
00:15:42,415 --> 00:15:43,815
should be delicate and gentle.

254
00:15:44,374 --> 00:15:45,374
Only then is she likable.

255
00:15:45,734 --> 00:15:48,374
Do you expect her to come here
with rouge on her face

256
00:15:48,654 --> 00:15:49,975
while wearing an extravagant outfit?

257
00:15:51,254 --> 00:15:52,455
Why not?

258
00:15:52,774 --> 00:15:54,374
What can a woman like her possibly do?

259
00:15:54,614 --> 00:15:56,614
She will have to get married
and have children eventually.

260
00:15:57,254 --> 00:15:58,494
Why not dress up

261
00:15:58,734 --> 00:15:59,614
and please our eyes?

262
00:16:00,494 --> 00:16:01,575
That should work!

263
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:03,415
In that case,

264
00:16:03,614 --> 00:16:06,935
I think men should get married
and have a family of their own.

265
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:09,695
They can do well
keeping the wife and children company.

266
00:16:09,975 --> 00:16:11,654
Why don't you go home

267
00:16:11,815 --> 00:16:13,014
and start preparing dinner?

268
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:13,975
(Hanlin Academy)
Wouldn't that be great?

269
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:15,494
Besides, how can you be sure

270
00:16:15,494 --> 00:16:17,815
the virtues of our ancestors
are not the same

271
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,014
as womanly virtues?

272
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,854
Judging by the gentlemen's logic,

273
00:16:21,894 --> 00:16:23,134
we all die eventually.

274
00:16:23,374 --> 00:16:25,494
Why do you two even bother
becoming officers?

275
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:26,975
Why not buy yourself a coffin

276
00:16:27,215 --> 00:16:28,175
and sleep in it?

277
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,815
Our Zhuangyuan and Tanhua
are really eloquent.

278
00:16:31,935 --> 00:16:33,295
Your logic is certainly outstanding.

279
00:16:33,894 --> 00:16:34,575
Well said.

280
00:16:35,854 --> 00:16:37,254
Don't forget, Mr. Sun,

281
00:16:37,254 --> 00:16:39,295
you're an outstanding Bangyan yourself.

282
00:16:39,854 --> 00:16:41,175
I'm flattered.

283
00:16:43,774 --> 00:16:45,254
(There goes her insolence again.)

284
00:16:45,894 --> 00:16:47,494
(How could Father assign me a tutor)

285
00:16:47,494 --> 00:16:48,455
(like her?)

286
00:17:05,455 --> 00:17:07,215
Your Highness.

287
00:17:09,215 --> 00:17:11,455
As the chief examiner of the day,

288
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:15,615
I shall do one last thing for you.

289
00:17:17,215 --> 00:17:18,814
I came

290
00:17:19,135 --> 00:17:21,175
to relay His Majesty's decree.

291
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:30,855
Shen Jinghong,

292
00:17:32,175 --> 00:17:33,175
Sun Yunqian...

293
00:17:40,774 --> 00:17:41,895
And Mu Zhuohua.

294
00:17:44,935 --> 00:17:47,655
In a few days, you shall
start giving lessons at Zhixing College.

295
00:17:49,294 --> 00:17:50,975
Much obliged, Your Majesty.

296
00:17:55,415 --> 00:17:56,215
Rise.

297
00:18:00,215 --> 00:18:02,574
Over the years, old scholars
have been giving us lessons.

298
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:04,895
But Father changed the rules this year.

299
00:18:06,175 --> 00:18:08,734
You must live up

300
00:18:08,734 --> 00:18:10,455
to Father's expectations.

301
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,814
Yes, Your Highness.

302
00:18:23,254 --> 00:18:26,494
The academy is full of conifers.

303
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,135
But an osmanthus plant
stands out among them.

304
00:18:30,615 --> 00:18:32,655
What an unsightly view.

305
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:42,574
Your Highness,

306
00:18:43,175 --> 00:18:45,734
I think the osmanthus plant
looks pretty.

307
00:18:46,014 --> 00:18:48,014
The poise is just as graceful
as the conifers.

308
00:18:48,534 --> 00:18:52,375
Ms. Mu, the plant that sticks out

309
00:18:52,895 --> 00:18:54,215
gets uprooted by the tornado.

310
00:18:55,814 --> 00:18:58,334
Your Highness
and I share the same thought.

311
00:18:58,615 --> 00:19:00,455
I also think the osmanthus plant

312
00:19:00,455 --> 00:19:02,054
stands out.

313
00:19:08,135 --> 00:19:10,455
You are good with your words, Ms Mu.

314
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,615
Indeed, Your Highness.

315
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,534
Very well. I shall wait and see

316
00:19:26,334 --> 00:19:29,415
how talented and skilled Ms. Mu is.

317
00:19:33,895 --> 00:19:35,455
Safe travel, Your Highness.

318
00:19:45,254 --> 00:19:48,774
Now that she gets the chance
to be His Highness' tutor.

319
00:19:49,415 --> 00:19:51,615
Who knows
when she will become a consort?

320
00:19:52,534 --> 00:19:53,655
Now that you mention it,

321
00:19:54,534 --> 00:19:55,895
I wish I were a woman.

322
00:19:58,455 --> 00:19:59,014
Don't be silly.

323
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,094
From what I see,

324
00:20:22,574 --> 00:20:24,895
the only osmanthus plant in the yard

325
00:20:25,734 --> 00:20:26,935
will grow to be tall and strong.

326
00:20:31,334 --> 00:20:32,254
Thank you, Shen.

327
00:20:33,294 --> 00:20:34,294
I believe

328
00:20:34,895 --> 00:20:36,935
when there is a will, there is a way.

329
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,294
Endeavors shall be rewarded.

330
00:20:39,734 --> 00:20:40,455
Well said.

331
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:44,935
What do you plan to teach

332
00:20:45,215 --> 00:20:46,615
the three princes?

333
00:20:47,534 --> 00:20:48,774
Good question.

334
00:20:50,054 --> 00:20:51,135
I'll teach geography.

335
00:20:51,935 --> 00:20:52,855
Geography?

336
00:20:53,455 --> 00:20:55,574
You certainly are knowledgeable.

337
00:20:55,814 --> 00:20:56,774
I'm flattered.

338
00:20:57,135 --> 00:20:59,334
I may not know as much
as you and Official Sun.

339
00:20:59,655 --> 00:21:01,455
But I read a variety of books.

340
00:21:01,895 --> 00:21:03,695
I can teach the princes

341
00:21:03,734 --> 00:21:05,615
about the cultures
and customs of the nation.

342
00:21:06,334 --> 00:21:08,094
I hope they like it.

343
00:21:10,175 --> 00:21:12,415
These three are no pushovers.

344
00:21:12,935 --> 00:21:13,615
Jinghong,

345
00:21:13,935 --> 00:21:15,455
you'll have to take the lead.

346
00:21:16,135 --> 00:21:17,895
When Ms. Mu isn't afraid,

347
00:21:18,215 --> 00:21:19,054
why are you worried?

348
00:21:20,054 --> 00:21:20,855
Good point.

349
00:21:23,494 --> 00:21:24,895
Sun, Shen.

350
00:21:25,615 --> 00:21:28,135
Do you think
that we can stand tall and proud

351
00:21:28,615 --> 00:21:29,695
like the trees

352
00:21:29,814 --> 00:21:32,375
years from now

353
00:21:32,655 --> 00:21:34,294
and become pillars of Xuanzheng Hall?

354
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:36,734
I'm sure we can.

355
00:21:38,734 --> 00:21:41,494
A life with grand ambitions

356
00:21:42,294 --> 00:21:44,615
shall not bring disappointments
as the rivers flow.

357
00:21:45,814 --> 00:21:47,135
With ten years...

358
00:21:48,294 --> 00:21:50,574
No, just five years.

359
00:21:51,655 --> 00:21:54,975
I shall bring changes
to the imperial court of Southern Chen.

360
00:21:57,814 --> 00:21:59,695
I don't share Jinghong's

361
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:01,175
grand ambitions and visions.

362
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:03,094
My focus is managing
the Ministry of Works.

363
00:22:03,574 --> 00:22:05,534
We build cities and fix houses.

364
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:07,895
None shall ever lose their homes again.

365
00:22:08,534 --> 00:22:09,734
Sun, Shen.

366
00:22:10,014 --> 00:22:12,574
This osmanthus tree
shall be our witness today.

367
00:22:12,855 --> 00:22:14,655
Five years from now, the three of us

368
00:22:14,655 --> 00:22:16,135
shall make a name for ourselves

369
00:22:16,175 --> 00:22:17,375
in the imperial court.

370
00:22:17,494 --> 00:22:18,494
- Yes!
- Yes!

371
00:22:29,534 --> 00:22:31,734
Young Lady, what are you drawing?

372
00:22:33,415 --> 00:22:34,615
This is a map.

373
00:22:36,094 --> 00:22:37,814
In a few days,
we, the three top scholars,

374
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,734
will be giving
the three princes lessons.

375
00:22:40,774 --> 00:22:43,375
Shen Jinghong is close
to the First Prince.

376
00:22:44,135 --> 00:22:47,415
Sun Yunqian is the cousin
of the other two princes.

377
00:22:49,294 --> 00:22:50,175
But me?

378
00:22:52,294 --> 00:22:53,975
You have no one back you up, Young Lady.

379
00:22:56,534 --> 00:22:58,734
But I am someone

380
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:01,695
who's already escaped a marriage.

381
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:03,655
I topped the imperial examination.

382
00:23:03,895 --> 00:23:06,094
I even earned Lord Ding's trust.

383
00:23:06,534 --> 00:23:08,415
I made it through all of these

384
00:23:08,415 --> 00:23:09,375
great challenges.

385
00:23:09,534 --> 00:23:10,895
Why would I be scared of

386
00:23:10,895 --> 00:23:12,574
giving lessons to the three princes?

387
00:23:15,615 --> 00:23:16,415
By the way, Juli,

388
00:23:16,814 --> 00:23:18,135
didn't I tell you

389
00:23:18,135 --> 00:23:19,534
to prepare some presents?

390
00:23:19,855 --> 00:23:20,895
Are they ready?

391
00:23:21,415 --> 00:23:22,494
I have a day off tomorrow.

392
00:23:22,655 --> 00:23:25,215
We should help my mother
find her old home.

393
00:23:25,615 --> 00:23:26,895
I have them ready, Young Lady.

394
00:23:26,935 --> 00:23:28,615
We can set out tomorrow morning.

395
00:23:28,655 --> 00:23:30,094
Great, we'll do just that.

396
00:23:37,655 --> 00:23:40,094
Young Lady, are you sure
we can find her home this way?

397
00:23:40,534 --> 00:23:40,935
Yes.

398
00:23:41,135 --> 00:23:43,375
I remember Mother
once told me this when I was little.

399
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:49,254
Mother, do you like apricot blossoms?

400
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,135
I don't.

401
00:23:54,855 --> 00:23:56,334
When I was little,

402
00:23:57,094 --> 00:23:58,334
there was a spring

403
00:23:59,175 --> 00:24:01,534
where apricot blossoms
covered the trees.

404
00:24:02,334 --> 00:24:05,054
The petals fell into the pond.

405
00:24:05,534 --> 00:24:08,615
I tried to pick them up.

406
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:10,895
But I fell into the water

407
00:24:11,014 --> 00:24:12,494
and almost drowned.

408
00:24:13,895 --> 00:24:15,054
What happened then?

409
00:24:15,135 --> 00:24:16,054
Then?

410
00:24:17,615 --> 00:24:18,935
I can't remember.

411
00:24:25,455 --> 00:24:27,094
An apricot tree and a pond?

412
00:24:27,975 --> 00:24:28,615
Yes.

413
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:31,695
If this street
is full of elder imperial physicians,

414
00:24:31,895 --> 00:24:33,494
we should ask around.

415
00:24:34,455 --> 00:24:35,574
Let's start with this.

416
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:35,935
Yes.

417
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:43,455
Coming.

418
00:24:45,935 --> 00:24:46,655
Greetings.

419
00:24:47,014 --> 00:24:49,935
Young ladies,
is there anything I can help you with?

420
00:24:50,014 --> 00:24:51,415
We just moved here recently.

421
00:24:51,534 --> 00:24:53,334
We live at the manor
on the 17th of the street.

422
00:24:53,695 --> 00:24:56,254
We came by to visit our neighbors.

423
00:24:57,094 --> 00:24:57,814
Juli.

424
00:24:59,175 --> 00:25:01,014
We prepared a little gift for you.

425
00:25:01,054 --> 00:25:02,014
I hope you like it.

426
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:03,774
That is very nice of you.

427
00:25:03,895 --> 00:25:04,734
Come in.

428
00:25:04,734 --> 00:25:05,494
Yes. Thank you.

429
00:25:05,494 --> 00:25:06,814
There is no need to bring me a gift

430
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:08,494
for a visit.

431
00:25:08,935 --> 00:25:12,014
People move in and out all the time.

432
00:25:12,054 --> 00:25:13,615
But I've never met anyone

433
00:25:13,615 --> 00:25:15,215
who is as well-mannered as you.

434
00:25:15,935 --> 00:25:17,975
The apricot tree is beautiful.

435
00:25:19,294 --> 00:25:20,574
Our apricot tree

436
00:25:20,574 --> 00:25:23,455
has the most beautiful blossoms
on Zhuque Street.

437
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,359
Madam, do you mean

438
00:25:26,534 --> 00:25:27,695
there are other houses

439
00:25:27,814 --> 00:25:29,935
with apricot trees in the yard?

440
00:25:30,215 --> 00:25:31,334
They symbolize great skills.

441
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:33,334
In the past,

442
00:25:33,695 --> 00:25:35,054
physicians from
the Imperial Academy of Medicine

443
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:37,375
loved to have
an apricot tree in the yard.

444
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:41,774
So there must be many
imperial physicians on the street.

445
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,334
In the past, yes.

446
00:25:43,415 --> 00:25:44,774
But not anymore.

447
00:25:45,695 --> 00:25:47,175
About 30 years ago,

448
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:50,094
several imperial physicians
were in grave trouble.

449
00:25:51,215 --> 00:25:53,054
The others thought it was a bad omen.

450
00:25:53,534 --> 00:25:54,574
So, they moved away.

451
00:25:55,895 --> 00:25:56,975
Grave trouble?

452
00:25:58,814 --> 00:25:59,814
Yes.

453
00:26:00,534 --> 00:26:01,415
Rumor has it

454
00:26:01,855 --> 00:26:03,975
that they failed to save a person
of prestige in the palace.

455
00:26:04,334 --> 00:26:05,574
Their family wealth was confiscated.

456
00:26:06,014 --> 00:26:08,975
Even their wives and children
were banished as outcasts.

457
00:26:14,975 --> 00:26:18,175
We were on the street the whole day.

458
00:26:18,415 --> 00:26:20,054
Many houses have an apricot tree
in the yard.

459
00:26:20,455 --> 00:26:22,494
But none of them has a pond.

460
00:26:23,574 --> 00:26:25,054
All that's left is the one next door.

461
00:26:25,734 --> 00:26:28,695
No one knows its owner.

462
00:26:29,014 --> 00:26:30,655
No one has seen anyone move in either.

463
00:26:32,294 --> 00:26:33,935
But it's such a huge house.

464
00:26:35,175 --> 00:26:36,415
There must be a pond in there.

465
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,774
Young Lady, are you saying...

466
00:26:40,294 --> 00:26:41,935
Juli, get me a ladder.

467
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:42,975
Yes.

468
00:26:47,054 --> 00:26:48,695
Young Lady, why do you need a ladder?

469
00:26:49,094 --> 00:26:50,494
I want to check out the house.
Go get me a ladder.

470
00:26:51,254 --> 00:26:52,814
Young Lady, wait here.

471
00:26:52,814 --> 00:26:53,494
Wait here.

472
00:27:02,175 --> 00:27:04,094
There should be a pond.

473
00:27:07,695 --> 00:27:08,574
I got it, Young Lady.

474
00:27:08,655 --> 00:27:09,855
Come closer.

475
00:27:14,615 --> 00:27:15,615
That's safe.

476
00:27:16,455 --> 00:27:17,254
Silly girl.

477
00:27:17,415 --> 00:27:18,774
I'm visiting a neighbor,

478
00:27:18,814 --> 00:27:20,175
not entering a thieves' den.

479
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:21,094
Is this necessary?

480
00:27:21,254 --> 00:27:22,054
Just in case

481
00:27:22,054 --> 00:27:22,814
the house

482
00:27:22,814 --> 00:27:24,375
is a den of a tiger or worse.

483
00:27:24,975 --> 00:27:26,294
If a tiger lived there,

484
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:27,814
would this mole save me?

485
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:29,695
Would a tiger be picky with its food?

486
00:27:31,014 --> 00:27:31,975
Get me the ladder, quick.

487
00:27:32,415 --> 00:27:33,135
Go.

488
00:27:38,655 --> 00:27:39,734
Young Lady, here you go.

489
00:27:55,655 --> 00:27:57,774
Juli, wait for me at home.

490
00:27:58,534 --> 00:28:00,774
Young Lady, stay safe!

491
00:28:28,334 --> 00:28:30,655
(That person looks
so familiar from the back.)

492
00:28:31,094 --> 00:28:31,695
Zhimo.

493
00:28:32,574 --> 00:28:33,774
Get me the cloak.

494
00:28:34,455 --> 00:28:35,215
(Zhimo?)

495
00:28:36,814 --> 00:28:38,014
(He is Lord Ding!)

496
00:28:40,054 --> 00:28:40,855
Zhimo?

497
00:28:44,175 --> 00:28:45,375
Get me the cloak.

498
00:28:45,734 --> 00:28:46,615
(I should run.)

499
00:28:46,855 --> 00:28:47,534
(No!)

500
00:28:48,014 --> 00:28:49,215
(What if he turns around?)

501
00:28:49,935 --> 00:28:51,814
(Whatever, I'm taking my chances.)

502
00:29:14,975 --> 00:29:16,215
Lord Ding, it's me.

503
00:29:18,774 --> 00:29:19,695
Mu Zhuohua?

504
00:29:21,254 --> 00:29:22,215
It's you again.

505
00:29:23,494 --> 00:29:24,334
My Lord...

506
00:29:26,094 --> 00:29:29,094
My Lord, I was merely curious
about who lived here.

507
00:29:29,175 --> 00:29:30,895
I came over
because I thought no one was here.

508
00:29:31,494 --> 00:29:32,494
I didn't know

509
00:29:32,895 --> 00:29:34,415
this was your house.

510
00:29:36,895 --> 00:29:38,415
My Lord, your cloak.

511
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:40,254
Let me get it for you.

512
00:29:45,294 --> 00:29:46,574
What are the odds?

513
00:29:48,734 --> 00:29:49,734
Perhaps

514
00:29:50,135 --> 00:29:52,054
we are fated to meet here.

515
00:29:56,574 --> 00:29:57,534
Mu Zhuohua.

516
00:29:58,895 --> 00:30:00,935
Your footsteps betrayed you.

517
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:06,855
My Lord,
I didn't mean to keep it a secret.

518
00:30:07,695 --> 00:30:08,455
My Lord.

519
00:30:08,895 --> 00:30:11,135
You... You are a kind person.

520
00:30:11,494 --> 00:30:12,734
Please forgive me.

521
00:30:13,175 --> 00:30:14,494
It won't happen again.

522
00:30:14,935 --> 00:30:15,695
Never.

523
00:30:24,975 --> 00:30:27,135
(Oh no! What is he doing?)

524
00:30:27,734 --> 00:30:29,695
(How could I have known he'd be here?)

525
00:30:29,935 --> 00:30:31,494
(I haven't made up my mind.)

526
00:30:31,855 --> 00:30:33,455
(Why did I get myself
in this situation again?)

527
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:39,254
Come with me.

528
00:30:41,695 --> 00:30:42,094
What?

529
00:30:47,655 --> 00:30:49,494
(An apricot tree and a pond.)

530
00:30:49,494 --> 00:30:51,014
(My mother's parents lived here.)

531
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,375
Judging by what you said earlier,

532
00:31:04,814 --> 00:31:06,254
you live next door.

533
00:31:08,054 --> 00:31:10,054
I thought

534
00:31:10,054 --> 00:31:13,655
that was quite a coincidence.

535
00:31:14,774 --> 00:31:15,975
Indeed.

536
00:31:17,655 --> 00:31:20,135
You are an editor of Hanlin Academy.

537
00:31:20,935 --> 00:31:24,175
Hanlin Academy
is far from Zhuque Street.

538
00:31:26,014 --> 00:31:27,935
Why did you choose to move here?

539
00:31:29,895 --> 00:31:30,655
My Lord,

540
00:31:30,975 --> 00:31:34,494
I moved here
because the rent here is cheap.

541
00:31:35,455 --> 00:31:38,415
You are a man of prestigious status.

542
00:31:38,415 --> 00:31:39,415
You wouldn't know

543
00:31:39,574 --> 00:31:41,814
the hardship of those
who have to drift around.

544
00:31:42,415 --> 00:31:43,814
That day at Fuyun Temple,

545
00:31:44,254 --> 00:31:46,175
I gave you 500 taels.

546
00:31:48,135 --> 00:31:49,534
You've used up all that money already?

547
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:55,774
(Oh no.)

548
00:31:55,774 --> 00:31:57,215
(Playing poor won't work.)

549
00:31:57,534 --> 00:31:58,774
(I need another idea.)

550
00:31:59,774 --> 00:32:00,655
My Lord!

551
00:32:03,774 --> 00:32:04,534
I...

552
00:32:06,415 --> 00:32:08,774
I moved here because I admire you.

553
00:32:10,935 --> 00:32:13,054
But you always ignore me.

554
00:32:13,574 --> 00:32:15,615
So I followed you here

555
00:32:15,774 --> 00:32:19,014
to quench this lovesickness.

556
00:32:19,935 --> 00:32:20,935
Living next door

557
00:32:21,054 --> 00:32:24,334
helps me close the distance
between the two of us.

558
00:32:25,054 --> 00:32:28,494
I get to see you more often.

559
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,695
What is this nonsense?

560
00:32:41,534 --> 00:32:42,415
My Lord.

561
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:45,175
On my way back to the city that day,

562
00:32:45,334 --> 00:32:47,814
I suddenly caught a cold.

563
00:32:49,014 --> 00:32:50,375
You were the one

564
00:32:50,655 --> 00:32:53,135
who took care of me so attentively.

565
00:32:54,895 --> 00:32:57,215
No one has ever been so nice to me.

566
00:32:57,534 --> 00:32:58,415
Therefore,

567
00:32:59,294 --> 00:33:02,175
I fell for you.

568
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:06,615
However,

569
00:33:07,534 --> 00:33:09,734
I am aware of my lowly background.

570
00:33:09,895 --> 00:33:10,975
I'm not worthy of you.

571
00:33:11,254 --> 00:33:12,494
So I thought

572
00:33:12,855 --> 00:33:14,814
I could just stay by your side

573
00:33:15,014 --> 00:33:16,895
in silence.

574
00:33:18,054 --> 00:33:20,774
I can recognize you simply by looking

575
00:33:21,054 --> 00:33:22,254
at the back of your head.

576
00:33:22,814 --> 00:33:26,734
My love for you is deep and true.

577
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,294
I am surprised.

578
00:33:32,935 --> 00:33:34,655
You're good at flirting.

579
00:33:36,254 --> 00:33:38,135
My Lord, anything is worth it

580
00:33:38,294 --> 00:33:39,574
if I can get your attention.

581
00:33:41,814 --> 00:33:44,655
I wouldn't have been bold enough

582
00:33:45,135 --> 00:33:46,655
to come here

583
00:33:47,455 --> 00:33:49,215
if you hadn't seduced me first.

584
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:54,814
When did I ever seduce you?

585
00:33:55,455 --> 00:33:58,135
My Lord, if you didn't like me at all,

586
00:33:58,455 --> 00:34:00,935
why would you take great care of me
on the way?

587
00:34:01,494 --> 00:34:03,135
Given your status,

588
00:34:03,415 --> 00:34:05,094
you could ask your servants
to do so instead.

589
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:08,735
When a man cares so much

590
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:10,614
about a woman,

591
00:34:11,295 --> 00:34:12,654
he is undoubtedly

592
00:34:12,935 --> 00:34:14,174
in love with her.

593
00:34:22,735 --> 00:34:23,534
One more thing.

594
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:26,288
That's the peony I won.

595
00:34:27,134 --> 00:34:29,494
You could have all the famous
and glamorous flowers you want.

596
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:33,094
But this flower carries my love.

597
00:34:34,054 --> 00:34:36,975
If you didn't like me,

598
00:34:37,415 --> 00:34:39,815
why did you take my flower?

599
00:34:40,855 --> 00:34:42,335
You might as well say

600
00:34:43,735 --> 00:34:45,255
the jade pendant I gave you

601
00:34:47,054 --> 00:34:48,935
is a token of our love.

602
00:34:51,415 --> 00:34:52,214
My Lord.

603
00:34:53,255 --> 00:34:54,455
Do you admit

604
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:56,935
you're in love with me?

605
00:34:58,694 --> 00:35:00,694
You claim you're in love with me.

606
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:04,174
You didn't know which path to take.

607
00:35:04,415 --> 00:35:07,415
Do you have the answer now?

608
00:35:11,014 --> 00:35:13,815
My Lord, they're two different matters.

609
00:35:14,574 --> 00:35:15,295
They are not related.

610
00:35:25,174 --> 00:35:26,574
(He is staring straight at me.)

611
00:35:26,815 --> 00:35:28,775
(Did he see through my lie?)

612
00:35:36,415 --> 00:35:37,534
(Don't touch me!)

613
00:35:37,975 --> 00:35:39,455
(I just haven't made up my mind.)

614
00:35:47,494 --> 00:35:48,415
What is this?

615
00:35:51,255 --> 00:35:51,935
My Lord.

616
00:35:52,654 --> 00:35:55,455
It's not easy for a woman
to survive outside.

617
00:35:55,895 --> 00:35:57,494
I want to cover it.

618
00:35:58,534 --> 00:35:59,415
This mole

619
00:35:59,775 --> 00:36:01,255
brings bad luck to the husband.

620
00:36:04,415 --> 00:36:05,054
My Lord.

621
00:36:05,775 --> 00:36:08,855
Are you still mad at me?

622
00:36:10,895 --> 00:36:12,694
If I am mad at you,

623
00:36:13,054 --> 00:36:14,255
what will you do?

624
00:36:17,935 --> 00:36:19,335
If you're still mad at me,

625
00:36:19,654 --> 00:36:20,375
I'll...

626
00:36:20,654 --> 00:36:23,815
I'll figure out a way to cheer you up.

627
00:36:28,694 --> 00:36:31,775
Very well. I forgive you.

628
00:36:33,455 --> 00:36:34,534
Thank you for your kindness.

629
00:36:36,855 --> 00:36:38,694
The floor is cold. Get up.

630
00:36:39,494 --> 00:36:40,255
Yes.

631
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:46,735
I shouldn't bother you any longer.

632
00:36:47,054 --> 00:36:49,094
I'll be on my way now.

633
00:37:06,295 --> 00:37:07,935
My Lord, time for your medicine.

634
00:37:16,054 --> 00:37:16,614
My Lord.

635
00:37:17,455 --> 00:37:18,614
She must be lying when she said

636
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:19,694
she loved you.

637
00:37:20,694 --> 00:37:21,415
Just days ago,

638
00:37:21,735 --> 00:37:23,775
she sent gifts to every household

639
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:24,494
on Zhuque Street,

640
00:37:25,134 --> 00:37:26,295
especially the backstreet.

641
00:37:26,975 --> 00:37:29,214
She visited every family.

642
00:37:30,975 --> 00:37:33,134
She is profit-oriented.

643
00:37:33,415 --> 00:37:34,375
She wouldn't be so kind

644
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:35,494
without an ulterior motive.

645
00:37:35,494 --> 00:37:37,054
Given she's visited every house,

646
00:37:37,574 --> 00:37:38,574
she must be looking for something.

647
00:37:39,855 --> 00:37:41,654
What do you think she's looking for?

648
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:44,775
Judging by her previous whereabouts,

649
00:37:45,255 --> 00:37:47,614
she doesn't know
the true identity of her mother.

650
00:37:48,174 --> 00:37:49,255
She also mentioned to you

651
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:51,174
she wanted her mother
to rest in her hometown.

652
00:37:52,494 --> 00:37:54,574
Could it be her grandfather

653
00:37:55,654 --> 00:37:56,614
was Fu Shengru?

654
00:37:57,295 --> 00:37:58,534
His only daughter...

655
00:37:59,654 --> 00:38:02,574
She was indeed banished as an outcast.

656
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:09,134
That matches her description

657
00:38:09,134 --> 00:38:11,895
of her mother's past.

658
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,200
(Had my mother not died in childbirth,)

659
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,295
(which gave the mastermind an opening,)

660
00:38:19,935 --> 00:38:22,574
(her mother wouldn't have suffered
from such a cruel fate.)

661
00:38:23,255 --> 00:38:24,014
(Perhaps)

662
00:38:24,174 --> 00:38:25,335
(she could've had a better life.)

663
00:38:26,174 --> 00:38:26,855
My Lord.

664
00:38:27,654 --> 00:38:29,014
Mu Zhuohua is full of lies.

665
00:38:29,654 --> 00:38:31,335
Even if she's not related
to the mastermind,

666
00:38:31,614 --> 00:38:32,855
she is certainly up to no good.

667
00:38:34,054 --> 00:38:35,494
Why not expose her identity

668
00:38:35,775 --> 00:38:37,014
and lure the villains out?

669
00:38:39,134 --> 00:38:40,494
A righteous man

670
00:38:40,895 --> 00:38:42,014
must act righteously.

671
00:38:42,895 --> 00:38:43,735
My apologies.

672
00:38:46,255 --> 00:38:46,895
So...

673
00:38:47,694 --> 00:38:50,014
Should we tell her about Fu Shengru?

674
00:38:50,694 --> 00:38:51,815
It might not be wise

675
00:38:52,295 --> 00:38:53,975
to tell her the truth.

676
00:38:55,975 --> 00:38:57,335
After tonight,

677
00:38:58,614 --> 00:39:00,775
I doubt she'll act recklessly again.

678
00:39:17,614 --> 00:39:18,375
Zhijian.

679
00:39:20,094 --> 00:39:21,014
Why do you think

680
00:39:22,614 --> 00:39:24,335
people cherish flowers?

681
00:39:27,415 --> 00:39:28,255
Because...

682
00:39:29,214 --> 00:39:29,935
they are beautiful.

683
00:39:32,054 --> 00:39:33,134
Because they are full of life.

684
00:39:39,654 --> 00:39:42,295
(They always move up toward the sun.)

685
00:39:43,455 --> 00:39:46,735
(A person like myself,
who has been stranded)

686
00:39:46,735 --> 00:39:48,134
(in this stagnant water,)

687
00:39:48,855 --> 00:39:50,654
(yearns for this very much.)

688
00:39:54,935 --> 00:39:55,335
Here...

689
00:39:55,975 --> 00:39:56,375
Here...

690
00:39:58,654 --> 00:39:59,335
Young Lady.

691
00:40:01,335 --> 00:40:02,455
This might sting a little.

692
00:40:05,014 --> 00:40:05,935
By the way,

693
00:40:06,574 --> 00:40:08,094
you broke into Lord Ding's house.

694
00:40:08,335 --> 00:40:09,415
Wasn't he mad?

695
00:40:11,255 --> 00:40:12,775
He wasn't mad at me.

696
00:40:13,174 --> 00:40:14,134
But I think

697
00:40:14,815 --> 00:40:16,935
he never believed the story I made up.

698
00:40:17,574 --> 00:40:18,815
What story did you make up?

699
00:40:20,735 --> 00:40:21,614
I told him

700
00:40:22,174 --> 00:40:23,415
I was in love with him.

701
00:40:24,494 --> 00:40:27,054
Young Lady, you flirted with Lord Ding!

702
00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:28,654
I wasn't flirting.

703
00:40:28,654 --> 00:40:29,935
I was trying to save my neck.

704
00:40:30,455 --> 00:40:31,654
What if he thought

705
00:40:31,775 --> 00:40:33,855
I was spying with ill intent

706
00:40:33,935 --> 00:40:35,494
and had me executed?

707
00:40:35,855 --> 00:40:37,614
Please, you're scaring me.

708
00:40:37,815 --> 00:40:38,574
It's all right.

709
00:40:38,654 --> 00:40:40,935
Therefore, I put my wits to good use.

710
00:40:41,174 --> 00:40:43,335
I told him I loved him,

711
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:45,174
so he couldn't do anything to me.

712
00:40:46,054 --> 00:40:46,855
Good to hear that.

713
00:40:49,415 --> 00:40:50,174
By the way,

714
00:40:50,455 --> 00:40:52,614
did the Third Madam live...

715
00:40:55,014 --> 00:40:57,214
Juli, for us to survive,

716
00:40:57,335 --> 00:40:59,335
we must keep that secret to ourselves.

717
00:40:59,775 --> 00:41:01,134
Lord Ding wouldn't want me

718
00:41:01,134 --> 00:41:02,654
to be caught up in this plot.

719
00:41:03,455 --> 00:41:04,255
Keep that in mind.

720
00:41:05,054 --> 00:41:06,895
Yes. I insisted

721
00:41:07,054 --> 00:41:08,935
that I loved him. That's the deal.

722
00:41:10,494 --> 00:41:13,214
Young Lady,
I need to apply the ointment here too.

723
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:15,775
Juli,

724
00:41:15,855 --> 00:41:17,574
I need an outfit

725
00:41:17,735 --> 00:41:18,975
that can cover this mark.

726
00:41:19,174 --> 00:41:21,174
I have a gathering
