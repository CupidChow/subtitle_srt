a Playful Soul" by Sui Yu Er An)

=Episode 19=

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
(This is a work of fiction.)

20
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:51,110
So, you've been avoiding me

21
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:53,590
because

22
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,710
you have fallen for me?

23
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:57,990
I...

24
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,750
Not...

25
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,030
Not yet.

26
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,310
But...

27
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,950
But you're an outstanding man.

28
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,750
I do worry...

29
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,270
Worry that one day...

30
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,430
I might...

31
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,310
I might

32
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,230
fall for you.

33
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,030
Why are you blushing?

34
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,350
Please take a good rest.

35
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,790
I need to leave now.

36
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,670
Little liar.

37
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,670
You're back.

38
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,270
Did you find the ledger?

39
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,190
We couldn't find
Zhuang Wenfeng's ledger.

40
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,870
(Lanxiu Pavilion)

41
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,470
I see. Please stay here

42
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,590
to take care of His Lordship, then.

43
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:23,990
I'll go and get you some food.

44
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,670
Hold on.

45
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,550
The First Prince has a message for you.

46
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:27,830
What's it?

47
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,590
He said only part of the food relief
was found.

48
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,550
But he'll take care of the rest

49
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,470
and never let the people starve

50
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,270
or corrupt officials get away with it.

51
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,910
His Highness has grown up a lot.

52
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,350
Well, wait for me here.

53
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,830
That's all for pleasantries

54
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,830
and vitriol here.

55
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,710
Let's call it a day.

56
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,710
You're all dismissed now.

57
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,070
Well...

58
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,510
Everyone seems to be
in good health today.

59
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,950
Neither are you
having a headache or fever,

60
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,150
nor are you saying
you want to get rest early.

61
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,070
By the way,

62
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,150
there's someone in our residence
who is not in good health.

63
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,710
I heard that Miss Seventh

64
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,670
even asked Old Master

65
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,790
for the Qinghe sprig for his sake.

66
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,070
A man?

67
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,110
Miss Seventh brought him back?

68
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,670
Besides,

69
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,070
she has brought back more than one man.

70
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,830
There are two.

71
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,350
Isn't it three?

72
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,020
I saw them with my own eyes.

73
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:43,630
No, there are four of them.

74
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,030
She's blessed with such a generous heart

75
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,750
just like her father.

76
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,790
Why?

77
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,430
Only men are allowed
to take in concubines one after one,

78
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,390
but women have to
stick to a man till the end?

79
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,310
Now that Qi
has made something for herself,

80
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,230
she earns her own rights

81
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,550
to choose a husband.

82
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,110
We're envious of her.

83
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,510
Everyone here is envious of her,
am I right?

84
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,190
Get lost!

85
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,710
Yes.

86
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,270
Hurry up, ladies.

87
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,110
Coming.

88
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,750
Be quick.

89
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,950
Who are you?

90
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,350
Who are you?

91
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,620
We're the lady folks of the Mu family.

92
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,660
We're told that we have
an unwell guest here.

93
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,740
So, we came here to visit him.

94
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,780
Are you the concubines?

95
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,380
Yes, we are.

96
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,180
Are you the eighteen concubines
of Mu Rong?

97
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,060
There are nineteen of us now.

98
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,940
Miss Seventh has quite
a bad taste, though.

99
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,900
Look at them.

100
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,260
Average looks

101
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,340
and slim builds.

102
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,500
Young age is the only thing they have.

103
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,980
That's good enough.

104
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,900
They're pretty decent to me.

105
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,580
Their physique

106
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,540
isn't sturdy enough,

107
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,620
but they have a delicate look.

108
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,620
They are handsome.

109
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,580
What nonsense are you saying?

110
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,940
Please allow us in, young men.

111
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,300
We want to visit the unwell guest.

112
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:24,940
You're not going inside.

113
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,780
Why are you so fierce?

114
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,780
That's right. We have to see
the other two.

115
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,620
The other two?

116
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,380
The one inside here
must be the legitimate one.

117
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,900
That's right.

118
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,620
I got a sneak peek of him just now.

119
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,780
The one inside is mature and composed.

120
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,220
He's a better choice for Miss Seventh.

121
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,260
Really?

122
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,620
How blessed of her.

123
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,540
Get lost!

124
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,420
Don't shout at us.

125
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,260
You scared me.

126
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,660
That's right. You're so fierce.

127
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,460
No one has shouted at me before.

128
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,020
Let's leave.

129
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,580
Those concubines are so idle

130
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,780
and spend their time talking nonsense.

131
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,340
I think what they said

132
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,460
makes sense.

133
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,060
Are you serious?

134
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,820
They are just nonsense.

135
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,380
Here, My Lord.

136
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,460
The medicine is getting cold soon.

137
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,180
Take it now.

138
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,260
Let me help you.

139
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,460
Do you mean...

140
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,100
Slowly.

141
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,100
The nonsense

142
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,260
refers to good fortunes

143
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,540
or...

144
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,660
My Lord.

145
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,260
Are you all right, My Lord?

146
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,940
Did you hurt yourself, My Lord?

147
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,500
I didn't mean it.

148
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,540
Do you feel hurt, My Lord?

149
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,660
My Lord.

150
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,620
My Lord.

151
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,100
I'm fine.

152
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,500
My Lord!

153
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,380
You scared me.

154
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,220
How could you lie to me?

155
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,820
I wasn't lying.

156
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,740
You were toying with Zhuang Wenfeng,

157
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,300
making him believe
that he has taken control of the situation

158
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,660
but he was actually the prey.

159
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,620
It's all thanks to you, My Lord.

160
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,780
I saw Zhijian the other day.

161
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,060
Zhijian seems to be

162
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,660
losing his touch.

163
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,500
You could actually find his trail.

164
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,500
That day,
after I left Tutor Shang's place,

165
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,180
I noticed someone was tailing me.

166
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,980
I wanted to lure this person out,

167
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,100
which turned out to be Zhijian.

168
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,860
And that was why

169
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,740
I decided to use the honey trap.

170
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Honey trap?

171
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:41,700
Yes.

172
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,340
What's wrong?

173
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,380
Do you doubt me?

174
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,300
Do I look ugly to you?

175
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,220
You said this yourself.

176
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,060
I just don't want you

177
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,340
to put your life at risk.

178
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,500

Qi.

213
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,660
I've been looking around for you

214
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,220
for a long time.

215
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,020
So, here you are.

216
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,620
Why did you retrieve my kite?

217
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,780
That's right.

218
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,380
I got the kite back for you.

219
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,460
Come on, you can continue.

220
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,300
I released this kite
to ward off rotten luck.

221
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,100
How could you retrieve it?

222
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,140
Ward off rotten luck?

223
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,820
Qi, listen to me.

224
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,060
You can't pamper men too much.

225
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,380
Of course,

226
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,100
apart from me.

227
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,020
I don't want to be mean.

228
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,780
But since Qi has chosen you,

229
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,540
you should do your best to assist her.

230
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,900
How could you get her sidetracked

231
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,380
and influence her to play with kites?

232
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,780
My Qi

233
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
has a position and status.

234
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,220
Therefore,

235
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,020
you should be domestic

236
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,020
and obedient.

237
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,060
You mustn't throw your weight around

238
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,220
in the name of Qi.

239
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,460
Do you hear me?

240
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,380
Furthermore,

241
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,780
as a man,

242
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,540
don't be petty.

243
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,460
You have to take care
of the household for Qi.

244
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,580
Always avoid jealousy,

245
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,380
getting emotional,

246
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,100
or being sensitive.

247
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,660
Well, back then,

248
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,980
that Gu...

249
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,100
I can't remember her name.

250
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,860
That woman was always so gloomy.

251
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,060
What a spoilsport.

252
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:50,940
Enough said.

253
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,660
Please watch your words.

254
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,020
I...

255
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,780
I...

256
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,340
How dare a kept man like you

257
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,260
talk to me like that?

258
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,620
Just you wait.

259
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,380
Are you thinking of your mother?

260
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,700
I feel so upset for her.

261
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,820
Old Master Mu

262
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,020
is indeed cruel and heartless.

263
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,780
All of his concubines

264
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,620
suffer from jealousy

265
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,220
because of him.

266
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,500
But in his eyes,

267
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,940
he sees their feelings as ominous.

268
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,580
Let bygones be bygones.

269
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,620
Your mother suffered because of love,

270
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,180
but deep inside,

271
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,540
she loved you the most.

272
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,740
Now that you've matured
into an exceptional individual,

273
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,380
she must be glad

274
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,300
and can rest in peace.

275
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,740
My Lord, since you're out and about,

276
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,340
let's leave tomorrow.

277
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,980
But before we do,

278
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,420
I have something important to do.

279
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,220
What did you just say?

280
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,300
Qi, please change your request.

281
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,900
I'll make it happen for you.

282
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,860
Your mother belongs to the Mu family.

283
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,540
You can't simply move
her ashes elsewhere.

284
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,620
But you've never pegged her
as part of the Mu family.

285
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,660
Didn't you claim

286
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,060
that my mother didn't deserve
to be buried in the ancestral tomb

287
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,420
due to her humble status?

288
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,140
You were so furious

289
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,300
that you wanted to burn her remains.

290
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,860
Thanks to the benevolent First Madam,

291
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,660
I managed to move my mother's ashes

292
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,620
into the residence shrine.

293
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,140
So what?

294
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,700
I provided her with the best life.

295
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,540
She had already enjoyed
a life of comfort while she was alive,

296
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,900
so there's no need
to have a grand funeral after death.

297
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,860
What's the use
of having a grand funeral?

298
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,300
What my mother asked for

299
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,940
is nothing but your true heart.

300
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,260
If you didn't love her,

301
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,900
you shouldn't have made
the promise to her

302
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,500
and deceived her into marrying you.

303
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,580
Deceived her?

304
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,500
That sounds offensive.

305
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,700
I didn't deceive her.

306
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,180
She was merely a courtesan.

307
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,660
If not for me,

308
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,180
she would still be stuck in the mire.

309
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,900
That's enough.

310
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,940
Whatever you say,
she belongs to the Mu family,

311
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,220
alive or dead.

312
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,300
She can never leave here.

313
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,860
You're afraid of being humiliated

314
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,500
once this gets out.
Am I right, Old Master Mu?

315
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,340
You...

316
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,300
My Lord.

317
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,460
It hurts!

318
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,220
My Lord.

319
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:29,940
Let go!

320
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,820
Why are you here?

321
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,500
I was worried about you,

322
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,660
so I came here.

323
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:36,780
I suppose

324
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,700
I showed up just in time.

325
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,980
Are you all right, My Lord?

326
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,700
Here, let me check on you.

327
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,180
I've told you

328
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,980
not to initiate your inner strength.

329
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,180
Don't worry.

330
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:02,820
I'm fine.

331
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,020
"My Lord"?

332
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,660
Who are you to call yourself a lord

333
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,860
in front of me, gigolo?

334
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:21,980
Lord?

335
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:34,980
Qi.

336
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,060
Which lord is he?

337
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,660
How many lords do we have
in Southern Chen?

338
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,580
Greetings, My Lord.

339
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,300
I was clueless

340
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,060
about your presence, My Lord.

341
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,380
Qi.

342
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,300
First Madam told us
that you're leaving soon.

343
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,700
So, we come to bid you farewell.

344
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,460
Old Master, who are you kneeling for?

345
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,380
It's not a festival or something else.

346
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,940
Lord Ding.

347
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,060
We have Lord Ding here.

348
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,580
Lord Ding?

349
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:20,010
(Mu's Residence)

350
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:29,820
Hyah!

351
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,220
Qi has amounted to something.

352
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,020
She even brought home a lord.

353
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,620
You've just learned the lesson.

354
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,900
Can't you watch your mouth?

355
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,180
I was terrified just now.

356
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,180
Stop mocking me.

357
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,060
My dear Qi,

358
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,900
I'm proud of her.

359
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,140
I want some.

360
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:18,700
Here you go.

361
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:19,900
I'll do this.

362
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,260
Your Highness, you've toiled these days.

363
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,500
Please return to the carriage
and take a rest.

364
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,020
Leave this to me.

365
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,380
The people are suffering.

366
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,700
How can I sit back in good conscience?

367
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,380
Here.

368
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,500
Orders from Official Zhou.

369
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,740
We must find Xue Xiaotang

370
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,940
before Lord Ding.

371
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,340
Use Princess Roujia as the bait

372
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,860
to lure him out

373
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,860
and eliminate him.

374
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:45,820
Understood.

375
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:46,940
Don't worry.
Everyone will get a share.

376
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,460
Thank you.

377
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,820
Give me more.

378
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,780
Those at the back, please move forward.

379
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,300
Don't break the line.

380
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,950
Everyone will get a share. Be patient.

381
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,940
(Yunlou Inn)

382
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,540
When my mother
just married Old Master Mu,

383
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:32,420
they were deeply in love.

384
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,220
But she could never predict

385
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,980
that he married a new concubine

386
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,020
half a year later.

387
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,700
After that, my mother died in sorrow.

388
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,540
I don't even know

389
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,900
if she regretted marrying
into the Mu family.

390
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,180
At least she had you.

391
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,620
My Lord, bad news!

392
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,220
Princess is in trouble, My Lord.

393
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,380
A riot erupted at the congee stall
and Princess went missing.

394
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,580
Dispatch troops from County Yamen.

395
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,900
We're going to quell the riot

396
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,860
and search for my sister.

397
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,420
Yes.

398
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,220
And save the innocent victims.

399
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,340
Stop right there!

400
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,300
Stop running!

401
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:41,820
Stop!

402
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,020
Your Highness!

403
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,820
Why?

404
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,660
I've offered you food.

405
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,260
Why do you have to do this to me?

406
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,620
No, you're not refugees.

407
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,900
Xue Xiaotang, you finally show up!

408
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,420
Xiaotang.

409
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,420
Your Highness.

410
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,500
Xiaotang!

411
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,780
Your Highness!

412
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,380
Your Highness!

413
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,100
Your Highness.

414
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,940
He's dead.

415
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,460
Jiao!

416
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,060
Jiao!

417
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,180
Jiao.

418
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,740
The imperial physicians
are treating the refugees out there.

419
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,340
I'll take it from here.

420
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,420
Don't worry, Official Shen.

421
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,940
Her Highness passed out
due to a deficiency

422
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,460
in both qi and blood,

423
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,660
combined with the impact
of extreme anger.

424
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,060
She will heal up
after resting for some days.

425
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,740
Thank you so much.

426
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:16,620
No problem.

427
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,820
How's my sister doing?

428
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:20,980
Greetings, Your Highness.

429
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,900
Her Highness is all right.

430
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,100
She just needs meticulous care.

431
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,380
How about you? Are you injured?

432
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,700
I'm all right. Thank you, Your Highness.

433
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,660
By the way, Your Highness.

434
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,580
Is there something off
about those refugees?

435
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,060
I interrogated one of them,

436
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:40,940
who got injured

437
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,460
while hunting down Jiao.

438
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,220
That guy flat out said

439
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,060
they were infuriated
because Jiao added brans to the congee

440
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,420
to fool them.

441
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,900
But does this excuse warrant murder?

442
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,620
Besides, they know martial skills.

443
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,220
They're not refugees

444
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,420
but assassins.

445
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,380
By the way, where's my uncle?

446
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,940
After seeing Princess is all right,

447
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,420
His Lordship led the Falcon Squad

448
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,620
to the bottom of the cliff
to search for Xue Xiaotang's body.

449
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,900
Given the time,

450
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,260
I'm afraid they haven't found anything.

451
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,980
The situation in Jiangnan

452
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,380
is getting more complex.

453
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,460
Yes. At first,
the food provision is gone.

454
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,180
Although we've found some,

455
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,780
most remain unknown.

456
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,100
Then, the fake refugees
initiated a riot.

457
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,460
As of now,

458
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,620
the ledger Zhuang Wenfeng hid

459
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,820
is missing.

460
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,740
How hateful of them!

461
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,900
How could they
treat people's lives lightly?

462
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,500
The disaster relief

463
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,300
is our priority now.

464
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,660
Given the time now,

465
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,500
the new food provision allocated
by the imperial court

466
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,460
will arrive tomorrow.

467
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,940
We must get ready for it.

468
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,620
Man.

469
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,260
How is she?

470
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,380
Official Shen.

471
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,860
You've been taking care
of Her Princess the whole night.

472
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,380
Why don't you get some rest?

473
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:04,860
I'm fine.

474
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,500
Your Highness.

475
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,300
Great! Finally, you're awake.

476
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,300
Official Shen was worried sick.

477
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,540
Your Highness, do you feel better now?

478
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,260
Have they found Xiaotang?

479
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,580
Well...

480
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:33,780
Your Highness.

481
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,100
General Xue risked his life
to protect you

482
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,260
because he wanted you
to be safe and happy.

483
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,140
Jiao.

484
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,700
You're finally awake.

485
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,140
I've been worried all night.

486
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,420
Don't worry.

487
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:47,940
I'm all right.

488
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,540
You should let Ms. Mu check on you.

489
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,140
Your Highness.

490
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,300
You're all right,

491
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,700
but your body is weak

492
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,860
and needs proper rest.

493
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,340
I told you I'm fine.

494
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,660
How's the situation out there?

495
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,620
Rest assured.

496
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,420
Things are improving.

497
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,180
Look, the relief provision
from the imperial court is here!

498
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,140
We're saved!

499
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:27,700
Great!

500
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,820
We won't get starved anymore!

501
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:51,860
- Come on.
- I didn't do that.

502
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:52,780
I don't dare!

503
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,460
Jeez!

504
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,300
You wretched woman!

505
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,700
How dare you come back here alone!

506
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,460
(Madam Zhuang, Zhuang Wenfeng's mother)
You left with Wenfeng.

507
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,580
(Madam Zhuang, Zhuang Wenfeng's mother)
But now he got arrested,

508
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,820
(Madam Zhuang, Zhuang Wenfeng's mother)
and you're back here. Why?

509
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,780
I don't know, Mother.

510
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,540
I was inside the room

511
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,620
when they took him away.

512
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,740
I have no idea about what happened.

513
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,300
They must have a reason to arrest him.

514
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,860
Didn't the officials tell you anything?

515
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,580
No.

516
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,220
They just arrested him

517
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,660
without saying anything.

518
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,100
You useless woman!

519
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:22,860
This way, please.

520
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,140
Wretched woman!

521
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,140
Jinx!

522
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,900
- Please stop!
- I'll beat you to death!

523
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,660
Please stop!

524
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,340
Useless fool!

525
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,540
Stop.

526
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,140
Who are you?

527
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,420
Old woman.

528
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,020
Do you want to defy the law?

529
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,900
Beating people

530
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,100
in broad daylight.

531
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,940
I have the right to teach
my daughter-in-law.

532
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,980
Who are you

533
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,300
to tell me what to do in my place?

534
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,300
Men.

535
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,540
How dare you threaten
a primary sixth-rank official?

536
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,460
Old woman.

537
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,180
Do you want to accompany your son
in prison?

538
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,540
No need to look at me like that.

539
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,380
Look at how successful you are

540
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,380
after becoming an official.

541
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,980
You must be glad

542
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,380
you ran off before the wedding

543
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,460
and avoided all this trouble.

544
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,780
Eighth Sister.

545
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,020
You're putting it the wrong way.

546
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,660
You were the one who insisted on
marrying County Magistrate Zhuang.

547
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,660
I ran off before the wedding

548
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,580
and it's what you wished for.

549
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,780
As for the things
you went through afterward,

550
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,180
I didn't predict that,

551
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,780
and neither did you.

552
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,540
So, don't you think it's ridiculous

553
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,980
to put the blame on me?

554
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,180
I know you came here to laugh at me.

555
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,220
Well,

556
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,740
that's all for the joke.

557
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,580
You should leave now.

558
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,060
Today, I'm here

559
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,620
to make a deal with you.

560
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,020
What do you mean?

561
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,180
Eight Sister,

562
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,620
you're smart.

563
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,540
You always know

564
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,180
how to plan for yourself

565
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,380
and make the right choices

566
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,660
that are most advantageous for you.

567
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,700
What are you trying to say?

568
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,500
I bet you know

569
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,260
where Zhuang Wenfeng's ledger is.

570
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,980
You want me to sell him out?

571
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,460
As long as you hand over
the evidence to the Ministry of Justice,

572
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,660
Zhuang Wenfeng will be convicted.

573
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:11,860
And I assure you

574
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,740
I'll get you out of the Zhuang family

575
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,340
and give you a sum of money.

576
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,060
This way, you'll be free

577
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:21,020
and can live carefreely
for the rest of your life.

578
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,260
You're smart,

579
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,540
however, you have confined yourself

580
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,340
to this little residence.

581
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,420
As of now, I'm in favor of His Majesty.

582
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,180
If you're looking for someone
to rely on,

583
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,420
aren't I the most trustworthy one?

584
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:50,940
How much?

585
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,580
One thousand guan.

586
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:53,820
Three thousand guan.

587
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,780
Are you sincere about this deal?

588
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,100
You want me to risk my life
for merely one thousand guan?

589
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,420
No way.

590
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,590
(Zhuang's Residence)

591
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,460
You couldn't convince her?

592
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,780
Let me try.

593
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,700
No need.

594
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,580
I can bring Zhuang Wenfeng down myself

595
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,420
without her help.

596
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,260
My Lord.

597
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,180
You're on the mend.

598
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,460
Don't stand here.

599
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,660
You should go inside.

600
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,180
Are you going out?

601
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,980
We're returning to the capital soon.

602
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,740
So I want to pay Tutor Shang
another visit.

603
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:39,980
Yes, you should.

604
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,500
I'll go with you.

605
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,020
Why are you standing there?

606
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,460
Come on.

607
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,740
Why are you going with me?

608
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,500
I'd like to pay Mr. Shang a visit.

609
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,220
No...

610
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,060
No, you don't have to.

611
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:02,660
Why not?

612
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,660
Tutor Shang refrains

613
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,420
from meeting strangers.

614
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,900
That's why he went into hiding
in Yongding County.

615
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,460
You don't have to visit him, My Lord.

616
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,940
But I heard

617
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,100
that Mr. Shang is cheerful.

618
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,580
And he has many friends.

619
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,500
No, he's not cheerful at all.

620
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,580
He only speaks

621
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,420
to those fishing folks.

622
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,990
How could he groom a student
as eloquent as you

623
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
if he's not cheerful?

624
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:30,970
I was born with it.

625
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,500
My Lord.

626
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,500
Here's your peach blossom brew.

627
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,700
Wait...

628
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,220
You even prepared a gift.

629
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,580
You fool me again.

630
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,580
No.

631
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,380
You're the one who fools me.

632
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:48,820
I fool you?

633
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:49,780
Let's go.

634
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:54,820
This is the place.

635
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,560
(Fenghua Garden)

636
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,220
Excellent calligraphy.

637
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,420
My teacher writes great calligraphy.

638
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,340
I'll go and check it out.

639
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,660
It's dark inside.

640
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,180
Maybe he's not back yet.

641
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,260
My Lord.

642
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,500
Let's go to the lakeside
to look for him.

643
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,060
Looks like

644
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,780
Tutor Shang is obsessed with fishing,

645
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,020
just like those rumors say.

646
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,340
Well, my teacher

647
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,420
is overconfident
about his fishing skills.

648
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,620
He always imagines
that he could reap a bumper harvest.

649
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,460
However, in fact,

650
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:46,100
he ended up empty-handed
most of the time.

651
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,220
You're disrespectful.

652
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,260
How dare you badmouth me
behind my back?

653
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,020
If you said so,

654
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,780
look at your empty basket.

655
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,460
You're so clueless to bring this up.

656
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,300
I, Liu Yan,

657
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,100
offer my greetings, sir.

658
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,380
Oh.

659
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,340
He's pretending.

660
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,380
He noticed you long ago.

661
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,420
You talk too much.

662
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,460
Take this.

663
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:16,860
Here you go.

664
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,700
Is this for me?

665
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,620
Please accept my gift, sir.

666
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,620
Hahaha.

667
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,380
Thank you.

668
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,580
Let's go inside.

669
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,900
He likes drinking.

670
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,460
They must be good brews.

671
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,180
Come on, sit.

672
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,420
Let me have a taste of it.

673
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,180
Drink slowly. Don't drink too much.

674
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,380
Please take care of your health.

675
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,460
You're old already.

676
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,940
Why bother?

677
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,460
Live to the fullest with fine brews,

678
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:53,250
one couldn't care less
about vain fame afterlife.

679
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,900
You're always full of nonsense.

680
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,860
Are you cooking something on the stove?

681
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,020
It seems overcooked.

682
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:04,820
Oh, no.

683
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:05,940
I forgot that.

684
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,300
It smells familiar.

685
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:16,820
I knew you would be here.

686
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,140
So I made this for you.

687
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,740
My favorite fish soup. I knew it.

688
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,420
Here you go.

689
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,180
Thank you so much.

690
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,580
Have a taste, My Lord.

691
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,620
His fish soup is delicious.

692
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,100
Try it, My Lord.

693
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,020
This is so good.

694
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,060
Is it nice, My Lord?

695
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,900
This is a special serving for you.

696
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,380
I added more salt to your soup.

697
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,220
It tastes good.

698
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,980
You know what?

699
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,660
When I was little,

700
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,380
whenever I sneaked out
to attend lessons here,

701
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,180
I'd bribe Juli with my food.

702
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,540
She'd then keep a lookout for me.

703
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,900
Afterward, Tutor Shang noticed
I always came here starving,

704
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,580
he cooked all the fish he caught

705
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,900
for me.

706
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,980
If it weren't for my fish soup,

707
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,340
you wouldn't have

708
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,940
grown up smart.

709
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:15,820
Rightfully so.

710
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,980
Regarding disaster relief,

711
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,020
I need to give you a heads-up.

712
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,140
Strictly speaking,

713
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,660
you merely solved it superficially.

714
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,940
Sir, do you mean

715
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,740
we haven't solved the root of the issue?

716
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:41,700
Yes.

717
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:46,420
When you see mold on the fruit,

718
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,300
it's futile to just remove the mold.

719
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:55,020
You might find it rotten to the core
when you cut it open.

720
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,980
You're born into the royal family.

721
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,420
You should know these complexities

722
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,900
better than we do.

723
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,620
Yongding County is a small township.

724
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,060
We used to think
it was easy to deal with.

725
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,900
Little did we know

726
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,380
that corruption keeps on showing up.

727
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,540
At this rate,

728
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,340
these affluent clans

729
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,340
seem to be too big

730
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:28,260
to control.

731
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,060
So Zhuang Wenfeng

732
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,260
is just a pawn.

733
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,140
It takes more than one cold day

734
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,860
to freeze the river.

735
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,060
Young girl,

736
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,460
why do you sigh?

737
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,020
I ask you not to drink,

738
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,420
and you ask me not to sigh.

739
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,500
When are you leaving?

740
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,020
Soon.

741
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,900
Have you settled everything?

742
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,900
Most pressing matters

743
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,420
have been taken care of.

744
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,340
As for the minor ones...

745
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,180
That means

746
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:19,300
you have some minor issues pending?

747
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,420
Yes.

748
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,500
You may continue.

749
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,340
I'll step out to get some fresh air.

750
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:29,980
