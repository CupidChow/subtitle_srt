a Playful Soul" by Sui Yu Er An)

=Episode 18=

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,035
(This is a work of fiction.)

20
00:01:48,085 --> 00:01:49,860
(Jishan Hall)

21
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,580
(Zhuohua,)

22
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:52,299
you look exceptionally beautiful
in this outfit today.

23
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,980
Is there something
that's making you happy?

24
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:57,179
Thanks to First Prince
and Your Highness.

25
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,220
The disaster situation
has finally eased.

26
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:01,539
I could finally feel at ease
because of this.

27
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,459
(Jishan Hall)
Your Highness.

28
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,500
Your Highness.

29
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,419
Your Highness.

30
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,979
You're like a goddess
descending to the mortal realm.

31
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,699
Thank you for saving our lives.

32
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:13,060
- He's right.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

33
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,460
Thank you, Your Highness.

34
00:02:15,066 --> 00:02:16,186
Also, this kind-hearted official.

35
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,699
I've seen it very clearly.

36
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,620
She is one of the officials

37
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,859
who has been tirelessly working for us

38
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:22,060
over the days.

39
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:24,819
- Thank you, Official.
- Thank you, Official.

40
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,340
Your Highness, Official.

41
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:27,780
We're not well-off,

42
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,020
and we don't have much to offer.

43
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,020
This is a purse embroidered by my wife.

44
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:31,699
Please accept it.

45
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:32,659
This is my gift.

46
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:34,340
- Please accept it.
- Please accept our gifts.

47
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,340
We can't accept things for nothing.

48
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,300
These are things we should do, anyway.

49
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,340
Your Highness, please accept it.

50
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:38,900
Thank you.

51
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:39,620
Please accept our gifts.

52
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:40,539
Thank you.

53
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:41,020
Official, Your Highness,

54
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,699
please accept our gifts.

55
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,340
Many thanks.

56
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:42,859
Thank you.

57
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:43,659
Thank you.

58
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,579
Thank you all.

59
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,379
These are my favorites,
and I'm giving them to you.

60
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:49,300
What are these?

61
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,859
These are colorful pebbles.

62
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:53,620
Colorful pebbles?

63
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,180
Thank you, Your Highness.

64
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:56,900
Then we won't be in your way anymore.

65
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,620
Thank you, Your Highness and Official.

66
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,780
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- Thank you, Official.

67
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,060
It's our responsibility.

68
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,379
Your Highness,

69
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,740
I now understand

70
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,060
why you established Jishan Hall.

71
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:13,780
Well, tell me your thoughts.

72
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,340
To let more children

73
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:17,859
have colorful pebbles to play with.

74
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:20,620
As an official before this,

75
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:22,979
I always thought
about making a path for myself.

76
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,099
But from now on,

77
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,819
I want to make a path
for everyone as well.

78
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:39,259
I was wondering where you were.

79
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:41,340
It turns out you're here.

80
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:42,460
Sleeping, huh?

81
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:43,500
Did I say you can sleep?

82
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,900
I told you to attend
to Old Madam's illness.

83
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:49,539
Yet you're slacking off right here?

84
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,539
Look at you.

85
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,180
You can't have children

86
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,539
or take care of others.

87
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:55,699
Why should I raise you, then?

88
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,659
Zhuang Wenfeng,

89
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,699
you know very well
what happened to my child.

90
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,060
He was four months old

91
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:05,740
and was already moving.

92
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:08,300
You were the one who beat him to death!

93
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:10,139
Wait... Are you...

94
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,859
Are you blaming me now?

95
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:14,740
How dare you!

96
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,100
Zhuang Wenfeng,

97
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:25,540
are you even human?

98
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:28,740
I just had a miscarriage.

99
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:31,100
I only wanted to rest for a while
in the room

100
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:32,940
because I wasn't feeling well.

101
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,579
And you started hitting and kicking me.

102
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:38,579
Listen here.

103
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:41,100
I did not marry into the Zhuang family

104
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,500
to be your servant!

105
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,379
Unbelievable.

106
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,579
It's outrageous, completely outrageous!

107
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,180
You dare talk back to me?

108
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,379
You're talking back to me?

109
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:49,019
Let me go!

110
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:50,300
You dare to talk back to me?

111
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,899
Let me go! Stop it!

112
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:54,100
This is what you get
for talking back to me!

113
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,860
Do it again!

114
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,139
(I have something to report.)

115
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:57,620
(Official Zhuang!)

116
00:04:58,219 --> 00:04:58,980
(Official Zhuang!)

117
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,500
What is it?

118
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,339
You'd better reflect on your actions.

119
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:19,019
What is it?

120
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:20,940
Official Zhuang,

121
00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:22,980
Mu Zhuohua has returned.

122
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:24,899
Really?

123
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,660
Yes.

124
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:28,100
But you're heading
to the capital next month

125
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,339
for the triennial evaluations.

126
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,339
Well...

127
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:31,620
I've taken care of the things there.

128
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:33,620
But before I leave,

129
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,379
I must settle the things here first.

130
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,699
You must deliver this
to First Prince for me.

131
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,980
Seventh Sister.

132
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,310
(Mingxiang Pavilion)

133
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,019
How fate played tricks on us.

134
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,740
I was the one eager to get married.

135
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,579
Yet, because you got caught in the rain,

136
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,420
and I lost my chance to get married.

137
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,300
But unexpectedly,

138
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:15,459
you ran away from marriage.

139
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,300
And I ended up marrying
the person I wanted.

140
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:20,980
Speaking of which,

141
00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:22,819
I have to thank you, Seventh Sister.

142
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:28,660
By the way,

143
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:31,660
why didn't you go home
since you've returned?

144
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,980
How have you been lately?

145
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:39,459
My life

146
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:41,379
has been hard, of course.

147
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:44,779
It's nothing like your high life.

148
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,579
Eighth Sister,

149
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:57,339
have you been doing well?

150
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,300
Of course, I have.

151
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,540
That's why I want to thank you,
Seventh Sister.

152
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:05,339
How about this?

153
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,699
Instead of wine, I use this cup of tea

154
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:09,620
to give you a toast.

155
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:39,779
Seventh Sister?

156
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,459
Why did you come back

157
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:49,500
since you've run away from the marriage?

158
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:51,540
It's fine even if you returned.

159
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:53,579
But why did you let Butler Zhou see you?

160
00:07:58,779 --> 00:07:59,860
You'd better listen to me.

161
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,219
She's nothing more than
an illegitimate daughter.

162
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,540
Your mother said she's mine long ago.

163
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,540
It's only reasonable and lawful for me

164
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,660
to bring back my runaway concubine.

165
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,019
What are you worrying about?

166
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,139
But if you defy me,

167
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,899
you know what I'll do to you.

168
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,139
Do you hear me?

169
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:18,139
Huh?

170
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,500
Just blame yourself for this.

171
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,420
My beauty,

172
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:55,979
you're finally in my hands.

173
00:08:58,219 --> 00:09:01,060
Do you know
I've been looking for you everywhere?

174
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:08,180
Official Zhuang,

175
00:09:08,859 --> 00:09:12,099
I've finally met you.

176
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:13,940
Wait.

177
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:15,499
What's going on here?

178
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,819
You wanted to see me?

179
00:09:17,819 --> 00:09:19,180
Didn't you escape?

180
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,140
I heard

181
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,060
you were working under Lord Ding

182
00:09:26,619 --> 00:09:28,459
when you were in the capital.

183
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,099
Why did you come back?

184
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:34,979
Official Zhuang,

185
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,499
Lord Ding is a fickle person.

186
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,459
How can he
be a reliable long-term support?

187
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,380
Besides,

188
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,060
I didn't intend

189
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,499
to escape the marriage back then.

190
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,739
You didn't intend
to escape the marriage?

191
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,099
How so?

192
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,420
Think about it, sir.

193
00:09:54,579 --> 00:09:55,979
If I did intend to escape,

194
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,780
why would I return now?

195
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,300
Actually, that day,

196
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,020
I didn't intend to run away
from the marriage.

197
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:03,859
I was knocked unconscious

198
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:04,780
and sent away.

199
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:05,979
What happened?

200
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,780
Sir, you don't know this.

201
00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:13,579
I'm only an illegitimate daughter
of the Mu family.

202
00:10:13,979 --> 00:10:16,060
I never received any affection
from the First Madam of the family

203
00:10:16,219 --> 00:10:17,499
and went through a lot of hardships.

204
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,979
And you're the respected
county magistrate.

205
00:10:20,499 --> 00:10:21,819
It's a blessing for me

206
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,819
to be able to associate with you.

207
00:10:24,099 --> 00:10:25,540
How could I possibly want to run away
from the marriage?

208
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,540
I then gave the situation a thought.

209
00:10:29,219 --> 00:10:30,739
The marriage didn't go
according to plan,

210
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,660
and I was accused
of escaping the marriage.

211
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,900
So, I could only find a supporter
in the capital.

212
00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:37,900
Who... Who did it?

213
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:41,540
After I give it a thought,

214
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,180
Eighth Sister

215
00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:45,819
is likely behind it.

216
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,579
Her?

217
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:50,300
Why would she do that?

218
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,540
You may not know,

219
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,859
but that day, Eighth Sister invited me

220
00:10:54,859 --> 00:10:56,140
to the mountains to offer incense.

221
00:10:56,499 --> 00:10:57,819
Only then did I realize

222
00:10:57,819 --> 00:10:59,219
that she wanted to marry you.

223
00:10:59,979 --> 00:11:02,339
She thought I was dull and ordinary,

224
00:11:02,739 --> 00:11:04,900
which would make her appear
more beautiful in comparison.

225
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,219
But who knew

226
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,140
that heavy rain

227
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:11,819
would bring us together,

228
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,459
and I caught your attention.

229
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:16,940
Eighth Sister worked hard planning this.

230
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,739
But her effort ended up benefiting
someone else.

231
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,260
She felt upset

232
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:21,859
and sought revenge against me.

233
00:11:22,819 --> 00:11:23,660
Outrageous!

234
00:11:23,979 --> 00:11:24,739
Guards!

235
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,880
Bring that wretched woman here!

236
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,020
Greetings, sir.

237
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,660
Why have you called

238
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:37,579
for me?

239
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:38,780
You wretched woman!

240
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,180
You were the one who hired people
to abduct Miss Seventh that day

241
00:11:41,219 --> 00:11:42,380
and ruined my plan!

242
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,060
Sir, why did you say that?

243
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,540
You...

244
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,459
Eighth Sister,

245
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,380
you invited me to the mountain

246
00:11:48,619 --> 00:11:50,459
because you wanted to marry him.

247
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,380
I never intended to compete with you.

248
00:11:52,739 --> 00:11:53,819
So why did you harm me?

249
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:55,619
I didn't do it!

250
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,180
We lived close to each other.

251
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,579
If I disappeared,

252
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,140
you would have known right away.

253
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,739
But when did you tell

254
00:12:02,979 --> 00:12:04,459
our parents about it?

255
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,300
I didn't hire anyone to abduct her.

256
00:12:08,499 --> 00:12:10,499
I wouldn't have the ability to do so.

257
00:12:10,499 --> 00:12:12,219
Oh, no. You truly are quite resourceful.

258
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:13,540
Otherwise, how could you

259
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,060
have gathered such detailed information

260
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,780
about when he went up the mountain?

261
00:12:18,099 --> 00:12:19,219
Mu Zhuohua, you...

262
00:12:19,219 --> 00:12:19,900
Guards!

263
00:12:19,979 --> 00:12:21,140
Take her away and lock her up!

264
00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:22,979
No visitation is allowed!

265
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,900
Come with me, please.

266
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,859
Sir, please calm down.

267
00:12:38,099 --> 00:12:40,499
Today is a joyful day.

268
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:42,219
Sir,

269
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:44,020
could you please have someone fetch

270
00:12:44,219 --> 00:12:46,020
some rouge for me?

271
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,739
I want to do makeup.

272
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:50,660
Of course.

273
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:00,300
Sir,

274
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,219
could you wait outside for me?

275
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,219
I'd like to surprise you

276
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,979
after getting ready.

277
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,140
Can't I stay here instead?

278
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,739
Sir, it'll just be a moment.

279
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,540
When I'm ready,

280
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,380
I'll call you right away.

281
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,619
There's no rush, sir.

282
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,819
Please wait a moment.

283
00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:22,300
Just be patient, sir.

284
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,260
I'll be ready soon.

285
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,739
(Isn't that Zhijian?)

286
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:43,260
(If this is Zhuang's Residence's
side courtyard,)

287
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,940
(it's easier to hide documents
of illicit dealings here.)

288
00:13:46,979 --> 00:13:48,699
(Could it be that
it's not in the warehouse?)

289
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,819
(You're unbelievable, Zhuang Wenfeng.)

290
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:31,380
(You're indeed involved
in the missing official grains.)

291
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,380
(Ledgers?)

292
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:47,293
You did come with intentions.

293
00:14:47,739 --> 00:14:49,859
I was wondering
why you were willing to come to me.

294
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,579
It turns out
you are here with a plan.

295
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,540
Get her!

296
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,579
Zhijian!

297
00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:01,540
Leave now.

298
00:15:03,979 --> 00:15:05,060
After them!

299
00:15:05,219 --> 00:15:06,499
Kill them if you can't catch them!

300
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,940
Kill them all!

301
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,859
It's Zhijian.

302
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:52,060
He's in danger.

303
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,140
Follow it.

No.

323
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,019
My Lord, why are you here?

324
00:18:26,219 --> 00:18:27,100
My Lord!

325
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:30,660
Zhuang Wenfeng,

326
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,660
you corrupted scum.

327
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,580
Do you know who she is?

328
00:18:36,219 --> 00:18:38,259
She's Mu Zhuohua, a sixth-rank official
of the Hanlin Academy

329
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,340
and a court official
appointed by His Majesty.

330
00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:47,019
You sure have a lot of nerve.

331
00:18:57,459 --> 00:18:58,499
How is His Lordship?

332
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,459
The Yuanluo Flower and Snow Dust Pill
in His Lordship's body

333
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:06,059
have been maintaining
a delicate balance.

334
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,459
He shouldn't use force recklessly.

335
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,459
He exerted his strength
with force just now.

336
00:19:09,699 --> 00:19:10,940
Not only did it damage his meridians,

337
00:19:11,699 --> 00:19:13,860
but it also caused a struggle
between these two energies.

338
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,620
Do you have any solution?

339
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,299
Go to Mu's Residence.

340
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,539
Where's Zhijian?

341
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,140
Zhijian will meet us

342
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,499
after he reports our safety
to First Prince.

343
00:19:35,121 --> 00:19:39,979
(Yongding County Yamen)

344
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:40,660
Who are you?

345
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,459
Why are you here?

346
00:19:49,459 --> 00:19:50,259
Greetings, Your Highness.

347
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:52,620
I came to Jiangnan with Lord Ding
on official duties.

348
00:19:52,979 --> 00:19:53,900
Uncle is also here?

349
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:55,499
That's perfect.

350
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,420
Follow me and rescue Mu Zhuohua.

351
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:57,979
Your Highness,

352
00:19:58,459 --> 00:19:59,340
Official Mu is safe.

353
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:01,180
She sent me to bring the news
of her safety to you.

354
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:02,886
However,

355
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,499
His Lordship
has sustained some injuries.

356
00:20:04,699 --> 00:20:05,660
Uncle is injured?

357
00:20:08,219 --> 00:20:09,539
Where is he? Take me to him now.

358
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:10,180
Your Highness,

359
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:12,739
Official Mu has taken His Lordship

360
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,100
to a relative's house for treatment.

361
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:15,259
You don't need to worry.

362
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:16,900
She also said

363
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:18,140
the current situation is unstable.

364
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:19,420
You need to stay at the county office

365
00:20:19,499 --> 00:20:20,620
to reassure the people.

366
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:25,459
I understand.

367
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,620
Take care of Uncle.

368
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,580
I'll handle the disaster relief.

369
00:20:31,087 --> 00:20:31,766
Yes, Your Highness.

370
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,539
Your Highness,

371
00:20:34,739 --> 00:20:36,340
we counted the grains in the granary

372
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,940
and found that the quantity
of relief grains doesn't match up.

373
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,059
I'm afraid

374
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:40,860
Zhuang Wenfeng has sold off most of it.

375
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,019
How much longer
can the remaining grains last?

376
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,580
If we continue making congee

377
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,059
with the same amount as before,

378
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,580
it can only last for up to seven days.

379
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,380
Transport the remaining relief grains
to the congee stall.

380
00:20:53,779 --> 00:20:55,059
I'll issue an order

381
00:20:55,499 --> 00:20:56,580
to nearby counties

382
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,499
to send a new batch of relief grains.

383
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,699
The congee portion must be the same
as the previous days.

384
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,100
We mustn't deceive the people.

385
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,059
Yes, Your Highness.

386
00:21:08,499 --> 00:21:09,660
Why are you still here?

387
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,820
Go and take care of Uncle.

388
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:12,380
Your Highness,

389
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:14,739
I haven't finished my words.

390
00:21:15,699 --> 00:21:16,539
Then go on.

391
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:21,820
Have you heard?

392
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:23,860
County Magistrate Zhuang
has been arrested

393
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,820
by First Prince,
who came from the capital.

394
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,660
It serves him right.

395
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:27,059
That Zhuang has been overbearing
for too long.

396
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:28,259
It's about time he was caught.

397
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,699
This is karma catching up to him.

398
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,620
Indeed.

399
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,459
(Zhuang Wenfeng has caused
the people to suffer.)

400
00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:39,259
(Yet, he's still safe to this day.)

401
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,340
(The situation in Jiangnan
is quite complicated.)

402
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:03,779
Now that County Magistrate Zhuang
has been arrested,

403
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,739
I wonder if all the business dealings

404
00:22:06,739 --> 00:22:07,820
we colluded in before

405
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,140
will come to light.

406
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,699
That depends

407
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,259
on the relationship

408
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,059
between you
and County Magistrate Zhuang.

409
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,739
Stop teasing me.

410
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:20,580
Master, Madam!

411
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,019
Master, Madam.

412
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,499
Miss Seventh has returned.

413
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,779
Qi?

414
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:34,499
Didn't she marry
County Magistrate Zhuang?

415
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,380
Why is that darned lass back now?

416
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:42,140
Master...

417
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:44,459
Madam,

418
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,219
wasn't it Miss Eighth

419
00:22:46,219 --> 00:22:47,499
who married County Magistrate Zhuang?

420
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,860
Don't I know that?

421
00:22:54,697 --> 00:23:02,303
(Mu's Residence)

422
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:07,019
Did you report it to First Prince?

423
00:23:07,699 --> 00:23:08,499
How's His Lordship?

424
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,860
What's going on here?

425
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:15,340
Why is this carriage in the courtyard?

426
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,180
Miss Seventh...

427
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:18,259
She has an official badge.

428
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:20,140
Official badge?

429
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:22,100
I have a belt!

430
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,900
(Administrator of the Ministry of Rites)

431
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,660
Administrator of the Ministry of Rites?

432
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,620
Official Mu.

433
00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:42,580
It's been a while.

434
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:44,539
Old Master Mu, we meet again.

435
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,979
Is First Prince in the carriage?

436
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,299
His Highness didn't come.

437
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,979
I have an urgent matter.

438
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:55,900
Hope you can lend a chamber to me.

439
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,380
Of course, it's not a problem.

440
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,459
Please come inside.

441
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,699
Qi,

442
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,380
you know the way.
Take your friend there.

443
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:05,739
If you need anything, just let me know.

444
00:24:06,459 --> 00:24:07,420
Thank you, Mother.

445
00:24:14,979 --> 00:24:15,620
My dear,

446
00:24:16,499 --> 00:24:17,340
what did you call her?

447
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,699
Qi?

448
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,259
Your daughter, Qi.

449
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:25,499
She's my daughter, Qi?

450
00:24:25,499 --> 00:24:26,340
Yes.

451
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,219
My dear,

452
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,900
is she really my daughter?

453
00:25:01,699 --> 00:25:03,459
His Lordship's pulse
has stabilized for now.

454
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,059
Stay here and take care of His Lordship.

455
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,100
I'll be back soon.

456
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:06,539
Is His Lordship...

457
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:07,299
Is His Lordship safe now?

458
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:11,459
I won't let anything happen to him.

459
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,059
(My Lord,)

460
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,979
(you must survive.)

461
00:25:17,979 --> 00:25:20,100
(You're the pillar of the Cangwu Army,)

462
00:25:20,699 --> 00:25:22,860
(the unyielding rock of Southern Chen.)

463
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,219
(As long as you're here,)

464
00:25:24,219 --> 00:25:27,820
(the spirit of the Cangwu Army
will never fade!)

465
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,779
(My Lord, you must survive.)

466
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:30,779
(Live on!)

467
00:25:38,699 --> 00:25:39,459
Mother,

468
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,380
you must watch over him.

469
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,259
Bless him so that he'll be safe.

470
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,539
Be safe and sound.

471
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:54,259
With so many courtyards
in the residence,

472
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,699
why did she pick this one?

473
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,699
Isn't this too shabby?

474
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:01,420
This won't work.

475
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,299
I must move them to a better place.

476
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:08,779
Qi,

477
00:26:09,459 --> 00:26:10,580
I was looking for you.

478
00:26:11,979 --> 00:26:12,699
Listen, I...

479
00:26:12,699 --> 00:26:14,140
I was looking for you, too.

480
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,979
What is it? You can tell me.

481
00:26:17,219 --> 00:26:19,459
I want that Qinghe sprig
from the dispensary.

482
00:26:19,699 --> 00:26:20,580
What did you say?

483
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,860
You little rascal. You...

484
00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:28,380
Well, Qi.

485
00:26:28,699 --> 00:26:29,580
You have to know

486
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,499
that Qinghe sprig is very valuable.

487
00:26:31,499 --> 00:26:32,580
It's a life-saving medicinal herb.

488
00:26:33,219 --> 00:26:34,380
Choose something else.

489
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,539
I'll surely satisfy your request.

490
00:26:35,539 --> 00:26:36,699
I only want the Qinghe sprig.

491
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:37,699
I need it urgently.

492
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,739
I can't...

493
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:46,580
I know what you're worried about.

494
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,660
Don't worry.

495
00:26:49,299 --> 00:26:50,059
With me around,

496
00:26:50,499 --> 00:26:52,820
what Zhuang Wenfeng has done
won't implicate you.

497
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,539
Can you

498
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,100
really handle it?

499
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,140
Of course.

500
00:26:59,979 --> 00:27:01,779
I may be merely a sixth-rank official.

501
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:02,900
But currently,

502
00:27:03,019 --> 00:27:05,299
I'm working for First Prince.

503
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,979
The successful relief efforts
in Jiangnan

504
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,940
are thanks to First Prince.

505
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:13,019
After we return,
we will definitely be generously...

506
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,019
You're right.

507
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:18,699
Qinghe sprig is now yours.

508
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,580
Did you manage
to get the medicinal herb?

509
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,580
It's being decocted.

510
00:27:51,699 --> 00:27:52,380
Is he all right now?

511
00:27:54,459 --> 00:27:55,539
He's safe for now.

512
00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:01,299
I wonder
how First Prince's interrogation

513
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,739
of Zhuang Wenfeng is going.

514
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:05,699
By the way,

515
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,380
there are some ledgers
in the hidden compartment

516
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,259
of Zhuang Wenfeng's side courtyard.

517
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,820
You must find them.

518
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,140
All right. You can leave it to me.

519
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,140
What's the matter?

520
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,820
You seem different now.

521
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,019
Why are you so nagging?

522
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:27,219
Do you want me to go or not?

523
00:28:28,219 --> 00:28:30,100
Of course. Only you can handle it,

524
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,259
Hero Zhijian.

525
00:28:31,499 --> 00:28:32,219
Off you go now.

526
00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:35,059
Who's there?

527
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,340
(Who are you?)

528
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,539
What's the matter?

529
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:44,580
Qi. Qi.

530
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,380
What's wrong with this person?

531
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,660
He appeared out of nowhere

532
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,539
and gave me a fright.

533
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:49,900
I didn't lay a finger on him.

534
00:28:50,699 --> 00:28:51,699
I know.

535
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,019
What were you doing hiding outside?

536
00:28:55,219 --> 00:28:57,699
I... I wasn't doing anything.

537
00:28:58,499 --> 00:28:59,739
He was eavesdropping.

538
00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:01,019
Eavesdropping?

539
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:01,860
Oh, no, no, no.

540
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,219
How could I be eavesdropping?

541
00:29:05,259 --> 00:29:06,739
I only wanted

542
00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:08,140
to give you some advice.

543
00:29:08,699 --> 00:29:09,940
Advice for what?

544
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,059
Qi, you may not admit it.

545
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:14,660
But I understand.

546
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,580
Isn't it about choosing a man?

547
00:29:16,699 --> 00:29:17,979
It's no big deal.

548
00:29:18,499 --> 00:29:19,580
But let me tell you.

549
00:29:19,739 --> 00:29:21,059
You have a bright future ahead.

550
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,580
So you must choose the people

551
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,100
around you carefully.

552
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,340
Look at that lad behind you.

553
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,019
You can never choose him.

554
00:29:28,219 --> 00:29:28,860
I beg your pardon.

555
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:30,100
Listen.

556
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,620
- He has a bad temper.
- Ignore him.

557
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:35,059
Don't take it to heart.

558
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:36,100
He's talking nonsense.

559
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,699
Qi, listen to me.

560
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,539
I'm not done talking, Qi.

561
00:29:48,459 --> 00:29:50,779
Qi, I'm experienced.

562
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,019
A person's character is crucial.

563
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:54,940
And...

564
00:29:58,779 --> 00:29:59,699
Also,

565
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,259
you must make the decision
in the household.

566
00:30:02,699 --> 00:30:04,180
Rules must not be disregarded.

567
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,620
So,

568
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,459
tell me.

569
00:30:06,739 --> 00:30:07,979
Which one

570
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:10,539
did you choose?

571
00:30:10,539 --> 00:30:12,420
(Yongding County Yamen)

572
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,979
Your Highness, I'm innocent.

573
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:16,459
I wouldn't dare

574
00:30:16,739 --> 00:30:18,940
to switch the grains
distributed by the court.

575
00:30:19,459 --> 00:30:20,420
Someone must have framed me.

576
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:22,660
Please make a fair judgment for me.

577
00:30:27,219 --> 00:30:28,140
Butler Zhou.

578
00:30:28,979 --> 00:30:30,580
He must have done it behind my back.

579
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,100
Butler Zhou is a mere servant.

580
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,620
Without your permission,

581
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,580
how would he dare

582
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,660
to switch disaster relief grains?

583
00:30:38,219 --> 00:30:39,059
Besides,

584
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,900
this is only a portion
of the official grains.

585
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,340
Where is the rest?

586
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,940
Fess up now.

587
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,299
Your Highness,

588
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,340
I'm telling the truth.

589
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:52,860
You...

590
00:30:53,739 --> 00:30:55,299
You may be a high-ranking noble.

591
00:30:56,219 --> 00:30:58,180
But I am an appointed official
of the court.

592
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:02,340
You surely can't force a confession
from me.

593
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:03,820
Outrageous!

594
00:31:09,979 --> 00:31:10,699
(By the way,)

595
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,219
Official Mu wants me
to remind Your Highness one thing.

596
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:15,620
Zhuang Wenfeng may have no guts.

597
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,900
But he's cunning.

598
00:31:17,499 --> 00:31:18,779
She hopes that you won't act impulsively

599
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:20,380
to avoid falling for his tricks.

600
00:31:23,499 --> 00:31:24,259
Fine.

601
00:31:25,979 --> 00:31:27,940
Since you said you were framed,

602
00:31:29,459 --> 00:31:31,299
follow me back to the capital

603
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,299
so that the law
can seek justice for you.

604
00:31:37,219 --> 00:31:37,900
Your Highness.

605
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:39,380
Your Highness! Your Highness!

606
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:41,739
Your Highness!
I'm innocent, Your Highness!

607
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,219
Your Highness, please!
Let me explain, Your Highness!

608
00:31:43,219 --> 00:31:44,860
I'm innocent, Your Highness!

609
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,620
(These may be old injuries.)

610
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:49,739
(But you still need to be careful.)

611
00:31:56,979 --> 00:31:57,699
Thank you.

612
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:00,860
Don't mention it.

613
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,100
You've been nice to Juli, after all.

614
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:09,900
Juli

615
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,580
always talks about food.

616
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,140
Other than that,
you're the one she talks about the most.

617
00:32:18,459 --> 00:32:20,140
You must not mistreat Juli.

618
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:21,380
Do you hear me?

619
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:22,900
I won't.

620
00:32:23,979 --> 00:32:24,739
I'm glad to hear that.

621
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,940
Is this where you two lived?

622
00:32:33,979 --> 00:32:34,620
Yes.

623
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,539
My father

624
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,580
has many concubines.

625
00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:42,699
We're lucky

626
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,459
to have a place to stay

627
00:32:45,219 --> 00:32:46,340
and enough to eat and wear.

628
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:51,180
Juli used to be picked on
in other places.

629
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:54,380
She doesn't eat a lot
because she's greedy.

630
00:32:54,699 --> 00:32:56,180
But if she doesn't eat,

631
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,900
there won't be anything for her.

632
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:07,660
Are you hungry?

633
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,443
(Young Guo Juli)

634
00:33:16,499 --> 00:33:17,580
I'm going out for a while.

635
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,940
Can you keep a lookout for me?

636
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,779
Thank you, Juli.

637
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:52,059
Did you finish your mantou?

638
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,219
I'll get you more next time.

639
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,739
I'll get going first.

640
00:34:02,219 --> 00:34:03,660
The older maid found out

641
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:05,100
about Juli keeping a lookout for me.

642
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,660
She'd rather get punished
than reveal my secret.

643
00:34:08,459 --> 00:34:09,260
What happened after that?

644
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,940
Later, I begged my mother

645
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:13,979
to talk to First Madam

646
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:15,139
to let Juli come to us.

647
00:34:17,539 --> 00:34:19,900
That's how Juli

648
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,659
became the closest person to me

649
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:23,260
besides my mother.

650
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,780
At that time,

651
00:34:28,579 --> 00:34:30,179
my mother forced me to take lessons

652
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,900
with Tutor Shang every day.

653
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,300
At first, I thought First Madam
was indifferent to us

654
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:36,900
because she thought

655
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,659
nothing useful

656
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,220
would come out of this shabby courtyard.

657
00:34:40,979 --> 00:34:42,340
But when I think about it,

658
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,220
she even agreed to assign Juli
to our courtyard.

659
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,940
It shows how smart and capable she is.

660
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,059
Anything happening in this family

661
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,260
cannot be hidden from her.

662
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,780
First Madam's situation
was similar to my mother's at first.

663
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,740
She thought she found a good husband.

664
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,700
So she brought a huge dowry

665
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:05,059
and married my father.

666
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,459
It gave my father the capital
to start his business.

667
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:15,380
But who could have thought

668
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,220
that this man

669
00:35:18,979 --> 00:35:20,860
would fancy other women?

670
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,940
He married them one by one

671
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,220
and brought them home.

672
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,179
Once they're here,

673
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,940
he would neglect them.

674
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,900
Yet, how many women

675
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,700
can be like First Madam,

676
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,579
who can make their own decisions?

677
00:35:44,179 --> 00:35:45,260
But my mother

678
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,820
had it better than Miss Song
and the others.

679
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,860
Look at that portrait.

680
00:35:57,659 --> 00:35:58,860
That's my mother.

681
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,260
Doesn't she look beautiful

682
00:36:03,139 --> 00:36:04,340
when she smiles?

683
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,979
Everyone says,

684
00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:11,459
"A single glance and smile

685
00:36:11,979 --> 00:36:13,420
can captivate the entire city."

686
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,459
That's how her name came about.

687
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,499
My Lord?

688
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:28,700
My Lord, you're awake.

689
00:36:30,139 --> 00:36:31,700
My Lord, you're finally awake.

690
00:36:32,459 --> 00:36:33,420
How do you feel?

691
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,220
I just

692
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,860
dreamed of you.

693
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:45,979
What did you dream of me?

694
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,300
I saw you

695
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:52,420
saving my life.

696
00:36:54,499 --> 00:36:56,019
You were the one who saved my life.

697
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,139
Let me check your pulse.

698
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,900
Qinghe sprig is working.

699
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,260
The energy of the two medicines
within His Lordship's body

700
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,139
has stabilized.

701
00:37:16,243 --> 00:37:18,828
(Lanxiu Pavilion)

702
00:37:19,499 --> 00:37:20,340
How is His Lordship?

703
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,499
He's awake.

704
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,820
Why are you stopping me?

705
00:37:24,979 --> 00:37:26,220
His Lordship is talking to Mu.

706
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:26,900
You

707
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:28,459
will be a spoiler.

708
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:30,900
I really

709
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,019
have to thank you for this.

710
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,300
My Lord, no need to thank me.

711
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,579
By the way,

712
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:44,740
the jade pendant you gave me
was shattered.

713
00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:47,700
It took a blow for me.

714
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,979
Let it be, then.

715
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,780
I gave you

716
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,099
the jade pendant
as a protective charm.

717
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:57,659
Now that it has protected you once,

718
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,740
you could say it has served its purpose.

719
00:38:01,059 --> 00:38:01,979
Thank you, My Lord.

720
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:03,900
You're such a kind person.

721
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,300
Back then...

722
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:09,979
Back then,

723
00:38:10,979 --> 00:38:12,659
it was my mother who protected me.

724
00:38:24,979 --> 00:38:25,900
Your mother's original name

725
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,059
was Fu Yin.

726
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:35,659
Fu Yin?

727
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:40,260
My Lord,

728
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:43,979
didn't you forbid me
from investigating further?

729
00:38:46,179 --> 00:38:47,019
It was because

730
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,420
the more you knew back then,
the more dangerous it would become.

731
00:38:52,019 --> 00:38:53,019
Now, I feel

732
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,420
you have the right to know these things.

733
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,059
Is the small residence
with the medicinal pool

734
00:39:03,459 --> 00:39:06,459
you're staying in now
my mother's former home?

735
00:39:11,179 --> 00:39:12,220
Your mother

736
00:39:14,139 --> 00:39:15,943
was Fu Shengru's only daughter,

737
00:39:15,944 --> 00:39:17,179
the Imperial Academy of Medicine's
former head.

738
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:21,260
Your maternal grandfather, Fu Shengru,

739
00:39:22,459 --> 00:39:24,420
once expended a large amount
of Immortal Fruits

740
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,659
to research a new medicine.

741
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:30,740
Thirty years ago,

742
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,820
my mother died in childbirth.

743
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:37,220
Physicians involved in her treatment
were held accountable.

744
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,539
It shouldn't have implicated
their family.

745
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,740
But even after your grandfather
took his life,

746
00:39:45,659 --> 00:39:47,499
his entire family couldn't be saved.

747
00:39:49,499 --> 00:39:50,499
Are you saying

748
00:39:51,499 --> 00:39:53,619
someone wanted
to use your mother's death

749
00:39:54,979 --> 00:39:56,099
to wipe them out?

750
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,619
Yes.

751
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:07,539
Could this person

752
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,179
be the true culprit behind the incident
five years ago?

753
00:40:14,019 --> 00:40:14,900
Yes.

754
00:40:40,459 --> 00:40:41,099
My Lord,

755
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,420
you may have had some recovery,
but you're still weak.

756
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,900
You should get some rest.

757
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,179
Wait.

758
00:40:51,979 --> 00:40:53,380
Are you still not willing to tell me?

759
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,940
Why did you approach
other high-ranking individuals?

760
00:41:01,179 --> 00:41:02,260
Were you upset

761
00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:04,820
because you thought I curry favor
with other people?

762
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,139
So, is that the case?

763
00:41:17,301 --> 00:41:18,459
Why would I do that?

764
00:41:18,979 --> 00:41:20,139
From the get-go,

765
00:41:20,139 --> 00:41:22,380
you're the only
and biggest support I have.

766
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:23,979
That's what I call unwavering loyalty.

767
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:33,940
Then why did you distance yourself
from me?

768
00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:39,820
Did you hear

769
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,019
what I said about my family just now?

770
00:41:44,019 --> 00:41:44,820
Yes.

771
00:41:47,059 --> 00:41:48,220
My father is a promiscuous man.

772
00:41:48,979 --> 00:41:50,220
He married many women,

773
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:51,940
and he has seven sons
and eight daughters.

774
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,380
Since young,

775
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,179
I hardly saw him.

776
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,220
So he couldn't even recognize me
when he saw me.

777
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:00,900
That's why

778
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,499
I've known from a young age

779
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:06,380
that women shouldn't rely solely on men.

780
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,260
They should strive for self-improvement.
