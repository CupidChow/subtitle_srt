=The Legend of Zhuohua=

17
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,860
(Adapted from "She Was Once
a Playful Soul" by Sui Yu Er An)

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,940
=Episode 12=

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
(This is a work of fiction.)

20
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:49,670
My Lord,

21
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,750
the First Prince and the Third Prince

22
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,910
are fighting at Zhixing College.

23
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:53,871
Please go and mediate.

24
00:01:56,231 --> 00:01:57,390
How long has this been going on?

25
00:01:57,991 --> 00:01:59,071
About twenty minutes.

26
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:01,670
Zhixing College is probably going
to be torn apart by these two princes.

27
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,871
Who is giving the lecture
to the princes today?

28
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,190
It's Mu Zhuohua.

29
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:10,390
Grandmother,

30
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,990
(Zhixing College)
she has nothing to do with this.

31
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:13,270
As a civil official,

32
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:14,911
how could she stop us
if we wanted to fight?

33
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,311
Chen.

34
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,390
Please calm down, Grandmother.

35
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,631
We have to thank Ms. Mu for today.

36
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,270
She may not be a physician.

37
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:30,670
But her heart is full of compassion
for the world.

38
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,351
If it weren't
for her unconventional methods

39
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:34,511
in helping the First Prince
stop the bleeding,

40
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,511
the consequences
would have been direr.

41
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,110
He's right, Grandmother.

42
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,390
At that time,
the First Prince was bleeding profusely.

43
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,951
Not at all.

44
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,471
Grandmother,

45
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,471
my injuries may appear grim.

46
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,150
But it is not that serious.

47
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,911
Using unconventional methods

48
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:56,550
to stop the First Prince's bleeding?

49
00:02:57,311 --> 00:03:00,390
The entire court knows
of her romantic affairs.

50
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,830
She has such improper behaviors.

51
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:06,911
You shouldn't
let her sweet words deceive you.

52
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,550
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
I was incompetent

53
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,471
to stop the princes in time.

54
00:03:13,071 --> 00:03:14,430
I'm willing to accept any punishment.

55
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:16,590
It's just that those rumors
about my romantic affairs

56
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,231
are completely fabricated.

57
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,430
I would never dare
to deceive the two princes.

58
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:23,351
Your Majesty, please judge this fairly.

59
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,990
Chen and Jin may have disagreements.

60
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,511
But they had never resorted to violence.

61
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,590
Yet, they got into a real fight
because of jealousy

62
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,791
in your lecture!

63
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,351
As a woman,

64
00:03:40,351 --> 00:03:42,110
you frequently visit the brothel.

65
00:03:43,191 --> 00:03:44,631
It's already lacking in virtue.

66
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:46,951
How dare you claim innocence!

67
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:48,951
Your Majesty,

68
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,550
people generally consider brothels
as disreputable.

69
00:03:55,471 --> 00:03:56,231
But in reality,

70
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:57,830
those places

71
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,990
are temporary stops for helpless women.

72
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,270
How can we judge them so biased?

73
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,311
I

74
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,270
sympathize with
what they've gone through

75
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,471
and they also treat me sincerely.

76
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:12,471
How's that lacking in virtue?

77
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:16,951
Sincerity, indeed.

78
00:04:18,511 --> 00:04:22,030
But in places of indulgence,
how can it be sincere?

79
00:04:23,991 --> 00:04:26,991
Your association with people
of questionable morals

80
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,030
shows a lack of proper manners.

81
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,910
Though I dare not call myself virtuous,

82
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:35,270
I've been taught by wise teachings
since childhood.

83
00:04:35,991 --> 00:04:37,311
So I have a clear conscience.

84
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,991
Stop trying to argue.

85
00:04:40,511 --> 00:04:43,710
It's enough that you butter
your bread on both sides.

86
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,431
You dare to entertain

87
00:04:46,431 --> 00:04:48,551
such wicked thoughts about my grandsons.

88
00:04:51,511 --> 00:04:52,350
Someone!

89
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:56,230
Ms. Mu Zhuohua of Hanlin Academy

90
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,631
lacks in conduct
and seduced the princes.

91
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:02,191
She shall be dismissed
from her teaching position

92
00:05:02,871 --> 00:05:04,350
and punished with twenty floggings

93
00:05:04,551 --> 00:05:05,710
as a warning to others!

94
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,951
Your Majesty, I...

95
00:05:07,951 --> 00:05:08,710
Do it now!

96
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,311
Your Majesty!

97
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:09,991
Grandmother!

98
00:05:09,991 --> 00:05:11,311
Your Majesty, I accept the punishment.

99
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,590
But the crime is my inability to stop
the princes' actions in time,

100
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,470
not a lack of moral character!

101
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:51,671
Stop right there!

102
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:55,671
Grandmother, she truly
has nothing to do with this.

103
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,311
You must not falsely accuse her.

104
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,431
Grandmother, please calm down.

105
00:06:09,191 --> 00:06:11,871
Mr. Shen and Ms. Mu
are fellow colleagues.

106
00:06:12,751 --> 00:06:15,551
Their close interactions
are understandable.

107
00:06:15,991 --> 00:06:16,751
About today's incident,

108
00:06:16,991 --> 00:06:18,910
Ms. Mu has merit without fault.

109
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:23,671
Grandmother,

110
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,270
my elder brother and I
were only slightly injured

111
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,150
and it's not life-threatening.

112
00:06:27,431 --> 00:06:28,350
Please spare her.

113
00:06:31,751 --> 00:06:32,710
Mu Zhuohua,

114
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,671
do you know what you've done wrong?

115
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,071
I...

116
00:06:40,951 --> 00:06:42,111
I admit my fault.

117
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:43,710
It was my fault

118
00:06:44,631 --> 00:06:46,230
for not stopping

119
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,350
both princes' actions

120
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,710
in time.

121
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,270
Besides that, I have a clear conscience.

122
00:06:54,871 --> 00:06:56,030
A clear conscience.

123
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,951
Give her a good beating!

124
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,431
Grandmother!

125
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:17,671
Lord Ding has arrived!

126
00:07:31,511 --> 00:07:32,910
Uncle, you're finally here.

127
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,270
Please plead with Grandmother

128
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:35,350
to let Mu Zhuohua go.

129
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,111
Greetings, Your Majesty.

130
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,230
Yan, you're here.

131
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,551
What crime did Ms. Mu commit

132
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,551
to have angered you so much?

133
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,111
Mu Zhuohua is supposed
to be an exemplary teacher.

134
00:08:01,431 --> 00:08:03,071
Yet, she neglected her moral conduct

135
00:08:03,311 --> 00:08:05,951
and incited the princes into fighting.

136
00:08:06,671 --> 00:08:08,150
Her despicable actions
are truly detestable.

137
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,470
After hearing what you said,

138
00:08:11,071 --> 00:08:13,551
Mu Zhuohua is indeed wicked.

139
00:08:14,511 --> 00:08:16,710
A few floggings would be too lenient.

140
00:08:19,991 --> 00:08:21,191
In my opinion,

141
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,311
she should be imprisoned

142
00:08:23,631 --> 00:08:24,790
and trialed
by the Three Judicial Agencies.

143
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,710
Then her crimes should be made known
by everyone.

144
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,951
Uncle, we cannot do that.

145
00:08:35,311 --> 00:08:37,551
If this gets out,

146
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,911
it would tarnish
the royal family's reputation.

147
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:43,510
Mu Zhuohua is a student of the Emperor

148
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,110
and a teacher of the princes,

149
00:08:45,671 --> 00:08:47,071
as well as a court-appointed official.

150
00:08:47,951 --> 00:08:49,911
She has committed such a grave offense.

151
00:08:50,151 --> 00:08:51,630
It is truly unforgivable.

152
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:54,990
She deserves severe punishment
to appease the anger of the people.

153
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,671
Uncle, must you do this?

154
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,630
For just a person like Mu Zhuohua,

155
00:09:02,311 --> 00:09:04,350
there's no need to make such a fuss.

156
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,590
Since you say so,

157
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:12,391
with a benevolent heart like yours,

158
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,951
why bother with her?

159
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,951
This is a strategic retreat,

160
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,791
pleading for her.

161
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,071
Princess Roujia has arrived!

162
00:09:38,671 --> 00:09:41,791
Today's incident sure is dramatic.

163
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,791
Greetings, Grandmother.

164
00:09:46,311 --> 00:09:47,230
Greetings, Uncle.

165
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,230
Are you also here to plead
for Mu Zhuohua?

166
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,391
Grandmother, I'm here to visit you.

167
00:10:00,191 --> 00:10:01,191
Grandmother,

168
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,350
you know

169
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,750
what my younger brothers are like.

170
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,630
When they started fighting,

171
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:08,391
even I, as their older sister,
can't stop them.

172
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,510
Let alone Ms. Mu.

173
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,151
So calm down.

174
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,630
If you get sick from anger,

175
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,071
the younger generations

176
00:10:17,151 --> 00:10:18,510
would feel very distressed.

177
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,911
Your Majesty,
please prioritize your health.

178
00:10:23,031 --> 00:10:24,791
Don't let this affect your health.

179
00:10:24,911 --> 00:10:25,911
That's right, Grandmother.

180
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,830
Please calm down.

181
00:10:29,951 --> 00:10:30,990
That's right, Grandmother.

182
00:10:31,911 --> 00:10:33,110
You have the most benevolent heart.

183
00:10:33,431 --> 00:10:34,791
If she bleeds from the flogging,

184
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:36,151
with a kind heart like yours,

185
00:10:36,431 --> 00:10:38,510
you'll end up
visiting Bodhisattva for days.

186
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,470
Now that my brothers are fine,

187
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,191
please show some leniency

188
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,710
and spare Ms. Mu.

189
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,750
Inform Imperial Physician Zhao to go
to Mu's Residence on Zhuque Street.

190
00:10:57,191 --> 00:10:57,791
Yes.

191
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,191
My Lord,

192
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:02,311
these floggings hurt
more than I had expected.

193
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,791
(It looks like)

194
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,671
(you can't escape
from this complicated situation.)

195
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:07,750
Return to the residence.

196
00:11:17,391 --> 00:11:19,830
Your Majesty, she was taken
to Lord Ding's Residence.

197
00:11:20,271 --> 00:11:21,590
Imperial Physician Zhao
has gone there too.

198
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:23,951
Lord Ding's Residence?

199
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,431
Grandmother, Uncle probably

200
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:32,031
wants Ms. Mu to receive treatment
as soon as possible.

201
00:11:32,151 --> 00:11:33,911
That's why he took her to his residence,

202
00:11:33,911 --> 00:11:35,951
which is nearer to the palace.

203
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:39,870
It seems our ambitious Lord Ding

204
00:11:40,071 --> 00:11:42,431
has truly revealed
his human side this time.

205
00:11:44,431 --> 00:11:45,510
Grandmother,

206
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,431
how is this revealing his human side?

207
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,391
Allowing women
to attend the imperial exam

208
00:11:50,671 --> 00:11:52,191
was Uncle's idea, to begin with.

209
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,551
She also ranked third
and became a Tanhua.

210
00:11:55,911 --> 00:11:57,911
It's hard for him to ignore her.

211
00:11:59,071 --> 00:12:00,951
You have a point.

212
00:12:02,191 --> 00:12:06,510
I see her as a woman

213
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:08,230
before she's an official.

214
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:10,391
It's been many years

215
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,911
since Southern Chen
had appointed female officials.

216
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:19,260
(Lord Ding's Residence)

217
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,311
Go and tidy up the courtyard.

218
00:12:21,311 --> 00:12:21,870
Yes, sir.

219
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,350
In Lord Ding's Residence,

220
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,791
even the fish is male.

221
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,510
It truly lacks vitality.

222
00:12:34,951 --> 00:12:36,791
What happened to this young lady?
How did she get so severely injured?

223
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,191
Prepare hot water, towels, and gauze.

224
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:40,271
Should we get Madam Li from the kitchen

225
00:12:40,271 --> 00:12:41,110
to come over?

226
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,750
Yes.

227
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:51,151
My Lord,

228
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,470
how could you carry a young lady

229
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,151
to the front courtyard
of your residence?

230
00:12:56,671 --> 00:12:59,350
I should get things prepared
for that matter.

231
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:06,870
My Lord.

232
00:13:09,191 --> 00:13:10,110
How is she?

233
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,870
My Lord, Official Mu has a fit body.

234
00:13:13,071 --> 00:13:14,710
She may have a fever.
But it's nothing serious.

235
00:13:15,071 --> 00:13:17,431
She only needs cold compresses

236
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,870
to reduce her temperature.

237
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:21,830
Thank you, Imperial Physician Zhao.

238
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:23,191
You're welcome.

239
00:13:23,311 --> 00:13:24,830
I shall take my leave now.

240
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,710
Zhimo, walk him to the door.

241
00:13:30,951 --> 00:13:33,230
My Lord, I did no wrong.

242
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:35,470
I won't admit it.

243
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:37,911
My Lord,

244
00:13:39,071 --> 00:13:40,791
it really hurts.

245
00:13:47,031 --> 00:13:47,911
Get some proper rest.

246
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:51,630
You won't be punished like this again.

247
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,830
May the various deities bless us.

248
00:13:57,311 --> 00:13:58,350
Bless His Lordship

249
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,671
to have two children in three years

250
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,791
and three children in five years.

251
00:14:01,151 --> 00:14:03,750
Regardless of gender,
the more, the better.

252
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,071
Please bless His Lordship.

253
00:14:07,391 --> 00:14:08,830
Please bless His Lordship.

254
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,110
Please bless him.

255
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,990
I ask for a blessing.

256
00:14:19,271 --> 00:14:20,071
My Lord.

257
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,431
My Lord,

258
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,470
is that young lady awake?

259
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,110
Not yet.

260
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,990
She's such a decent young lady.

261
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:31,830
So beautiful, like a flower.

262
00:14:33,951 --> 00:14:34,951
Like a flower?

263
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,470
Her?

264
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:39,870
How much suffering
she must have endured.

265
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,710
Without someone caring for her,

266
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,271
how lonely she is.

267
00:14:44,031 --> 00:14:45,031
She has a maidservant.

268
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,551
You're always around, huh?

269
00:14:49,031 --> 00:14:52,350
My Lord, she has suffered
such serious injuries.

270
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,710
She really needs proper care.

271
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,311
There's a lack of physicians
and medicine outside.

272
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,031
What if

273
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:00,470
something bad happens?

274
00:15:01,071 --> 00:15:01,671
You see,

275
00:15:02,071 --> 00:15:03,710
you already brought her back.

276
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,191
If you send her away again,

277
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,911
won't that be too heartless?

278
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:11,110
Then she may stay.

279
00:15:11,391 --> 00:15:12,151
All right.

280
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,951
Then I'll ask the servants

281
00:15:14,191 --> 00:15:15,911
to clean the back courtyard

282
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:17,230
so you can stay in comfort.

283
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:19,791
Back courtyard?

284
00:15:21,271 --> 00:15:24,031
Imperial Physician Zhao told me

285
00:15:24,031 --> 00:15:24,870
that she must not be moved.

286
00:15:25,031 --> 00:15:25,750
Didn't you

287
00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:28,710
carry her into your room?

288
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:29,671
Why don't you...

289
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,311
Just clean the place.

290
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,031
All right.

291
00:15:39,391 --> 00:15:40,311
Is there anything else?

292
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:42,551
My Lord.

293
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:46,671
Seeing how badly injured this girl is

294
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,151
and that she's in an unfamiliar place,

295
00:15:48,551 --> 00:15:52,470
maybe we should send something
to make her feel better.

296
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:56,791
When she wakes up,

297
00:15:57,191 --> 00:15:58,350
I'll personally go visit her.

298
00:16:06,431 --> 00:16:08,830
(His Lordship has finally come
to his senses.)

299
00:16:10,031 --> 00:16:11,710
My Lord, our secret agent has reported

300
00:16:12,191 --> 00:16:14,391
that Northern Liang is sending an envoy
to Southern Chen.

301
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,311
It seems your plan
of luring the enemy out

302
00:16:16,391 --> 00:16:17,350
is working effectively.

303
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,870
Since that's the case,

304
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,470
we should prepare in advance

305
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,951
to welcome
the Northern Liang delegation.

306
00:16:25,271 --> 00:16:26,710
Why should we welcome
the Northern Liang people?

307
00:16:28,951 --> 00:16:30,391
We must treat them with respect

308
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,151
but also be cautious.

309
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,151
I understand.

310
00:16:34,951 --> 00:16:36,951
I'll make preparations both inside
and outside in advance

311
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,870
to ensure a proper welcome
for Northern Liang's delegates.

312
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,791
My Lord...

313
00:16:43,311 --> 00:16:44,350
Is there anything you'd like to say?

314
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,271
What do you think

315
00:16:47,271 --> 00:16:48,551
Butler Zhang is up to?

316
00:16:49,071 --> 00:16:50,551
First, he made you stay in the backyard.

317
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,271
Then he made you send things to Miss Mu.

318
00:16:52,671 --> 00:16:54,151
Now there's a big feast set up there.

319
00:16:54,391 --> 00:16:55,470
Is he trying to...

320
00:17:02,391 --> 00:17:04,351
How much suffering
she must have endured.

321
00:17:04,831 --> 00:17:06,151
Without someone caring for her,

322
00:17:06,631 --> 00:17:07,750
how lonely she is.

323
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,710
Since you can't keep quiet,

324
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,831
how about you run some errands for me?

325
00:17:14,111 --> 00:17:15,270
Go to Zhuque Street

326
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,470
and bring her maidservant here.

327
00:17:17,111 --> 00:17:17,911
My Lord,

328
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,030
why not let Zhimo go instead?

329
00:17:20,351 --> 00:17:21,550
Whenever she sees me,

330
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,270
it's like a rat running into a cat.

331
00:17:43,911 --> 00:17:44,671
Hello, Zhimo.

332
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,351
Oh,

333
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:47,591
this is for you.

334
00:17:47,871 --> 00:17:49,391
Miss Mu is injured.

335
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:55,310
Young Lady, are you all right?

336
00:17:56,831 --> 00:17:57,911
Don't worry.

337
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,310
I'll be fine after some recuperating.

338
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:01,710
I really thought
something really bad had happened.

339
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:04,351
Does it hurt, Young Lady?

340
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:05,990
My Lord...

341
00:18:06,111 --> 00:18:07,270
Young Lady. Young Lady, don't move.

342
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:09,351
Stay still.

343
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,790
Thank you for saving my life, My Lord.

344
00:18:23,351 --> 00:18:24,270
What's this?

345
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:26,911
A gift from the palace.

346
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,111
Don't finish it too quickly.

347
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,070
Thank you.

348
00:18:36,391 --> 00:18:37,510
Leave us.

349
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,591
Go.

350
00:18:52,111 --> 00:18:52,871
My Lord.

351
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,431
So,

352
00:18:59,391 --> 00:19:02,230
did today's flogging seem unfair?

353
00:19:07,911 --> 00:19:08,631
Yes.

354
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,990
But it's not at the same time.

355
00:19:13,831 --> 00:19:15,270
The matter may happen suddenly.

356
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,351
But after giving it careful thought,

357
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:21,310
there were signs
before the incident happened.

358
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:23,790
The Third Prince

359
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,710
didn't seem like a studious person,

360
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,591
yet, he actively asked me
about Northern Liang.

361
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,470
His intention

362
00:19:30,591 --> 00:19:32,911
was to bring up
the war at Juma River.

363
00:19:33,911 --> 00:19:36,911
It's a thorn in the First Prince's flesh.

364
00:19:37,591 --> 00:19:39,990
Then he and the Second Prince

365
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,951
started playing the good
and the bad person.

366
00:19:43,591 --> 00:19:45,631
All just to provoke the First Prince.

367
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,831
With the First Prince's impulsiveness,

368
00:19:50,391 --> 00:19:51,470
he'll definitely fall for it

369
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,790
when that happens.

370
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:59,030
Then he'll be labeled as aggressive
and hot-tempered,

371
00:19:59,591 --> 00:20:01,230
which damages his image
as a future emperor.

372
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,070
So,

373
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,951
this is actually

374
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,230
a premeditated power struggle.

375
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,871
But

376
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,911
you seem to have
a deep understanding of Chen.

377
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:25,270
I think the First Prince

378
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,391
has a rare innocent heart.

379
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,510
His emotions are written
all over his face.

380
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,351
It's not hard to know.

381
00:20:35,351 --> 00:20:38,831
Sun Yunqian is Yu and Jin's cousin,

382
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:45,550
and Shen Jinghong has the ability
to keep Chen in check.

383
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,671
So,

384
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,550
a seemingly useless pawn like me

385
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,111
is like a pillow offered to them

386
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,191
when they're napping.

387
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,750
This fight

388
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,270
was truly an unwarranted calamity.

389
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:04,871
Truly unfair.

390
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:07,951
It hurts so bad.

391
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,510
Then why do you also think

392
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,911
that it's fair?

393
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,391
It's my carelessness

394
00:21:18,631 --> 00:21:19,990
that gave them the opportunity.

395
00:21:21,191 --> 00:21:22,710
Be more cautious next time.

396
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,535
(Jishan Hall)

397
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,191
Greetings, Your Highness.

398
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,510
Looking at your apparel,

399
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,591
you didn't have the time
to return to your residence

400
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:11,191
after finished teaching
the princes, right?

401
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,270
I dare not delay when you summoned me.

402
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,871
I have a favor to ask of you.

403
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,990
What do you think about this pearl?

404
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:27,151
Elegant and luxurious.

405
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:29,391
Comparable to your noble status.

406
00:22:32,591 --> 00:22:33,831
What nobility do I have?

407
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,510
It's merely due to my fortunate birth.

408
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,951
The quality of this pearl is good.

409
00:22:39,951 --> 00:22:40,871
But it is prone to turn yellow

410
00:22:42,431 --> 00:22:43,230
and not suitable for frequent wearing.

411
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,990
The jade bangle is flawless,

412
00:22:51,431 --> 00:22:52,310
crystal clear, and pure.

413
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,591
Though flawless,

414
00:22:57,911 --> 00:22:58,750
it's fragile.

415
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,030
That's how it is

416
00:23:08,831 --> 00:23:09,911
with precious materials like these.

417
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,111
Let's pick this one.

418
00:23:15,191 --> 00:23:17,710
I also find these apricot blossoms
quite unique.

419
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,270
If they're worn

420
00:23:20,351 --> 00:23:21,591
in your hair,

421
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:22,871
they'll surely...

422
00:23:22,871 --> 00:23:23,831
You're wrong.

423
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,831
I intend to give it as a gift.

424
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:26,911
A gift?

425
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,151
What does it have to do with me?

426
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,111
Naturally, it concerns you.

427
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:37,310
I need to trouble you
to visit Lord Ding's Residence

428
00:23:38,111 --> 00:23:39,510
and deliver it to Zhuohua.

429
00:23:40,831 --> 00:23:42,631
I've already made Her Majesty upset

430
00:23:42,911 --> 00:23:44,750
by going to Zhixing College.

431
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:48,951
I dare not go to Lord Ding's Residence
and visit her now.

432
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,470
So I can only trouble you.

433
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,631
But...

434
00:23:55,671 --> 00:23:58,230
I may have a close bond with Ms. Mu.

435
00:23:59,351 --> 00:24:00,391
But we're only colleagues.

436
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:02,951
Why?

437
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,230
Can't you visit

438
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,510
an injured colleague?

439
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,391
How are the preparations
regarding the Northern Liang?

440
00:24:15,631 --> 00:24:16,510
Everything is ready.

441
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,030
Pay attention to any clues

442
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,871
related to the hawk claw hook
among the Northern Liang envoy.

443
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,310
Yes, My Lord.

444
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:30,431
My Lord,

445
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,911
how long do you plan

446
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,591
to let Mu Zhuohua stay in the residence?

447
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:37,911
Why?

448
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:39,911
You don't want to see her here?

449
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:43,230
That was because you saw

450
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,710
Mu Zhuohua get beaten to a pulp

451
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,111
and urgently wanted
to provide her treatment

452
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,270
by letting her stay here.

453
00:24:47,831 --> 00:24:49,510
For her, that's a great kindness.

454
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,351
I'm only concerned about the rumors.

455
00:24:57,591 --> 00:24:59,750
Why should I fear rumors?

456
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,151
Shen comes to visit Mu.

457
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,351
Didn't Mu Zhuohua keep insisting

458
00:25:11,351 --> 00:25:12,710
that there was nothing
between Shen Jinghong and her?

459
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,030
Now, the only person daring
to visit her at Lord Ding's Residence

460
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,470
turns out to be Shen Jinghong.

461
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,470
My Lord,

462
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,750
I fear you might be drawn
into the gossip and rumors,

463
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:26,030
saying that you
and the current Zhuangyuan

464
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,230
are competing for the Tanhua.

465
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,310
His Lordship does know
what I'm talking about.

466
00:25:32,985 --> 00:25:34,435
(Beyond saving)

467
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,510
"It seems to be the sound
of melody in the air."

468
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,790
Mr. Shen, Ms. Mu is recuperating here.

469
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,151
Young Lady, someone is here with money.

470
00:25:42,671 --> 00:25:43,151
Calm down.

471
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,391
We are now people of status

472
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,191
and can't sell
poetry collections anymore.

473
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,230
Shen,

474
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,591
why are you here?

475
00:25:56,191 --> 00:25:58,191
Ms. Mu, are you feeling better now?

476
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:00,111
Much better, thank you for asking.

477
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,431
Please take a seat.

478
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:10,631
Young Lady.

479
00:26:12,951 --> 00:26:13,710
What's this?

480
00:26:14,391 --> 00:26:15,710
The First Prince entrusted me

481
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,111
to bring you
these precious medicinal herbs.

482
00:26:17,631 --> 00:26:18,831
He's busy

483
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,191
entertaining the Northern Liang envoy.

484
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,391
So he couldn't come
and visit you personally.

485
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,750
By the way, he wants me to tell you

486
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,151
that since you know medicine,

487
00:26:26,671 --> 00:26:27,431
you should know

488
00:26:27,591 --> 00:26:28,710
what to do with these medicinal herbs.

489
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,710
Then help me thank

490
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:31,911
the First Prince on my behalf.

491
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,391
Young Lady, I'll go
and decoct medicine for you.

492
00:26:34,391 --> 00:26:35,030
All right.

493
00:26:43,951 --> 00:26:45,151
If we look closely,

494
00:26:45,951 --> 00:26:46,790
this matter is my fault.

495
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,391
If it weren't for the rumors about us,

496
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,230
I don't think Her Majesty
would be this furious.

497
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,270
Shen,

498
00:26:53,591 --> 00:26:55,871
how can this be your fault?

499
00:26:56,111 --> 00:26:56,990
You have nothing to do with it.

500
00:26:58,911 --> 00:26:59,710
By the way,

501
00:27:01,151 --> 00:27:01,990
this one too.

502
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:04,550
The Princess asked me
to bring you this golden hairpin to you.

503
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,230
Her Highness is very kind indeed.

504
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,070
It's beautiful.

505
00:27:17,151 --> 00:27:17,951
Shen.

506
00:27:18,391 --> 00:27:20,191
If those gossipmongers

507
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,671
saw you giving me a hairpin,

508
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:24,070
who knows what rumors
they'd come up with.

509
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:28,270
Are we the sort of people
who care about such rumors?

510
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:29,951
Of course, we don't.

511
00:27:30,831 --> 00:27:33,310
But those people
sure have a lot of free time.

512
00:27:34,911 --> 00:27:35,550
Besides,

513
00:27:35,631 --> 00:27:37,951
you giving me a hairpin is nothing.

514
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,750
Lord Ding has even
let me stay at his residence.

515
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,510
I can see

516
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,310
you've truly come to terms
with these rumors.

517
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,710
Of course. I value my life.

518
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,510
I've thought it through now.

519
00:27:50,871 --> 00:27:53,270
I'm determined to live a long
and healthy life.

520
00:27:53,391 --> 00:27:54,070
That's the spirit.

521
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:04,470
Greetings, Lord Ding.

522
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,351
Mr. Shen,

523
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,470
Ms. Mu is feeling unwell.

524
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:11,911
She needs to take the medicine.

525
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,431
You can leave now.

526
00:28:16,351 --> 00:28:17,030
Shen.

527
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,310
Then rest well.

528
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,591
I'll come and visit you again.

529
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,831
My Lord, this...

530
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,310
Why is the medicine becoming
more and more bitter?

531
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:25,790
This is not food.

532
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,351
I can't share it with you.

533
00:29:31,191 --> 00:29:32,510
Young Lady said

534
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:34,510
the imperial physician's decoction
was too bitter.

535
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,550
So she asked me
to throw it away secretly.

536
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,030
Young Lady gave me a new prescription.

537
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,310
I have to go and prepare it for her.

538
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,510
Your master is truly capable.

539
00:30:05,431 --> 00:30:07,431
Juli, what took you so long?

540
00:30:08,191 --> 00:30:09,070
Come and have some snacks.

541
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,750
It seems you're living comfortably

542
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,070
in my residence.

543
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,191
My Lord,

544
00:30:25,671 --> 00:30:26,671
why are you still up

545
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,470
at this hour?

546
00:30:36,151 --> 00:30:36,790
Come in.

547
00:30:40,351 --> 00:30:41,351
Young Lady.

548
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,191
My Lord,

549
00:30:54,951 --> 00:30:57,310
you're really considerate
of those under you.

550
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,111
But it's too late now.

551
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,191
Maybe

552
00:31:02,191 --> 00:31:04,191
you should go back and rest.

553
00:31:18,591 --> 00:31:19,510
My Lord,

554
00:31:19,951 --> 00:31:21,990
this medicine is really too bitter.

555
00:31:22,111 --> 00:31:23,591
I had no other choice

556
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,230
but to resort to this.

557
00:31:30,391 --> 00:31:32,990
My Lord, I feel much better now.

558
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,990
I want to go home!

559
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,710
(I want to go home!)

560
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:53,431
If you still wish to work for me,

561
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:56,310
I will certainly do my utmost
to make sure you're safe.

562
00:31:56,951 --> 00:31:57,831
However,

563
00:31:58,591 --> 00:31:59,911
you should also be aware

564
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:04,631
that this path will not be
a ladder to success

565
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:08,550
but rather a steep
and challenging precipice.

566
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:12,550
Juli,

567
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:16,151
what do you think about Lord Ding?

568
00:32:18,391 --> 00:32:20,030
His Lordship may look stern.

569
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,391
But he's a kind person.

570
00:32:23,671 --> 00:32:26,230
Lord Ding may not smile often.

571
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,191
But he's really protective.

572
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,550
He may feed me with bitter medicine,

573
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:35,030
but he also offers us
a lot of delicious food.

574
00:32:41,111 --> 00:32:41,951
Do you remember

575
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,871
what he asked me before?

576
00:32:45,351 --> 00:32:46,871
He told me to make a choice.

577
00:32:47,391 --> 00:32:48,310
At that time,

578
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,151
I didn't know how to choose.

579
00:32:52,831 --> 00:32:54,030
But now,

580
00:32:56,191 --> 00:32:57,951
I think I know what I should choose.

581
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,111
My Lord.

582
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,070
Don't feel obligated to join me

583
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,750
just because I saved you.

584
00:33:20,671 --> 00:33:22,951
I'm not the type who always wants
to have something in return.

585
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,831
I hope you can follow your heart.

586
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:37,510
Don't forget to take the medicine,

587
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,070
and don't throw it away again.

588
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:46,070
My Lord,

589
00:33:48,351 --> 00:33:49,591
about what you asked me before.

590
00:33:50,671 --> 00:33:51,951
I have my answer now.

591
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,750
I want

592
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:59,750

612

Young Lady,

00:34:52,711 --> 00:34:54,431
you're still reading
when you're injured.

614
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:56,150
Be careful not to strain your eyes.

615
00:34:56,431 --> 00:34:57,831
It's all right. Let me read some more.

616
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,351
Is this the book

617
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:03,030
you've been asking me to search for?

618
00:35:04,711 --> 00:35:06,311
This book is really useful.

619
00:35:08,951 --> 00:35:11,630
But you said you wanted
to share Lord Ding's worries.

620
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,351
Why are you reading books
about Northern Liang?

621
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:18,150
He has been working tirelessly
day and night recently.

622
00:35:18,431 --> 00:35:21,070
It's all for the upcoming peace talks
with Northern Liang.

623
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,951
However, it's Lord Ding

624
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,751
who initiated these talks
with Northern Liang.

625
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:30,070
He deliberately leaked news of wanting
to negotiate peace with Eastern Xia.

626
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,711
This made Northern Liang anxious,

627
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:34,351
thinking that Southern Chen would ally
with Eastern Xia.

628
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,271
What does that have to do with us?

629
00:35:36,751 --> 00:35:39,231
To seek justice
for the thirty thousand loyal souls,

630
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,190
His Lordship has put himself
on the line.

631
00:35:41,871 --> 00:35:43,311
Since I've already made up my mind

632
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,711
to follow him

633
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,150
and become a good official that cares
for the country and the people,

634
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,590
then I must

635
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,990
take practical action.

636
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:51,831
I can't just talk the talk.

637
00:35:52,711 --> 00:35:53,871
I'm someone

638
00:35:54,311 --> 00:35:56,311
who knows how to repay kindness.

639
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,351
The medicine is ready.

640
00:36:06,135 --> 00:36:07,985
(Landscape of Northern Liang)

641
00:36:13,911 --> 00:36:16,510
My Lord, you've worked hard all day

642
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,271
and still came to deliver
the medicine to me.

643
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,630
I'm truly touched.

644
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:23,190
By taking the medicine,

645
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,590
you're already repaying me.

646
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,630
These are two separate matters.

647
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,630
My Lord, did you hear

648
00:36:33,231 --> 00:36:34,431
what I just said earlier?

649
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,951
Then do you think

650
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:41,231
you can give me a chance

651
00:36:41,391 --> 00:36:42,751
to observe and participate
in the works of the Ministry of Rites?

652
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:55,231
If you can master
Northern Liang's language

653
00:36:55,711 --> 00:36:57,510
within twenty days

654
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,630
and pass the test,

655
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,911
I'll allow you to join the works
of the Ministry of Rites.

656
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,550
Of course, I'll do it.

657
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,431
But, My Lord,

658
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,311
I still need some materials to study.

659
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:12,431
Can you lend me more books?

660
00:37:17,231 --> 00:37:18,231
It's getting late.

661
00:37:18,311 --> 00:37:19,351
You should get some rest early.

662
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:20,951
I won't be in your way anymore.

663
00:37:21,831 --> 00:37:24,751
Later, I'll have someone
deliver the books to you.

664
00:37:25,831 --> 00:37:26,470
All right.

665
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:27,711
Thank you, My Lord.

666
00:37:31,311 --> 00:37:32,311
That's awesome, Young Lady.

667
00:37:35,271 --> 00:37:36,911
Young Lady, the books are here.

668
00:37:37,711 --> 00:37:39,190
"Anecdotes of the Northern Liang."

669
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,751
Young Lady, here's your medicine.

670
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:57,951
It's so bitter.

671
00:37:58,990 --> 00:37:59,670
Young Lady.

672
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:10,911
This is great, Young Lady.

673
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,630
You've almost fully recovered.

674
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,630
I can walk normally now.

675
00:38:14,871 --> 00:38:15,550
I've recovered.

676
00:38:16,351 --> 00:38:17,110
Young Lady,

677
00:38:17,231 --> 00:38:19,030
there is so much delicious food
in Lord Ding's Residence.

678
00:38:19,951 --> 00:38:21,670
Stop that, Guo Juli.

679
00:38:21,751 --> 00:38:22,871
We must return home.

680
00:38:23,711 --> 00:38:26,271
Butler Zhang talks to me
about daily life every day

681
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:27,791
and would go on for more than two hours.

682
00:38:27,911 --> 00:38:29,311
Or he'll tell me

683
00:38:29,711 --> 00:38:32,431
that Lord Ding grows up
without parental care and love.

684
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,951
He would also tell me

685
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:36,791
that Lord Ding has never been attracted
to any woman.

686
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:39,110
I don't even have time

687
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:39,911
to read in peace.

688
00:38:40,311 --> 00:38:41,791
You can tell him
that you want some time alone.

689
00:38:42,271 --> 00:38:44,670
Do you have the heart
to turn someone kind

690
00:38:44,751 --> 00:38:46,911
who brings you food every day away?

691
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:49,351
So,

692
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:52,030
I'll go and bid farewell
to Lord Ding now.

693
00:38:52,271 --> 00:38:54,190
Pack up our things.

694
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:55,831
Don't be greedy for food.

695
00:39:09,271 --> 00:39:09,911
Uncle.

696
00:39:32,311 --> 00:39:34,190
You were severely injured
in the past few days.

697
00:39:34,431 --> 00:39:35,431
So I couldn't bear to reprimand you.

698
00:39:36,871 --> 00:39:37,590
Uncle,

699
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:42,070
please take into account
that I came to you in person

700
00:39:42,911 --> 00:39:44,271
and spare me a few scoldings.

701
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,311
Chen,

702
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,630
you're the eldest.

703
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:55,590
In this matter,

704
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,351
you bear the biggest responsibility.

705
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,070
He was the one
being disrespectful first.

706
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,030
He said that you had misjudged people

707
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:02,711
and was deceived.

708
00:40:02,711 --> 00:40:03,871
I couldn't hold my anger.
That's why I...

709
00:40:04,791 --> 00:40:07,231
They deliberately provoked you

710
00:40:07,231 --> 00:40:08,431
because they know your temper.

711
00:40:08,791 --> 00:40:09,751
They did it on purpose?

712
00:40:14,431 --> 00:40:15,231
I get it now.

713
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:19,951
Liu Yu got Liu Jin
to drag me down on purpose.

714
00:40:22,231 --> 00:40:24,590
I can't believe he was willing
to put his younger brother at risk.

715
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:25,990
Chen,

716
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:29,831
the three of you are my nephews.

717
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:33,791
I should be impartial in this.

718
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:35,351
But now,

719
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:36,911
your conflicts are getting so intense.

720
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,550
This would only sadden your father.

721
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,711
They drove me into a corner.

722
00:40:47,431 --> 00:40:48,711
You are the legitimate eldest son.

723
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:51,150
As long as you don't make mistakes,

724
00:40:51,871 --> 00:40:53,911
everything will proceed smoothly.

725
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:57,311
Their goal is to force you
to make a mistake.

726
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,391
And yet, you chose to act impulsively,

727
00:40:59,391 --> 00:41:00,871
falling right into their traps.

728
00:41:03,751 --> 00:41:06,351
From now on,
you must control your temper

729
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:09,550
and think carefully
before you act in all matters.

730
00:41:10,391 --> 00:41:12,311
My Lord, Mu Zhuohua
requests an audience.

731
00:41:18,391 --> 00:41:19,271
Let her in.
