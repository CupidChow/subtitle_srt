=The Legend of Zhuohua=

17
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,860
(Adapted from "She Was Once
a Playful Soul" by Sui Yu Er An)

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,940
=Episode 31=

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
(This is a work of fiction.)

20
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,920
You thought

21
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,439
that, at worst,
you would lose your life for it.

22
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:54,473
Yet, by doing so,

23
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,320
Zhimo

24
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,079
will lose the only family he has.

25
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,760
But I have been waiting for this moment.

26
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,680
I didn't know who my enemy was.

27
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:11,600
But now, I have a target.

28
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,200
I don't want to waste this opportunity.

29
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,440
Official Mu,

30
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,200
do you know how this feels?

31
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,000
You're willing to die for it,

32
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:26,760
but Zhimo will not let you

33
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,040
risk your life like this.

34
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,040
If you do this,

35
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:33,079
you're hurting Zhimo.

36
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,679
For His Lordship,

37
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:37,799
Zhimo and you

38
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:40,480
are more important than vengeance.

39
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,639
Zhijian,

40
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,359
to die is easy.

41
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:49,519
To live,

42
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:52,399
especially to live meaningfully,

43
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,280
that's a challenge.

44
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:57,959
Can't you see?

45
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:08,600
Our parents are dead anyway.

46
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:10,959
Why celebrate birthdays?

47
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,799
Because it's important.

48
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:35,839
If I'm gone

49
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:38,040
one day,

50
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:40,920
you need to celebrate your birthday, too.

51
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,720
Have some rest.

52
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,839
I'll take care of him.

53
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,559
It wasn't until you were injured

54
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,119
that I found out

55
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:11,639
a human

56
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,480
could bleed this much.

57
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:16,559
But...

58
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:20,840
But I'm your elder brother.

59
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,480
I'm supposed to protect you.

60
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,559
Enough, Your Lordship.

61
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,199
He learned his lesson.

62
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,080
Stop making him kneel.

63
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,119
If not,

64
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,400
he will have bad knees forever.

65
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:54,040
Retain your lesson.

66
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:57,999
Do not repeat the same mistake.

67
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:01,199
Yes, My Lord.

68
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,720
Get up.

69
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:12,520
Zhimo's condition has stabilized,

70
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,439
though he still needs some time to heal.

71
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:23,960
Your Highness.

72
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,600
I heard that you were attacked.

73
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,799
Were you hurt?

74
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,480
I am fine.

75
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,160
The assassin did not hurt me.

76
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:35,920
I'm relieved, then.

77
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:48,559
But who is

78
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,960
that malicious assailant?

79
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,640
My guards fought him.

80
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,040
Judging from his technique,

81
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:57,679
he must be Zhijian.

82
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,759
Lord Ding's subordinate?

83
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,520
Does this mean

84
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,600
that Lord Ding is suspecting you?

85
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:07,759
So?

86
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:09,480
He has no evidence.

87
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,359
Making speculations is all he can do.

88
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,920
(In this life,)

89
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,199
(I made one mistake after another.)

90
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,720
(There is no turning back.)

91
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,799
(Only in death can I atone for my sins.)

92
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,960
Since Lord Ding already suspects me,

93
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,640
we should strike first

94
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,520
instead of playing passively.

95
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,720
We can catch them by surprise.

96
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:06,840
My uncle holds Chen dearly.

97
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,520
And Chen respects him a lot.

98
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,720
They are very close.

99
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,679
And that bond of steel

100
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:17,960
sticks out

101
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,960
like a sore thumb.

102
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,080
But

103
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,640
it's not easy to drive a wedge

104
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:26,960
between them.

105
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:28,239
No worries.

106
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,359
Slow and steady wins the race.

107
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,520
When the opportunity presents itself,

108
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,600
sow the seed of doubt.

109
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:38,799
It will grow

110
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:41,239
and fester.

111
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,239
She died so soon.

112
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,160
She should have suffered more.

113
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:10,720
Grandmother went to a temple
to get this for me

114
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,679
on my 18th birthday.

115
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,439
She said that it would protect me

116
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,040
from harm.

117
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:21,679
She told me to carry it always.

118
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,480
But rebellious as I was,

119
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:28,400
I never wore it.

120
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:33,000
Now that Father and Grandmother left me,

121
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,000
I learned

122
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:42,719
the true pain of regret.

123
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,599
My condolences, Your Majesty.

124
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,400
You still have your nation

125
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:51,199
and the Dowager Empress.

126
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,160
Please take care of yourself.

127
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,040
Princess Roujia,

128
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:05,040
you should take care of yourself, too.

129
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,439
Before the Grand Dowager Empress
passed away,

130
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,520
she cared most about you.

131
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:15,439
Thank you for your concern, Uncle.

132
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,280
I'm sure

133
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:20,839
she thought about you, too.

134
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:32,839
After Father passed away,

135
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:36,240
Grandaunt made the trip here
immediately.

136
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,079
I guess

137
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,640
she must be close by.

138
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,000
But before she could arrive,

139
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,719
Grandmother had already gone.

140
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:52,319
Knowing her age,

141
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,799
Grandaunt will be heartbroken.

142
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:03,599
First, it was Ju.

143
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:06,280
Now, it's the Grand Dowager Empress.

144
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,959
You are a filial son.

145
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,599
I can imagine your grief.

146
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,400
Fortunately,
you're here with me, Grandaunt.

147
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,679
You're a grown-up now.

148
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,439
Grandaunt,

149
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,000
I'll accompany you to pay respect

150
00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:29,400
to Father and Grandmother later.

151
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:30,880
Okay.

152
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:32,040
Grandaunt,

153
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:35,079
you remind me of the Evil-erasing Sword.

154
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:36,920
Well,

155
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,439
when I was little, I was afraid of it.

156
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,839
The sword that Grandfather used
in his battle.

157
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:46,920
For years,

158
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,280
you kept it hidden

159
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:50,719
from the public's eyes.

160
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,439
A bloody blade

161
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,120
is ill-suited for public display.

162
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,280
Indeed.

163
00:10:58,479 --> 00:11:00,400
The appearance of Evil-erasing Sword

164
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,000
can only mean

165
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:04,559
that Southern Chen is at war.

166
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:11,280
May it never reappear.

167
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,535
(Jishan Hall)

168
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:28,040
Your mind is wandering, Your Highness.

169
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:34,079
I made a wrong move.

170
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:37,400
Alas, I cannot take it back.

171
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,000
All right.

172
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,599
I surrender.

173
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,599
The Border Defender Princess
has returned to the capital.

174
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,280
I heard she carries
the Evil-erasing Sword with her.

175
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,880
That blade

176
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:05,719
was left behind by Grandfather.

177
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,000
It is a symbol of his presence.

178
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:12,240
Even Father

179
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:13,760
had to show it some respect.

180
00:12:15,479 --> 00:12:17,920
If I can get that blade...

181
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:25,120
Grandaunt adores me.

182
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,920
It is not impossible

183
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,959
to get it from her.

184
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,040
However, Lord Ding is here.

185
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,439
He might try to impede

186
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:39,920
our plan.

187
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,439
It is time to sow

188
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,160
the seed of doubt.

189
00:12:47,885 --> 00:12:48,799
(Ministry of Revenue)

190
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,240
His Lordship wishes to return
to his fiefdom?

191
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,120
No way.

192
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,479
Why not?

193
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,880
It's widely spread now.

194
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,280
His Majesty barely claimed the throne.

195
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:57,599
He can't possibly

196
00:12:57,599 --> 00:12:59,719
keep the high-achieving Lord Ding
by his side.

197
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,959
I feel bad for Lord Ding.

198
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,160
He is being sidelined.

199
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,360
I'm returning to my fiefdom.

200
00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:17,920
Are you not worried?

201
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,920
We can write to each other.

202
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,319
You're heartless.

203
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,760
Your Lordship.

204
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,640
A message from the Falcon Squad.

205
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,240
The rumors

206
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,160
are circulated by merchants

207
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:46,360
and grassroots scholars.

208
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:54,559
A concise and persuasive article.

209
00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:57,240
Not bad.

210
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,520
It's most probably written

211
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,360
by Shen Jinghong.

212
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:07,120
Besides, I once saw him

213
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:09,040
imitate someone's handwriting.

214
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:13,760
In that case,

215
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:16,000
he quite likely forged

216
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,120
the testamentary edict then.

217
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:20,760
Your Lordship,

218
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:23,360
he is really working
for Princess Roujia.

219
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:26,760
Everything is

220
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,439
expected.

221
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,799
Princess Roujia is regarded

222
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,559
as the Holy Maiden.

223
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:39,280
And among the grassroots scholars,

224
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:40,719
Shen Jinghong is profoundly respected.

225
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,880
They make

226
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,520
a formidable duo.

227
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,479
Roujia made a brilliant move

228
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:53,360
by using Shen Jinghong.

229
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,120
Your Lordship,

230
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,360
they are trying to force you away
from the capital.

231
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,240
Noted.

232
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:14,880
Your Majesty,

233
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,559
there have been

234
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,160
rumors circulating about.

235
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,719
They say Lord Ding is ready

236
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,160
to usurp your position.

237
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,839
Usurp

238
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:39,799
my position?

239
00:15:42,785 --> 00:15:45,885
(Xuanzheng Hall)

240
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:50,120
All princes are to manage their fiefdoms
upon coming of age

241
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,319
unless summoned by the Emperor.

242
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:55,280
Yet Lord Ding

243
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:58,839
has stayed in the capital
for a decade now.

244
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:00,360
He has never visited his fiefdom.

245
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:01,640
I'm afraid

246
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,640
this is inappropriate.

247
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,079
I agree with Official Sun.

248
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,040
The late Emperor was benevolent enough

249
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,719
to allow Lord Ding
to stay in the capital.

250
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,319
But we now have a new emperor.

251
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:19,920
Some might think
that Lord Ding's powerful position

252
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,120
might influence policy-making.

253
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:24,599
He should recuse himself

254
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,920
and return to his fiefdom.

255
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:40,599
I have heard about the rumors

256
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,280
concerning Lord Ding.

257
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,920
They say

258
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:48,559
he might usurp my position.

259
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:51,079
They

260
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,360
are the same words repeated to my father

261
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:55,199
when he was alive.

262
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,599
It's been a decade now.

263
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,880
Are you not tired of it?

264
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,551
But I am.

265
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,600
Now,

266
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,519
focus on your duty and stop speculating.

267
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:11,640
I am not blind.

268
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,840
During Father's reign,

269
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,800
Lord Ding fought in dangerous battles

270
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:20,719
and emerged

271
00:17:21,479 --> 00:17:22,519
victorious.

272
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,120
I acceded to the throne recently.

273
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,959
And despite his ill health,
Lord Ding returned to politics

274
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:32,039
to help me.

275
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:34,800
What could a ruler possibly want more

276
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:37,519
than a faithful minister like him?

277
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:52,120
"By His Majesty's decree, Lord Ding
will be appointed as the Prince Regent.

278
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,479
He will be given a seat
in the imperial court

279
00:17:54,719 --> 00:17:56,160
and is allowed to carry his sword
to the court.

280
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,959
Thus concludes this decree."

281
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,160
You have my gratitude, Your Majesty.

282
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,959
Grandaunt resides in Jiangzuo.

283
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,519
How does she fare in the capital?

284
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,579
She adapts to the environment very well.

285
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,840
However, many socialites

286
00:18:38,999 --> 00:18:40,239
would love to visit her.

287
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,039
She has no love for such occasions,

288
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,120
so she feigns sickness
to turn them away.

289
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,400
I see.

290
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,239
That reassures me.

291
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:55,080
I should congratulate you, Uncle.

292
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,719
I was forced

293
00:18:59,479 --> 00:19:00,519
to assume the office.

294
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,439
Uncle,

295
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,880
you don't sound too happy.

296
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,279
Perhaps

297
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:17,479
it's a blessing in disguise.

298
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:25,320
Roujia.

299
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,320
I remember

300
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,920
that before your father
became the Emperor,

301
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:33,759
you were his only child.

302
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,360
Back then,

303
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,719
he often brought you with him
to visit me.

304
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,679
One time, you fell on the ground.

305
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,360
To cheer you up,

306
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,999
he played the swing with you
for the entire afternoon.

307
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,999
But shortly after,

308
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:54,400
I was sent away from the capital.

309
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:56,880
In the following ten years,

310
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,519
Father never came to see me.

311
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:04,199
When I returned,

312
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:07,920
I have three other brothers.

313
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:11,400
You know very well

314
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,560
what happened then.

315
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,360
Your father had no choice.

316
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:20,999
He wanted to protect you.

317
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,719
I know Father did all this

318
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,999
for my own good.

319
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:32,360
You have always been

320
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,600
his favorite child.

321
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,199
Before he passed away,

322
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,519
he dreamed of a peaceful nation

323
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,640
and a harmonious family.

324
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,759
But Yu made a mistake

325
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:47,199
and hurt Father's feelings.

326
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:53,600
Yet he learned from his mistake.

327
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,279
And now, he enjoys his life
in his fiefdom

328
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,959
as a free and wealthy nobleman.

329
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:03,160
His Majesty has a generous soul.

330
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,600
I'm sure my father will be happy

331
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:08,840
to see this.

332
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,840
I can only wish

333
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,279
that it would remain this way.

334
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,320
If I may ask, Uncle,

335
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:27,640
why don't you return to your fiefdom?

336
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:33,400
Sorry for my forwardness.

337
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:35,360
Pardon me.

338
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:38,719
I will return.

339
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,679
Now is not the right time.

340
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,935
(Department of State Affairs)

341
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,199
Official Shen.

342
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:04,320
Do you remember?

343
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:10,160
The weather was as good

344
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,479
as today

345
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:15,239
when we first came
to the Department of State Affairs.

346
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,479
You have a good memory, Official Mu.

347
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,519
It is, indeed.

348
00:22:23,479 --> 00:22:24,640
I don't have a good memory.

349
00:22:25,439 --> 00:22:28,039
It's just that I remember
why I came here.

350
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,959
After this long journey,

351
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:32,400
do you still remember

352
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:36,640
why you wish to serve the people?

353
00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:38,400
Of course.

354
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:43,640
I wish to see a prosperous nation
and a peaceful society.

355
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:48,039
And at the moment,

356
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,679
do you still harbor the same wish?

357
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:52,199
My heart

358
00:22:53,199 --> 00:22:54,039
has never changed.

359
00:23:00,439 --> 00:23:01,719
I pray

360
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,519
that you'll remember
what you said today.

361
00:23:08,479 --> 00:23:10,560
What do you mean, Official Mu?

362
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,840
Despite the unrest outside,

363
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,160
we have this short moment of respite.

364
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,080
We should cherish it.

365
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,560
Plain, uneventful days are the best,

366
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:57,759
aren't they?

367
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,239
Just like the time we spent

368
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,800
in the hut.

369
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:06,600
When we woke up,

370
00:24:07,199 --> 00:24:09,320
we saw plants.

371
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,439
Everything was simple.

372
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,279
We drank the morning dews

373
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:17,999
and feasted upon
the leaves of chrysanthemums.

374
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,880
You reminisce about the old days.

375
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,400
Why? You want to give
your career up now?

376
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,439
Those peaceful days

377
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,320
make me realize

378
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,400
how heavy my duty is.

379
00:24:35,999 --> 00:24:37,759
But I won't give up.

380
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,120
On the contrary,

381
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,160
I will do what I can

382
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,560
to give the people of Southern Chen

383
00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:46,800
the peace

384
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:48,199
they deserve.

385
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,360
Isn't that

386
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,479
your wish, too?

387
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:07,560
Who would have thought

388
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,239
that the ones supporting Zhuang Wenfeng

389
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:12,039
were the Suns?

390
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:16,160
The Suns have a long history
in Jiangnan.

391
00:26:17,479 --> 00:26:18,800
This explains

392
00:26:19,199 --> 00:26:21,679
why Zhuang Wenfeng
went unpunished for years

393
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:23,840
despite the atrocities

394
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,039
he committed.

395
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,999
I thought we would have
several days of respite,

396
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,279
but God has denied me of this luxury.

397
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,759
It has nothing to do with God.

398
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,039
It's human greed.

399
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,160
God's will could not be defied,

400
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,279
but human greed

401
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:50,719
should not be allowed to run rampant.

402
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:52,640
Yes.

403
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:54,239
And we

404
00:26:55,719 --> 00:26:57,120
will make an example of him.

405
00:26:59,185 --> 00:27:01,985
(Xuanzheng Hall)

406
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,160
Sun Ru.

407
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,920
What can you still explain?

408
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,279
Is it as what Lord Ding claimed here

409
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,080
that you embezzled the relief fund

410
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,959
when a disaster struck Jiangnan?

411
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,439
Your Majesty!

412
00:27:16,999 --> 00:27:18,999
I am innocent.

413
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,840
I do not know Zhuang Wenfeng at all.

414
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,120
I don't know

415
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,519
why my name appeared in his letters.

416
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:28,719
I'm afraid

417
00:27:28,719 --> 00:27:30,560
my loyalty attracted
some political enemies,

418
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,039
and they colluded with Zhuang Wenfeng

419
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,479
to frame me.

420
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:36,560
I would confront Zhuang Wenfeng

421
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,600
if he wasn't dead!

422
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,640
Prince Regent,

423
00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:46,039
you only answer to His Majesty,

424
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:46,999
all right.

425
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,880
But that doesn't mean

426
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,320
you can frame an innocent soul

427
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,640
with these letters.

428
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,199
Official Sun, you do make a point.

429
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,920
Several letters aren't enough

430
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,719
to prove you are guilty.

431
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,120
Besides,

432
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:04,239
Your Majesty,

433
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,080
I also think

434
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,640
that Official Sun is innocent.

435
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:15,120
Your Majesty.

436
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:18,120
Prince Regent,

437
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,239
you wanted to persecute Official Sun.

438
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,199
Now, you say that he was framed.

439
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:27,320
This court is not a place for jests,

440
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,479
so please explain everything at once.

441
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:34,199
Otherwise, you did more than
just lie to His Majesty's face.

442
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,400
Official Zhou,

443
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,160
Zhuang Wenfeng was the one
framing Official Sun.

444
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,279
I merely presented the evidence I found

445
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:47,239
to His Majesty.

446
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:49,671
The Sun family

447
00:28:49,672 --> 00:28:51,320
is one of the most noble families
in Southern Chen.

448
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,880
They are ministers for generations,

449
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,360
so they lead

450
00:28:57,439 --> 00:28:59,800
a wealthy life.

451
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:02,519
Why would they collude

452
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:04,360
with a lowly county magistrate
like Zhuang Wenfeng

453
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:09,479
and commit embezzlement?

454
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,840
Your Majesty.

455
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,600
I

456
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,640
disagree with the Prince Regent.

457
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:28,800
Official Shen,

458
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,320
do you have any opinion?

459
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,719
Zhuang Wenfeng is dead.

460
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,279
We couldn't possibly

461
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,320
interrogate the truth out of him.

462
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,880
However,

463
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,400
since this discovery
concerns Official Sun,

464
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,560
even if he isn't the culprit,

465
00:29:49,999 --> 00:29:51,959
he must have something to do
with this mystery.

466
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,560
I suggest

467
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,279
that we get to the bottom of the case.

468
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,519
Your Majesty.

469
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,400
Zhuang Wenfeng is dead,

470
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:05,360
so is the clue.

471
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:07,039
For the proper functioning
of the court,

472
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,959
we can

473
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,560
hold off on the investigation

474
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,920
until the dust settles.

475
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,920
How many corrupted county magistrates

476
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,400
are there in our nation?

477
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:19,080
Do you know that, Official Wang?

478
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,959
If we do not get to the bottom of this,

479
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,880
how many more will continue

480
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,120
to line the pocket of the main culprit?

481
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:29,679
Should we

482
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:30,840
only conduct an investigation

483
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,279
whenever another Zhuang Wenfeng dies?

484
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:35,800
Who should the exploited citizens

485
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,120
turn to?

486
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,120
I...

487
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,160
Or are you saying
that a family's reputation

488
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,439
is more important

489
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:43,279
than the people's welfare?

490
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:46,400
These are fabricated accusations!

491
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,479
Your Majesty,

492
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,080
he twisted my words.

493
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:49,999
Your Majesty,

494
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,640
I believe

495
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:53,719
the root of this problem

496
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:55,959
is the Protected Appointments System.

497
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,759
Eliminating it

498
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,120
enables all scholars
to begin their careers

499
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:00,959
on an equal footing.

500
00:31:01,199 --> 00:31:02,120
Everyone will be equal.

501
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,519
No one

502
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,840
will enjoy a background advantage.

503
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,560
This is an important decision.

504
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,840
We can discuss it in the future.

505
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,759
Let's call it a day.

506
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:29,320
Adjourn.

507
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,600
Court adjourned!

508
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:34,920
Thank you, Your Majesty.

509
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,160
Wait, Official Mu.

510
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:49,400
Official Shen, your endorsement
of equality

511
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,120
in the court today

512
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,679
was admirable.

513
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,439
Official Mu, you are often
the talkative one.

514
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:56,840
Why did you remain silent

515
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,239
today?

516
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,479
The Protected Appointments System
has its flaws,

517
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,999
but it works

518
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,360
for a reason.

519
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,560
We both went through
the imperial examination

520
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:10,959
and know how it discriminates
against the grassroots scholars.

521
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,640
If we refuse to stand up,

522
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,120
we enable the noble families
to exploit us

523
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:17,320
and the other poor scholars.

524
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,120
You are absolutely right, Official Shen.

525
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,999
We come from a humble background,

526
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,920
so our view

527
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,719
is shaped by it.

528
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,400
But His Majesty rules everyone.

529
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,959
He has to face noble families

530
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,279
and the commoners.

531
00:32:32,719 --> 00:32:34,160
He is squeezed in between.

532
00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:36,120
As His Majesty's ministers,

533
00:32:36,719 --> 00:32:38,120
we are supposed to reduce his burden.

534
00:32:38,199 --> 00:32:39,479
I beg to differ, Official Mu.

535
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,320
Grassroot...

536
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,080
Didn't I say

537
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:25,640
to leave me alone?

538
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,080
Did you not hear

539
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,199
what I said?

540
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,039
Did we

541
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:50,920
embezzle the relief fund?

542
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,519
No.

543
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,719
Don't look at me like that.

544
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,640
If I was guilty,

545
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,959
His Majesty would have
punished me already.

546
00:34:07,199 --> 00:34:08,320
He didn't.

547
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:10,599
So I'm innocent.

548
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:14,760
Father.

549
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,119
You are awfully verbose today.

550
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,159
If you're here to confront me,

551
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,320
you may leave.

552
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,079
You have never cared about your family.

553
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:29,119
You don't need to do it now.

554
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,479
Father,

555
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:34,240
why?

556
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:37,760
Do we not have enough wealth?

557
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:39,639
Why would you

558
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,119
forsake your principles?

559
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,920
Forsake my principles?

560
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:47,079
You are the guiltiest of us all.

561
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,400
As the eldest son of the family,

562
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:52,599
you did nothing

563
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:54,360
for this family.

564
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,439
You think

565
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,760
it's that easy to continue

566
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,800
our legacy?

567
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:04,479
Then let it go.

568
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,400
You...

569
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:08,400
You traitor.

570
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,880
Get out.

571
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,200
Now!

572
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,039
(If my comfort)

573
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:36,840
(is built upon the misappropriation
of public funds,)

574
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,959
(then I am ashamed)

575
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,079
(to have admired this beautiful view
in my garden.)

576
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:47,639
(The blossoming plants merely remind me)

577
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,240
(of my incompetence, naivete,)

578
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,800
(and inaction.)

579
00:35:54,479 --> 00:35:56,320
(I was born with a silver spoon.)

580
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,599
(Though I never committed a crime,)

581
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,400
(I bear responsibility
for my family's sins.)

582
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:12,360
My dear.

583
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:18,439
Are you all right?

584
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:21,999
You seem to be deeply troubled.

585
00:36:21,999 --> 00:36:22,599
(Sun Yunqian's Wife)

586
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:24,159
(Sun Yunqian's Wife)
Did something happen during work?

587
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,959
I'm your wife.

588
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,159
You ought to share your woes with me.

589
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,880
I will do what I can

590
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:36,720
to help you.

591
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:40,959
Qian.

592
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:44,519
Mother.

593
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,119
Why did you argue
with your father again?

594
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:50,360
Listen to me.

595
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:52,519
Don't talk back to your father.

596
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,760
He wants you

597
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,999
to grow up sooner

598
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,920
to be the pillar of this family.

599
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,320
Like father, like son.

600
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:02,880
Both of you are equally stubborn.

601
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:04,880
We're a family.

602
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:06,680
You can talk it out.

603
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,959
Don't keep everything to yourself.

604
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,240
Worry not, Mother-in-law.

605
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:15,959
I will talk to Yunqian.

606
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:17,559
It's getting late.

607
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:18,519
Let's eat.

608
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,360
Otherwise, you will have indigestion.

609
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,519
Okay.

610
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:24,159
If only you were as sensible
as your wife.

611
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:26,880
Let's go.

612
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:42,320
You chastised me
for not taking care of myself.

613
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:43,720
But now,

614
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:45,519
you're the one falling sick.

615
00:37:47,479 --> 00:37:48,880
As your physician,

616
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,680
I have to keep an eye on you.

617
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,320
You keep tabs on everything, huh?

618
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,280
Of course.

619
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,320
I am not as generous as you think.

620
00:38:00,999 --> 00:38:03,280
So once in a while,

621
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:04,760
I'll air your dirty laundry

622
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,360
so that you know
not to mess around with me.

623
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,439
The land deed already falls
under your name.

624
00:38:12,439 --> 00:38:15,360
What more do you want from me?

625
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,159
Your heart, needless to say.

626
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,720
However, My Lord,

627
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,240
you set up the perfect ruse

628
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,360
in the court today.

629
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,119
Those few letters are enough

630
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,880
to send the Zhous and the Suns

631
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,800
into panic.

632
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,920
You also exposed the shortcomings
of the Protected Appointments System.

633
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,880
Shen jumped on the occasion

634
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,959
and suggested its abolition.

635
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,079
But it's too radical of a move.

636
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,360
He wants to get rid of the pest
as soon as possible,

637
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,360
yet the noble families
are no ordinary pests.

638
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,800
They are more like venomous snakes
ready to bare their fangs.

639
00:38:53,479 --> 00:38:55,479
He's too impatient.

640
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,639
We shall proceed slowly.

641
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,039
Eventually, we will depose
those influential families.

642
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,559
Lord Ding uses Zhuang Wenfeng

643
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,039
to wage a war
against the noble families.

644
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,999
Well,

645
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,240
we can use this opportunity

646
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:20,119
to push for a systemic reform

647
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,599
and get rid
of those generational leeches.

648
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,079
But Prince Regent doesn't seem

649
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,920
to favor a radical approach.

650
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:31,840
He wants to proceed slowly

651
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,320
and eliminate them one by one.

652
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,159
But those noble families

653
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:41,039
are the source of pestilence.

654
00:39:41,999 --> 00:39:43,599
Letting it fester

655
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:45,119
will only make the court

656
00:39:45,479 --> 00:39:46,999
increasingly hostile.

657
00:39:48,479 --> 00:39:50,119
I agree.

658
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,840
The noble families
do not lack in cunning foxes.

659
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,959
They won't sit by and allow someone
to remove them from power.

660
00:39:58,039 --> 00:39:59,400
Once they know what's happening,

661
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,680
they will retaliate for sure.

662
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:07,559
We want them to fight.

663
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,920
If my uncle prefers a careful approach,

664
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:14,999
we can just stoke the flame ourselves.

665
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,240
He holds an important position

666
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,439
and is supported by the people.

667
00:40:27,479 --> 00:40:29,800
He is the greatest obstacle
on my path to dominion.

668
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,840
However,

669
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,840
he is very fond of Zhuohua.

670
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,920
If we can implicate her in this plan,

671
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:42,280
maybe my uncle will side with us.

672
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:46,559
He will have no choice but to do that.

673
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,800
Besides,

674
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,840
that arrangement

675
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,479
will create distrust

676
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,479
between His Majesty
and Prince Regent.

677
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,519
After all,

678
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:02,240
when sovereignty clashes
with the interests of the noble families,

679
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,599
none can walk away from it.

680
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:08,135
(Shen's Residence)

681
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:52,039
This book by Mr. Shang
only has the first part

682
00:41:52,959 --> 00:41:54,439
but not the second one.

683
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,519
Why is that?

684
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,840
(Eradicating Corruption Proposal)
However, it is well-written

685
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,920
and easy to understand.

686
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,479

with my advocacy.)
