(Wenzheng Parlor)

21
00:01:51,185 --> 00:01:52,144
Tutor Shang's words

22
00:01:52,144 --> 00:01:53,304
(Eradicating Corruption Proposal)
have raised awareness.

23
00:01:53,584 --> 00:01:55,985
Those from noble families
are now favored by the Emperor,

24
00:01:56,064 --> 00:01:58,465
but they are complacent
and bully the common people.

25
00:01:58,465 --> 00:01:59,745
They're unworthy of being favored.

26
00:01:59,944 --> 00:02:00,905
And look at us.

27
00:02:01,025 --> 00:02:03,025
We studied for years
and passed the examination.

28
00:02:03,265 --> 00:02:04,665
We aspire to serve the nation.

29
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:07,504
But that ambition
is being hindered by these pests.

30
00:02:07,504 --> 00:02:08,760
(Eradicating Corruption Proposal)

31
00:02:09,225 --> 00:02:12,065
This is the Eradicating Corruption Proposal
that's been widely spread

32
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,704
among grassroots scholars lately?

33
00:02:14,345 --> 00:02:15,065
Yes.

34
00:02:15,464 --> 00:02:16,665
The Protected Appointments System

35
00:02:17,265 --> 00:02:18,385
has carried on for a century.

36
00:02:18,864 --> 00:02:20,304
It is like a towering old tree

37
00:02:21,105 --> 00:02:22,105
that is deeply rooted.

38
00:02:22,864 --> 00:02:25,105
These words hit the nail on the head.

39
00:02:25,464 --> 00:02:28,584
This Tutor Shang
is indeed very insightful.

40
00:02:29,144 --> 00:02:29,904
Your Majesty.

41
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:33,304
Tutor Shang
also pointed out in his essay

42
00:02:33,584 --> 00:02:34,584
that if one is an official,

43
00:02:35,265 --> 00:02:36,945
their descendants and relatives

44
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,024
can all become officials with ease.

45
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,584
In the worst case,
there will be free riders

46
00:02:41,904 --> 00:02:42,665
acting with impunity.

47
00:02:46,225 --> 00:02:46,985
Your Majesty.

48
00:02:47,864 --> 00:02:50,105
Even a teacher who isn't a court official

49
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,945
knows the harms
of the Protected Appointments System.

50
00:02:52,704 --> 00:02:53,825
But those court officials

51
00:02:54,665 --> 00:02:57,144
are afraid to speak up as they fear
the power of the noble families.

52
00:02:57,904 --> 00:03:00,665
This shows that the powers
of the noble families have been a scourge.

53
00:03:03,144 --> 00:03:04,265
If they are not removed soon,

54
00:03:04,945 --> 00:03:06,385
the nation's foundation might be harmed.

55
00:03:17,624 --> 00:03:18,304
Jinghong.

56
00:03:19,024 --> 00:03:20,385
Why are you suddenly on your knees?

57
00:03:21,385 --> 00:03:22,144
Quickly get up.

58
00:03:24,065 --> 00:03:24,985
I know

59
00:03:25,864 --> 00:03:27,785
you are concerned
for the sake of Southern Chen.

60
00:03:28,785 --> 00:03:31,424
The Protected Appointments System
has indeed become a threat.

61
00:03:32,744 --> 00:03:34,105
It cannot be condoned any further.

62
00:03:35,505 --> 00:03:36,304
That is very wise, Your Majesty.

63
00:04:03,304 --> 00:04:05,825
You need to hold your breath
and concentrate when you shoot an arrow.

64
00:04:06,144 --> 00:04:07,144
You cannot be distracted.

65
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:17,105
As expected from Mr. Jinghong
who outperformed Yemu Jing.

66
00:04:17,744 --> 00:04:18,824
You have excellent archery skills.

67
00:04:26,744 --> 00:04:27,665
That was rude of me.

68
00:04:32,384 --> 00:04:33,145
It's alright.

69
00:04:50,944 --> 00:04:51,665
You did well.

70
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:53,345
I shall make a toast to you with tea

71
00:04:53,744 --> 00:04:54,545
instead of wine.

72
00:05:05,025 --> 00:05:06,025
The tea has a strong aroma.

73
00:05:06,585 --> 00:05:08,905
But it has a refreshing taste
like the green mountains.

74
00:05:09,744 --> 00:05:10,504
That's right.

75
00:05:11,424 --> 00:05:12,145
Sit.

76
00:05:21,785 --> 00:05:22,905
I get to come here

77
00:05:23,465 --> 00:05:25,025
and enjoy a moment of peace
from the chaos.

78
00:05:26,705 --> 00:05:27,905
But there are still
many people in Southern Chen

79
00:05:29,345 --> 00:05:32,424
who are struggling in the mire.

80
00:05:33,184 --> 00:05:34,025
Not to worry, Your Highness.

81
00:05:34,705 --> 00:05:36,145
The proposal has highlighted

82
00:05:36,424 --> 00:05:37,824
problems of the system.

83
00:05:38,384 --> 00:05:39,145
Now,

84
00:05:39,304 --> 00:05:40,944
it has caused a great stir

85
00:05:41,105 --> 00:05:42,225
among grassroots scholars.

86
00:05:42,905 --> 00:05:44,465
His Majesty is also aware of it

87
00:05:44,705 --> 00:05:46,585
and thinks the essay is substantial.

88
00:05:47,585 --> 00:05:50,304
If so, we will be able
to accomplish our plan.

89
00:05:50,864 --> 00:05:52,585
Shang Shou, the author of this essay,

90
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:54,624
is the teacher of Mu Zhuohua.

91
00:05:56,345 --> 00:05:57,705
Shang Shou and Mu Zhuohua seemed to be

92
00:05:58,545 --> 00:06:00,145
more than just teacher and disciple.

93
00:06:00,705 --> 00:06:02,384
They are more like father and daughter.

94
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:06,504
Since Shang Shou has become
the leader in supporting the abolition

95
00:06:06,504 --> 00:06:07,905
of the Protected Appointments System,

96
00:06:08,705 --> 00:06:11,145
we don't have to worry
about Mu Zhuohua not being on board.

97
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,424
(Eradicating Corruption Proposal,
Part One, Shang Shou)

98
00:06:16,424 --> 00:06:18,905
This essay was written by Mr. Shang
in his early years.

99
00:06:19,705 --> 00:06:21,985
Now, it's being publicized and spread.

100
00:06:22,864 --> 00:06:26,345
I wonder if someone
is doing this deliberately.

101
00:06:28,225 --> 00:06:30,545
Mr. Shang is sharp-tongued,

102
00:06:31,345 --> 00:06:33,905
but he would never offend anyone.

103
00:06:37,225 --> 00:06:39,785
I think their target isn't Tutor Shang

104
00:06:41,504 --> 00:06:42,545
but you.

105
00:06:47,225 --> 00:06:48,944
Mr. Shang got dragged into this
because of me.

106
00:06:50,304 --> 00:06:50,944
My Lord.

107
00:06:56,304 --> 00:06:57,225
Don't worry.

108
00:06:58,345 --> 00:07:00,145
I will send He Xin to Jiangnan
with his squad

109
00:07:00,424 --> 00:07:01,424
to protect Tutor Shang.

110
00:07:03,025 --> 00:07:03,944
Thank you, My Lord.

111
00:07:06,424 --> 00:07:07,184
Old Master.

112
00:07:07,545 --> 00:07:09,264
The writer of the proposal, Shang Shou,

113
00:07:09,585 --> 00:07:11,985
is from Yongding County
in Huaizhou, Jiangnan.

114
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,105
Huaizhou?

115
00:07:15,264 --> 00:07:15,944
Yes.

116
00:07:20,824 --> 00:07:22,824
This darn
Eradicating Corruption Proposal.

117
00:07:23,264 --> 00:07:24,665
Darn you, Shang Shou.

118
00:07:25,705 --> 00:07:28,705
How dare you stir trouble
in the Sun family's territory!

119
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:30,504
Go.

120
00:07:30,744 --> 00:07:31,424
Bring a few men.

121
00:07:32,064 --> 00:07:35,225
Give him a good warning.

122
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:36,424
Yes, Old Master.

123
00:07:36,744 --> 00:07:37,545
I'll see to that at once.

124
00:08:08,944 --> 00:08:09,785
Look at that bend.

125
00:08:10,105 --> 00:08:11,785
It must be a big fish.

126
00:08:20,345 --> 00:08:20,944
Ouch, my hand.

127
00:08:33,105 --> 00:08:34,144
Young man.

128
00:08:36,024 --> 00:08:37,384
I guess

129
00:08:38,864 --> 00:08:42,185
you aren't here to fish, are you?

130
00:08:44,504 --> 00:08:46,305
You didn't even put the bait.

131
00:08:56,225 --> 00:08:59,384
I work for Official Sun Ru,
the Minister of Works.

132
00:09:00,705 --> 00:09:02,945
He sent me to warn you.

133
00:09:03,465 --> 00:09:06,624
If you still can't
watch over your mouth,

134
00:09:08,985 --> 00:09:10,105
then the next time I am here,

135
00:09:10,585 --> 00:09:13,185
I won't just be accompanying you.

136
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,110
(Eradicating Corruption Proposal)

137
00:09:34,345 --> 00:09:35,185
It turns out

138
00:09:36,105 --> 00:09:38,065
that I was the bait.

139
00:10:02,624 --> 00:10:05,144
Alright. That's all for today.

140
00:10:05,425 --> 00:10:06,185
Go home.

141
00:10:06,504 --> 00:10:08,425
Goodbye, sir.

142
00:10:08,504 --> 00:10:09,585
Goodbye.

143
00:10:09,904 --> 00:10:10,504
Alright.

144
00:10:12,585 --> 00:10:14,144
All of you must remember

145
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,504
to study hard,

146
00:10:17,024 --> 00:10:19,264
especially you girls.

147
00:10:20,585 --> 00:10:22,825
If you want to live a different life

148
00:10:23,024 --> 00:10:24,384
and get out of the house,

149
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,105
you must study hard

150
00:10:26,185 --> 00:10:27,305
and pass the examination.

151
00:10:27,504 --> 00:10:28,465
I will, sir.

152
00:10:29,465 --> 00:10:31,664
It is a big world out there.

153
00:10:33,384 --> 00:10:34,105
Sir.

154
00:10:34,544 --> 00:10:35,945
What's wrong with you today?

155
00:10:36,144 --> 00:10:38,144
Whenever classes were over,

156
00:10:38,425 --> 00:10:40,105
you would run faster than a rabbit.

157
00:10:40,945 --> 00:10:42,985
But today,
you are seeing us out at the entrance.

158
00:10:43,105 --> 00:10:44,225
That's so strange.

159
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:45,664
You rascal!

160
00:10:46,225 --> 00:10:47,425
You naughty little thing.

161
00:10:47,904 --> 00:10:50,664
Use that intelligence
in your studies from now on.

162
00:10:50,904 --> 00:10:51,624
Isn't it better?

163
00:10:51,945 --> 00:10:52,664
Go home.

164
00:10:53,825 --> 00:10:54,945
That's more like you, sir.

165
00:10:55,425 --> 00:10:56,105
Scram!

166
00:10:56,425 --> 00:10:57,825
See you tomorrow, sir.

167
00:10:59,105 --> 00:10:59,705
Goodbye, sir.

168
00:10:59,904 --> 00:11:00,705
Goodbye.

169
00:11:19,864 --> 00:11:21,384
Go on.

170
00:11:22,465 --> 00:11:23,825
All of you should leave.

171
00:11:26,544 --> 00:11:28,345
I should leave, too.

172
00:12:30,264 --> 00:12:32,345
If that old geezer finds out

173
00:12:32,425 --> 00:12:33,744
that I dreamed of him,

174
00:12:33,985 --> 00:12:35,305
he is going to be so delighted.

175
00:12:42,864 --> 00:12:45,585
Old geezer, why aren't you fishing today?

176
00:12:54,544 --> 00:12:55,425
Old geezer!

177
00:12:59,144 --> 00:12:59,864
Young Lady.

178
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:03,544
Young Lady, what's wrong?

179
00:13:05,105 --> 00:13:05,825
Juli.

180
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:07,544
I dreamed of Mr. Shang.

181
00:13:08,144 --> 00:13:08,904
Mr. Shang?

182
00:13:09,305 --> 00:13:10,624
What happened to him?

183
00:13:14,185 --> 00:13:15,784
Young Lady, are you alright?

184
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:45,825
Coming.

185
00:13:48,624 --> 00:13:49,384
My Lord.

186
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:56,264
My Lord.

187
00:13:56,945 --> 00:13:59,105
So? Do you have news about Mr. Shang?

188
00:14:00,744 --> 00:14:03,144
The Falcon Squad
sent news from Jiangnan.

189
00:14:03,825 --> 00:14:05,305
They have found Tutor Shang.

190
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:07,185
How is he?

191
00:14:09,904 --> 00:14:11,144
Tutor Shang...

192
00:14:15,864 --> 00:14:16,624
He has passed away.

193
00:15:02,864 --> 00:15:03,985
He has passed away?

194
00:15:15,105 --> 00:15:16,065
This old man.

195
00:15:18,425 --> 00:15:20,384
How can he leave without caring?

196
00:15:23,744 --> 00:15:25,904
Did he not even leave me any last words?

197
00:15:31,225 --> 00:15:32,065
Although Tutor Shang

198
00:15:33,504 --> 00:15:35,544
did not leave behind any last wishes,

199
00:15:37,065 --> 00:15:38,225
he has always

200
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,864
worried about you the most.

201
00:15:56,345 --> 00:15:57,144
I know.

202
00:15:58,144 --> 00:16:02,185
He didn't want me
to fall under someone's control.

203
00:16:05,624 --> 00:16:06,504
Zhuohua.

204
00:16:08,144 --> 00:16:09,185
Stop blaming yourself.

205
00:17:34,685 --> 00:17:37,235
(Mu's Residence)

206
00:17:50,824 --> 00:17:51,824
As per my investigation,

207
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:54,264
two groups of people
looked for Mr. Shang.

208
00:17:54,985 --> 00:17:56,905
The first group was sent by Sun Ru.

209
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,985
The second group was unknown.

210
00:18:01,425 --> 00:18:02,344
They were

211
00:18:03,344 --> 00:18:04,344
the ones who killed Mr. Shang.

212
00:18:06,225 --> 00:18:08,504
Their purpose was unclear.

213
00:18:09,024 --> 00:18:10,104
But I am assuming

214
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:13,344
it is related
to the essay written by Mr. Shang.

215
00:18:14,504 --> 00:18:15,225
Noted.

216
00:18:17,225 --> 00:18:18,185
Keep investigating.

217
00:18:19,504 --> 00:18:21,584
Be sure to get to the bottom of it.

218
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:23,504
Yes, My Lord.

219
00:18:28,104 --> 00:18:29,185
Two groups of people.

220
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:32,905
Besides the Sun family,

221
00:18:33,304 --> 00:18:34,425
who else can it be?

222
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:42,705
The wind is cold at night.

223
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:44,344
Here.

224
00:18:44,945 --> 00:18:46,385
Warm yourself with some tea.

225
00:18:47,665 --> 00:18:48,304
Your Highness.

226
00:18:48,985 --> 00:18:50,064
Did you hear about it?

227
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,465
Are you referring

228
00:18:55,225 --> 00:18:57,504
to Zhuohua's teacher being murdered?

229
00:19:00,425 --> 00:19:01,264
If only

230
00:19:02,905 --> 00:19:05,264
I hadn't pushed ahead
with the Eradicating Corruption Proposal

231
00:19:06,185 --> 00:19:07,465
and dragged him into this,

232
00:19:08,584 --> 00:19:09,824
this innocent man

233
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:11,544
wouldn't have been killed.

234
00:19:15,705 --> 00:19:16,985
That is the Sun family's sin.

235
00:19:17,385 --> 00:19:18,425
It has nothing to do with you.

236
00:19:20,705 --> 00:19:21,625
However,

237
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,264
if Shang Shou hadn't died,

238
00:19:24,945 --> 00:19:27,584
it would have been hard for us
to make our next move.

239
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:32,784
Why do you say so?

240
00:19:35,584 --> 00:19:37,385
Mu Zhuohua has been hesitant

241
00:19:37,865 --> 00:19:39,665
about going against noble families.

242
00:19:41,145 --> 00:19:42,665
Now that Shang Shou has been killed,

243
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:44,665
as his student,

244
00:19:45,705 --> 00:19:47,465
how can she stay silent?

245
00:19:49,185 --> 00:19:50,465
I suppose you know

246
00:19:51,264 --> 00:19:52,385
what we have to do next.

247
00:19:53,544 --> 00:19:55,744
But Shang Shou was just murdered.

248
00:19:56,705 --> 00:19:58,425
Do we have to be so eager

249
00:19:58,824 --> 00:20:00,225
to make an issue of his death?

250
00:20:01,024 --> 00:20:02,945
We must proceed
with the abolition of the system.

251
00:20:03,064 --> 00:20:04,504
We have no time to waste.

252
00:20:05,544 --> 00:20:07,104
Don't you want
to root out noble families

253
00:20:07,304 --> 00:20:08,064
and give grassroots scholars

254
00:20:08,064 --> 00:20:09,665
a world to shine?

255
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:14,784
Besides, the imperial court

256
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:16,945
is a dog-eat-dog world.

257
00:20:18,024 --> 00:20:20,145
Since you have chosen this path,
you should be aware

258
00:20:20,945 --> 00:20:23,905
that you often don't have a choice.

259
00:20:32,504 --> 00:20:35,385
(She never believed in Buddhism.)

260
00:20:37,064 --> 00:20:40,064
(I pray for the benevolence
of the Goddess of Mercy.)

261
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,911
(Please let my teacher, Shang Shou,
ascend to Heaven soon)

262
00:20:43,385 --> 00:20:45,024
(and be free of the world's sufferings.)

263
00:20:46,024 --> 00:20:46,824
Young Lady.

264
00:20:47,385 --> 00:20:49,264
If we let Tutor Shang stay here,

265
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,425
will it disrupt his tranquility?

266
00:20:51,905 --> 00:20:53,744
This is a tranquil place in the city.

267
00:20:55,824 --> 00:20:56,865
He will like it here.

268
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:01,985
Zhuohua, we should go.

269
00:21:10,104 --> 00:21:11,024
Let's go home.

270
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,544
Sir.

271
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,024
I have waited all day.

272
00:21:45,185 --> 00:21:46,784
Why hasn't the fish taken the bait?

273
00:21:50,145 --> 00:21:51,385
Do you know what it means by

274
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:54,985
"where there is a will, there is a way"?

275
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,504
No matter what you do,

276
00:21:58,665 --> 00:22:01,625
you mustn't be in two minds about it.

277
00:22:02,544 --> 00:22:03,945
Imagine doing something

278
00:22:04,145 --> 00:22:05,544
in fits and starts.

279
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,504
How can you

280
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:12,145
accomplish something
without putting in

281
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:13,304
time and effort?

282
00:22:13,784 --> 00:22:15,544
You are right. I will keep that in mind.

283
00:22:22,104 --> 00:22:22,945
Young Lady.

284
00:22:23,344 --> 00:22:24,104
Juli.

285
00:22:26,264 --> 00:22:27,544
Bring me my official robe.

286
00:22:29,584 --> 00:22:30,544
Your official robe?

287
00:22:31,024 --> 00:22:32,584
Mr. Shang died for my sake.

288
00:22:34,264 --> 00:22:35,344
His grievances.

289
00:22:36,784 --> 00:22:37,784
His expectations.

290
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,584
He had placed them all on me.

291
00:22:44,945 --> 00:22:46,744
I mustn't be here
grieving over his death.

292
00:22:49,145 --> 00:22:50,584
I want to see Shen Jinghong.

293
00:22:50,935 --> 00:22:55,710
(Mu's Residence)

294
00:23:18,985 --> 00:23:20,185
About Tutor Shang...

295
00:23:22,544 --> 00:23:23,304
I'm...

296
00:23:23,504 --> 00:23:24,705
I was just about

297
00:23:24,865 --> 00:23:25,865
to see you.

298
00:23:26,784 --> 00:23:29,425
If you need my help with anything,

299
00:23:30,465 --> 00:23:31,304
I am willing to help.

300
00:23:31,945 --> 00:23:33,225
Do you have the bylaws

301
00:23:33,744 --> 00:23:35,504
for the abolition
of the Protected Appointments System?

302
00:23:36,344 --> 00:23:37,425
Are you saying

303
00:23:38,985 --> 00:23:40,064
that you are joining me?

304
00:23:42,264 --> 00:23:43,865
I was once taught to take it slow.

305
00:23:44,665 --> 00:23:47,905
But noble families have operated
in Southern Chen for years.

306
00:23:48,705 --> 00:23:49,584
Now,

307
00:23:50,024 --> 00:23:51,504
they have become like a tumor.

308
00:23:52,344 --> 00:23:54,304
A strong medicine is needed
to cure a serious illness.

309
00:23:55,145 --> 00:23:58,264
I am willing to be the knife

310
00:23:59,264 --> 00:24:00,264
to make the first cut.

311
00:24:02,744 --> 00:24:03,504
Very well.

312
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:07,385
Your Majesty.

313
00:24:08,024 --> 00:24:09,504
Noble families
have pocketed public funds

314
00:24:09,544 --> 00:24:10,584
and taken national treasures,

315
00:24:10,665 --> 00:24:12,625
causing a flood of complaints
from commoners.

316
00:24:12,824 --> 00:24:14,225
This is their first offense.

317
00:24:15,145 --> 00:24:16,225
Ignoring the law.

318
00:24:16,425 --> 00:24:17,425
Disregarding people's lives.

319
00:24:17,945 --> 00:24:19,504
That is their second offense.

320
00:24:20,145 --> 00:24:21,985
Using the Protected Appointments System
as a shield

321
00:24:22,344 --> 00:24:25,104
to help those without virtue and talent
hold a high position,

322
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,225
while those with competence
and knowledge are not appreciated.

323
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:29,985
That is their third offense.

324
00:24:31,465 --> 00:24:32,784
In my opinion,

325
00:24:33,225 --> 00:24:34,304
noble families have committed

326
00:24:34,425 --> 00:24:35,544
a long list of offenses.

327
00:24:36,024 --> 00:24:38,104
In order to appease the people
and correct the law,

328
00:24:38,264 --> 00:24:39,945
we must first get rid of them.

329
00:24:40,064 --> 00:24:41,304
Show the nation

330
00:24:41,385 --> 00:24:42,584
to ease their hearts.

331
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:55,425
Your Majesty.

332
00:24:55,945 --> 00:24:58,425
I think what Official Mu said
is very true.

333
00:24:59,225 --> 00:25:00,544
The Protected Appointments System

334
00:25:00,985 --> 00:25:02,584
has not protected loyal subjects

335
00:25:03,385 --> 00:25:05,665
but pests who feed on the nation
over the years.

336
00:25:07,145 --> 00:25:08,865
There is no making without breaking

337
00:25:08,865 --> 00:25:09,784
or gain without pain.

338
00:25:09,784 --> 00:25:10,945
To get rid of this corruption,

339
00:25:10,985 --> 00:25:11,905
we cannot have mercy.

340
00:25:12,784 --> 00:25:15,104
Please abolish
the Protected Appointments System

341
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:17,865
and remove all free riders
from the imperial court

342
00:25:18,304 --> 00:25:21,024
so that those who are competent
can serve the nation.

343
00:25:23,544 --> 00:25:24,344
Your Majesty.

344
00:25:25,104 --> 00:25:27,784
Doing so might weaken
the nation's foundation.

345
00:25:28,145 --> 00:25:30,985
Official Mu and Official Shen
are acting rashly

346
00:25:31,145 --> 00:25:32,465
without considering the consequences.

347
00:25:33,145 --> 00:25:36,425
Do not blindly listen to them.

348
00:25:36,584 --> 00:25:38,264
Official Zhou is absolutely right.

349
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:41,945
Please consider it carefully
before making a decision.

350
00:25:49,385 --> 00:25:50,584
This is a great matter.

351
00:25:51,465 --> 00:25:52,465
We shall discuss this again.

352
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:54,625
Court adjourned!

353
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:11,584
Do you have orders for me, Your Majesty?

354
00:26:13,024 --> 00:26:14,425
I just heard

355
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,425
about what happened to Tutor Shang.

356
00:26:19,824 --> 00:26:20,665
Are you

357
00:26:21,225 --> 00:26:21,985
alright?

358
00:26:24,465 --> 00:26:25,465
The court is still unstable.

359
00:26:26,264 --> 00:26:28,024
I dare not be careless
towards my health.

360
00:26:30,225 --> 00:26:31,145
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

361
00:26:32,304 --> 00:26:33,985
I will take care of myself

362
00:26:34,665 --> 00:26:37,225
as I wait for the day
justice is prevailed.

363
00:26:38,304 --> 00:26:39,264
I knew

364
00:26:40,584 --> 00:26:42,104
you would definitely pull through.

365
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:49,064
(Department of State Affairs)

366
00:26:49,064 --> 00:26:50,465
You acted sort of rashly today.

367
00:26:54,104 --> 00:26:55,104
Do you think

368
00:26:55,544 --> 00:26:56,665
what I said wasn't true?

369
00:26:57,024 --> 00:26:58,185
You spoke the truth.

370
00:27:00,865 --> 00:27:01,705
But right now,

371
00:27:03,064 --> 00:27:04,385
it is not the best time

372
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:06,304
to have a head-on fight
with the noble families.

373
00:27:07,824 --> 00:27:08,744
As you know,

374
00:27:09,905 --> 00:27:11,945
someone is standing by
and watching the fire.

375
00:27:12,744 --> 00:27:13,985
They have set a trap.

376
00:27:15,304 --> 00:27:15,905
You can't...

377
00:27:15,905 --> 00:27:16,784
Why can't I?

378
00:27:17,104 --> 00:27:18,465
Someone has to do it.

379
00:27:18,584 --> 00:27:19,344
Am I wrong?

380
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:20,504
No.

381
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:23,784
It can't be you.

382
00:27:31,425 --> 00:27:32,985
Still, I should do something.

383
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:39,705
Fine.

384
00:27:42,584 --> 00:27:44,185
You can do whatever you want.

385
00:27:45,185 --> 00:27:46,264
I won't interfere.

386
00:27:48,024 --> 00:27:48,945
Thank you, My Lord.

387
00:27:58,865 --> 00:27:59,584
My Lord.

388
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:01,264
What did Official Mu do

389
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:02,665
to make you so worried?

390
00:28:05,024 --> 00:28:06,104
Did I say something wrong?

391
00:28:07,425 --> 00:28:09,945
Have you forgotten
how you were set on taking revenge

392
00:28:10,465 --> 00:28:12,425
and fighting to the death with Roujia?

393
00:28:13,504 --> 00:28:14,425
My Lord, I...

394
00:28:14,744 --> 00:28:16,784
I was just...

395
00:28:17,344 --> 00:28:18,304
She lost her mother

396
00:28:19,344 --> 00:28:20,544
and wasn't cared for by her father.

397
00:28:21,665 --> 00:28:23,705
Tutor Shang was like her second father.

398
00:28:24,425 --> 00:28:25,344
Anyone who has lost their family

399
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:28,104
would feel devastated

400
00:28:29,145 --> 00:28:30,225
and aggrieved.

401
00:28:31,985 --> 00:28:33,425
Give her some time.

402
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,625
What Zhuohua did was no different

403
00:28:37,744 --> 00:28:39,865
from declaring war
against the noble families.

404
00:28:40,665 --> 00:28:42,425
I'm worried the Sun family
will harm her.

405
00:28:43,705 --> 00:28:44,824
From this moment on,

406
00:28:45,145 --> 00:28:47,385
stay close to her and keep her safe.

407
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:49,425
Yes, My Lord.

408
00:28:54,145 --> 00:28:54,824
Qi.

409
00:28:55,064 --> 00:28:55,784
Qi!

410
00:28:56,824 --> 00:28:57,544
Father.

411
00:28:57,625 --> 00:28:58,465
- Mother.
- Qi.

412
00:28:59,544 --> 00:29:01,945
Listen. Our house has been seized.

413
00:29:02,145 --> 00:29:03,385
I have nowhere to go now.

414
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:05,385
You have to help me.

415
00:29:05,824 --> 00:29:06,865
I'm telling you...

416
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:09,344
Zhijian?

417
00:29:11,665 --> 00:29:12,744
My Lord.

418
00:29:13,504 --> 00:29:14,344
Seeing

419
00:29:14,344 --> 00:29:15,985
that we will be a family in the future,

420
00:29:16,264 --> 00:29:17,145
please help me.

421
00:29:17,504 --> 00:29:19,625
If anything bad happens to me,

422
00:29:20,304 --> 00:29:22,425
you will no longer have a father-in-law.

423
00:29:23,425 --> 00:29:24,185
Mother.

424
00:29:24,705 --> 00:29:27,064
Why did you and Father
come to the capital?

425
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:30,584
It's a long story.

426
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:32,344
What?

427
00:29:33,344 --> 00:29:34,465
Tutor Shang is dead?

428
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,824
Yes.

429
00:29:37,225 --> 00:29:38,264
I heard

430
00:29:38,504 --> 00:29:39,865
that some ruffians broke into his house
late at night.

431
00:29:40,824 --> 00:29:42,544
When the officials arrived the next day,

432
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:43,945
the ground was covered in blood.

433
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:46,945
How awful.

434
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:48,625
This won't do.

435
00:29:49,584 --> 00:29:51,264
We must leave for the capital at once.

436
00:29:52,425 --> 00:29:53,344
The capital?

437
00:29:53,865 --> 00:29:55,985
Why are you so impulsive?

438
00:29:56,865 --> 00:29:59,304
There must be more
to Tutor Shang's death.

439
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:00,865
The next to be targeted

440
00:30:01,264 --> 00:30:02,264
might be our family.

441
00:30:02,985 --> 00:30:03,584
Us?

442
00:30:08,865 --> 00:30:11,264
Seems like I have put you
and Father through trouble.

443
00:30:11,665 --> 00:30:12,824
I suppose you don't know.

444
00:30:13,185 --> 00:30:14,945
Not long ago,
I had conflicts with the Sun family

445
00:30:15,145 --> 00:30:16,905
in the imperial court

446
00:30:17,264 --> 00:30:18,625
due to the abolition
of the Protected Appointments System.

447
00:30:19,145 --> 00:30:21,264
Seems like Sun Ru
dragged the Mu family into this

448
00:30:21,865 --> 00:30:23,304
in order to get revenge on me.

449
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:26,584
What do you mean?

450
00:30:27,264 --> 00:30:28,304
Sun,

451
00:30:28,584 --> 00:30:29,625
that nasty thing!

452
00:30:30,665 --> 00:30:32,465
What a corrupted official.

453
00:30:32,865 --> 00:30:33,784
He has benefited so much

454
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,344
from my family all these years.

455
00:30:36,425 --> 00:30:38,024
What's the use of saying this now?

456
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,500
Qi.

457
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,860
We don't mind losing all our money

458
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,980
as long as we can overcome this crisis.

459
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,740
What are you talking about?

460
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,860
Lose all our money?

461
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,180
Then all my efforts

462
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,540
will go to waste.

463
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,340
What else can we do?

464
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,380
The Mu family has fallen into poverty,

465
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,540
but as long as we are still alive,

466
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,620
we will always get a chance
to start over.

467
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:08,860
Qi.

468
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,860
You are now a court official.

469
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,580
Find a way to help me.

470
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,540
It wasn't easy for me to establish

471
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,620
a family business.

472
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,380
You value money more than your life.

473
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,180
You are just a young girl.

474
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,140
What do you know?

475
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,460
Old Master Mu,
you have been a businessman for years.

476
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,900
You should know
that you can't have your cake

477
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,260
and eat it too.

478
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,140
I can find a way to save your business.

479
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,260
But there's no mercy in the law.

480
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,540
So I cannot guarantee

481
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,460
if I can save your life.

482
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,660
Why, you little...

483
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,220
Qi, I will do as you say.

484
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,860
I will leave it to you.

485
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,220
Dear.

486
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,260
When Lord Ding glared at me earlier,

487
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,860
it was terrifying.

488
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,780
Seriously. This brat.

489
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,420
She didn't show me any respect.

490
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,780
She even said
there's no mercy in the law.

491
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,220
She doesn't care
about her old man at all.

492
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,820
Why didn't you say that earlier?

493
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,420
That's because of

494
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,540
our son-in-law,
who is second only to the Emperor.

495
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,380
How would I dare?

496
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,980
Don't worry about the Mu family.

497
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,380
I will take care of it.

498
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,420
Thank you, My Lord.

499
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,220
But as you said,

500
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,620
it is the Mu family.

501
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,580
I want to handle it myself.

502
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,780
Must you draw a line with me?

503
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,540
If you need me to do anything,

504
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,060
just let me know.

505
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,940
Mu Rong is greedy
for money and personal gains.

506
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,060
He Xin.

507
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,860
Keep a close eye on him.

508
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,540
Don't let him do anything wrong

509
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,260
that can be used against him.

510
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,620
Yes, My Lord.

511
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,860
My Lord, why do you care about him?

512
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,820
He is Zhuohua's father, after all.

513
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,940
I don't want to see what happened
to Tutor Shang happen again.

514
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,100
My Lord.

515
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,980
Official Mu asked you to stay out of it.

516
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,220
Are you really not doing anything?

517
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,900
I trust her.

518
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,660
She will be able to take care of it
in her own way.

519
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,780
(Xuanzheng Hall)

520
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,940
Your Majesty.

521
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,660
Mu Rong disregarded the law

522
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,700
for his personal gain.

523
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,180
He must be condemned
for such immoral conduct.

524
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:02,780
Ministry of Revenue Director, Mu Zhuohua,
condoned her father's abuse of the law.

525
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,220
She is just as guilty.

526
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,700
Ms. Mu.

527
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,540
Mu Rong is your father.

528
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,100
Do you have anything to say?

529
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,940
Your Majesty.

530
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,020
My father is well aware
of his wrongdoings.

531
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,980
He feels ashamed,

532
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,660
looking back on his past actions.

533
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,860
As such,

534
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,820
he has come to the capital
with his wife to plead guilty.

535
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,740
He is now kneeling
before the Capital Governor Hall.

536
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,460
He's just putting on an act.

537
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,980
Who knows if Mu Rong has truly repented?

538
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,660
Your Majesty.

539
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:43,820
My father is willing to hand over
all his property to the treasury

540
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,940
as a gesture of repentance.

541
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,340
He knows it can barely make up
for his wrong actions.

542
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,980
He is willing to obey
the judgments of Your Majesty.

543
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,260
Mu Rong's unlawful act

544
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,300
is indeed outrageous.

545
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,100
However,

546
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,060
since the Mu family
has been charitable for years,

547
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,900
gained merits through disaster relief,

548
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,260
and handed over all their property,

549
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:11,100
I will consider that as atonement
and reduce their punishment.

550
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,980
Mu Rong will be flogged 30 times
as punishment,

551
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,420
while his wife will be imprisoned
with him for ten days

552
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,100
to serve as a warning to others.

553
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,100
Thank you, Your Majesty.

554
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:30,940
Move it.

555
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:31,700
What?

556
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,700
Why?

557
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,380
What for?

558
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:34,740
Move it.

559
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,260
Where are you taking me?

560
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,380
Hurry up.

561
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,820
Where are we going?

562
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:39,740
Dear.

563
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,220
Why?

564
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,540
- Dear.
- My dear!

565
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:42,860
Dear!

566
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,380
Where?

567
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,340
Please have mercy!

568
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,900
Don't kill me!

569
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,580
Please have mercy!

570
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,220
Dear.

571
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,220
Dear.

572
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,820
(Wende Hall)

573
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,900
Due to the abolition
of the Protected Appointments System,

574
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,220
crisis after crisis
has been occurring in the capital,

575
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,900
while court officials
kept stirring trouble.

576
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,940
I have decided
to quickly put an end to this.

577
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,060
I want both of you
to present a bylaw as soon as possible.

578
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,900
Be sure to root out
this tumor in the imperial court.

579
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,100
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

580
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,020
Zhuohua is now in our trap.

581
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,140
We can proceed to the next step.

582
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,580
Since Uncle has put a target
on the Sun family,

583
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,420
why don't we start with them?

584
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:04,820
What's wrong?

585
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,300
Nothing.

586
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,780
I was just

587
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,500
thinking of Mr. Sun.

588
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,420
Sun Yunqian?

589
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,500
Yes.

590
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:22,900
He is indeed different
from other noble scholars.

591
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,860
He has no arrogant
and peremptory manner.

592
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,580
Sun remained pure and untainted.

593
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,300
He is a breath of fresh air
among the noble families.

594
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,420
But dragging him into this movement

595
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,540
is inevitable.

596
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,540
I would like to ask Your Highness

597
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,980
to keep him out of this
when the time comes.

598
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,740
He never had anything to do with this.

599
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,660
And he is your good friend.

600
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,620
I will obviously
leave a way out for him.

601
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,580
In that case,

602
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,220
I shall thank Your Highness in advance.

603
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,300
How do you plan to thank me?

604
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,860
I am at your disposal.

605
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:28,900
Father.

606
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,260
I resigned on your behalf
from your position at the academy.

607
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,460
Take the office
at the Ministry of Works tomorrow.

608
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:38,860
Father.

609
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,820
I like teaching children.

610
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,580
Who are you to decide for me?

611
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,780
Who am I?

612
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,820
I am your father.

613
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,900
You are the eldest son
of the Sun family.

614
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,020
Since you carry the family name,

615
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,380
being an official
and stepping into politics

616
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,100
is the only future you have.

617
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,820
Alright. It is decided.

618
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,180
Take office tomorrow.

619
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:03,940
Fine.

620
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,140
But I'm taking the imperial examination

621
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,860
to enter the Ministry of Works
on my own merits.

622
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,100
You despise the privilege
of protected appointments.

623
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,340
You want to take the exam?

624
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:23,860
Fine.

625
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,260
Go ahead.

626
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,300
But don't forget.

627
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,220
Your family name is Sun.

628
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,300
You have the blood of the Sun family.

629
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,820
No matter how capable you are,

630
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,340
people will still see you

631
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,500
as just a member of the Sun family.

632
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,340
I knew you would be here.

633
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,100
You made it back home.

634
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,980
Did you have fun outside?

635
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,740
There's nothing to be happy about.

636
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,340
They just know

637
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,380
that I didn't get married
to Prince Regent.

638
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,940
They fear I will disgrace the family.

639
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,060
Once I got back, I heard

640
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,740
that you and Father had an argument.

641
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:23,220
What you're trying to do
is just a hopeless endeavor.

642
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,940
Just let it go.

643
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,260
What about you?

644
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,460
You can't let go of Prince Regent.

645
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,780
Isn't that a hopeless endeavor as well?

646
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,220
Prince Regent?

647
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,180
You're right.

648
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,940
He is now Prince Regent.

649
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,380
I can't believe I missed my chance.

650
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,020
As a member of this family,

651
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:08,900
I have to be
the most praiseworthy young lady.

652
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,980
This way, I won't get
a carelessly arranged marriage.

653
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,380
Furthermore,

654
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,940
His Lordship is someone I like.

655
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,860
He is also my best choice.

656
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,580
Why should I give up?

657
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,380
I can't be bothered fighting
to be the best.

658
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,620
I don't care
if you say I'm not ambitious

659
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,180
or call me ungrateful.

660
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,060
I just wish for my family to be safe.

661
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,700
And to be free.
