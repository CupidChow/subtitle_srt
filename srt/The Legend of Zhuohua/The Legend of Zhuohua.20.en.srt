(Adapted from "She Was Once
a Playful Soul" by Sui Yu Er An)

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,940
=Episode 20=

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
(This is a work of fiction.)

20
00:01:49,785 --> 00:01:51,024
Do you really like him?

21
00:01:56,985 --> 00:01:57,705
Yes,

22
00:01:58,345 --> 00:01:59,304
I've fallen for him.

23
00:02:02,345 --> 00:02:03,225
But

24
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:06,744
I can't do that.

25
00:02:08,505 --> 00:02:09,584
Why not?

26
00:02:13,305 --> 00:02:14,144
Sir,

27
00:02:15,544 --> 00:02:16,424
you already know this.

28
00:02:17,384 --> 00:02:18,424
My journey

29
00:02:19,185 --> 00:02:21,905
has been full of twists and turns,
ups and downs.

30
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:24,704
I've endured countless hardships

31
00:02:25,264 --> 00:02:26,704
and overcome many obstacles

32
00:02:27,225 --> 00:02:28,465
to accomplish what I have today.

33
00:02:32,144 --> 00:02:33,264
I'm afraid

34
00:02:34,185 --> 00:02:38,264
that if I allow myself
to fall for Lord Ding,

35
00:02:39,144 --> 00:02:40,465
I'll undo all my previous efforts

36
00:02:42,424 --> 00:02:43,465
and burn my bridges.

37
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:50,465
I've watched you grow up.

38
00:02:51,144 --> 00:02:53,745
Naturally, I understand the hardships

39
00:02:53,905 --> 00:02:56,465
you've faced better than anyone.

40
00:02:57,656 --> 00:03:00,816
But you need to understand one thing.

41
00:03:01,584 --> 00:03:05,065
If you lose yourself
for the sake of love,

42
00:03:05,384 --> 00:03:06,945
then it's the fault of the world,

43
00:03:07,345 --> 00:03:08,505
not yours.

44
00:03:12,864 --> 00:03:14,144
Sir, your words make sense.

45
00:03:15,065 --> 00:03:15,864
But

46
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:20,424
I'm still not capable
of changing the current situation.

47
00:03:23,785 --> 00:03:25,384
I'll bury my feelings for him

48
00:03:26,144 --> 00:03:27,264
deep in my heart

49
00:03:28,345 --> 00:03:29,305
because

50
00:03:30,824 --> 00:03:32,384
I must continue moving forward.

51
00:03:36,285 --> 00:03:43,310
(Fenghua Garden)

52
00:03:45,905 --> 00:03:46,704
Sir,

53
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,911
I

54
00:03:49,785 --> 00:03:50,544
must take my leave now.

55
00:03:50,945 --> 00:03:53,424
Do you have anything else to say to me?

56
00:03:53,905 --> 00:03:55,424
I've said everything
that needs to be said.

57
00:03:55,984 --> 00:03:56,584
Go on.

58
00:03:59,225 --> 00:04:00,384
After I leave this time,

59
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,104
I don't know when I'll be able
to return and visit you again.

60
00:04:06,984 --> 00:04:08,225
If you're having a bad time,

61
00:04:09,104 --> 00:04:10,305
come and visit me in the capital.

62
00:04:10,905 --> 00:04:12,264
I will take good care of you.

63
00:04:15,864 --> 00:04:17,344
Just focus on being a good official,

64
00:04:18,065 --> 00:04:19,305
that's how you'll show
your care and piety to me.

65
00:04:26,464 --> 00:04:27,105
Zhuohua,

66
00:04:28,464 --> 00:04:31,185
I have something to talk to Mr. Shang.

67
00:04:41,784 --> 00:04:42,745
Then I'll take my leave.

68
00:04:43,305 --> 00:04:43,945
Off you go.

69
00:04:53,425 --> 00:04:54,305
Go.

70
00:05:03,144 --> 00:05:03,985
Coincidentally,

71
00:05:04,464 --> 00:05:05,344
I also

72
00:05:05,745 --> 00:05:08,384
have a couple of things
to say to Your Lordship.

73
00:05:09,865 --> 00:05:10,824
Please go ahead.

74
00:05:11,824 --> 00:05:13,105
I can tell

75
00:05:13,665 --> 00:05:15,745
your relationship with Qi
is not ordinary.

76
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:17,745
You should know

77
00:05:18,105 --> 00:05:19,344
that she changed her identity, right?

78
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:21,185
She didn't hide it from me.

79
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:25,464
Qi changed her identity
out of necessity.

80
00:05:26,384 --> 00:05:27,545
When a woman holds an official position,

81
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:29,224
she encounters constraints and limitations
at every turn.

82
00:05:31,185 --> 00:05:32,665
Her unique background

83
00:05:33,264 --> 00:05:36,065
makes her journey even more challenging.

84
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:39,505
You should understand this
better than I do.

85
00:05:43,457 --> 00:05:45,137
Forgive my drunken ramblings.

86
00:05:47,185 --> 00:05:49,305
You treat Qi differently.

87
00:05:50,264 --> 00:05:51,384
This kind of treatment

88
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,784
might be a form of blessing for others.

89
00:05:54,224 --> 00:05:55,384
But for Qi,

90
00:05:56,264 --> 00:06:00,105
it's perhaps more like a shackle.

91
00:06:03,344 --> 00:06:04,904
Do you understand

92
00:06:05,584 --> 00:06:06,464
what I'm trying to imply here?

93
00:06:11,384 --> 00:06:12,784
Thank you for your reminder, Mr. Shang.

94
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,464
I know

95
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:18,904
she has her ambitions.

96
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:24,024
And I will clear the path for her.

97
00:06:26,305 --> 00:06:27,625
I won't let her be held back

98
00:06:28,985 --> 00:06:30,305
because of me.

99
00:06:35,824 --> 00:06:38,425
I'm nearing the end of my life.

100
00:06:39,945 --> 00:06:41,505
It's my greatest fortune

101
00:06:41,865 --> 00:06:43,545
to have met her in this lifetime.

102
00:06:45,264 --> 00:06:48,185
I won't ask for more.

103
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:50,425
Very well, then.

104
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,065
Your words put my mind at ease.

105
00:06:54,185 --> 00:06:56,464
It's also Qi's blessing

106
00:06:56,865 --> 00:06:58,224
to have met you.

107
00:07:01,784 --> 00:07:02,464
You should leave too.

108
00:07:48,745 --> 00:07:49,545
My Lord,

109
00:07:50,584 --> 00:07:54,384
what did Tutor Shang tell you?

110
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:02,665
What did Tutor Shang tell you?

111
00:08:04,425 --> 00:08:05,745
I asked you first.

112
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:18,144
Well...

113
00:08:20,024 --> 00:08:21,384
I won't tell you

114
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:24,665

you're back!

134
00:10:06,545 --> 00:10:07,425
What is it?

135
00:10:08,545 --> 00:10:09,185
Nothing.

136
00:10:10,185 --> 00:10:12,385
Please continue your stroll

00:10:27,945 --> 00:10:28,984
It's getting late.

138
00:10:29,265 --> 00:10:31,864
Have an early rest, My Lord.

139

Your Highness!
Over here, Your Highness!

144
00:11:49,185 --> 00:11:50,864
Your Highness,
we prepared these gifts for you.

145
00:11:50,864 --> 00:11:51,785
Please accept them.

146
00:11:51,785 --> 00:11:52,665
That's right, Your Highness.

147
00:11:52,665 --> 00:11:53,624
It's a token of our appreciation.

148
00:11:53,624 --> 00:11:54,464
Please accept them.

149
00:11:54,744 --> 00:11:56,065
Jiao, just accept them.

150
00:11:56,265 --> 00:11:57,504
They're giving your gifts
out of their kind intention.

151
00:11:58,025 --> 00:12:00,624
That's right. Please accept these gifts.

152
00:12:08,984 --> 00:12:10,665
Chen, don't take this to heart.

153
00:12:11,305 --> 00:12:12,224
They're only...

154
00:12:13,385 --> 00:12:15,224
Jiao, you gave out congee to the hungry.

155
00:12:15,464 --> 00:12:16,624
It's only natural

156
00:12:16,624 --> 00:12:17,665
that they're grateful.

157
00:12:18,584 --> 00:12:20,385
I just provided some rice and grains.

158
00:12:20,864 --> 00:12:21,824
You and Zhuohua

159
00:12:21,945 --> 00:12:24,065
were the ones tirelessly working

160
00:12:24,065 --> 00:12:25,305
for disaster relief.

161
00:12:25,905 --> 00:12:27,344
I truly feel undeserving.

162
00:12:27,744 --> 00:12:28,864
Jiao, I beg to differ.

163
00:12:29,185 --> 00:12:30,665
We've both done it for the country
and the people.

164
00:12:35,305 --> 00:12:35,945
Official Mu.

165
00:12:39,905 --> 00:12:41,025
You must be elated

166
00:12:41,464 --> 00:12:42,584
to see the people
being this happy, right?

167
00:12:43,065 --> 00:12:44,305
The people of Yongding County

168
00:12:44,425 --> 00:12:45,824
have successfully overcome the disaster.

169
00:12:46,545 --> 00:12:49,065
The greedy and corrupt Zhuang Wenfeng
has been caught.

170
00:12:49,704 --> 00:12:51,864
What could be more gratifying than this?

171
00:12:54,265 --> 00:12:56,464
It is indeed a joyful occasion

172
00:12:57,104 --> 00:12:58,224
that Yongding County is back on track.

173
00:12:58,744 --> 00:12:59,145
Yes.

174
00:12:59,658 --> 00:13:00,658
But...

175
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:05,145
What is it, Shen?

176
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:08,224
Earlier, the First Prince instructed me

177
00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:10,104
to investigate
Zhuang Wenfeng's background.

178
00:13:10,945 --> 00:13:13,224
Care to guess how he obtained
his official position?

179
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:16,984
Shen, stop the suspense.

180
00:13:18,584 --> 00:13:21,025
He's the assistant of Imperial Censor,
Zhuang Zixian's nephew.

181
00:13:21,624 --> 00:13:23,464
His father was a high-ranking official.

182
00:13:24,464 --> 00:13:25,425
After his father's death,

183
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,344
he was granted this position
through the connection.

184
00:13:27,984 --> 00:13:29,065
Despite his mediocrity,

185
00:13:29,704 --> 00:13:31,185
he secured a good job position.

186
00:13:32,265 --> 00:13:34,704
I'm afraid apprehending Zhuang Wenfeng

187
00:13:35,504 --> 00:13:36,385
may not be an end,

188
00:13:37,104 --> 00:13:38,265
but a beginning.

189
00:13:44,864 --> 00:13:45,624
It doesn't matter.

190
00:13:46,185 --> 00:13:48,504
We'll face whatever comes our way.

191
00:13:48,945 --> 00:13:51,984
After all, anything and everything
that begins has to come to an end.

192
00:13:55,265 --> 00:13:57,265
Official Mu, you're right.

193
00:14:02,405 --> 00:14:04,648
(Zhuang's Residence)

194
00:14:09,025 --> 00:14:12,025
My son has been taken to the capital.

195
00:14:12,545 --> 00:14:13,704
You useless fool!

196
00:14:13,704 --> 00:14:15,584
What do I need you for?

197
00:14:17,864 --> 00:14:20,385
If anything happens to my son,

198
00:14:21,385 --> 00:14:22,624
you can

199
00:14:22,785 --> 00:14:23,385
just be prepared

200
00:14:23,385 --> 00:14:25,185
to be buried with him!

201
00:14:25,504 --> 00:14:27,385
Mother-in-law, please calm down.

202
00:14:28,145 --> 00:14:30,824
Mu Zhuohua may have Lord Ding
as her support,

203
00:14:31,624 --> 00:14:33,545
but I know her secret.

204
00:14:33,905 --> 00:14:35,584
You?

205
00:14:36,104 --> 00:14:36,905
Mother-in-law,

206
00:14:37,104 --> 00:14:40,065
Mu Zhuohua is the Zhuang family's
runaway concubine.

207
00:14:40,425 --> 00:14:42,104
We even exchanged
an engagement letter before.

208
00:14:42,425 --> 00:14:43,864
How can she deserve an official position

209
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:44,984
after she's done such an improper thing?

210
00:14:45,624 --> 00:14:46,464
Why?

211
00:14:47,185 --> 00:14:48,945
Why does she get her way?

212
00:14:49,385 --> 00:14:50,545
How could she throw her weight around

213
00:14:50,945 --> 00:14:52,385
and make me utterly miserable?

214
00:14:53,145 --> 00:14:53,785
I...

215
00:14:54,824 --> 00:14:57,945
I'm going to make her pay.

216
00:14:59,984 --> 00:15:01,744
What are you planning to do?

217
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:09,785
I will go to the capital
and strike the Dengwen Drum.

218
00:15:10,425 --> 00:15:11,785
I'm going to sue Mu Zhuohua!

219
00:15:23,704 --> 00:15:24,425
Juli!

220
00:15:25,704 --> 00:15:26,425
Young Lady!

221
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:27,905
Young Lady!

222
00:15:29,185 --> 00:15:30,785
Young Lady, you're finally back.

223
00:15:30,785 --> 00:15:31,984
I missed you so much.

224
00:15:31,984 --> 00:15:33,065
I missed you too.

225
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,065
It's my fault.

226
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:34,984
Next time,

227
00:15:34,984 --> 00:15:36,104
I'll never leave you alone at home

228
00:15:36,104 --> 00:15:37,464
for so long again.

229
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:41,344
Young Lady, this is...

230
00:15:42,704 --> 00:15:43,984
It's my mother's ashes.

231
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:45,305
I brought them back.

232
00:15:48,025 --> 00:15:49,025
Third Madam,

233
00:15:49,344 --> 00:15:51,344
Young Lady has finally brought you back.

234
00:15:51,905 --> 00:15:53,984
This place will be our home from now on.

235
00:15:54,385 --> 00:15:56,224
Our days will get better and better.

236
00:15:57,305 --> 00:15:57,984
That's for sure.

237
00:15:58,065 --> 00:16:00,104
Our days must get better and better.

238
00:16:00,785 --> 00:16:02,065
Young Lady, you must be exhausted.

239
00:16:02,065 --> 00:16:03,145
Hurry inside and get some rest.

240
00:16:03,145 --> 00:16:03,984
I'll go and carry the luggage.

241
00:16:03,984 --> 00:16:04,864
Okay, go ahead.

242
00:16:27,864 --> 00:16:28,665
Mother,

243
00:16:30,344 --> 00:16:31,385
can you see this?

244
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:34,744
You're home now.

245
00:16:36,905 --> 00:16:38,224
I've brought you home.

246
00:17:10,264 --> 00:17:11,264
Qi,

247
00:17:12,145 --> 00:17:13,784
this is my home.

248
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,224
Look at this apricot tree.

249
00:17:17,264 --> 00:17:18,145
Isn't it beautiful?

250
00:17:23,185 --> 00:17:26,585
In spring, it's full of apricot blossoms
on its branches.

251
00:17:27,825 --> 00:17:30,905
In summer, red apricots adorn its tips.

252
00:18:00,464 --> 00:18:01,345
Earlier,

253
00:18:02,744 --> 00:18:04,945
I had someone choose an auspicious time
for her burial.

254
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:10,391
I also picked a burial site
with excellent feng shui.

255
00:18:11,945 --> 00:18:12,744
Tomorrow,

256
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,425
I'll accompany you
to put your mother to rest in peace.

257
00:18:18,385 --> 00:18:19,264
Thank you, My Lord.

258
00:18:22,984 --> 00:18:23,744
My mother

259
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,784
was trapped in the Mu's Residence

260
00:18:28,905 --> 00:18:29,984
for most of her life.

261
00:18:31,064 --> 00:18:32,625
She always wanted
to break free from destiny.

262
00:18:34,784 --> 00:18:35,905
But in the end,

263
00:18:38,264 --> 00:18:39,504
she couldn't escape it

264
00:18:41,185 --> 00:18:42,345
even after she traded her life.

265
00:18:47,984 --> 00:18:48,744
Now,

266
00:18:49,784 --> 00:18:50,945
it was you

267
00:18:51,945 --> 00:18:53,185
who helped her overcome her fate.

268
00:19:03,064 --> 00:19:03,905
Mother,

269
00:19:05,304 --> 00:19:06,585
you were right.

270
00:19:07,665 --> 00:19:09,224
You said that if a woman studies,

271
00:19:10,304 --> 00:19:11,544
there will be a way out for her.

272
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,544
(Mu's Residence)

273
00:19:22,544 --> 00:19:23,425
Zhimo?

274
00:19:23,784 --> 00:19:24,784
It's really you.

275
00:19:24,945 --> 00:19:25,544
I'm back.

276
00:19:25,984 --> 00:19:27,145
You're finally back.

277
00:19:27,504 --> 00:19:29,224
Why didn't you tell me before you left?

278
00:19:29,744 --> 00:19:31,385
By the way, where did you go?

279
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:32,464
Have you eaten?

280
00:19:32,865 --> 00:19:34,345
You... You're not injured, right?

281
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,425
I didn't have time to tell you.

282
00:19:35,945 --> 00:19:36,905
We went to Jiangnan.

283
00:19:37,585 --> 00:19:38,345
I haven't eaten.

284
00:19:39,064 --> 00:19:39,704
I'm not injured.

285
00:19:40,744 --> 00:19:42,464
Luckily, you came back safe and sound.

286
00:19:47,064 --> 00:19:48,185
You have delicious snacks.

287
00:19:54,464 --> 00:19:55,024
By the way,

288
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:56,784
why don't you have one?

289
00:20:01,544 --> 00:20:02,224
Is it good?

290
00:20:02,385 --> 00:20:02,984
Yes.

291
00:20:06,185 --> 00:20:06,744
Oh?

292
00:20:09,024 --> 00:20:10,345
I thought you didn't like sweet things.

293
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,593
(It's fortunate that you've reconciled
with Lord Ding.)

294
00:20:15,704 --> 00:20:16,704
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to enjoy

295
00:20:16,704 --> 00:20:18,064
such delicious pig's trotters again.

296
00:20:18,544 --> 00:20:19,585
Try the chicken wings.

297
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:21,825
Look at you.

298
00:20:22,024 --> 00:20:23,105
A few mouthfuls of food

299
00:20:23,105 --> 00:20:24,264
and you're taking his side.

300
00:20:25,304 --> 00:20:26,784
Young Lady, why are you judging me

301
00:20:27,345 --> 00:20:28,224
when you're the same?

302
00:20:28,665 --> 00:20:29,704
A few mouthfuls of food

303
00:20:30,024 --> 00:20:31,385
and you're staying next door
for the meal.

304
00:20:31,504 --> 00:20:33,345
I even made so much delicious food
waiting for you here.

305
00:20:34,504 --> 00:20:36,544
Lord Ding saved my life.

306
00:20:37,064 --> 00:20:38,224
I couldn't bring myself to reject him

307
00:20:38,385 --> 00:20:39,504
when he invited me for dinner.

308
00:20:40,425 --> 00:20:41,945
Young Lady, are you injured?

309
00:20:42,425 --> 00:20:43,544
Are your injuries serious?

310
00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:45,224
I'm fine, no need to worry.

311
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:47,504
It was Lord Ding

312
00:20:47,825 --> 00:20:48,784
who got seriously injured

313
00:20:48,865 --> 00:20:50,145
while trying to save me.

314
00:20:50,865 --> 00:20:51,704
You scared me half to death.

315
00:20:53,464 --> 00:20:54,185
Eat slowly.

316
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:55,471
By the way, Young Lady,

317
00:20:56,105 --> 00:20:58,345
Lord Ding sure has a streak of bad luck.

318
00:20:59,105 --> 00:21:01,825
First, he got injured in Jiangnan
while saving you.

319
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:04,304
Now, someone filed a complaint against him
in the capital.

320
00:21:05,425 --> 00:21:06,304
A complaint?

321
00:21:06,504 --> 00:21:07,585
What do you mean?

322
00:21:09,064 --> 00:21:10,105
I'm not too sure.

323
00:21:10,224 --> 00:21:11,464
Zhimo told me.

324
00:21:12,185 --> 00:21:14,145
It seems Lord Ding left the capital
without permission.

325
00:21:14,784 --> 00:21:16,784
Many people went to His Majesty
to complain about him.

326
00:21:18,264 --> 00:21:19,945
He was impeached
because he left the capital

327
00:21:20,744 --> 00:21:21,625
without permission?

328
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:23,865
Yes, that's the word Zhimo used.

329
00:21:25,345 --> 00:21:26,504
These gossipmongers.

330
00:21:26,704 --> 00:21:27,945
They sure have nothing better to do.

331
00:21:28,145 --> 00:21:29,385
Are they the only ones who can complain?

332
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:32,224
Tomorrow morning,
I'll seek an audience with His Majesty

333
00:21:32,784 --> 00:21:34,064
and put this false accusation to an end.

334
00:21:39,055 --> 00:21:40,264
(Wende Hall)

335
00:21:40,264 --> 00:21:41,905
(Greetings, Your Majesty.)

336
00:21:42,304 --> 00:21:42,984
You may rise.

337
00:21:43,825 --> 00:21:44,784
Thank you, Your Majesty.

338
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,625
Official Mu, what brings you here today?

339
00:21:51,145 --> 00:21:53,665
Your Majesty, I know you're busy,

340
00:21:54,224 --> 00:21:55,784
and I shouldn't trouble you.

341
00:21:56,464 --> 00:21:58,264
But something

342
00:21:58,704 --> 00:22:00,064
has been bothering me.

343
00:22:00,464 --> 00:22:01,665
Thus, I felt compelled to see you.

344
00:22:05,385 --> 00:22:06,224
What's bothering you?

345
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:07,865
I've heard

346
00:22:09,784 --> 00:22:12,024
about the recent accusations
against Lord Ding

347
00:22:12,105 --> 00:22:13,064
for leaving the capital.

348
00:22:13,264 --> 00:22:15,744
Some even claim

349
00:22:15,784 --> 00:22:17,905
he's arrogant and disrespectful
due to his accomplishments.

350
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,224
It's just as you've said.

351
00:22:20,905 --> 00:22:22,145
Almost accurate.

352
00:22:24,064 --> 00:22:25,425
So what are your thoughts
on this matter, Official Mu?

353
00:22:25,984 --> 00:22:26,744
I believe

354
00:22:27,024 --> 00:22:30,345
these memorials are full of nonsense.

355
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:31,264
Oh?

356
00:22:34,304 --> 00:22:35,304
Why do you say that?

357
00:22:36,345 --> 00:22:39,224
Your Majesty, you and Lord Ding
are biological brothers.

358
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,464
Who could understand

359
00:22:41,464 --> 00:22:43,185
Lord Ding's character better than you?

360
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:44,704
To Your Majesty,

361
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,905
his loyalty and sincerity are unmatched.

362
00:22:47,385 --> 00:22:48,304
To his nephew,

363
00:22:48,464 --> 00:22:50,585
his care and guidance are wholehearted.

364
00:22:50,945 --> 00:22:52,145
Even toward his subordinates,

365
00:22:52,464 --> 00:22:53,665
he's fair and understanding,

366
00:22:53,784 --> 00:22:54,825
setting a positive example.

367
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,865
You've always shown great approval
toward Lord Ding.

368
00:23:01,224 --> 00:23:02,984
Yet, these individuals
are spreading malicious words,

369
00:23:03,224 --> 00:23:04,905
trying to incite discord

370
00:23:04,905 --> 00:23:06,825
between Your Majesty
and His Lordship's brotherly affection.

371
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:08,304
So do you have any idea

372
00:23:08,665 --> 00:23:10,784
why they would dare to slander him?

373
00:23:12,145 --> 00:23:13,665
They criticize and defame him

374
00:23:14,425 --> 00:23:16,345
only because they fear and envy him.

375
00:23:22,385 --> 00:23:23,825
It's exactly as you said.

376
00:23:24,304 --> 00:23:26,825
I know Lord Ding's character
and personality very well.

377
00:23:27,504 --> 00:23:29,224
That's why I've already rejected

378
00:23:29,504 --> 00:23:31,504
all these impeachments made against him.

379
00:23:35,345 --> 00:23:36,345
Your Majesty is indeed wise.

380
00:23:37,464 --> 00:23:39,304
If I knew, I...

381
00:23:39,865 --> 00:23:40,585
I

382
00:23:40,784 --> 00:23:41,224
would...

383
00:23:42,984 --> 00:23:45,585
Your willingness to do so
is truly rare and admirable.

384
00:23:46,665 --> 00:23:47,905
If Lord Ding knows,

385
00:23:48,544 --> 00:23:50,145
he would be very pleased.

386
00:23:51,145 --> 00:23:52,185
Your Majesty,

387
00:23:52,504 --> 00:23:54,224
I shall take my leave, then.

388
00:24:18,632 --> 00:24:22,089
(Mingde Gate)

389
00:24:38,585 --> 00:24:41,224
Someone has struck the Dengwen Drum?

390
00:24:41,544 --> 00:24:42,665
Dengwen Drum?

391
00:24:43,784 --> 00:24:45,264
How many grievances did one endure

392
00:24:45,825 --> 00:24:47,290
to willingly bear 30 floggings

393
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:47,945
to strike the drum?

394
00:24:48,744 --> 00:24:49,544
Hurry up and see

395
00:24:50,185 --> 00:24:52,425
who's striking the drum
and what grievance to address.

396
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:54,264
Yes, Your Majesty.

397
00:25:01,464 --> 00:25:02,905
Do you know
you have to receive 30 floggings

398
00:25:03,024 --> 00:25:03,945
before meeting His Majesty

399
00:25:03,945 --> 00:25:05,464
after you strike this drum?

400
00:25:07,704 --> 00:25:08,784
I know.

401
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:12,185
Eight!

402
00:25:14,544 --> 00:25:15,185
Nine!

403
00:25:17,304 --> 00:25:17,984
Ten!

404
00:25:22,345 --> 00:25:23,224
Eleven!

405
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:25,905
Twelve!

406
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:28,145
Thirteen!

407
00:25:28,585 --> 00:25:29,304
(What?)

408
00:25:29,585 --> 00:25:30,945
She would rather endure 30 floggings

409
00:25:31,064 --> 00:25:32,224
just to accuse me?

410
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:34,464
What is she up to?

411
00:25:35,105 --> 00:25:37,105
Official Mu, you just returned
from Jiangnan

412
00:25:37,264 --> 00:25:38,984
and can't even rest peacefully.

413
00:25:39,544 --> 00:25:41,464
But now, His Majesty summons you.

414
00:25:41,784 --> 00:25:42,464
Official Mu,

415
00:25:43,665 --> 00:25:44,385
please come with me.

416
00:25:44,825 --> 00:25:45,744
Miss Eighth...

417
00:25:46,064 --> 00:25:46,504
She...

418
00:25:46,784 --> 00:25:48,304
How could she accuse us
when she's the evildoer?

419
00:25:49,105 --> 00:25:49,905
Young Lady,

420
00:25:50,264 --> 00:25:51,504
what should we do now?

421
00:25:52,585 --> 00:25:53,544
What should we do?

422
00:25:54,105 --> 00:25:54,905
Just change into the court attire.

423
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:56,224
I will go to the Xuanzheng Hall

424
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,264
and confront her head-on.

425
00:25:59,464 --> 00:26:00,185
I

426
00:26:01,024 --> 00:26:01,984
respectfully greet Your Majesty.

427
00:26:02,665 --> 00:26:04,264
Who is kneeling?

428
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:06,945
What grievance do you wish to report?

429
00:26:07,865 --> 00:26:11,865
I'm Madam Mu, wife of Zhuang Wenfeng,
Yongding County's county magistrate.

430
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:17,024
I want to accuse someone.

431
00:26:17,865 --> 00:26:19,704
This person is guilty of embezzlement,
abusing power,

432
00:26:20,304 --> 00:26:21,345
condoning acts of violence,

433
00:26:21,744 --> 00:26:22,825
oppressing innocent people,

434
00:26:22,984 --> 00:26:24,185
and committing all kinds of evil deeds!

435
00:26:34,665 --> 00:26:35,704
Zhuang Wenfeng?

436
00:26:37,865 --> 00:26:38,665
Zhuang Zixian.

437
00:26:44,105 --> 00:26:44,825
Yes, Your Majesty.

438
00:26:45,665 --> 00:26:46,945
Who is this Zhuang Wenfeng to you?

439
00:26:47,665 --> 00:26:48,385
(Zhuang Zixian)
Your Majesty,

440
00:26:48,385 --> 00:26:48,865
(Zhuang Zixian)
(Assistant of Imperial Censor of Southern Chen)

441
00:26:48,865 --> 00:26:51,464
(Assistant of Imperial Censor of Southern Chen)
Zhuang Wenfeng is my nephew.

442
00:26:52,665 --> 00:26:53,345
Your Majesty,

443
00:26:53,784 --> 00:26:55,504
as Madam Mu stated,

444
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:58,585
my nephew is innocent.

445
00:26:59,185 --> 00:26:59,905
Now,

446
00:27:00,297 --> 00:27:03,057
Madam Mu struck the Dengwen Drum

447
00:27:03,825 --> 00:27:06,145
to seek justice for her husband.

448
00:27:09,704 --> 00:27:10,504
Madam Mu,

449
00:27:11,345 --> 00:27:13,385
you're now at Xuanzheng Hall,

450
00:27:13,825 --> 00:27:15,024
please speak sensibly

451
00:27:16,224 --> 00:27:18,264
before me.

452
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:21,064
Yes, Your Majesty.

453
00:27:22,185 --> 00:27:24,105
I'm risking my life today

454
00:27:24,825 --> 00:27:26,304
to seek justice!

455
00:27:29,145 --> 00:27:30,145
The people

456
00:27:31,905 --> 00:27:32,825
I want to accuse today

457
00:27:37,704 --> 00:27:40,024
are County Magistrate Zhuang Wenfeng

458
00:27:40,185 --> 00:27:42,905
and Imperial Censor Zhuang Zixian!

459
00:27:44,064 --> 00:27:44,784
You!

460
00:27:45,945 --> 00:27:48,264
What nonsense are you spouting?

461
00:27:48,984 --> 00:27:49,544
Insolence!

462
00:27:51,064 --> 00:27:52,185
How dare you behave insolently

463
00:27:52,665 --> 00:27:53,665
in the presence of His Majesty?

464
00:27:58,905 --> 00:27:59,704
Madam Mu,

465
00:28:00,385 --> 00:28:02,945
Zhuang Wenfeng and Zhuang Zixian
are appointed officials of the court.

466
00:28:03,544 --> 00:28:04,544
Do you have evidence

467
00:28:04,825 --> 00:28:05,625
to accuse them?

468
00:28:06,064 --> 00:28:06,865
I have it.

469
00:28:19,984 --> 00:28:21,185
This ledger

470
00:28:21,504 --> 00:28:24,064
contains records
of Zhuang Wenfeng's bribery

471
00:28:24,464 --> 00:28:25,945
and corruption in Yongding County.

472
00:28:26,185 --> 00:28:27,024
Other than this,

473
00:28:27,185 --> 00:28:29,064
he colluded with wealthy merchants,
released counterfeited currency,

474
00:28:29,064 --> 00:28:30,945
destroyed families, seized land,

475
00:28:31,145 --> 00:28:32,425
committed murder and arson.

476
00:28:33,665 --> 00:28:34,145
No, no, no!

477
00:28:34,544 --> 00:28:35,145
Your Majesty,

478
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:37,464
Zhuang Wenfeng is just my nephew.

479
00:28:37,704 --> 00:28:39,905
I did not know this matter.

480
00:28:40,024 --> 00:28:41,984
I'm innocent!

481
00:28:42,105 --> 00:28:43,264
This ledger

482
00:28:43,464 --> 00:28:44,744
also records Zhuang Wenfeng's

483
00:28:44,744 --> 00:28:47,304
accumulation of wealth
in Yongding County for Zhuang Zixian.

484
00:28:49,064 --> 00:28:51,544
If it weren't for Lord Ding
and Official Mu

485
00:28:51,825 --> 00:28:53,064
handling it impartially,

486
00:28:53,784 --> 00:28:57,105
I couldn't have brought
this ledger here.

487
00:28:58,024 --> 00:28:59,224
Your Majesty,
please investigate this thoroughly.

488
00:28:59,464 --> 00:29:01,345
Your Majesty,
please investigate this thoroughly.

489
00:29:01,345 --> 00:29:02,304
Your... Your Majesty.

490
00:29:02,304 --> 00:29:02,984
Your Majesty.

491
00:29:08,264 --> 00:29:09,464
Take Madam Mu
to the Imperial Academy of Medicine

492
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:10,504
for treatment.

493
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:11,264
Yes, Your Majesty.

494
00:29:12,345 --> 00:29:13,264
Guards!

495
00:29:21,905 --> 00:29:23,264
Your Majesty, I...

496
00:29:24,425 --> 00:29:26,425
I'm innocent, Your Majesty.

497
00:29:26,425 --> 00:29:28,064
Zhuang Wenfeng and Zhuang Zixian

498
00:29:28,304 --> 00:29:30,425
are guilty of embezzlement
and corruption.

499
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:32,585
From this day on, imprison him

500
00:29:32,585 --> 00:29:33,905
and the Ministry of Justice
shall take over this case.

501
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:34,865
He shall be executed
on an appointed day!

502
00:29:36,064 --> 00:29:37,625
Those who assisted his wrongdoing

503
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:38,585
shall be executed.

504
00:29:39,464 --> 00:29:40,304
The others

505
00:29:40,304 --> 00:29:41,385
shall be sent into exile.

506
00:29:41,898 --> 00:29:43,578
Madam Mu, wife of Zhuang Wenfeng,

507
00:29:43,984 --> 00:29:45,704
who stood up for justice
by accusing him shall be pardoned.

508
00:29:46,425 --> 00:29:47,504
She shall be rewarded
thousands of taels of silver

509
00:29:47,945 --> 00:29:49,224
and erect a monument
of loyalty and righteousness.

510
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,464
Your Majesty!

511
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:56,464
Your Majesty, I'm innocent!

512
00:29:56,825 --> 00:29:57,585
What are you doing?

513
00:29:58,024 --> 00:29:58,825
Your Majesty!

514
00:29:59,105 --> 00:30:02,504
Your Majesty! I'm innocent!

515
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:05,865
Your Majesty is wise.

516
00:30:05,945 --> 00:30:07,825
Your Majesty is wise!

517
00:30:10,224 --> 00:30:11,304
Official Shen.

518
00:30:16,665 --> 00:30:18,625
The First Prince told me

519
00:30:19,145 --> 00:30:20,213
that Mu Zhuohua, the administrator

520
00:30:20,213 --> 00:30:20,984
of the Ministry of Rites,

521
00:30:21,585 --> 00:30:23,464
and Shen Jinghong,
the Director of the Ministry of Revenue,

522
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:25,905
have selflessly served the people

523
00:30:25,984 --> 00:30:27,064
and shared the country's worries.

524
00:30:27,865 --> 00:30:29,304
It was sure a painstaking effort.

525
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:32,064
Mu Zhuohua, the administrator
of the Ministry of Rites,

526
00:30:32,585 --> 00:30:34,744
who has shown loyalty to the ruler
and compassion for the people

527
00:30:35,145 --> 00:30:36,464
and thoroughly investigated corruption,

528
00:30:36,665 --> 00:30:39,105
is hereby promoted to the Director
of the Ministry of Revenue.

529
00:30:40,945 --> 00:30:43,784
Thank you, Your Majesty.

530
00:30:49,105 --> 00:30:50,464
As for Shen Jinghong,

531
00:30:53,264 --> 00:30:54,385
you will go to the Ministry of Personnel

532
00:30:54,704 --> 00:30:55,865
and be promoted to the director there.

533
00:30:58,784 --> 00:31:01,185
Thank you, Your Majesty.

534
00:31:03,385 --> 00:31:04,105
Also,

535
00:31:04,665 --> 00:31:08,105
Princess Roujia has contributed

536
00:31:08,105 --> 00:31:08,905
to disaster relief
and aided the afflicted.

537
00:31:09,264 --> 00:31:11,345
I shall reward her generously.

538
00:31:35,744 --> 00:31:36,585
Congratulations, Your Highness.

539
00:31:37,464 --> 00:31:38,304
I shall take my leave now.

540
00:31:48,704 --> 00:31:49,425
Man,

541
00:31:50,304 --> 00:31:53,064
convert these rewards
into rice and supplies

542
00:31:53,585 --> 00:31:55,425
for those in need at Jishan Hall.

543
00:31:56,105 --> 00:31:56,905
Yes, Your Highness.

544
00:32:01,865 --> 00:32:03,905
Is there anything, Father?

545
00:32:07,145 --> 00:32:09,345
Everyone received rewards, except you.

546
00:32:09,744 --> 00:32:12,425
You must be displeased.

547
00:32:15,905 --> 00:32:16,784
Well...

548
00:32:20,865 --> 00:32:22,865
I am indeed slightly disappointed.

549
00:32:24,264 --> 00:32:24,905
Chen,

550
00:32:26,304 --> 00:32:27,585
you didn't receive any rewards

551
00:32:27,984 --> 00:32:30,385
because those were your duties.

552
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:33,024
What you should see

553
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:34,665
aren't those rewards

554
00:32:35,585 --> 00:32:37,185
but the people of the country.

555
00:32:41,665 --> 00:32:42,704
I shall remember your guidance

556
00:32:42,945 --> 00:32:44,544
in my heart.

557
00:32:51,984 --> 00:32:52,744
My Lord,

558
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,625
thank you for what you did
at Xuanzheng Hall.

559
00:32:56,905 --> 00:32:59,145
Consider it as your repayment

560
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:00,585
for defending me
in front of His Majesty.

561
00:33:02,585 --> 00:33:03,945
So you found out

562
00:33:04,585 --> 00:33:07,024
what I told His Majesty.

563
00:33:08,704 --> 00:33:09,504
But

564
00:33:10,105 --> 00:33:12,544
you earned your promotion.

565
00:33:13,185 --> 00:33:14,145
It's not because of me.

566
00:33:19,585 --> 00:33:20,784
But I'm thanking you

567
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:22,264
not just because you helped me
get promoted.

568
00:33:22,345 --> 00:33:23,984
But also

569
00:33:24,304 --> 00:33:25,984
for not letting my Eighth Sister
be flogged again.

570
00:33:28,385 --> 00:33:29,024
My Lord,

571
00:33:29,185 --> 00:33:30,744
my Eighth Sister
is currently recovering.

572
00:33:31,024 --> 00:33:33,224
Can I go and visit her?

573
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:35,105
There's nothing you can't do

574
00:33:35,544 --> 00:33:37,024
as long as I'm in charge.

575
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,064
But

576
00:33:43,504 --> 00:33:44,865
did you and your sister

577
00:33:45,385 --> 00:33:47,145
plot this together beforehand?

578
00:33:52,504 --> 00:33:53,825
You sure have deep familial affection.

579
00:33:55,504 --> 00:33:56,425
My Eighth Sister

580
00:33:56,984 --> 00:33:58,304
is smart.

581
00:33:59,865 --> 00:34:01,945
You want me to risk my life
for merely one thousand guan?

582
00:34:02,865 --> 00:34:04,385
No way.

583
00:34:08,144 --> 00:34:09,464
What if you could obtain

584
00:34:10,265 --> 00:34:12,024
something worth more than 3,000 guan?

585
00:34:15,945 --> 00:34:16,745
What do you mean?

586
00:34:18,705 --> 00:34:20,464
Free of worries
for the rest of your life.

587
00:34:23,984 --> 00:34:25,225
And you're capable of that?

588
00:34:26,705 --> 00:34:27,745
I'm not.

589
00:34:28,225 --> 00:34:29,544
But His Majesty is.

590
00:34:36,104 --> 00:34:37,225
Are you saying...

591
00:34:44,584 --> 00:34:45,385
All right.

592
00:34:47,664 --> 00:34:48,504
I'll do what you say.

593
00:34:49,785 --> 00:34:50,504
My Lord,

594
00:34:50,945 --> 00:34:52,225
will you blame me

595
00:34:52,265 --> 00:34:54,024
for not telling you about this?

596
00:34:55,345 --> 00:34:56,984
You don't need to tell me everything.

597
00:34:57,705 --> 00:34:58,785
You have your freedom.

598
00:35:00,305 --> 00:35:01,425
Thank you for your guidance, My Lord.

599
00:35:02,305 --> 00:35:04,305
I will fulfill my duties

600
00:35:04,464 --> 00:35:05,305
and not disappoint His Majesty.

601
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:10,504
You're an official
of the Department of State Affairs,

602
00:35:11,184 --> 00:35:14,425
so I naturally must advise you.

603
00:35:14,705 --> 00:35:15,945
If you ever have doubts in the future,

604
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,705
you can always come to me for guidance.

605
00:35:19,024 --> 00:35:19,544
Yes,

606
00:35:19,745 --> 00:35:20,385
I understand.

607
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,806
(Yunlou Inn)

608
00:35:41,865 --> 00:35:44,504
This medicine can relieve pain.

609
00:35:48,705 --> 00:35:49,464
So,

610
00:35:51,544 --> 00:35:52,664
why did you help me?

611
00:35:54,265 --> 00:35:55,425
Did I help you?

612
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,144
If you didn't accuse me,

613
00:35:58,305 --> 00:35:59,745
I wouldn't be at Xuanzheng Hall.

614
00:36:00,464 --> 00:36:01,544
If I didn't go there,

615
00:36:01,905 --> 00:36:03,664
how would I receive
His Majesty's rewards?

616
00:36:08,265 --> 00:36:09,584
You're silly.

617
00:36:10,024 --> 00:36:12,664
You could have handed the ledger
to the Ministry of Justice.

618
00:36:12,745 --> 00:36:14,624
Why did you have to strike
the Dengwen Drum?

619
00:36:17,984 --> 00:36:18,945
If I didn't do that,

620
00:36:19,865 --> 00:36:21,104
how could I see His Majesty?

621
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:27,345
Fair enough.

622
00:36:28,865 --> 00:36:31,265
His Majesty rewarded you
with thousands of taels of silver,

623
00:36:31,705 --> 00:36:32,984
a mansion in Jiangnan,

624
00:36:34,064 --> 00:36:36,064
and a monument
of loyalty and righteousness.

625
00:36:38,184 --> 00:36:39,504
With this monument protecting you,

626
00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:40,945
no one will dare

627
00:36:43,504 --> 00:36:45,225
to mistreat you again in the future.

628
00:36:51,225 --> 00:36:52,144
Really?

629
00:37:01,104 --> 00:37:01,785
That's great.

630
00:37:03,184 --> 00:37:03,825
Great.

631
00:37:05,945 --> 00:37:06,584
It's great.

632
00:37:10,464 --> 00:37:11,225
Eighth Sister.

633
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:14,265
In the future,

634
00:37:15,385 --> 00:37:17,385
you won't need to rely on others
for a living anymore.

635
00:37:24,865 --> 00:37:25,945
After we bid farewell today,

636
00:37:28,265 --> 00:37:29,184
I wish you well.

637
00:37:36,825 --> 00:37:37,544
What's wrong?

638
00:37:47,905 --> 00:37:49,504
I have something

639
00:37:51,064 --> 00:37:52,425
I didn't tell you all this while.

640
00:37:54,464 --> 00:37:55,504
What is it?

641
00:37:57,705 --> 00:37:58,785
When I was a child,

642
00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:03,064
I had a Chausie.

643
00:38:04,464 --> 00:38:06,064
It was white and fluffy,

644
00:38:06,905 --> 00:38:07,825
and quite adorable.

645
00:38:08,664 --> 00:38:09,745
I liked it a lot.

646
00:38:11,464 --> 00:38:12,745
But as you know,

647
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,184
whenever Father encounters a cat,

648
00:38:15,425 --> 00:38:16,705
his tears will flow profusely.

649
00:38:17,184 --> 00:38:19,225
So no one in the Mu Residence

650
00:38:19,504 --> 00:38:20,865
ever kept a cat.

651
00:38:22,184 --> 00:38:23,504
Later, someone told him

652
00:38:23,865 --> 00:38:25,024
about the cat.

653
00:38:25,624 --> 00:38:26,945
Father was furious.

654
00:38:29,104 --> 00:38:30,225
And I was terrified.

655
00:38:34,584 --> 00:38:35,425
What happened after that?

656
00:38:37,905 --> 00:38:38,945
After that,

657
00:38:40,745 --> 00:38:42,104
Madam said

658
00:38:43,305 --> 00:38:44,785
to kill the cat.

659
00:38:46,664 --> 00:38:47,425
I didn't let them.

660
00:38:49,265 --> 00:38:50,385
After that, she said

661
00:38:51,385 --> 00:38:52,265
I must get rid of the cat.

662
00:38:55,064 --> 00:38:57,825
I held it and cried for a long time.

663
00:39:00,385 --> 00:39:01,345
In the end,

664
00:39:04,984 --> 00:39:06,184
I left it

665
00:39:06,905 --> 00:39:08,265
in your courtyard.

666
00:39:11,385 --> 00:39:13,225
So it was really you
who left the cat there.

667
00:39:14,705 --> 00:39:15,584
You knew it?

668
00:39:16,905 --> 00:39:18,984
The cat was clean and white.

669
00:39:19,305 --> 00:39:20,905
It must be someone's pet.

670
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:22,425
It was clearly not a stray.

671
00:39:23,064 --> 00:39:24,104
But because of that,

672
00:39:24,825 --> 00:39:27,104
Father almost threw you
out of the house.

673
00:39:27,544 --> 00:39:28,584
You didn't deny it either.

674
00:39:37,265 --> 00:39:37,984
But it's as expected.

675
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,984
I took a bet that you wouldn't deny it.

676
00:39:43,504 --> 00:39:46,305
That's why I chose to leave the cat

677
00:39:47,144 --> 00:39:47,945
in your courtyard.

678
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:55,225
I hope you don't think

679
00:39:56,184 --> 00:39:57,664
that I think you were kind.

680
00:40:01,664 --> 00:40:02,905
I think you were silly.

681
00:40:03,745 --> 00:40:04,825
A complete fool.

682
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:10,385
I didn't bother

683
00:40:10,624 --> 00:40:11,905
because I knew

684
00:40:12,265 --> 00:40:13,984
you wanted to keep the cat alive.

685
00:40:16,064 --> 00:40:17,425
It's not because I'm a pushover.

686
00:40:25,504 --> 00:40:26,305
What happened

687
00:40:27,305 --> 00:40:28,504
to the cat after that?

688
00:40:30,184 --> 00:40:32,504
I didn't see you raising it.

689
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:34,905
I gave it to my teacher.

690
00:40:35,705 --> 00:40:36,624
Taking care of it is so troublesome.

691
00:40:36,825 --> 00:40:38,144
I'm not so fond of cats anyway.

692
00:40:41,945 --> 00:40:42,865
As long as it lives.

693
00:40:45,664 --> 00:40:47,305
You're the foolish one.

694
00:40:47,504 --> 00:40:49,785
That cat has long since passed away
peacefully.

695
00:40:52,385 --> 00:40:53,385
I'm not a fool.

696
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:54,984
You're the fool.

697
00:41:04,584 --> 00:41:05,584
Seventh Sister...

698
00:41:10,584 --> 00:41:11,544
