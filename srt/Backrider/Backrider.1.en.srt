1
00:00:54,408 --> 00:00:56,535
Is the pressure okay, sir?

2
00:00:57,078 --> 00:00:58,412
Press a little harder.

3
00:01:04,668 --> 00:01:06,587
Sir, please turn.

4
00:01:42,206 --> 00:01:44,416
Five thousand is the rate, sir.

5
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:23,742
Sir, not there..

6
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:26,424
Just relax. You're being paid.

7
00:04:30,717 --> 00:04:31,717
Sir.

8
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:34,669
Sir.

9
00:04:37,214 --> 00:04:38,257
Sir.

10
00:04:48,309 --> 00:04:49,309
Sir.

11
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,610
I’ll beat you idiots.

12
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:02,114
Here they come.

13
00:05:04,658 --> 00:05:08,037
What now idiots?

14
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,497
Let’s see--

15
00:05:10,706 --> 00:05:12,541
You think you can take me?

16
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,918
No way, dumbass!

17
00:05:17,212 --> 00:05:18,464
Raymond.

18
00:05:20,174 --> 00:05:21,842
- You can’t beat me.
- Raymond.

19
00:05:22,384 --> 00:05:23,384
Hey..

20
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:25,179
Is this new?

21
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,502
No, babe, it’s just--

22
00:05:30,476 --> 00:05:33,228
- It’s on installment.
- You're always spending money.

23
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,650
Here.

24
00:05:45,574 --> 00:05:46,574
Is this all?

25
00:05:48,035 --> 00:05:49,370
I reloaded my phone.

26
00:05:50,871 --> 00:05:52,498
How much did you reload?

27
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:55,876
Do you even have to ask?

28
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:04,635
Okay, take a look at this.

29
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:08,972
We managed to
pay well this month.

30
00:06:09,473 --> 00:06:10,473
See?

31
00:06:14,228 --> 00:06:16,480
Are we doing
the right thing, Raymond?

32
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:19,441
This setup we have?

33
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:21,860
What setup?

34
00:06:25,114 --> 00:06:26,490
I thought...

35
00:06:27,574 --> 00:06:29,535
when we decided
to leave Mama Mimi,

36
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,914
we would stop this kind of work…

37
00:06:34,915 --> 00:06:36,291
Turns out it’s just you.

38
00:06:41,964 --> 00:06:43,382
Hon, do you think...

39
00:06:45,134 --> 00:06:47,094
that I like what you’re doing?

40
00:06:48,595 --> 00:06:51,014
Having other men use you?

41
00:06:53,725 --> 00:06:54,725
But it’s just--

42
00:06:55,936 --> 00:06:58,147
We both need to sacrifice, right?

43
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,023
So we can save money?

44
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:02,943
That’s why I’m gaming.

45
00:07:03,527 --> 00:07:05,237
This is how we’ll make money.

46
00:07:07,948 --> 00:07:09,950
But once we have enough savings,

47
00:07:11,201 --> 00:07:13,412
I’ll buy us tickets to Canada.

48
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:18,959
Our friends are waiting for us there.

49
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:24,047
We won’t come back here.
We won’t suffer anymore.

50
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,840
Right?

51
00:07:34,808 --> 00:07:36,477
Oh my honey...

52
00:07:37,394 --> 00:07:39,271
always sulking...

53
00:07:42,357 --> 00:07:43,984
Just relax, hon.

54
00:07:45,194 --> 00:07:46,945
Let me caress you...

55
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,952
Don’t be mad at me anymore...

56
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,300
You have a customer later, okay?

57
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:20,969
One at 7 PM and at 9 PM.

58
00:12:22,053 --> 00:12:23,138
You’ll give me a ride?

59
00:12:25,223 --> 00:12:27,476
I have a schedule in the game.

60
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:29,853
You’ll be fine.

61
00:13:44,886 --> 00:13:46,315
Please come in.

62
00:13:49,474 --> 00:13:50,474
Wait for a while.

63
00:13:57,148 --> 00:13:58,148
Come in.

64
00:14:02,904 --> 00:14:05,073
Wait here for a while.

65
00:14:19,671 --> 00:14:22,883
Hello, sir.
I’ll just put down my things.

66
00:14:27,178 --> 00:14:29,347
Sorry, sorry--

67
00:14:29,681 --> 00:14:30,891
It's okay.

68
00:14:36,771 --> 00:14:37,771
Come…

69
00:14:51,703 --> 00:14:53,288
Let’s start, sir.

70
00:15:08,386 --> 00:15:10,889
What's your name?

71
00:15:13,433 --> 00:15:14,433
Faith...

72
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:16,353
- Sir..
- Dave.

73
00:15:18,063 --> 00:15:19,063
Dave...

74
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,109
What do you do for work?

75
00:15:23,902 --> 00:15:26,780
I have businesses.

76
00:15:27,822 --> 00:15:29,407
How long
have you been doing this job?

77
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:31,952
For a few years now.

78
00:15:33,244 --> 00:15:34,955
I'll always request for you.

79
00:15:36,998 --> 00:15:38,416
Thank you.

80
00:15:42,128 --> 00:15:43,128
Married?

81
00:15:45,715 --> 00:15:47,133
Boyfriend, sir.

82
00:15:47,634 --> 00:15:49,803
Sorry, I'm asking too many questions.

83
00:16:00,438 --> 00:16:02,816
Time to turn, sir.

84
00:16:23,837 --> 00:16:25,672
Is the pressure okay, sir?

85
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:27,799
It’s all good.

86
00:16:51,197 --> 00:16:52,866
You don't have to do that.

87
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:15,161
[background chattering]

88
00:17:17,682 --> 00:17:18,850
Baby, who’s that?

89
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,020
You flirt!

90
00:17:22,395 --> 00:17:25,440
Flirt! Whore!

91
00:17:25,648 --> 00:17:28,359
Come here you flirt!

92
00:17:31,362 --> 00:17:32,362
Nice.

93
00:17:34,657 --> 00:17:36,659
It looks good, bro.

94
00:17:40,622 --> 00:17:42,165
Woah, Mond.

95
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,126
It’s nice. Looks good on you.

96
00:17:45,835 --> 00:17:47,045
Can I sit?

97
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:51,549
So? You’ll take it?

98
00:17:53,384 --> 00:17:55,512
Alright, alright, I’ll take it.

99
00:17:55,678 --> 00:17:56,930
Good luck to Faith.

100
00:17:57,138 --> 00:17:59,140
She’ll probably the one to pay for that.

101
00:18:00,141 --> 00:18:01,935
Don’t think about her.

102
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,728
I know my girl’s weak spots.

103
00:18:04,395 --> 00:18:05,939
She won’t say a word.

104
00:18:10,777 --> 00:18:13,029
I’ll just pay you
with Gems Eternities, okay?

105
00:18:13,696 --> 00:18:15,323
What’s that?

106
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:19,410
Crypto coins in the game I play.
Here, look...

107
00:18:19,911 --> 00:18:22,497
- Crypto?
- Yeah.

108
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:23,998
That sounds risky.

109
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,083
Just pay me in cash.

110
00:18:26,876 --> 00:18:28,670
A lot of people
have gotten rich from this.

111
00:18:28,837 --> 00:18:31,089
This is how
Faith and I saved up.

112
00:18:31,506 --> 00:18:32,746
This is what
you’re going to do.

113
00:18:33,174 --> 00:18:34,551
You’re just
going to deposit.

114
00:18:34,676 --> 00:18:36,177
After one or two weeks,

115
00:18:36,553 --> 00:18:37,804
your money will double.

116
00:18:38,555 --> 00:18:40,275
- What do you think?
- My money will double?

117
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:42,099
Are you interested?

118
00:18:42,183 --> 00:18:43,702
Do you want me
to make an account for you?

119
00:18:43,726 --> 00:18:44,936
Just top up
a few more cash,

120
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,147
I’ll take care of the rest.

121
00:18:49,065 --> 00:18:50,065
Alright, I’m in.

122
00:18:52,735 --> 00:18:53,862
Add this then.

123
00:18:55,071 --> 00:18:56,071
Give it to me.

124
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:00,577
That’s what
I’m talking about.

125
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:01,953
Sweet cash!

126
00:19:04,414 --> 00:19:05,414
How about you, Nona?

127
00:19:05,665 --> 00:19:06,705
Do you also
want to top up?

128
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,250
Come on.

129
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:10,336
I want something else.

130
00:19:15,842 --> 00:19:18,094
I want something else.

131
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,186
What do you want?

132
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,821
This one.

133
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,237
So that’s what
you want to sit on.

134
00:19:36,237 --> 00:19:37,237
Uh huh.

135
00:19:49,751 --> 00:19:50,919
Fuck!
It feels so good.

136
00:19:58,176 --> 00:19:59,802
Wait a minute.

137
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:01,994
I’m just going to pee.

138
00:20:04,224 --> 00:20:05,642
Where are you going?

139
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:36,584
Ouch!

140
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:38,211
This bitch!

141
00:22:38,419 --> 00:22:39,670
Why did you hit me?

142
00:22:40,671 --> 00:22:41,464
Nona!

143
00:22:41,589 --> 00:22:43,299
Nona, let’s just go.

144
00:22:53,851 --> 00:22:54,852
Faith, what was that?

145
00:22:55,812 --> 00:22:57,522
Why did you have
to do that to my friends?

146
00:22:59,107 --> 00:23:01,025
To your friends,
you are embarrassed,

147
00:23:02,235 --> 00:23:03,694
but to me you aren’t.

148
00:23:06,447 --> 00:23:07,490
Raymond!
What the hell?

149
00:23:08,616 --> 00:23:10,034
All you care
about is having fun!

150
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:18,084
What are you whining about?

151
00:23:19,001 --> 00:23:20,711
Is it this, huh?

152
00:23:21,838 --> 00:23:23,881
What the fuck, Faith?
This is only some cheap shit!

153
00:23:24,424 --> 00:23:25,883
Fuck you, Raymond.,

154
00:23:26,926 --> 00:23:28,719
that’s still added to our expenses.

155
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:34,016
Every day, I’m being used by men

156
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:37,688
just to satisfy your whims.

157
00:23:37,854 --> 00:23:39,021
Stop being so dramatic.

158
00:23:40,648 --> 00:23:42,483
You talk like you’re some saint.

159
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:45,653
Aren’t you just a whore anyway?

160
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:06,798
Go.

161
00:24:07,758 --> 00:24:09,469
And don’t you
fucking come back.

162
00:24:10,834 --> 00:24:11,960
Bitch.

163
00:24:25,443 --> 00:24:26,903
You seem quiet.

164
00:24:33,534 --> 00:24:34,869
Don’t be shy....

165
00:24:35,203 --> 00:24:36,829
I’ll listen.

166
00:24:42,266 --> 00:24:44,102
It's my boyfriend...

167
00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:46,714
All he does is enjoy himself...

168
00:24:48,716 --> 00:24:51,385
while I’m working my ass off.

169
00:24:52,274 --> 00:24:54,972
Now, he's mad at me.

170
00:24:56,682 --> 00:24:58,768
I'm just so tired, Sir...

171
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:09,946
My ex was just like that.

172
00:25:11,656 --> 00:25:14,617
She used me, abused me...

173
00:25:16,244 --> 00:25:18,079
When I was drained,

174
00:25:19,247 --> 00:25:20,790
she was the one who got angry.

175
00:25:29,924 --> 00:25:32,218
You don't deserve
that kind of guy, Faith.

176
00:25:34,053 --> 00:25:37,807
You deserve someone
who will love you,

177
00:25:38,474 --> 00:25:40,142
who will respect you...

178
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,839
Sorry, sir. I’m sorry.

179
00:27:02,683 --> 00:27:04,101
Hon...

180
00:27:07,467 --> 00:27:08,467
Hon.

181
00:27:17,295 --> 00:27:18,838
I’m sorry...

182
00:27:20,167 --> 00:27:21,752
It’s my fault.

183
00:27:23,982 --> 00:27:25,275
I’m sorry.

184
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,623
I love you--

185
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,884
Come on, I’m sorry.

186
00:27:53,553 --> 00:27:54,762
I’m really sorry.

187
00:31:27,433 --> 00:31:30,019
See, we're able to make use of this.

188
00:31:35,483 --> 00:31:36,483
Raymond!

189
00:31:38,528 --> 00:31:40,488
- Raymond!
- Is that Obet?

190
00:31:41,114 --> 00:31:42,114
Let me check.

191
00:31:43,116 --> 00:31:44,367
Raymond, open up.

192
00:31:48,913 --> 00:31:50,707
- Bro.
- You motherfucker!

193
00:31:51,999 --> 00:31:54,903
You were just here
all this time?

194
00:31:55,294 --> 00:31:56,337
You asshole,

195
00:31:56,546 --> 00:31:59,048
our friends are chasing me
because of your scam.

196
00:31:59,298 --> 00:32:00,550
Bastard!

197
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,719
- I can explain--
- Where’s the money?

198
00:32:02,719 --> 00:32:03,803
Obet, that’s enough.

199
00:32:03,845 --> 00:32:05,930
Enough or else I’ll call the police.

200
00:32:06,806 --> 00:32:08,285
Get out. Leave!

201
00:32:10,101 --> 00:32:12,645
Pay me back
or I’ll have you jailed!

202
00:32:20,069 --> 00:32:22,071
What scam is Obet talking about?

203
00:32:23,364 --> 00:32:25,616
- It’s not important. Don’t think--
- Raymond.

204
00:32:26,617 --> 00:32:28,911
- I told you it’s not important--
- Raymond.

205
00:32:29,829 --> 00:32:30,830
It’s nothing.

206
00:32:31,514 --> 00:32:34,600
- It’s--
- What’s Obet talking about?

207
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:35,966
What the hell is he talking about?

208
00:32:35,991 --> 00:32:39,036
I got scammed.
Even my friends got dragged into it.

209
00:32:39,216 --> 00:32:40,759
Our saving’s gone.

210
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:45,261
Fuck-- is that
what you want to hear?

211
00:32:48,347 --> 00:32:49,974
Damn you--

212
00:32:50,016 --> 00:32:52,852
- Damn you. Damn you!
- Hey--

213
00:32:52,852 --> 00:32:54,562
Go on, hurt me.

214
00:32:54,562 --> 00:32:57,165
- I did everything for you.
- Go on. What else?

215
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:59,525
I let myself be used,
I prostituted myself,

216
00:32:59,525 --> 00:33:01,281
and this is what you do?

217
00:33:01,673 --> 00:33:04,926
What have you done to me, Raymond?

218
00:33:05,072 --> 00:33:07,241
You left me with nothing.

219
00:33:08,665 --> 00:33:10,124
What have you done?

220
00:33:10,203 --> 00:33:13,490
What else?
What do you want to do, huh?

221
00:33:13,515 --> 00:33:16,184
Do you want to break up?
Fine, break up with me.

222
00:33:17,084 --> 00:33:18,044
Is that what you want?

223
00:33:18,044 --> 00:33:19,212
Really? You’re saying that?

224
00:33:27,804 --> 00:33:29,124
That's where we’re headed, right?

225
00:33:30,723 --> 00:33:33,142
Pack your things and go.
Go!

226
00:33:33,309 --> 00:33:34,309
Fine!

227
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:36,706
You’re challenging me?

228
00:33:38,147 --> 00:33:39,732
We’re done!

229
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:15,559
Come in.

230
00:34:42,628 --> 00:34:43,628
Faith?

231
00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:49,010
- What happened?
- Dave... Dave...

232
00:34:57,768 --> 00:34:58,895
Why? What happened?

233
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,516
Tell me.

234
00:38:20,471 --> 00:38:22,056
Leave that kind of work.

235
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,059
Just stay here with me.

236
00:38:56,882 --> 00:38:59,426
Good morning... mister?

237
00:38:59,844 --> 00:39:01,345
Just call me Bong.

238
00:39:02,817 --> 00:39:04,902
Have you been here long, Bong?

239
00:39:05,922 --> 00:39:07,507
Just a few months, ma'am.

240
00:39:10,218 --> 00:39:12,345
Is Dave a good boss?

241
00:39:13,596 --> 00:39:15,140
He’s okay, ma’am.

242
00:39:17,033 --> 00:39:19,994
Is that a bruise? It looks pretty big.

243
00:39:23,773 --> 00:39:27,027
It’s nothing, ma’am. Excuse me...

244
00:39:49,382 --> 00:39:53,345
Hey, drinking in the middle
of the day?

245
00:39:54,429 --> 00:39:58,350
You know,
there’s a reason why that happened.

246
00:39:59,267 --> 00:40:01,895
Maybe you and Faith
weren’t meant to be.

247
00:40:02,312 --> 00:40:04,105
Maybe there's someone else for you?

248
00:42:49,854 --> 00:42:52,357
Am I better than your ex?

249
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,240
Goddamn it!

250
00:43:08,831 --> 00:43:10,124
What happened?

251
00:43:36,776 --> 00:43:39,737
You look so stressed.

252
00:43:40,822 --> 00:43:42,073
Is something wrong?

253
00:43:43,616 --> 00:43:45,201
I told you, it’s nothing!

254
00:43:50,915 --> 00:43:52,458
Faith, I’m sorry...

255
00:43:54,877 --> 00:43:56,337
Sorry. I’m sorry.

256
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:46,734
Who’s that?

257
00:47:47,485 --> 00:47:49,362
No one. Just an old customer.

258
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,127
Why do you still have his number?

259
00:48:01,999 --> 00:48:03,459
Are you still selling yourself?

260
00:48:04,252 --> 00:48:06,629
Ever since we got together
I’m not, Dave.

261
00:48:08,047 --> 00:48:09,173
Remember...

262
00:48:09,924 --> 00:48:12,635
that I accepted you
even though you’re a whore.

263
00:48:12,635 --> 00:48:15,446
- Dave, what’s happening...
- You’re going to fool me?

264
00:48:15,471 --> 00:48:17,682
- Dave, there’s nothing..
- Liar!

265
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:20,852
Dave, stop it, please.

266
00:48:20,935 --> 00:48:22,770
Stop, please.

267
00:48:22,854 --> 00:48:24,313
You liar.

268
00:48:24,605 --> 00:48:25,815
You whore!

269
00:48:27,275 --> 00:48:29,527
Dave, stop please--

270
00:48:29,652 --> 00:48:32,697
Let go of me.

271
00:49:07,481 --> 00:49:08,481
Faith.

272
00:49:10,943 --> 00:49:13,571
Faith, what happened?

273
00:49:13,571 --> 00:49:14,906
Raymond?

274
00:49:15,292 --> 00:49:16,460
Raymond--

275
00:49:17,158 --> 00:49:20,036
Raymond... Raymond...

276
00:49:20,328 --> 00:49:23,289
I’ll go with you, Raymond.

277
00:49:23,456 --> 00:49:25,041
Take me home...

278
00:49:25,458 --> 00:49:29,295
- Raymond, take me home.
- Yeah, we’re going home. It’s okay.

279
00:49:31,172 --> 00:49:33,174
You’re safe now.
We’re going home

280
00:49:38,596 --> 00:49:39,764
Wear this.

281
00:50:28,604 --> 00:50:29,604
This is the last.

282
00:50:29,814 --> 00:50:31,232
Don’t ever come back.

283
00:50:31,357 --> 00:50:33,693
Wait, bro, this seems light.

284
00:50:33,818 --> 00:50:35,778
Take it or leave it.

285
00:50:36,821 --> 00:50:38,364
Okay. Sure, sure, sure.

286
00:50:39,156 --> 00:50:40,950
Nona Marie and I are easy to talk to.

287
00:50:44,036 --> 00:50:46,872
I'll just tell Faith what you did.

288
00:50:51,836 --> 00:50:53,587
Maybe you’re forgetting

289
00:50:54,338 --> 00:50:56,298
we both wronged her.

290
00:50:57,258 --> 00:50:58,843
You sold her to me, remember?

291
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:02,013
A transaction happened,
that's different.

292
00:51:03,431 --> 00:51:05,808
Let's see if Faith
ever comes back to you.

293
00:51:06,092 --> 00:51:08,177
Are you blackmailing me?

294
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:12,023
You and Nona Marie already extorted
so much from me,

295
00:51:12,659 --> 00:51:14,578
just for you to keep quiet.

296
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:17,236
I have nothing left to lose.

297
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:19,572
How about you?

298
00:51:20,573 --> 00:51:21,949
Dave, what’s this?

299
00:51:22,241 --> 00:51:23,576
Faith? Faith..

300
00:51:24,076 --> 00:51:26,620
- What am I doing here?
- Faith... Faith...

301
00:51:27,288 --> 00:51:28,748
Raymond brought you here.

302
00:51:30,207 --> 00:51:32,793
- Do you think you’ll go home?
- Let go of me.

303
00:51:32,918 --> 00:51:37,048
They’ve sold you a long time ago.
You can’t go.

304
00:51:37,423 --> 00:51:39,008
You’re never going to leave.

305
00:56:04,023 --> 00:56:06,150
When will you give my allowance?

306
00:56:08,193 --> 00:56:11,155
Bitch.

307
00:56:11,488 --> 00:56:15,200
- I already gave you your share.
- As if it’s that big?

308
00:56:27,671 --> 00:56:30,049
Come to the house with Nona Marie.

309
00:56:30,591 --> 00:56:33,344
I’ll give you what you want.

310
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:36,680
See? You’re so selfish.
That’s a lot more for you.

311
00:56:38,849 --> 00:56:41,185
The asshole managed to give in.

312
00:56:41,852 --> 00:56:43,562
Bastard.

313
00:56:51,653 --> 00:56:52,905
This house is huge!

314
00:56:53,989 --> 00:56:55,991
Dave even prepared food?

315
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:57,993
Where is he?

316
00:56:58,744 --> 00:57:00,996
He told me you guys go ahead.

317
00:57:01,622 --> 00:57:03,499
He gave in so quickly, huh?

318
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:07,044
He acted tough with that
“take it or leave it”,

319
00:57:07,044 --> 00:57:09,546
but in the end
he’s even going to feed us.

320
00:57:09,713 --> 00:57:12,091
Yeah, he told us to come here
to feed us.

321
00:57:12,508 --> 00:57:14,134
He was so stingy at first.

322
00:57:15,094 --> 00:57:16,261
This is delicious...

323
00:57:17,262 --> 00:57:19,390
Yeah, it is.
It’s my first time to taste this.

324
00:57:19,556 --> 00:57:21,392
Really? You know why?

325
00:57:21,767 --> 00:57:22,767
Why?

326
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:26,146
- Because you can’t afford it.
- Whatever.

327
00:57:27,272 --> 00:57:28,399
I’m just saying...

328
00:57:31,193 --> 00:57:33,987
Do better at selling yourself,
so you can buy these.

329
00:57:34,279 --> 00:57:36,323
Sure, I’ll do better next time.

330
00:57:38,742 --> 00:57:40,202
But you should practice first.

331
00:57:41,328 --> 00:57:43,455
Practice on me, okay?

332
00:57:54,967 --> 00:57:56,218
It’s really tastes good, right?

333
00:57:57,219 --> 00:57:58,512
You can’t get enough of it.

334
00:59:34,149 --> 00:59:36,443
It's hard that you can't speak, right?

335
00:59:36,568 --> 00:59:38,779
Specially when you want to shout.

336
00:59:39,279 --> 00:59:40,572
But you can't.

337
00:59:40,572 --> 00:59:42,524
You all took advantage of me.

338
00:59:43,852 --> 00:59:47,610
And you even connived to bring
me back here.

339
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:50,374
And you, Raymond....

340
00:59:51,458 --> 00:59:54,127
You used me until the end.

341
00:59:54,545 --> 00:59:56,922
And you even brought this girl with you?

342
00:59:57,464 --> 01:00:00,467
That's why it was so easy for you
to dump me.

343
01:00:01,385 --> 01:00:03,220
Because you already sold me..

344
01:00:04,721 --> 01:00:06,265
Help..

345
01:00:14,523 --> 01:00:15,691
That's enough, Bong.

346
01:00:15,983 --> 01:00:16,984
Thank you.

347
01:00:22,948 --> 01:00:24,575
You fooled me.

348
01:00:27,619 --> 01:00:28,619
Now...

349
01:00:30,163 --> 01:00:31,873
It's my turn to play.

350
01:00:32,874 --> 01:00:33,917
Fuck each other.

351
01:00:36,712 --> 01:00:37,754
One!

352
01:00:38,547 --> 01:00:39,590
Two!
