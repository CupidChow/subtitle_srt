00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:45,979
[Sword and Beloved]

2
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,479
[Episode 15]

3
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,760
Cousin.

4
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,310
I won't let you die so easily.

5
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,750
Young Master Fugui,

6
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,710
dinner's ready.

7
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,280
Mm.

8
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,750
You've come all this way.

9
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,280
Aren't you going to come in?

10
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,800
Young Master Rumu?

11
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,280
I rushed here

12
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,740
as soon as I heard the news.

13
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,890
I thought you'd be in some pitiful state—

14
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,460
but I didn't expect

15
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,030
your life here

16
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,030
to be much better
than at the Wangquan Manor.

17
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,310
You're really something.

18
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,520
Nothing can stump you.

19
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,720
Even when I hide here, you still find me.

20
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,150
After all, I'm

21
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,680
your only friend, aren't I?

22
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,580
Young Master Rumu,

23
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,920
I'll get another set of tableware for you.

24
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:30,910
Fugui,

25
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,120
this wine's no good.

26
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,650
Where did you buy it?

27
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:36,840
Forget it.

28
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,410
You don't drink anyway. Can't blame you.

29
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,150
Fugui,

30
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,079
how old are you now?

31
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,250
Still carving a wooden sword?

32
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,360
Fugui,

33
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,840
there's something

34
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,170
I've never figured out.

35
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,590
Tell me the truth.

36
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,520
Who drove you to this point?

37
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,520
Don't tell me...

38
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,080
it was my father.

39
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,240
I'm fine.

40
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,120
It's just an old injury.

41
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:41,600
Fugui,

42
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,240
I'm really fine.

43
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,680
I've made it this far,

44
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,550
and every time, I've managed to
survive against all odds.

45
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,480
You...

46
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,600
You don't need to worry about me.

47
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,620
Why?

48
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,670
What do you mean, "why"?

49
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,780
All your meridians have been destroyed.

50
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,580
It obviously happened long ago.

51
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,750
Who hurt you?

52
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:04,720
Fugui,

53
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,370
you're the Soldier.

54
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,560
Calm down.

55
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,040
I'm asking you—

56
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,830
who did this to you?

57
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,710
Fugui,

58
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,720
before I answer,

59
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,560
let me tell you a story.

60
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,240
I haven't finished telling you the story

61
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,440
of me and Long Weiyun.

62
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,410
If you don't listen now,

63
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,830
you may not

64
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,720
get the chance again.

65
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,240
As you know,

66
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,700
after my father went to
the Western Regions,

67
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,500
he killed a lot of dragon demons.

68
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,909
But what you don't know is

69
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,230
that he also toyed with
a dragon demon's heart

70
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,000
and tortured her to death.

71
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,240
Later,

72
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,960
that dragon demon's daughter abducted me,

73
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,250
wanting to exchange me
for her mother's remains.

74
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,040
But my father...

75
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,600
he didn't care about my life at all.

76
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,750
So...

77
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,390
her plan failed.

78
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,720
Sister, help me.

79
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,040
Help me...

80
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,000
Help me...

81
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,600
Stop pretending.

82
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,120
Your own father doesn't care about you.

83
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,430
You think I would?

84
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,720
Help me...

85
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,840
Dragon demons are born
with the power to heal.

86
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,830
Funny enough,

87
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,750
my family couldn't help me

88
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,870
with my asthma,

89
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,409
but my family's enemy healed me.

90
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,870
After she cured my asthma,

91
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,620
she wanted to let me go.

92
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,470
But I, an abandoned child,

93
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,790
didn't want to return to that cold family,

94
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,560
so I shamelessly followed her.

95
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,070
And I stayed

96
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,920
for over 10 years.

97
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,060
She's cold on the outside,
yet warm on the inside.

98
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,780
No wonder you've never had

99
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,120
any prejudice against demons.

100
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,830
You mentioned it before.

101
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,310
Turns out you comprehended

102
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,850
your own Way of the Sword in the desert.

103
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,540
At that time,

104
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,870
after I comprehended
my own Way of the Sword,

105
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,600
the first thing I did for her...

106
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,800
was to return home

107
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,920
and retrieve her mother's remains.

108
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,310
Don't you want to know

109
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,310
where I've been these past few days?

110
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,460
Can you hold back from telling me?

111
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,950
I just went home,

112
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,510
stealing and forcing my way through...

113
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,870
to get...

114
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,650
what you wanted.

115
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,630
All that's left of your mother's remains

116
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,000
is her skull.

117
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,520
[Dragon Cave]

118
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:28,600
Mother,

119
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,430
you're finally able to return home.

120
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,270
Rest in peace

121
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,000
in the Dragon Cave.

122
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:58,690
What is this?

123
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,230
[Long Weiyun's Mother]

124
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,790
I scraped off your dragon scales

125
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,720
and absorbed them into my own body.

126
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,490
Look.

127
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,400
My left arm is now

128
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,590
impervious to all weapons.

129
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,920
Unfortunately, your scales can't
grow back.

130
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,440
But I heard that...

131
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,720
dragon horns...

132
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,390
can regrow when cut off.

133
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,450
That's Mother's memory
from when she was alive.

134
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,620
Quan Jingting,

135
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,750
you bastard.

136
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,200
Poor child,

137
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,510
you've suffered.

138
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:32,940
Who are you?

139
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,730
I'm the last dragon spirit

140
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,850
with memories in the Dragon Cave.

141
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,830
I've been waiting for you here

142
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,510
for many years,

143
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,870
just to give this Water-Control Orb
to you.

144
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,630
Water-Control Orb?

145
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,760
I've been searching for it for so long,

146
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,360
and it was actually here all along?

147
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,420
It was entrusted to me by your mother
when she was alive.

148
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,870
She told me not to give it to you

149
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,860
unless absolutely necessary.

150
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,000
But I died long ago,
and my spirit is weak.

151
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,660
I may dissipate at any moment.

152
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,080
Now

153
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,150
you're the last True Dragon of our clan.

154
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,310
This sacred relic of our clan

155
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,000
should be kept by you.

156
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,240
Remember,

157
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,390
though this Water-Control Orb
holds immense power,

158
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,510
until you have the strength to control it,

159
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,370
treasure your own life above all.

160
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,390
I only learned much later...

161
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,280
Weiyun's heart burned with vengeance,

162
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,120
so

163
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,190
she chose to forcefully absorb
that Water-Control Orb

164
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,990
to obtain the True Dragon Power.

165
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,720
The Water-Control Orb is

166
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,850
the greatest treasure
of the True Dragon Clan.

167
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,910
It can naturally absorb
all demon power for its own use.

168
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,280
Since ancient times,

169
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,880
this orb has absorbed
countless demon powers,

170
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,510
making it very unstable.

171
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,110
It's a double-edged sword.

172
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,720
To control it is
to command rain and storm;

173
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,230
to be controlled by it

174
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,680
is to fall into madness overnight.

175
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,120
I can't believe...

176
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,550
I failed to absorb it.

177
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,120
Ever since she found out

178
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,410
in the Dragon Cave what my father had done

179
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,390
to her mother,

180
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,150
Long Weiyun

181
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,020
hated me to the very core.

182
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,870
But I had no idea.

183
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,030
Until one day,

184
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,410
she suddenly asked me a question.

185
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,970
What kind of person

186
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,640
do you think your father is?

187
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,390
How should I...

188
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,360
answer that?

189
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,580
After all, he is my biological father.

190
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,140
Yes.

191
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,670
Do you like me?

192
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,510
What?

193
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,180
You... You...

194
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,180
You... I... I...

195
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,290
Weiyun...

196
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,050
I'll take you somewhere.

197
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,120
[Dragon Clan's Habitat]

198
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,320
There's such a beautiful place

199
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,600
in this desert.

200
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,060
I've never seen it before.

201
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,190
Do you know what this place used to be?

202
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,870
Was it a place

203
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,200
as beautiful as you are?

204
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,720
This was once our dragon clan's habitat.

205
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,630
Thousands of years ago,

206
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:39,060
this desert was once an oasis,
with clear skies and blue waters.

207
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:39,690
Later,

208
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,580
the oasis turned into a desert,

209
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,220
and our clan declined.

210
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,630
So our dragon demons became rare.

211
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,930
But our dragon clan
has always had a custom.

212
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:54,200
We bring the person we love,
who loves us in return...

213
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,910
to this place.

214
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,790
You haven't answered the question

215
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,080
I asked you at home.

216
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,360
Do you like me?

217
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,750
I-I do.

218
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,200
I like you.

219
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,920
What do you like about me?

220
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,450
I like the way you look
when you're lost in thought.

221
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,870
I like how you

222
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,340
have a cold expression

223
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,200
but a soft heart.

224
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,090
I like following behind you...

225
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,250
watching your back.

226
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,910
Anyway...

227
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,120
I like everything about you.

228
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,910
So much that

229
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,000
I'd do

230
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,510
anything for you.

231
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,640
I remember...

232
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,600
today is your birthday.

233
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,720
You even remember that?

234
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,180
How about I give you a gift?

235
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,120
Great!

236
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,920
Wait, Weiyun.

237
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,070
I also have a gift for you.

238
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:15,840
Look.

239
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,270
I searched for this flagon

240
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,130
for a long time.

241
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,270
I just hope...

242
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,320
every time you drink in the future,

243
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,910
you'll think of me.

244
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:28,510
Okay.

245
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,490
Weiyun,

246
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,490
it's your turn.

247
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,620
Should I close my eyes?

248
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,030
Wow...

249
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,300
It's so beautiful.

250
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,960
So beautiful.

251
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,840
Weiyun.

252
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,720
Can you...

253
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,530
promise me one thing?

254
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,240
Go ahead.

255
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,330
From now on, every year on my birthday,

256
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,010
will you make it snow for me?

257
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,320
Mm.

258
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,120
Okay.

259
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,170
Our dragon clan has now declined,

260
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,240
so

261
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,550
if you encounter
any difficulties absorbing

262
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,880
the Water-Control Orb,

263
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,360
you can use this.

264
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,790
Never forcefully absorb it,
or you'll lose your life.

265
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,270
This is the Love Gu
of the Southern Border.

266
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,550
It can only be planted on someone

267
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,109
who has deep feelings for you

268
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:11,109
and is devoted to you heart and soul.

269
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,589
From then on,

270
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:15,200
they will bear all the pain for you

271
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:16,790
and be controlled by you.

272
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,480
That day,

273
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,400
she planted the Love Gu on me,

274
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,440
wanting me to take on the pain

275
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,310
during the process of absorbing

276
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,640
the Water-Control Orb.

277
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,150
I understood her.

278
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,760
After all, I was Quan Jingting's son.

279
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,330
That surname,

280
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,120
etched into my blood,

281
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:58,920
was itself

282
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,460
an invisible harm to her.

283
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,490
And in my heart,

284
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,990
I too lived with that same torment.

285
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,350
I liked her,

286
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,230
so I didn't blame her.

287
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,750
I was willing to
bear all the pain for her.

288
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,510
The pain from the backlash

289
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,790
was actually easier to bear than
watching her forcibly swallow her hatred

290
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:18,720
all those years.

291
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,030
From now on...

292
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,400
never give your true heart
to the wrong person again.

293
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,400
The moment the Gu Mark disappeared,

294
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,010
I suddenly wanted to laugh.

295
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,930
It turned out she still didn't understand—

296
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,270
from the moment

297
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,920
she kidnapped me and healed my illness,

298
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,250
my life

299
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,800
had already belonged to her.

300
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,080
It's not worth it.

301
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,030
Why isn't it worth it?

302
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,280
You struggled so hard
to survive as a child...

303
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,770
yet you still mastered such swordsmanship.

304
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,400
With talent like yours,

305
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,470
you should never lay down your sword.

306
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:32,960
Ah.

307
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,010
I can accept you looking at me that way.

308
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,920
I'm a fool, and I know it.

309
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,440
Even so...

310
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,350
I never hated her.

311
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,750
How did you

312
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,600
find out about all this?

313
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,000
I only learned about it

314
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,080
much later from others.

315
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,790
I thought my father

316
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,430
had merely played with her mother's heart.

317
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,150
But who'd have known...

318
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,310
I underestimated him.

319
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,000
He somehow learned

320
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,600
that Weiyun possessed
the Water-Control Orb.

321
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,420
He also wanted that power.

322
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,560
And at that time, Long Weiyun

323
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:14,050
had just absorbed the Water-Control Orb

324
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,970
and couldn't fully control it.

325
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,890
He took advantage of it.

326
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,320
Quan Jingting,

327
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,510
today

328
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:25,180
I'll make you suffer a hundredfold
for what you did to my mother!

329
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,680
You dragon demons

330
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,830
are really stupid.

331
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,560
You actually walked into my trap.

332
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,360
Kill her!

333
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,720
Kill her!

334
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,960
You just said

335
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,910
you'd make me suffer a hundredfold
for the pain I caused your mother.

336
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,080
Do you know

337
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,300
how many times I cut off your mother's

338
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,400
dragon horns as they grew back,

339
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,070
huh?

340
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,440
You bastard!

341
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,880
I won't let you die so easily!

342
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,940
Do you know how miserably she screamed

343
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,950
when I scraped the scales from her body?

344
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,640
Quan Jingting!

345
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,720
Do you know...

346
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,720
why only your mother's skull remains?

347
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,700
I guessed right.

348
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,510
A berserk dragon loses its sense of self.

349
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:18,550
The violent power of the Water-Control Orb
will consume

350
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,730
a True Dragon's mind.

351
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,310
Oh no.

352
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,690
I can't let Weiyun rush into the town!

353
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,290
I must stop her here!

354
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,240
I'll kill you!

355
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,920
Even if I die,

356
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,410
I won't allow my Weiyun

357
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,790
to become so cruel!

358
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,310
Weiyun,

359
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,550
I know

360
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,080
you wouldn't hurt me.

361
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,480
You know it's me,

362
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,160
right?

363
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:07,350
Weiyun,

364
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,240
I'm Rumu.

365
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,680
The Rumu

366
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,790
who has followed you since childhood!

367
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,920
Have you forgotten?

368
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,900
I'm Rumu!

369
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,100
Quan...

370
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,880
Rumu...

371
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:40,750
Weiyun!

372
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:44,740
Weiyun!

373
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,480
Weiyun!

374
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,330
I'll take you home.

375
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,110
That day,

376
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,990
Weiyun and I were both gravely injured.

377
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,380
The Water-Control Orb

378
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,390
has been missing ever since.

379
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,420
♪ A gale blows, followed by rain ♪
