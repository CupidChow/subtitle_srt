[Episode 21]

3
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,970
If you like fish-shaped lanterns,

4
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,360
I can get you more.

5
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,370
Judging from the details of this lantern,

6
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,370
this is definitely
Young Master Fugui's handiwork.

7
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,210
I knew Young Master Fugui hadn't died!

8
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,360
He is in the Western Regions.

9
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,130
Sister, where are you going

10
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,000
without saying goodbye?

11
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,760
Qingcheng.

12
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,780
Qingcheng.

13
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,680
I recognize that fish-shaped lantern.

14
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,010
Young Master Fugui isn't dead.

15
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,120
He must be in the Western Regions now.

16
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,160
I have to find him.

17
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,930
Don't try to stop me.

18
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,970
Looks like you still haven't given up.

19
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,500
Very well then.

20
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,880
There are frequent sandstorms
in the Western Regions.

21
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,760
I can't let you

22
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,440
go alone.

23
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,650
I'll go with you.

24
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:34,600
Mm.

25
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,000
Rumu,

26
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,040
this… this isn't the way home.

27
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,680
Rumu,

28
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,760
where are you taking me?

29
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,880
Rumu,

30
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,320
this place is…

31
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,240
Quan Rumu!

32
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,820
You've got some nerve!

33
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,610
How dare you bring him here?

34
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,400
Weiyun,

35
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,290
I've brought him to you.

36
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,140
Do whatever you want with him.

37
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,520
Miss Long,

38
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,240
back then, I was possessed
by the Black Fox.

39
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,800
That's why I did those terrible things
to your mother.

40
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,320
Possessed by the Black Fox?

41
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,710
You think that excuses everything?

42
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,040
Miss Long,

43
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,680
even if

44
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,840
you cut me

45
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,120
into 1,000 pieces today,

46
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,960
I'd have no complaint.

47
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,880
I just want you to know—

48
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,560
I truly loved your mother.

49
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,920
Every time I think of her,

50
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,560
I'm filled with regret.

51
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,840
I'm a wreck now,

52
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:36,040
and I've long wished to die.

53
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,159
If I can die by your hand,

54
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,840
that will be my release.

55
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,720
Quan Rumu,

56
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,010
before I change my mind,

57
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,160
take your father and go home.

58
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:05,920
Weiyun.

59
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:07,840

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,520
Quan Rumu!

61
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,040
I thought I made myself clear last time.

62
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,000
Today is my birthday.

63
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,120
Do you remember

64
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,600
our agreement?

65
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,400
Master.

66
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,880
Master?

67
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,400
I've returned
to Sandstorm Town to get something.

68
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,080
Lantern Wang,

69
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,720
I have an urgent matter.

70
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,780
Could you help me write a letter home?

71
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,620
No problem.

72
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,000
Thank you.

73
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,530
I'm not sure how to write it.

74
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,640
I just want

75
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,720
to send my elder brother a letter

76
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,950
to tell him

77
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,600
I'm doing fine here,

78
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,560
so he won't worry.

79
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,440
Hey,

80
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,200
sir,

81
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,530
where did you buy this lantern?

82
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,600
There's a vendor around the corner.

83
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,660
He seems to be from the Yiqi Alliance.

84
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,680
Right over there.

85
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,000
Thank you.

86
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,680
Thank you!

87
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,440
Miss,

88
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,370
would you like to buy a lantern?

89
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,200
Sir,

90
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,440
did you

91
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,800
make all these yourself?

92
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,800
That's right.

93
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,130
I made every one of them.

94
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,320
I know a bit of fire magic,

95
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,520
so these lanterns
won't go out in the wind.

96
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,720
They sell quite well.

97
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,640
If you'd like one,

98
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,039
I'll give you a discount.

99
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,360
I heard you came from the Yiqi Alliance.

100
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,270
Do you know about the Soldier?

101
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,200
Who doesn't?

102
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,960
He consorted with demons.
That's strictly forbidden.

103
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,760
Though Chief is his father,

104
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,710
he executed him in public.

105
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,440
Many saw it with their own eyes.

106
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,980
Miss, why are you
suddenly asking about him?

107
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,520
Sister,

108
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,240
don't be sad.

109
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,320
Let's go home.

110
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,050
That's impossible.

111
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,400
That's impossible.

112
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,600
Why did you bring me here?

113
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,280
You promised me—

114
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,240
every year on my birthday,

115
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,720
you'd make it snow for me.

116
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,530
Do you remember?

117
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,220
Today, you really brought me here

118
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,480
just to let me make it snow for you?

119
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,240
Of course not.

120
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,650

♪ Then it's all worth it ♪

188
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,680
may be

189
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:44,960
the best

190
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,080
ending for us.

191
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,520
No.

192
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,240
Something's not right.

193
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,920
Everything happened too smoothly,

194
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,520
as if some unseen hand

195
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,920
was pushing me

196
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,960
to accept it all.

197
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,970
As for Young Master Fugui's death—

198
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,810
unless I see it with my own eyes,

199
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,720
I'll never believe anyone.

200
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:21,940
Qingcheng.

201
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,100
Sister.

202
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,700
I need to improve my cultivation faster.

203
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,340
Do you have any better way?

204
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,880
Of course I do.

205
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:33,880
It's just…

206
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,200
Just what?

207
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,280
Tell me!

208
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,880
Don't worry, Sister.

209
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,280
Whatever you want—

210
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,640
I can give it to you.

211
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,220
Qingcheng,

212
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,320
is this the place you mentioned

213
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,320
for cultivation?

214
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,730
What's wrong with them?

215
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,730
The former Qianji City Lord

216
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,440
left behind a journal
of secret techniques.

217
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,040
It records how to absorb

218
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,480
the demonic and spiritual power of others
and make it your own.

219
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,920
You've always been clever.

220
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,380
You'll learn it in no time.

221
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,120
You want me to use this method

222
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,040
to absorb their spiritual power?

223
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,040
This is your so-called good method?

224
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,280
What else then?

225
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,000
Sister,

226
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,000
think about the suffering we endured
when we were weak.

227
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,730
Think about how the Soldier
you loved most died.

228
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,100
Why do villains go unpunished

229
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,240
while the good die unjustly?

230
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,200
All of that

231
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,840
is because we were too kind.

232
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,000
We weren't ruthless enough.

233
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:53,860
Come on.

234
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,960
Just try it once,

235
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,880
and you'll get used to it.

236
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,440
It's not so hard.

237
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,840
No.

238
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,960
Absorbing their power like this

239
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,010
is no different from killing them.

240
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,180
This is dark magic.

241
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,440
Release them now.

242
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,720
Don't you hate the Yiqi Alliance so much

243
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,840
and want revenge?

244
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,280
As much as hatred

245
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,080
fills my heart,

246
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,440
I won't use a method like this

247
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,970
to improve my cultivation.

248
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:35,760
And you—

249
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,440
you're not allowed to do this either.

250
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,240
Do you hear me?

251
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,640
Fine.

252
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,440
I understand.

253
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,450
Is there really no other way

254
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,520
except this one?

255
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,290
[Space of Joy and Sorrow]

enter the Space of Joy and Sorrow.

258
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,730
The Space of Joy and Sorrow?

259
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,220
By the way, Qingcheng,

260
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:10,359
the cultivation book you gave me before

261
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,490
mentioned the Space of Joy and Sorrow.

262
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,700
What is it exactly?

263
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,900
Forget it, Sister.

264
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,099
That old monster gathered
all sorts of rare treasures,

265
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,210
but only the Space of Joy and Sorrow

266
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,140
was left untouched by anyone.

267
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,980
So what exactly is inside

268
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,450
the Space of Joy and Sorrow?

269
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,360
It's said

270
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,060
there's a tree seed inside

271
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,520
from the Grief Tree of Tushan.

272
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,620
Whoever refines it

273
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,340
can attain the supreme Power of Love.

274
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,400
But no one who's ever

275
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,850
entered the Space of Joy and Sorrow

276
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,120
has come out.

277
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,720
A tree seed…

278
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,880
The supreme Power of Love…

Qingcheng,

280
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,200
I want to try.

281
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,740
Qingcheng,

282
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,060
please let me go in.

283
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,200
I'm willing to pay any price.

284
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,880
Just let me try,

285
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,600
please?

286
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,760
I know you'd give your life

287
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,840
for the Soldier,

288
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,720
but I won't let you take the risk.

289
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:23,790
[The Quan family's dungeon at the border]

290
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,960
Don't you have anything

291
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,680
you want to say to me?

292
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,720
Fine.

293
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,600
For the rest of my life,

294
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,800
I'll stay in this dungeon

295
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,040
to repent for my sins.

296
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,720
From today on,

297
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,800
the Quan family

298
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,760
is yours to lead.

299
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,480
Rumu,

300
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,080
I know you long for freedom.

301
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,320
I'm sorry

302
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,160
for holding you back.

303
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,080
Master,

304
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,330
we've located the Water-Control Orb.

305
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,060
By some strange twist of fate,

306
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,360
it ended up in the hands of the second
prince of the Corsac Fox State.

307
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,960
It seems he ate it.

308
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,880
Ate it?

309
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,520
Yes.

310
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,520
Definitely

311
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,660
not something I expected.

312
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,260
Master,

313
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,760
shall we send someone

314
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,080
to the Corsac Fox State?

315
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,720
No need.

316
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,440
The Western Regions are complicated.

317
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,840
We shouldn't make a fuss.

318
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,640
Oh,

319
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,280
I heard the corsac fox royal family

320
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,680
is quite superstitious.

321
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,530
Yes, Master.

322
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,160
The entire corsac fox clan
believes in astrology.

323
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,720
Astrology…

324
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,440
Mm.

325
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,480
Young Master.

326
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,040
Hm?

327
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,280
Time for sword practice.

328
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,700
Are you feeling any better today?

329
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,000
Much better.

330
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,240
But look—

331
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,020
it's not even dawn yet.

332
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,760
Because you said this is the time

333
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,020
you practiced swordsmanship every day.

334
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,600
Who told you that?

335
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,360
You did.

336
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:54,880
Did I?

337
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,200
That was the old me.

338
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,440
It's alright.

339
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,280
I'm not in a hurry

340
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,720
to get the Water-Control Orb out.

341
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,760
I'm not in a hurry

342
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,270
to win Li Xueyang's heart either.

343
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,200
Sleep well.

344
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,400
Mm.

345
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,120
We're done with spiritual techniques
for now.

346
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,780
Next up is physical strength.

347
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,320
Master,

348
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,080
if I just keep
training like this every day,

349
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,600
can I really extract
the Water-Control Orb?

350
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,760
Of course.

351
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,810
The Water-Control Orb
holds violent energy,

352
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,320
yet this poor dog

353
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,850
shows no signs of backlash.

354
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,920
Perhaps

355
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,060
he really can refine
the Water-Control Orb.

356
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,210
No slacking.

357
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,340
More training?

358
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,160
Yes!

359
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,260
Prince Yunfei!

360
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,770
Greetings, Prince Yunfei.

361
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,440
His Majesty has paid a great sum

362
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,880
to invite a renowned astrologer

363
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,480
to perform a ritual
to bless the Corsac Fox State.

364
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,940
I'm here to bring you over.

365
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,250
Go ahead.

366
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,440
Astrologer?

367
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:45,610
[Fei]

368
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,200
Your Majesty.

369
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,160
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

370
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,480
Prince Yunfei is the one chosen by fate
to lead the Corsac Fox State.

371
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,360
However,

372
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,840
there is still one tribulation
he must overcome

373
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,640
before he can claim the throne.

374
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,200
Can this tribulation be overcome?

375
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,960
There is a way, of course.

376
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,600
All things in this world

377
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,660
follow the principle of yin and yang,

378
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,960
and the five elements
generate and restrain each other.

379
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,290
Follow the flow, and prosperity follows.

380
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,650
Go against it, and you defy Heaven.

381
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,570
What does that mean?

382
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,850
As long as Prince Yunfei

383
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,080
follows Heaven's will,
he can avoid disaster,

384
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,160
inherit the throne,

385
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,130
and ensure 500 years of prosperity

386
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,930
for the Western Regions.

387
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,560
The fox clan will thrive!

388
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,900
Really? That's wonderful!

389
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,600
Heaven's will—

390
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,800
what exactly is it?

391
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,710
From what I see,

392
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,000
Prince Yunfei has recently
encountered someone special.

393
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,660
It's a romantic tribulation.

394
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,920
Not only that—

395
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,560
this tribulation

396
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,880
is tied to destiny.

397
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,970
Tied to destiny?

398
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,120
Sir,

399
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,420
am I truly fated to be with her?

400
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,760
You must be Prince Yunfei.

401
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,180
Come, come.

402
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,560
Let me do a thorough reading for you.

403
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,960
Come on.

404
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,660
From what I see,

405
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,280
your destined one

406
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,600
seems

407
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,160
to be linked to the military.

408
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,960
You're…

409
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,600
incredibly accurate.

410
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,600
She really is a general.

411
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,220
Sir,

412
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,730
is Li Xueyang truly my destined one?

413
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,120
She is your heavenly fate.

414
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,760
But,

415
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,280
to know whether this blessing will last,

416
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,360
I need to perform

417
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,600
more detailed divination.

418
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,280
Wait.

419
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,580
Why are you shaking your head?

420
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,040
What's with the frown?

421
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,320
The prince's master is here.

422
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,000
Master.

423
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,880
Master?

424
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:29,720
Yes.

425
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,720
He's been guiding me in both demonic arts
and spiritual techniques.

426
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,320
Master,

427
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,670
this astrologer is really amazing!

428
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,790
He just said

429
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,380
Li Xueyang and I are destined
to be together.

430
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,570
Sounds impressive.

431
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,580
It's true.

432
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,040
Father,

433
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,040
I want this astrologer

434
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,840
to serve as my tutor too.

435
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,680
Alright.

436
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,600
The Eight Celestial Lodestars

437
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,200
and the signs from Brahma

438
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,760
all show that Prince Yunfei

439
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,140
and General Li are a fated match.

440
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,200
If they wed,

441
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,720
the Corsac Fox State

442
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,520
will thrive,

443
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,080
and all disasters will be averted.

444
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,160
Since you're so skilled,

445
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,320
could I ask you

446
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,800
to do a reading for me as well?

447
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,400
To connect with all things

448
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,320
is the only way
to fully perceive heaven and earth.

449
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,920
This is extremely exhausting.

450
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,120
I'm afraid

451
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,400
I can't do that again today.

452
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,360
Royal Master.

453
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,960
Royal Master.

454
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,960
What do you think of this astrologer?

455
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,000
Could he assist Yunfei

456
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,600
with you?

457
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,080
Though I'm too exhausted

458
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,420
to do another reading,

459
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,240
from your face alone,

460
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,400
I can tell you are

461
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,640
a man of kindness

462
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,680
and loyalty

463
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:54,920
and care a lot

464
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,320
for your family.

465
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,380
What do you think, Master?

466
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,380
Since the mood's already
built up like this…

467
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:11,600
fine.

468
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:12,960
Great.

469
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,920
In the Corsac Fox State, we've always
held astrology in high regard.

470
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,000
A heaven-sent astrologer to aid my son—

471
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,400
it's an auspicious sign.

472
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:19,920
Yunfei,

473
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,990
come with me
to pay our respects to our ancestors.

474
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,520
Let's go.

475
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,520
Let's go.

476
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,440
All dressed up like some creepy psychic—

477
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,040
you've really suffered for this role.

478
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,000
Exactly.

479
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,040
It ruined my personal charm.

480
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,320
But I don't understand.

481
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,660
These silly foxes

482
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:43,690
are too easily fooled, aren't they?

483
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,920
Let's go.

484
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,760
I really didn't expect

485
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,620
to see you sitting here drinking.

486
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,100
You can't tell
it's the sea buckthorn juice?

487
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,120
Well,

488
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,800
I wasn't paying attention.

489
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,400
Fugui,

490
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,400
why did you

491
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,480
give me your sword meridian?

492
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,840
You don't want it?

493
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:24,960
Fine.

494
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,730
If you don't want it,

495
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,960
give it back to me.

496
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:30,680
It's…

497
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,770
impossible to give it back now.

498
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,880
I won't go all sentimental about it.

499
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:36,800
Fugui,

500
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,360
from now on,

501
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,560
I'm your man.

502
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:41,410
There's no need for that.

503
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,080
Master.

504
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,520
Your foolish apprentice is here.

505
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,520
Did he truly

506
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,400
swallow the Water-Control Orb?

507
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,160
I think he's able to control it.

508
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,120
That is the sacred relic
of the True Dragon Clan.

509
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:56,600
Fugui,

510
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,700
don't you think

511
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,020
it's quite insulting…

512
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,490
quite a sacrilege
against this sacred relic?

513
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,080
True Dragon Power

514
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,960
knows no race.

515
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,360
Master.

516
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,470
Your Highness.

517
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,280
I'm back.

518
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,440
Oh, right.

519
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,260
Father asked me for your title, sir.

520
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:13,920
Title?

521
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,290
What do you call him?

522
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,320
Royal Master.

523
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:19,640
Fine.

524
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,800
Then call me

525
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,520
Celestial Master.

526
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,730
Greetings, Celestial Master.

527
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,440
I've heard you're a prodigious talent

528
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,640
and have learned swordplay
from your master.

529
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,440
Is that right?

530
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,320
I've learned a bit.

531
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,480
Show me.

532
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,400
Okay.

533
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,760
Fugui,

534
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,320
to be honest with you,

535
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,880
are you sure
you didn't pick the wrong person?

536
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,840
This guy

537
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,270
can handle the Water-Control Orb?

538
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,160
Look at that footwork—

539
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,760
so clumsy and incoherent,

540
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,120
like he's drunk.

541
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,020
Is he intoxicated or what?

542
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,210
Celestial Master,
are you complimenting me?

543
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,160
Yes.

544
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,090
You're doing great.

545
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,030
Keep going.

546
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,240
Fugui, is the Water-Control Orb

547
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,790
truly impossible to extract?

548
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,350
Have you tried a laxative?

549
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,240
They work wonders.

550
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,570
His heart is pure.

551
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,120
He just hasn't awakened yet.

552
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,640
I believe the little spider
is pure-hearted,

553
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,640
but this guy...

554
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,620
-Your Highness.
-Where is Qingtong?

555
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,420
The Celestial Master says
he has a special method

556
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,090
that can help you awaken quickly.

557
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,310
Go study with him.

558
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,720
Royal Master…

559
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,360
Please,

560
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,690
Celestial Master, give me some guidance.

561
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,690
The entrance
to the Space of Joy and Sorrow

562
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,880
is actually inside the Asura Hall.

563
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,560
Sister!

564
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,880
Sister.

565
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:16,960
Qingcheng.

566
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,440
Sister,

567
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,680
trust me.

568
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,080
You cannot enter
the Space of Joy and Sorrow.

569
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:23,740
Qingcheng,

570
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,900
don't worry.

571
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,500
I will definitely be fine.

572
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,080
Fine.

573
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Then I'll let you see with your own eyes

574
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,600
how terrifying it is inside.

575
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,800
Anyone who enters
the Space of Joy and Sorrow

576
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,960
will surely die.

577
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,200
If one person enters,

578
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,080
the entrance will be sealed,

579
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,040
and no one else can enter.

580
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,520
At that point,
even if I wanted to save you,

581
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,800
I would have no way to.

582
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,320
But I still want to try.

583
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,710
Sister,

584
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,900
is it that hard to forget Wangquan Fugui?

585
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,120
If you

586
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:20,170
are willing
to throw away your life for him,

587
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,260
then I will no longer be
an obedient brother.

588
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,080
Starting today,

589
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,180
don't even think about
leaving Qianji City.

590
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,840
Don't you have your own room?

591
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,160
I do.

592
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,120
Fugui,

593
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,250
I just want to have
an all-night talk with you.

594
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,480
Talk, my foot.

595
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,520
Actually,

596
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,490
we can talk about your foot.

597
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,520
I'm curious about something—

598
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,610
where is the little spider?

599
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,120
I saw her message in the woods.

600
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,800
It said she left.

601
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,360
But her departure

602
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,760
seemed a little strange.

603
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,060
When I was exiled,
a seal was placed on me.

604
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,480
I can't leave the Western Regions
without permission,

605
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,800
so I haven't been able to set out

606
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,080
to look for her.

607
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:22,810
However,

608
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,139
the little spider is very clever.

609
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:26,960
Currently,

610
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,920
I can sense that she's not in any danger.

611
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,480
If there's a chance,

612
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,040
we'll all meet again.

613
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,040
Since I'm here,

614
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,480
I'll help you look for Qingtong.

615
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:46,280
You came here for the Water-Control Orb,
didn't you?

616
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:46,920
What else?

617
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,280
Look at how I'm dressed—

618
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,280
I look like some creepy psychic.

619
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:49,679
I...

620
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,080
I don't want this either.

621
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,080
But I told you

622
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:56,100
I saw Long Weiyun
turn into a berserk dragon.

623
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:56,679
So,

624
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,400
I won't just stand by and do nothing.

625
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,200
Rumu,

626
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,320
the poor dog is kind-natured.

627
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,440
Why don't we just
leave the Water-Control Orb

628
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,760
inside him for now?

629
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,100
If the poor dog

630
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,940
can become the master
of the Water-Control Orb,

631
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,960
that would be a great help to us.

632
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,130
Drink some of it.

633
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,460
Come on.

634
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,160
If you don't want to talk to me, fine.

635
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,420
Anyway, you won't eat,

636
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,700
and I won't eat either.

637
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,680
No matter what you do,

638
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,340
I won't let you enter
the Space of Joy and Sorrow.

639
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,560
Sister,

640
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
is having me by your side not enough?

641
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,840
He is already dead!

642
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,240
Is a dead man

643
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,840
truly more important than me,
a living person?

644
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,800
Qingcheng,

645
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,140
you can trap me for a while,

646
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,090
but can you trap me forever?

647
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,440
Sister, do you still remember

648
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,320
when we were little spiders?

649
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,500
Our lives were as insignificant as dust.

650
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,770
A single breeze could blow us away.

651
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,720
Yet, you were always full of life,

652
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,720
encouraging me to live for myself.

653
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,800
Now we have enough demon power

654
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,060
to protect ourselves,

655
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,880
but you want to give up everything

656
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,960
for a person

657
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,440
who no longer exists.

658
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,680
Is it really worth it?

659
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,970
We used to depend on each other
to survive.

660
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,040
Now,

661
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,940
and in the future, it will be the same.

662
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,490
If anything happens to you,

663
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,930
I won't go on living either.

664
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,320
Qingcheng,

665
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,120
the soup is a bit cold.

666
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,240
I'll go heat it up right away.

667
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,560
Sister,

668
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,570
have you truly come around?

669
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:36,720
Yeah.

670
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:38,920
You are right.

671
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,520
Back then, we didn't have a choice.

672
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,080
But now, we do.

673
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,200
I'm going to live for myself

674
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:48,420
and for Young Master Fugui too.

675
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,400
Qianji City

676
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,600
is our hope.

677
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Let the past

678
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,880
be the past.

679
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:00,920
Good.

680
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,040
But you—

681
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,360
you're a boy.

682
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,680
Don't cry all the time.

683
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,800
No girl will want you like that.

684
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,000
I've got you.

685
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:28,160
[Qianji Hall]

686
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:33,920
Qingcheng,

687
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,740
everything you said is right,

688
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,240
but my fate…

689
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,330
I must decide it myself.

690
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,640
[Space of Joy and Sorrow]

691
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,520
Who are you?

692
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,020
Why have you come here?

693
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:36,320
[Statue of Goddess]

694
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,170
My name is Qingtong.

695
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,560
I have come for the Power of Love.

696
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,600
I voluntarily accept
the trial of the Space of Joy and Sorrow.

697
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,730
The trial of the Space of Joy and Sorrow

698
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,280
is this seed of the Grief Tree.

699
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,960
Only a human or demon
whose love is truly pure and true

700
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,080
can make the seed take root

701
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,120
and gain its power.

702
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,200
However,

703
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,480
you must undergo
the trial of the deep-seated

704
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,940
hatred within your heart.

705
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,160
If you fail,

706
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,520
you will be consumed by hatred

707
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,400
and eternally frozen here.

708
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,840
Have you truly decided

709
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,320
to accept this trial?

710
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,280
Yes.

711
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,200
Alright.

712
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,040
As you wish.

713
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,840
So it's the little spider.

714
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,640
Do you really think
that meager bit of your demon power

715
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,120
is enough to make the Grief Tree's seed
take root and sprout?

716
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,560
I'd like to see

717
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,520
how you'll make it take root and sprout.
