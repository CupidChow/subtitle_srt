00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,930
[Sword and Beloved]

2
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,470
[Episode 24]

3
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:57,870
Qingtong!

4
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,789
Don't go, Qingtong!

5
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:00,840
Qingtong!

6
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,070
Qingtong!

7
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,120
Don't go, Qingtong!

8
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,710
Don't leave me again,

9
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,870
Qingtong...

10
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,240
Wang... Quan... Fu... Gui!

11
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,730
Lord Qingcheng.

12
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,390
It's all my fault for failing in my duty.

13
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,560
Governor had just set out toward
the Western Regions

14
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,910
when she...

15
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,030
When she went missing.

16
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,360
You know what?

17
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,000
My sister's eyes

18
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,310
are the most precious treasure
in this world,

19
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,190
and her smile

20
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,470
is the most beautiful sight
I've ever seen.

21
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,310
But she left.

22
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,900
Little Spider, you know what?

23
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,190
Your sister has refined a tree seed.

24
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,310
With your current strength,

25
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,710
there's no way

26
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,110
you can stop her from
going after her Young Master Fugui.

27
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,710
Did you possess me

28
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,520
just to make snide remarks?

29
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,150
Hurry up and think of a way to help me.

30
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,710
If you can help Madam

31
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,190
carry out Quan Jingting's plan,

32
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,630
you'll gain the power

33
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,750
to stand up to the Soldier.

34
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,079
Then, when you kill the Soldier,

35
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,120
your sister will naturally
come back to you.

36
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,280
The story of Qianxia Kingdom's last queen

37
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,000
is indeed thrilling.

38
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,870
The Myriad Blight Formation
can restore Madam to a physical body

39
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,240
and make the Black Grief Tree grow again—

40
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,150
is all that

41
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,710
true?

42
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,030
Absolutely true.

43
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,310
Master said

44
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,150
as long as
the Myriad Blight Formation is activated,

45
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,070
Madam Black Fox

46
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,600
will regain the full power she had
at her prime.

47
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,329
Since Quan Jingting provided
this information,

48
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,190
he must want to

49
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,510
get something from Madam.

50
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,800
Master said

51
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,480
his loyalty to Madam

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
is as clear as daylight,

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,920
and the mountains and rivers
bear witness to it.

54
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,720
I wonder

55
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,159
if you could convey this message

56
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,490
to Madam Black Fox, Sir?

57
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,159
In that case,

58
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,830
Quan Jingting,

59
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,830
I'll help you reaffirm your loyalty

60
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,800
to Madam Black Fox.

61
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,390
And I'll show Madam

62
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,040
what this lowly spider

63
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,600
is capable of.

64
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:34,680
[Corsac Fox State]

65
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:43,100
[Corsac Fox State]

66
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,870
Father-in-law, Mother-in-law.

67
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,600
Today,

68
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,409
I'm entrusting my daughter to you.

69
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,720
Do you remember what I said to you?

70
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,480
Of course.

71
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,170
I'll skin you alive.

72
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,430
What was that?

73
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,040
No,

74
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,160
I mean,

75
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,190
if I ever betray Xueyang,

76
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,390
you can skin me alive.

77
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,240
Hmm,

78
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,560
that's more like it.

79
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,510
All right, all right.

80
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,270
You've gone and scared him again.

81
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,830
Look how nervous he is.

82
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,760
I'm not nervous.

83
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,800
I'm not nervous at all.

84
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,690
If you're not nervous,

85
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,920
then why are you holding my hand?

86
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,690
This is my first time getting married.

87
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,390
I don't have much experience.

88
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,120
And how many more times
do you plan to get married?

89
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,830
Father.

90
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,480
Silly boy.

91
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,370
Today,

92
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,040
I'm officially

93
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,360
entrusting Xueyang to you.

94
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,050
Father-in-law.

95
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,950
I've made a vow.

96
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,310
Xueyang.

97
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,120
I, Poor Dog,

98
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,500
will never let you down in this lifetime.

99
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,400
All right.

100
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,250
You should go in.

101
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,240
Welcome, Your Highness.

102
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:44,940
[Corsac Fox State]

103
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,120
A match made in heaven.

104
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,200
May your hearts be united forever.

105
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,600
Today, in the Western Regions,

106
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,000
twin blossoms bloom.

107
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,680
Human and fox pledge to each other,

108
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,120
forming a happy union.

109
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,190
Corsac Fox Prince
and the Li's female general,

110
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,870
through life and death together,

111
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,470
with no regrets till the end.

112
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,720
Newlyweds, kneel before your father,
His Majesty.

113
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,030
As the sun rises in the east
and sets in the west,

114
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:44,080
may the Corsac Fox Spirit
protect and grant everlasting blessings.

115
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,120
May the newlyweds' affection
be as deep as the sea,

116
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,520
and may heaven and earth
forever bless you.

117
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,120
Please rise.

118
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:57,960
Good.

119
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,130
From today onwards,

120
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,510
our Corsac Fox State will witness
a new legend.

121
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,270
Let the blessings begin!

122
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,390
Promise Scepter!

123
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,960
Promise Scepter,

124
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:41,200
may the Corsac Fox Spirit
protect and bless forever!

125
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,970
What's happening?

126
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,770
Xueyang!

127
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,480
Xueyang.

128
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,010
Xueyang.

129
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,720
My son.

130
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,130
Luckily, you're foolish,

131
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,560
or else this plan

132
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,240
wouldn't have gone so perfectly.

133
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,240
What're you trying to do?

134
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,750
Xueyang.

135
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,720
Xueyang!

136
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,720
Xueyang.

137
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,790
Xueyang!

138
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,000
Son.

139
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,600
In the Western Regions,

140
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,510
we've always had
sand painting performances,

141
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,750
telling the stories of

142
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,750
the Dragon Clan, the Qianxia Kingdom,

143
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,630
and our Corsac Fox Clan.

144
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,480
Have you ever seen one?

145
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,320
I said,

146
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,980
put her down!

147
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,090
You useless thing!

148
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,440
Listen to me!

149
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,240
That's merely a woman.

150
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,510
If you don't listen,

151
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,040
I'll kill her immediately!

152
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,480
Yunfei.

153
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,150
The stories
in the sand painting performances

154
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,120
have all been polished by me.

155
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,030
Do you want to hear

156
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,750
the real version?

157
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,120
It's just

158
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,080
the truth is a bit cruel.

159
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,290
It's about time for you

160
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,320
to wake up from your dream.

161
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,840
1,000 years ago, the Western Regions

162
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,430
were far from
as peaceful as they are today.

163
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,790
During the era when the berserk dragons
ran rampant,

164
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,440
yellow sands blotted out the sun,

165
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,700
and dragon claws tore through villages.

166
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,550
The cries of the people
echoed across the desert.

167
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,510
The people were like
fallen leaves in the wind,

168
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,510
struggling to survive
amidst bloodshed and chaos.

169
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,520
When the entire Western Regions
were in despair,

170
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,320
the Queen of the Qianxia Kingdom
of the human race,

171
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,230
Gulizan, stepped forward.

172
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:49,030
She led a joint force of humans and demons
to fight the berserk dragons.

173
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,670
She even devised a plan to seize
the Dragon Clan leader's dragon spine,

174
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:56,210
which became the key
to turning the situation around.

175
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,910
The strength of the Western Regions
increased dramatically,

176
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,600
gradually becoming capable of
resisting the berserk dragons.

177
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,390
However, the good times did not last.

178
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:06,840
The berserk dragons made a resurgence,
wielding the Water-Control Orb,

179
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,240
the ultimate treasure of the Dragon Clan.

180
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,320
Torrential floods swept across the land,
bringing more bloodshed and chaos.

181
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,200
The human-demon allied forces
were riddled with casualties,

182
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,270
and the demon clan was nearly wiped out,
with only 1 in 10 surviving.

183
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,550
Once again, the Western Regions
plunged into a deep abyss of despair.

184
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,950
At that critical moment,

185
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,910
the leader of the Corsac Fox State,

186
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,030
your grandfather,

187
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,900
devised with Queen Gulizan
a strategy to break the deadlock.

188
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,060
They decided to use

189
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,110
the forbidden secret art
of the Qianxia Kingdom,

190
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,280
the Myriad Blight Formation,

191
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,860
as their final trump card

192
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,910
to engage in a life-or-death battle
with the berserk dragons.

193
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,960
But the Myriad Blight Formation
came with a cruel condition:

194
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,360
it required the life force of
the human, demon, and dragon clans

195
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,540
as a sacrifice to unleash
the world-shattering power.

196
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,510
In their final stand, the Qianxia Kingdom

197
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:52,720
and the remaining demons
gritted their teeth and decided

198
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:56,270
to sacrifice some of their people
to activate the formation.

199
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,600
However, at the moment of the sacrifice,
your grandfather,

200
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,840
looking at the last surviving cubs
of the Corsac Fox Clan,

201
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,470
couldn't bring himself
to go through with it.

202
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,670
He led our people to flee from the altar.

203
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:07,960
In the end,

204
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,360
this forced the human race

205
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,380
to fill the gap with the lives
of their entire kingdom.

206
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,850
In an instant,

207
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,040
blood soaked the Qianxia Kingdom,

208
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:19,030
and Queen Gulizan was sealed by
the Myriad Blight Formation,

209
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,550
buried alongside the berserk dragons
beneath the yellow sands.

210
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,030
1,000 years

211
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,270
passed in the blink of an eye.

212
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:27,790
The humans who survived the catastrophe
changed their surname to "Li"

213
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,750
and established their roots
in the Western Regions,

214
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,200
forming the Li Army.

215
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,240
Son,

216
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,170
do you think your grandfather

217
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,550
was wrong?

218
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,630
Of course he was.

219
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,510
Silly boy.

220
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,550
Do you think that without the Dragon Clan,

221
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:50,010
the Qianxia Kingdom
would have accepted us?

222
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,840
The Qianxia Kingdom's royal family

223
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,640
would have seen every demon clan

224
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,520
as a potential evil dragon clan,

225
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,000
and the weak Corsac Fox Clan

226
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,930
would have been the first to be wiped out.

227
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,750
Therefore,

228
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,400
your grandfather wasn't wrong.

229
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,580
He ensured our entire clan survived,

230
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,350
becoming the only demon king

231
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,440
in the Western Regions.

232
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,030
The descendants of the Li family

233
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,690
have long forgotten
the bloodshed of that time,

234
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,120
but the Corsac Fox State
hasn't dared to forget.

235
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,910
Every grain of sand
is soaked in old hatred,

236
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,920
and every gust of wind
carries with it an oath.

237
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,960
Though they've gradually forgotten
these things,

238
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,060
the dragon spine from that time

239
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,950
was passed down by them,

240
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,110
which has been a monkey on my back.

241
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,370
And the one
who now inherits the dragon spine

242
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,480
is her,

243
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,510
Li Xueyang.

244
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,910
It must have been fate,

245
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,310
all written in the stars.

246
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,790
I never expected

247
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,750
that you two would end up together.

248
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,840
This actually saved me a lot of trouble.

249
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,320
Yunfei.

250
00:15:59,030 --> 00:15:59,760
Today,

251
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,260
I'm going to do something

252
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,970
that will create a new legend
for our Corsac Fox State.

253
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,230
Imperial Preceptor!

254
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,880
What are you going to do?

255
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,650
What are you going to do!

256
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,870
Pull out the dragon spine.

257
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,840
Why on earth do you

258
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,930
have to do this?

259
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,510
Why do I have to do this?

260
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,700
These days, the evil aura of

261
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,300
the Water-Control Orb has gradually faded.

262
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,230
The Imperial Preceptor found that

263
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,030
as long as one possesses the dragon spine,
dragon scales, and the Water-Control Orb,

264
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,750
even if they're not from
the True Dragon Clan,

265
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,320
they'd still gain True Dragon Power.

266
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,390
Today,

267
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,410
I'll pull out her dragon spine

268
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,260
and implant it into your body.

269
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,870
My son, after you gain True Dragon Power,

270
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:05,680
you'll become the real overlord
of the Western Regions.

271
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,510
I don't want the so-called
True Dragon Power.

272
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,829
If you dare hurt her,

273
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,030
I won't live on alone!

274
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,490
Well, that's not up to you.

275
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,000
Stop.

276
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,550
Stop!

277
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,829
Stop!

278
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:22,829
No...

279
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:24,690
Don't hurt her!

280
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,589
No!

281
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,240
Poor Dog.

282
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:45,770
Xueyang!

283
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,840
Playing dumb to trap the tiger, huh?

284
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,860
You sly old fox.

285
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,000
You've hidden your intention really well.

286
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
How could this be?

287
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,480
The demon poison I used today
is the Blood Scorpion Toxin

288
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,680
passed down through
generations of our Corsac Fox State.

289
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,590
How could you not have been affected?

290
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,200
Because we were prepared.

291
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,000
Even if you saw through it,
there's nothing you could do.

292
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,550
The demon poison has already
reached your hearts.

293
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,880
No one from the Li family

294
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,720
can be saved.

295
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,520
The Dongfang Blood
that can neutralize all poisons?

296
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,070
Who are you exactly?

297
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,850
Channel your demon power to catalyze it.

298
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:52,430
Okay.

299
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,640
Surnamed Wang...

300
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,210
Plus the Dongfang Blood...

301
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,440
Could it be that you're the Soldier

302
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,680
who was exiled to the Western Regions?

303
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,880
That's right.

304
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,580
What he was going to do is obvious.

305
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,970
It's about time

306
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,830
the throne changed hands, right?

307
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,290
The Fox Clan is cunning

308
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,320
and always keeps a backup plan.

309
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,400
Why didn't you kill me?

310
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,450
The Triple Transfer Talisman?

311
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,080
Fugui,

312
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,160
this talisman is very rare.

313
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,290
Why does he have one?

314
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,880
I have no idea.

315
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,750
But I left a tracking mark

316
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,110
on Poor Dog.

317
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,270
We can locate him.

318
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,440
So...

319
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,270
What should we do now?

320
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,080
Save them.

321
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,680
You have to help me catalyze
the spiritual blood.

322
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,550
What about Poor Dog?

323
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,480
Save them first.

324
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,480
Rumu.

325
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,140
Poor Dog's not stupid;

326
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,680
he's just pure-hearted.

327
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,550
A pure heart

328
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,960
won't necessarily lose to
a thousand-year-old fox.

329
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,310
I believe in

330
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,040
the demon I chose myself.

331
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,030
Rumu,

332
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,310
help me refine the spiritual blood.

333
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,000
Yunfei.

334
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,310
Stop struggling in vain.

335
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,160
You can't possibly defeat me.

336
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,380
[Secret Chamber, Corsac Fox State]

337
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,270
You'll only end up more badly hurt.

338
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,530
Every brick in these walls

339
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,570
is inscribed with a Spirit-Sealing Curse.

340
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,680
Except for me,

341
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,800
everyone—human or demon—

342
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,490
can use
only a tenth of their spiritual power.

343
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,110
So,

344
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,550
stop your pointless resistance

345
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
and hand her over to me obediently.

346
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,400
If you hurt her,

347
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,650
it'll only be over my dead body.

348
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,070
Son.

349
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,440
You're so naive.

350
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,070
Let him go!

351
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,640
Father.

352
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,360
I'm begging you.

353
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,940
Please don't hurt her.

354
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:24,550
Father!

355
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:25,880
Father!

356
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,480
Father!

357
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,070
Father!

358
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,290
I'm begging you!

359
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,640
Please don't hurt her!

360
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:38,880
Father...

361
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,110
Father!

362
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,920
Father!

363
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,440
I'm begging you!

364
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,920
Please don't hurt her!

365
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,270
Father!

366
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,110
Father!

367
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,200
Father!

368
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,270
Father!

369
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,680
The dragon spine.

370
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,590
That's Xueyang's dragon spine.

371
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,350
I won't take it even if I die!

372
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,350
It's not up to you.

373
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,270
Yunfei.

374
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,510
The dragon spine will make you stronger,

375
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,080
but it will also make you more ruthless.

376
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,720
Don't resist it.

377
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,730
Let the Corsac Fox Clan
reign over the Western Regions.

378
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:57,400
This is your destiny as the Crown Prince
of the Corsac Fox Clan.

379
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,030
Get lost!

380
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,070
I'm old.

381
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,040
I don't have much time left.

382
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,310
So,

383
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,310
only by making you sever all emotions

384
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:12,150
can I protect the thousand-year foundation
of our Corsac Fox State.

385
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,510
Get lost!

386
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,720
Yunfei.

387
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,530
You have to understand

388
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,130
that the ones you should love

389
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,960
are the countless citizens
of our Corsac Fox State.

390
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,160
Give up on that woman.

391
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,790
Why don't you just act
as if she never existed?

392
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,920
Actually, there's nothing to regret.

393
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,110
The final step of the ritual

394
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,030
is for you to personally kill her

395
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,170
once you've severed all emotions.

396
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,920
By then,

397
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,640
ashes to ashes,

398
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,440

399
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,070
You'll no longer remember

400
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,750
that she ever existed.

401
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,550
No.

402
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:08,960
No.

403
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,170
No.

404
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,310
No.

405
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,030
No!

406
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,000
Ashes to ashes.

407
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,070
Dust to dust.

408
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:25,840
I'll no longer remember she ever existed.

409
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,310
Kill her...

410
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,550
Kill her...

411
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,070
Kill her...

412
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,940
She won't cease to exist.

413
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,400
She won't cease to exist.

414
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,640
She won't cease to exist.

415
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,470
She won't.

416
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,080
I won't allow it!

417
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,310
Poor Dog!

418
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,680
Drop the knife in your hand.

419
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,960
If you kill him,

420
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:27,370
you'll be completely consumed
by demonic corruption.

421
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,550

422
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,350

my Poor Dog

424
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,160

I'll count to three.

426
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,640
Put down your knife.

00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,440
The present

556
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,409
is more important than anything.

557
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,400
Fan Yuanji, come out!

558
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,440
You harmed my daughter's dragon spine.

559
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,300
Today, I'm here to take your life!

560
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,230
Come out!

561
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,280
If you don't come out right now,

562
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,080
I'll level this darn hall to the ground!

563
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,000
Father.

564
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,440
Daughter.

565
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,040
Are you feeling better?

566
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:15,630
Yes.

567
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,060
What's this supposed to mean?

568
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,510
Previously, my father lost his mind,

569
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,960
wanting to seize the dragon spine

570
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,360
to ensure the prosperity of our clan
for generations to come.

571
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,620
His greed led him to make a grave mistake.

572
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,190
The elders of our clan decided

573
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:48,050
to send him to the Huntian Prison.

574
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,440
I believe my father

575
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:53,330
will soon realize his mistake
and return to the right path.

576
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,280
It's true.

577
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,160
He's been sent away.

578
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:02,880
Don't think that because of this,

579
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,330
I'll let my daughter marry you.

580
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,840
In your dreams!

581
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,630
If I don't skin you alive today,

582
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,890
consider yourself...

583
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,110
Father!

584
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,010
That's enough.

585
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,050
Come on, get up.

586
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,690
Don't you get up.

587
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,670
Get up!

588
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,800
I'll see if you dare!

589
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,480
I'll count to three.

590
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:33,670
You...

591
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:34,920
Father.

592
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,330
For me, Yunfei even managed

593
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,690
to suppress the Breath of Berserk Dragon.

594
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,710
He has not failed me.

595
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,880
That's still unacceptable.

596
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,760
Because he's Fan Yuanji's son.

597
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,280
Like father, like son.

598
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,360
He may love you and protect you now,

599
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,630
but once his feelings fade,

600
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,960
he'll surely deceive you and abandon you.

601
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,000
Be good.

602
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,030
Today,

603
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,880
I'll vent your anger for you properly.

604
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,510
Father!

605
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,820
If you have to hit someone, hit me.

606
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,230
Daughter,

607
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:11,150
why are you doing this?

608
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,190
Father.

609
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,660
Since the day I put on the armor

610
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,720
and inherited the dragon spine,

611
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,840
you've told me

612
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,400
that those who bear arms

613
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,340
do not fight for the sake of fighting,

614
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,550
but to end war.

615
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,860
Don't be silly, Daughter.

616
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,830
Although he treats you well now,

617
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,440
he has the Water-Control Orb
inside his body.

618
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,170
He'll turn into a berserk dragon
sooner or later.

619
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,230
With the Soldier's help,

620
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:56,440
the Water-Control Orb
has been completely refined by Yunfei.

621
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,400
No one else

622
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,880
can ever get the Water-Control Orb,

623
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,760
including our Li Army.

624
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,440
What do you mean exactly?

625
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,440
Just to be safe,

626
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,280
and to prevent any more pointless conflict

627
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,840
in the Western Regions,

628
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,630
Yunfei and I have decided

629
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,040
to leave the Corsac Fox State together.

630
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,380
You're doing this just for this brat?

631
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,360
It's not just for him.

632
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,290
More importantly,

633
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:02,000
the Western Regions I've protected
for so many years

634
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,270
can't fall into chaos again.

635
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:22,880
Daughter,

636
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,020
are you abandoning me?

637
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,430
Please grant my wish.

638
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:21,110
If you dare wrong my daughter again,

639
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,550
I'll skin you alive!

640
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:32,960
Does it hurt?

641
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,440
My father really didn't hold back.

642
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:51,240
Compared to being able to rule
the Western Regions by your side,

643
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:52,880
I can endure

644
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,480
all of this.

645
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,070
Wangquan Fugui.

646
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,000
Humans live 100 years at most.

647
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:30,030
You actually burned your life

648
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,490
to save a lowly corsac fox?

649
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,630
If the Soldier's life is truly consumed
because of this,

650
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:36,360
then no one can break the circle
for Madam, right?

651
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:38,510
I had planned to let him
fall into endless hatred,

652
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:41,030
to make him willingly break the circle
for Madam.

653
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,800
Can that plan still work?

654
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,110
The plan remains unchanged,

655
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,880
but we must

656
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,740
make other preparations as well.

657
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:53,230
The gift brought by Quan Jingting
is exactly what I wanted.

658
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,030
As long as Little Spider
can wake up Gulizan

659
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,590
and help her activate
the Myriad Blight Formation,

660
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:02,110
I can transform into a physical form,

661
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,200
and the Black Grief Tree
will be nourished.

662
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,110
By then,

663
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,130
as love fades and hatred grows,

664
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,940
all of your powers
will surge dramatically.

665
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:14,070
Congratulations in advance, Madam,

666
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,530
for fulfilling your wish.

667
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,070
Black Grief Tree.

668
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,640
Prepare to receive the nourishment of
the overwhelming Power of Hatred

669
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,670
and help me take on a physical form.

670
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:35,040
[Ruins of Qianxia Kingdom]

671
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,920
According to the information
Quan Jingting provided,

672
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,190
this should be

673
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,820
the ruins of the Qianxia Kingdom.

674
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,630
1,000 years have passed.

675
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,000
It's time for the Western Regions

676
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,360
to finally pay off their blood debt
to Gulizan.

677
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:33,690
With my blood as the offering,

678
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,090
I summon the power of the night.

679
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,560
I pray that you, who slumber in silence,

680
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,880
awaken once more!

681
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:24,730
[Queen of Qianxia Kingdom, Gulizan]

682
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,760
Who are you?

683
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:32,170
You've slept for 1,000 years.

684
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:34,760
Have you forgotten who you are

685
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:36,920
and the pain in your heart?

686
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,960
1,000 years?

687
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:42,150
So it's been 1,000 years.

688
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:45,110
Interesting.

689
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,280
I didn't expect that after all this time,

690
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,910
someone would still remember me, Gulizan.

691
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,320
Tell me.

692
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,630
You've awakened me
after crossing 1,000 years of time.

693
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:57,230
What is it that you want to do,

694
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,370
and what do you seek to gain?

695
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,000
Of course, I had a purpose in waking you.

696
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:04,150
I need you to set up
the Myriad Blight Formation

697
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:06,780
and help Madam
break free from her confinement.

698
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:07,590
Madam?

699
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,840
You mean Madam Black Fox?

700
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:11,360
She's still alive?

701
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:13,010
This doesn't concern you.

702
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:15,010
Remember the hatred in your heart

703
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:16,840
and do what you must do.

704
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,360
Everything you need,

705
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:21,360
I will provide.

706
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,680
After all, you're the only one who can
command the Myriad Blight Formation.

707
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:30,400
Young man,

708
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,550
remember your promise.

709
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,590
If you lie to me,

710
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:37,110
I'll cast you into an abyss forever,

711
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:39,070
with no chance of reincarnation.
