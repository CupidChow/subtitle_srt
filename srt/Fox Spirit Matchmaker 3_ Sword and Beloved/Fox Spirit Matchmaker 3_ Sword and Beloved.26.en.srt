Qingtong.

4
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,750
As long as the whole world believes

5
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,470
that you killed them,

6
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,030
by then,

7
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,079
Qianji City will be your only refuge.

8
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,860
The shape of this wound...

9
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,240
Could it be…

10
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,430
Lady Hero,

11
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,240
this…

12
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,440
this was left by the killer.

13
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,500
[Wangquan Shouren will die
on the night of Frost's Descent.]

14
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,470
Ridiculous.

15
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,800
There's no way
this could've been done by Fugui.

16
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,730
Because the murdered Master Ximen

17
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,079
and Elder Shouren
mentioned in the killer's message—

18
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,400
the thing they had in common

19
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,910
was that they'd both
opposed Senior Fugui before.

20
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,110
So now rumors are spreading everywhere

21
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,800
that Senior Fugui
has returned for revenge.

22
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,120
I believe in him.

23
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,740
He'd never do such a thing.

24
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,350
What else have you found out?

25
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,750
Master Ximen's Achilles' tendons
were severed by someone.

26
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,810
That sword mark...

27
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,190
seems familiar.

28
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,890
It looks like...

29
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,400
Like what?

30
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,079
The work of the Dust-Seeker Sword.

31
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,760
The Dust-Seeker Sword?

32
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,960
I remember—that sword

33
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,090
was a gift from Fugui to Miss Qingtong.

34
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,560
Master,

35
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,730
could it really be them?

36
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,800
We must get to the bottom of this.

37
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,360
Fugui and Miss Qingtong
must not be falsely accused.

38
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,000
Also,

39
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,160
the most urgent thing now

40
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,560
is to send people
to protect Elder Shouren at once,

41
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,420
in case something happens to him.

42
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,480
Okay.

43
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,870
Foolish.

45
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,830
Why hold a banquet at such a time?

46
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,560
Master,

47
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,560
why hasn't your condition improved yet?

48
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,360
Didn't the physician say
it was just a common cold?

49
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,430
It's fine.

50
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,170
I'll be better soon.

51
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,920
Go handle what I told you.

52
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,830
Huaizhu,

53
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,930
I just wanted our Fugui
to live an ordinary life.

54
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,680
But now he's caught up in chaos again.

55
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,630
If your spirit is watching over us,

56
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,560
please grant me a little more time.

57
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,750
Right now…

58
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,720

Pour some tea for me.

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,130
Here you go, Master.

62
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,040
Tasty.

63
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
The tea is bitter. You don't like it?

64
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,390
Well, right outside,

65
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,750
there's a steamed bun shop.

66
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,350
Just turn right out the door.

67
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:57,909
Then

68
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,440
I'll go get you some.

69
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,160
Alright.

Greetings, Soldier.

72
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,750
The matter
I asked Madam Yin to investigate—

73
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,870
how's it going now?

74
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,480
Madam has kept sending people out

75
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,940
to look for Miss Qingtong.

76
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,830
Unfortunately,

77
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,430
she still hasn't been found.

78
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,750
Though Miss Qingtong's whereabouts
remain unknown,

79
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,560
recently,

80
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,510
something major happened
in the Yiqi Alliance,

81
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,170
and it concerns you, Soldier.

82
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,800
The entire Ximen family was slaughtered.

83
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,390
The killer even left a message,

84
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,990
saying they'll kill Wangquan Shouren
on Frost's Descent night.

85
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,760
When did this happen?

86
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,930
Just a few days ago.

The rumors are everywhere.

92
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,510
They say you ordered
the demon at your side—

93

Miss Qingtong—to do it.

94
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,950
Elder Shouren,

95
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,810
to prove his conscience is clear,

96
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,000
has openly invited heroes from all around

97
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,920

98

The scent of that person...

101
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,400
why does it feel so familiar?

102
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,730
Elder Shouren,

103
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,270
the killer still hasn't been found.

104
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,159
By hosting the Frost's Descent Banquet,

105
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,800
aren't you unnecessarily
complicating things

106
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,200
and increasing the risk?

107
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,020
You're worried about retaliation,
aren't you?

108
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,120
Everything I, Wangquan Shouren, have done

109
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,510
has been for the Yiqi Alliance

110
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,910
and the Wangquan family,

111
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:05,950
not…

112
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,240
for myself.

113
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,600
Why should I fear retaliation?

114
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,070
Elder, there is no need
to speak out of spite.

115
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,560
Senior Fugui couldn't
possibly be the killer!

116
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,190
If it's not the Soldier himself,

117
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,950
then it's one of his followers!

118
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,560
Anyway,

119
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,040
the invitations for the banquet
have already been sent.

120
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,800
If Wangquan Hongye values his reputation,

121
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,669
he'll have to protect me at all costs.

122
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,440
You...

123
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,360
What?

124
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,390
I'll assign more guards

125
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,340
to protect you, Elder.

126
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,680
But before Frost's Descent,

127
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,670
no guests should be allowed inside.

128
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,790
Don't worry.

129
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Most of them

130
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,480
are staying at the Night Hotel.

131
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,630
The Night Hotel?

132
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,720
Miss, your tea.

133
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,790
Why have the drinks gotten even pricier?

134
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,920
That's ridiculous!

135
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,360
It's all because of Elder Wangquan

136
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,220
and his Frost's Descent Banquet.

137
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,440
Who on earth
killed the Yiqi Alliance's family masters?

138
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,120
Yeah.

139
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,200
Isn't it obvious?

140
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,670
It was the Soldier.

141
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,360
He and that spider demon by his side

142
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,550
did it together.

143
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,750
All those murdered family masters

144
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,840
once wanted the Soldier dead.

145
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,840
To take revenge, the Soldier

146
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,320
first severed their meridians

147
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,150
and then killed them to silence them.

148
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,150
Do you have proof?

149
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,600
You can't just make wild accusations.

150
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,910
There will be soon.

151
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,080
Master Ximen's body

152
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,280
is currently stored in Huntian Prison.

153
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,250
They're bound to find proof there.

154
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,850
I don't believe it.

155
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,080
What's so special about that prison?

156
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,030
Very special.

157
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,000
Let me put it this way for you:

158
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,120
any case

159
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,630
that reaches Huntian Prison

160
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,890
will surely be solved.

161
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,150
Master,

162
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,800
eat it while it's hot.

163
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,370
Have you noticed

164
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,410
something's really off about this place?

165
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,050
Don't look.

166
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,480
Right now, the entire Yiqi Alliance

167
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,610
thinks I killed those family masters.

168
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,870
Eat.

169
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,720
I remember now.

170
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,030
Master.

171
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,600
I ran into someone today,

172
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,570
the guy who asked you
to write a letter last time.

173
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,240
Waiter!

174
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,390
Coming!

Rumors are flying everywhere.

177
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,200
Master Ximen's death—

178
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,770
I'll find out the truth behind it.

179
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,670
There it is again—that scent.

180
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,870
But it's not quite the same as last time.

181

00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,750
Let me introduce you.

187
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,150
The guest she's entertaining today

188
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,910
is none other than the Chief Inspector
of Huntian Prison,

189
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,320
Lord Zhuge Wu himself!

190
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,840
No wonder he looks so distinguished!

191
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,510
So it's Lord Zhuge Wu!

192
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,840
Come on, pour the wine!

193
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:23,600
Here.

194
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,120
Okay.

195
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,200
Hurry.

196
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,390
Lord Zhuge, please.

197
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:26,910
Okay.

198
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,130
[Huntian Prison]

199
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,370
Here, let me fill your cup.

200
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,440
Not enough.

201
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,320
More!

202
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,720
That's enough.

203
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,630
Lord Zhuge Wu,

204
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,510
from now on,

205
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,030
we'll be counting on you.

206
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,510
Sure thing.

207
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,660
Here, have some more food.

208
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,360
Fill up the cups!

209
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,240
Got it.

210
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,000
Miss, you are so pretty and graceful,

211
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,060
like a lotus right out of clear water.

212
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,630
I wonder if I

213
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,280
may have the honor of buying you a drink.

214
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,790
May I ask who you are, sir?

215
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,990
That doesn't matter.

216
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,790
Are you my master's beloved one?

217
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,320
Your master's beloved one?

218
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,000
You have the wrong person.

219
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,030
Impossible.

220
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,910
The Celestial Master has drawn
so many portraits of you for me.

221
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,550
There is no way I would mistake you.

222
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,030
Yunfei.

223
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,440
I have a friend who looks a lot like you.

224
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,980
Her name is Qingtong.

225
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,630
Qingtong?

226
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,700
What a beautiful name.

227
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,120
I wonder

228
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,000
where she is now.

229
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,830
She must have been held up by something.

230
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,240
But she'll show up soon.

231
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,000
Young Master Fugui,

232
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,310
before the truth comes to light,

233
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,440
I have to pretend I don't know you.

234
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,270
Otherwise,

235
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,710
you will be dragged into danger.

236
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,910
Then I hope

237
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,660
that your wish will come true.

238
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,270
Oh, right.

239
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,670
There is one thing

240
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,750
that you may

241
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,910
be interested in.

242
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,690
[Huntian Prison]

243
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,210
You came for this, didn't you?

244
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,690
This token belongs to Zhuge Wu.

245
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,910
The Zhuges

246
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,930
usually idle their time away.

247
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,440
It just so happens they

248
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,900
bought themselves posts at Huntian Prison.

249
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,510
How do you know

250
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,560
that I want this token?

251
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,610
It was not hard.

252
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,010
Then would you give it to me?

253
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,150
You want this token

254
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,080
only because you want
to enter Huntian Prison.

255
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,120
As it happens,

256
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,340
I am heading there too.

257
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,360
You two…

258
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,440
know each other?

259
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,480
We do not.

260
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,950
I am her younger brother.

261
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,200
May I ask who you are?

262
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:27,840
Qingtong,

263
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,120
I saw a bracelet on the way here.

264
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,360
I thought it would look beautiful on you.

265
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,080
Try it on.

266
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,000
I also bought some candied chestnuts.

267
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,400
I will shell them for you.

268
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,850
They smell amazing.

269
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,540
They must taste really sweet.

270
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,480
Then I will take my leave.

271
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,560
At midnight tonight,

272
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,170
meet me downstairs.

273
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,030
Close the door.

274
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,560
Alright.

275
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,440
Well?

276
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,270
I was not mistaken, was I?

277
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,560
This nose of mine

278
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,920
never gets it wrong.

279
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,600
But

280
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,920
why were you two
pretending not to know each other?

281
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,950
Tonight at midnight,

282
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,560
I will go with her

283
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,360
to Huntian Prison.

284
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,840
Miss Qingtong is willing to see you?

285
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,630
Shut up.

286
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,040
It is fine.

287
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,280
If she pretends not to know you,

288
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,670
I will lend you the courtship manual
the Celestial Master gave me.

289
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,390
Yunfei.

290
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,770
The courtship manual…

291
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,910
I'll pass.

292
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,240
Tonight,

293
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,800
I need you to help me deal with someone.

294
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:52,870
Who?

295
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,090
Don't you like the bracelet I gave you?

296
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,550
Qingcheng already has many complaints
about Young Master Fugui.

297
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,829
I'd better not tell him about tonight

298
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,319
to avoid unnecessary complications.

299
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:15,160
It is just that

300
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:17,190
so much has happened lately,

301
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,540
and my mind is a little unsettled.

302
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,319
It's not that I don't like it.

303
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,250
Qingtong.

304
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,569
What's the matter?

305
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,110
If one day

306
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,720
you had to choose between Wangquan Fugui

307
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,400
and me,

308
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,310
who would you choose?

309
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,340
Qingcheng.

310
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:57,750
I…

311
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,440
Forget it.

312
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,010
I know who you would choose.

313
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,890
I will not make things hard for you.

314
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,800
Qingtong,

315
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,750
I will go back to my room.

316
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,200
Okay.

317
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:31,970
Qingcheng.

318
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,640
Let me introduce myself.

319
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,310
I am

320
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,880
Li Yunfei of the Li Army.

321
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,890
Where did this poor dog come from?

322
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,500
I am from the Li family.

323
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,010
This fried pancake is really delicious.

324
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,590
Do you want a bite?

325
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,790
No need.

326
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,880
You are so dull.

327
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,110
In the future,

328
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,510
when Miss Qingtong marries Master,

329
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,480
you absolutely cannot
come along as part of her dowry.

330
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,880
What did you just say?

331
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,920
Why is your temper so bad?

332
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,400
My wife told me when I came out

333
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,070
that while I am outside,

334
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,530
I must not get into fights.

335
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,960
Calm down.

336
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,350
Calm down.

337
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:28,480
Calm down.

338
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:41,290
[Night Hotel]

339
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,400
Miss,

340
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,230
you are right on time.

341
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,200
For this trip,

342
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,110
riding the sword there and back

343
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,570
will still take two hours.

344
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,810
We should set out quickly.

345
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,240
So,

346
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,130
have you figured out how to get in?

347
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,400
Qingtong.

348
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,160
Qingtong?

349
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,160
I never thought the Soldier would break
the binding spell and come out.

350
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,020
Little Spider,

351
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,910
we need to get out of here.

352
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,160
With how well Wangquan Fugui
knows your sister,

353
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,360
he will see through your plan very soon.

354
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,940
When that happens,

355
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,200
with Wangquan Fugui
and the whole Yiqi Alliance together,

356
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,000
it will be hard for us to get away.

357
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,270
I cannot leave yet.

358
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,440
Since the Soldier is
caught in this game too,

359
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,680
we might as well
keep him trapped in it as well.

360
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,480
That way, Gulizan will be safer.

361
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,080
But this is not the time for us
to risk our lives.

362
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,960
I know you cannot bear to leave Qingtong.

363
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,960
Let her go.

364
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,540
Go to the Western Regions
and help Gulizan.

365
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,600
Once the Myriad Blight Formation
is complete,

366
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,200
you can have any kind of woman

367
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,160
you want.

368
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,400
I do not want any woman.

369
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,920
I only want Qingtong.

370
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,160
I can give up everything in this world,

371
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,680
except her.

372
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,280
I will never let her go.

373
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,240
How can you be so stubborn?

374
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:15,960
Fine.

375
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,950
Since I am sharing your body,

376
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,750
I have no other choice.

377
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,720
Tell me your plan.

378
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,160
I want Qingtong

379
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,750
to choose between Wangquan Fugui

380
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,590
and me.

381
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,360
[Huntian Prison]

382
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:44,520
Zhuge Wu?

383
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,040
This is the token
of the Chief Inspector, isn't it?

384
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,160
The high and mighty Chief Inspector

385
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,640
coming to my rundown

386
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,770
mortuary—what for?

387
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,490
I am here to examine
the body of Master Ximen.

388
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,880
You think you can just walk in
and examine it?

389
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,140
Where are your papers?

390
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,270
You have none?

391
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,720
Then this matter

392
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,860
is quite difficult to handle.

393
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,550
The Zhuge family, is it?

394
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,050
A prestigious family.

395
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,200
You want to solve the Ximen case—

396
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,980
that's some ambition.

397
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,270
As long as you don't find it disgusting,

398
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,440
take your time.

399
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,070
Take him in.

400
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:32,640
Yes.

401
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,310
This way.

402
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,590
There are nine sword wounds
on his limbs and meridians.

403
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,520
The strikes were very controlled.

404
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,370
They crippled his martial arts
without taking his life.

405
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,270
The truly fatal one

406
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,850
is this cut on his neck.

407
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,440
This sword mark

408
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,160
looks similar
to the others at first glance,

409
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,920
but the killer struck without hesitation,

410
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,250
killing him instantly.

411
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,830
Qingtong,

412
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,890
I never thought I'd run into you here.

413
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,830
I was surprised too, Young Master Fugui.

414
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,030
What are you doing here?

415
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,560
I came here just to find you.

416
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,590
Ever since I lost you,

417
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,040
every day has felt like a lifetime.

418
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,480
Heaven has finally taken pity on me

419
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,830
and let me find you here.

420
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,610
Young Master Fugui,

421
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,890
since I left you,

422
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,270
I've suffered every single day too.

423
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,440
It's been so long.

424
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,250
You've lost so much weight.

425
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,130
But you haven't changed at all.

426
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,280
Still as beautiful as ever.

427
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,350
The truth is,

428
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,590
I've missed you all this time.

429
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,580
If you missed me,

430
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,510
why did you pretend not to know me?

431
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,070
I have my reasons.

432
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,530
Young Master Fugui,

433
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,160
could you hold me?

434
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,350
Of course.

435
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,880
If you want to cry,

436
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,640
lean on my shoulder and cry.

437
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,810
Young Master Fugui,

438
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,810
I will never leave you again.

439
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,280
Qingtong!

440
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:18,960
Qingtong!

441
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,550
Poor Dog?

442
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,790
Stop calling her.

443
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,250
Miss Qingtong is not here.

444
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,840
Master and Miss Qingtong

445
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,960
went out to drink under the moon.

446
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,200
It's you.

447
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,840
You have a death wish or what?

448
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,480
Why would I?

449
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,430
I've got a wife, a master,

450
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,350
and a pile of pastries.

451
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,720
Why would I want to die?

452
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,560
The pastries down south are so soft.

453
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,440
Forget it.

454
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,430
Don't be mad.

455
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,200
Anger hurts the liver.

456
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,440
I'm only keeping you here a bit longer

457
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,240
so Master and Miss Qingtong
can spend more time together.

458
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:26,900
Be patient.

459
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,790
Be patient.

460
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,310
I'll

461
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,510
give you a little tip.

462
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,790
Stop wasting your energy.

463
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:40,000
The Wangquan family
has already inspected the body.

464
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,800
The suspect is

465
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,400
that lowly spider demon.

466
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,720
The wanted notice

467
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,120
will be out in a day or two.

468
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,200
Take care, Mr. Zhuge.

469
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:48,670
Oh, right.

470
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,000
I'm not Zhuge Wu.

471
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,030
The token—

472
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,790
I borrowed it.

473
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,650
Stop shouting.

474
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,490
The money I gave you just now

475
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,790
is enough to treat your wounds.

476
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,920
What are you waiting for?

477
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,550
Get him!

478
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,540
The sword marks

479
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,360
are not hard to imitate.

480
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,090
The fatal slash on Master Ximen's neck

481
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,160
was deliberately staged.

482
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,300
Please contact
Wangquan Manor's Feng Tingyun.

483
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,080
Have her examine it carefully.

484
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,790
What did you find?

485
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:42,110
The wounds were caused by a sword

486
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,080
called Dust-Seeker.

487
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,350
But I want to know—

488
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,220
why the attacker hated him so deeply.

489
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,870
There's some history behind it.

490
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,240
But the real reason

491
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,550
is that they hunted demons cruelly,

492
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,880
taking their cores

493
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,150
to absorb their demon power.

494
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,200
Then those nine strikes were deserved.

495
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,480
As for my old friend,

496
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,480
whatever kind of demon
she wants to become,

497
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,010
whatever path she chooses,

498
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,170
it doesn't matter.

499
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,030
But she shouldn't

500
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,930
have been framed like this.

501
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:32,960
Have you...

502
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,270
never doubted her?

503
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,030
Never.

504
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,160
Young Master Fugui,

505
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,720
I went to Sandstorm Town to find you.

506
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,000
But I didn't expect your internal injury

507
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,200
to be so bad.

508
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,900
I didn't want you
to carry all that burden again.

509
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,030
So I…

510
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,160
Qingtong,

511
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,960
I'm not afraid of carrying burdens.

512
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,160
I only fear

513
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,880
that something might happen to you.

514
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,880
The one who framed you knows you so well.

515
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,200
They could even mimic your sword marks.

516
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,790
I believe

517
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,960
deep down, you know that very well.

518
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,480
Y-You…

519
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,400
what's wrong?

520
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,730
Have you

521
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,370
just learned how to use talismans?

522
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,270
Yeah,

523
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,640
how did you know?

524
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,840
Isn't this formation
only meant to trap me?

525
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,590
Why does my inner energy feel blocked?

526
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,190
It's really uncomfortable.

527
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,200
Then…

528
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,880
then what…

529
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,720
should I do now?

530
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:22,790
Maybe…

531
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,350
you can free me for a bit?

532
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,310
Fine.

533
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,220
What are you doing?

534
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:46,240
Forcing out so much sweat
with demon power

535
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,050
must be exhausting.

536
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,440
My formation is perfect.

537
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,350
You think I'm that easy to fool?

538
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,210
Guess you really
don't understand me at all.

539
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:00,480
I eat well and sleep well,

540
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,770
simple but not stupid.

541
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:05,690
I'm the prince of Corsac Fox State
who sees his every mission done!

542
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,070
Wow!

543
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,510
I'm perfect.

544
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:10,590
Plus,

545
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,080
I am the only one among all of us

546
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,800
who has a wife!

547
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,450
Don't… don't get angry.

548
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,060
Breaking free by force will hurt you.

549
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,410
You dead dog!

550
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,440
Stop running!

551
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,270
Hey!

552
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,240
Why are you getting so agitated?

553
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,720
If you have the guts, don't run!

554
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,750
I already told you,

555
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,830
my wife doesn't let me fight.

556
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,430
Where is my sister, exactly?

557
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,200
I told you
they went to drink under the moon!

558
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,000
Stop right there!

559
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,120
Make it clear!

560
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,280
You're serious?

561
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,310
You can't beat me.

562
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,790
Then keep going!

563
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:44,350
Stop!

564
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,440
I...

565
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,620
Qingcheng.

566
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,460
-What are you doing?
-Qingtong, help me!

567
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,680
Come with me, all of you.

568
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,030
Let's go.

569
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,000
You fool.

570
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,260
Miss Qingtong,

571
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,550
your brother is really good
at playing the victim!

572
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,150
He wasn't like this just now.

573
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,880
He smashed the inn window.

574
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,570
I told you, didn't I?

575
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,920
If you break things in someone's shop,

576
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,250
you have to pay for them.

577
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:25,160
You actually have dragon power inside you.

578
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,890
I told you you couldn't beat me.

579
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,520
Qingtong,

580
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,310
this guy just set a trap

581
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,600
and nearly killed me.

582
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,970
You're quite the actor.

583
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,480
Master, Miss Qingtong,

584
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,720
he's playing the victim.

585
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,320
He wasn't like this just now.

586
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:38,270
Enough.

587
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,860
I have made myself very clear.

588
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,890
Master Ximen was killed by you.

589
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,800
The evidence is conclusive.

590
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,940
Do you really think

591
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,480
you can keep it a secret?

592
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,370
Master, what's wrong with you?

593
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,030
How is it that after one trip out,

594
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,030
you two look like enemies now?

595
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:13,760
But don't worry.

596
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:17,400
I prepared two love poems for Xueyang.

597
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:18,680
I can

598
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,680
grudgingly let you use them.

599
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,310
That is unnecessary.

600
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,310
Don't be shy.

601
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,530
Are you feeling unwell?

602
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,470
Yunfei, listen to me.

603
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,310
I have a task

604
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,880
that I need you to do.

605
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,270
Qingtong, you've been gone for so long.

606
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,330
You must be hungry.

607
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,030
I made some desserts.

608
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,680
Please have some.

609
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,310
Has Wangquan Fugui

610
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,970
upset you again, Qingtong?

611
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,410
You've given him your whole heart.

612
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,920
After what happened to the Ximen family,

613
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,400
the first thing you thought about was

614
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,130
not letting him know who you are

615
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,159
so he wouldn't get dragged into it.

616
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,530
How did you know he was Wangquan Fugui?

617
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,429
You met him long ago, didn't you?

618
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:25,670
I…

619
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,460
Qingcheng.

620
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,150
What else have you been hiding from me?

621
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:35,800
No.

622
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:36,960
Nothing.

623
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,830
I went with him to Huntian Prison

624
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,670
to examine the body of Master Ximen.

625
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,510
The fatal wound on his neck

626
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:55,199
is identical to the mark
caused by my Dust-Seeker Sword.

627
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,920
Whoever's trying to frame me

628
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,670
is truly vicious.

629
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,150
The evidence is solid.

630
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,230
He said he'd go with me

631
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,980
to Wangquan Manor to clear things up.

632
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,070
He's forcing you to turn yourself in

633
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,590
so he can wash his hands of it.

634
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,320
You can't go, Qingtong.

635
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,230
I'll go.

636
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:17,880
Qingtong,

637
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,190
why?

638
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,510
If I go, at least I can prove

639
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,150
that the Frost's Descent prophecy

640
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,550
has nothing to do with me.

641
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:31,890
Qingcheng.

642
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,630
I'm going right now.

643
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,300
If anything happens to me,

644
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,590
you must take good care of yourself…

645
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,960
and Qianji City.

646
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:27,840
Qingtong,

647
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,590
you can't go to Wangquan Manor.

648
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,320
You have to listen to me

649
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,840
and kill Wangquan Shouren.

650
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,920
A puppet talisman…

651
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,760
Qingcheng,

652
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,690
what did you just say to me?

653
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,920
You asked me to listen to you

654
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,230
and kill Wangquan Shouren.

655
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,280
Qingtong,

656
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,590
please, let me explain.

657
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,920
What's left to explain?

658
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,600
Looks like Young Master Fugui
was right after all.

659
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,880
The one behind all this

660
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,550
really is you.

661
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:41,880
Qingtong,

662
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,280
what did he say?

663
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,920
Don't believe him!

664
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,200
Don't tell me…

665
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,030
everything you just said

666
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,040
was just to provoke me

667
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,880
to take action?

668
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,760
Miss Qingtong, are you alright?

669
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,020
Call me if you need me. I'm right outside.

670
00:37:59,110 --> 00:37:59,920
Qingtong,

671
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,560
you worked with those people

672
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,510
to trick me!

673
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,400
Tell me yourself.

674
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,400
Was it you who killed

675
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,160
the entire Ximen family?

676
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,840
Yunfei, go after him!

677
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,960
Yes, I'm on it.

678
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,960
He won't get away!

679
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:27,830
Stop running!

680
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,510
Stop!

681
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,510
You can't escape!

682
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,460
Qingcheng,

683
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,850
if I kill Wangquan Shouren,

684
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,900
I'll become a criminal
of the Yiqi Alliance.

685
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,590
Isn't that right?

686
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,110
This plan was perfect,

687
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,840
but his appearance

688
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,190
ruined everything.

689
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,000
I'm your only family.

690
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,320
Yet you chose to deceive me with him.

691
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:18,690
Be careful.

692
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,410
He's not your brother.

693
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:21,850
Who are you?

694
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,230
You're not my brother at all!

695
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,230
If I'm not Qingcheng,

696
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,800
where is

697
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,360
the real Qingcheng?

698
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,020
Wangquan Shouren's mansion.

699
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:48,630
Yunfei.

700
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,600
Go find Feng Tingyun.

701
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,000
Tell her to come at once.

702
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:52,440
Got it.

703
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:11,040
[Wangquan Shouren's mansion]

704
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,860
Let's split up.

705
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,070
Okay.
