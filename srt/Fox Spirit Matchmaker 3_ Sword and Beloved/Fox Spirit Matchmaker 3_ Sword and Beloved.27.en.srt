[Sword and Beloved]

00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,640
[Episode 27]

3
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,090
Let's split up and search.

4
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:11,750
Okay.

5
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,630
Little Spider...

6
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,240
All of this...

7
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,560
All of this is my fault.

8
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,410
I shouldn't have...

9
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,280
I shouldn't have incited
the Yiqi Alliance...

10
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,710
to punish you.

11
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,110
I shouldn't have spread rumors,

12
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,310
called you

13
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,280
a scourge,

14
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,310
or said you were despicable.

15
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,910
I'm worse than a beast.

16
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,590
I...

17
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,750
I...

18
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,590
I deserve to die.

19
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,080
It's all my fault.

20
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,470
It's my fault...

21
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,870
It's my fault...

22
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,030
It's my fault...

23
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,310
I...

24
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,520
It's...

25
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,090
Qingcheng!

26
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,310
Stop it now!

27
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,630
This damned old bastard...

28
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,680
he finally got what he deserved.

29
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,130
Though his apology wasn't sincere...

30
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,360
the way he died was beautiful.

31
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,910
Unfortunately,

32
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,190
my sister and I will never forgive you.

33
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,120
Qingcheng.

34
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,770
Everything you did before

35
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,310
was just to drive a wedge between me
and Young Master Fugui.

36
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,710
But now you're exposed.

37
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,260
Why did you still kill him?

38
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,590
Why?

39
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,750
Because they hurt you, Sister.

40
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,680
Those who hurt you must die!

41
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,830
Qingtong,

42
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,240
don't you understand?

43
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,040
In this world, the only person
who cares about you

44
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,190
is me!

45
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,490
That's not true.

46
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,070
Qingcheng,

47
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,920
you've been possessed by the Black Fox.

48
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,920
That's why you've become like this.

49
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,800
What?

50
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,140
Is this the first time you've met this version of me?

51
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,700
Without

52
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,470
the Black Fox's help,

53
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,480
how could I have survived

54
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,040
that pervert's clutches in Qianji City?

55
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,920
Qingcheng...

56
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,680
Listen to me.

57
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,270
The Black Fox's power

58
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,040
will only drag you deeper and deeper.

59
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,480
You should expel it as soon as possible.

60
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,750
Expel it?

61
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,680
And go back to being
that lowly little spider?

62
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,610
The spider that could
only crouch in the corner,

63
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,920
praying for you to look my way?

64
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,000
No.

65
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,680
I'd rather die.

66
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,360
This is a silence talisman.

67
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,070
Qingcheng.

68
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,080
Don't make a sound later.

69
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,600
Just listen.

70
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,130
What are you going to do?

71
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:34,950
Qingcheng?

72
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,040
Either way...

73
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,870
I've lost you.

74
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,800
Today...

75
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,310
you must choose between us!

76
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,920
Qingcheng...

77
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,430
Qingcheng...

78
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,630
Wangquan Fugui!

79
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,070
Wangquan Fugui,

80
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,610
you don't deserve to be with Qingtong.

81
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:49,920
Today,

82
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,560
either you die

83
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,310
or I do!

84
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,440
Young Master Fugui.

85
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,560
Qingcheng,

86
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,690
let me out.

87
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,360
Black Fox,

88
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,070
come out!

89
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,360
It hurts! It hurts so much!

90
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,250
Sister!

91
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,430
Help me, Sister!

92
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,920
Young Master Fugui,

93
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,800
stop.

94
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,950
I'll say it one more time:

95
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,630
Black Fox,

96
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,620
get the hell out!

97
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,190
Sister,

98
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,800
are you going to leave me

99
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,630
and give up on me?

100
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,510
Sister!

101
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,600
Never!

102
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,920
Right now, the priority is

103
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,070
to figure out

104
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,430
how to expel the Black Fox
from Qingcheng's body.

105
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,750
Wangquan Fugui,

106
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,960
it was I who knocked Qingtong out

107
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,480
and took her away.

108
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,750
It was I

109
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,409
who tried every way
to stop her from finding you.

110
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:37,080
It was I who told her you were dead

111
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,360
to make her let go of you.

112
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,240
I did all of that!

113
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,030
Wangquan Fugui,

114
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,240
that's it.

115
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,960
Hit me.

116
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,270
The crueler, the better.

117
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,710
If Qingcheng keeps provoking
Young Master Fugui,

118
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,720
he'll die along with the Black Fox.

119
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,510
The one who deserves to die
is the Black Fox.

120
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,120
I can't abandon Qingcheng.

121
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,620
Qingcheng,

122
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,910
you've colluded with the Black Fox,

123
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,510
striking cruelly at humans.

124
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,440
You even dragged Qingtong
into your schemes.

125
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,680
Come back with me now

126
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,980
and confess everything about you
and the Black Fox.

127
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,730
Young Master Fugui.

128
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,240
Qingcheng was simply bewitched
by the Black Fox.

129
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,510
Please spare his life!

130
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,080
Qingtong.

131
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,750
I never intended to kill him.

132
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,480
I only wanted to expel
the Black Fox from his body.

133
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,920
But if you do that...

134
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,120
Qingcheng will die too.

135
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,600
In order to expel the Black Fox,

136
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,200
he'd even sacrifice himself.

137
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,270
Do you think he'd spare me?

138
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,000
Shut up!

139
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,510
All disciples of the alliance, listen up!

140
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,320
Search this place thoroughly,

141
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,670
inside and out!

142
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,360
If you find any suspicious demons,

143
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,080
bring them back to
Wangquan Manor immediately!

144
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,960
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

145
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,550
Sister,

146
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,080
the Yiqi Alliance won't let me off.

147
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,030
Save me!

148
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,150
You're still talking nonsense.

149
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,720
Sister,

150
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,600
he'll kill me.

151
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,440
I'll handle the Black Fox

152
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,580
inside Qingcheng's body.

153
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,700
Why is there also a trace of power

154
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,330
similar to the Black Fox
within Qingtong's demon power?

155
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,150
Junior,

156
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,370
this time I broke the binding spell

157
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,080
and left the Western Regions,

158
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,210
violating the Yiqi Alliance's rules.

159
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,270
Senior Fugui, you did nothing wrong.

160
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,800
Why should you be expelled?

161
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,440
I can't beat you anyway.

162
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,700
In the future, wherever you want to go...

163
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,050
I also won't be able to stop you.

164
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,670
How is the Chief?

165
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,670
The Master...

166
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,550
is doing well.

167
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,550
I left you a letter...

168
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,260
in Huntian Prison.

169
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,150
I've already confirmed it myself.

170
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,550
Actually, I also believe

171
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,970
that Little Spider

172
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,360
would never commit

173
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,020
such heartless, insane acts.

174
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,440
If she didn't do it,

175
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,990
we won't falsely accuse her.

176
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,250
Actually, it was a little black fox

177
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,090
that possessed her brother
and did these things.

178
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,200
The alliance

179
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,130
will definitely not

180
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,720
let this matter rest easily.

181
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,150
If Qianji City doesn't
hand over Qingcheng,

182
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,480
the alliance will never

183
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,510
let the matter rest.

184
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
Will the alliance

185
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,080
besiege the city?

186
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:22,550
Yes.

187
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,870
Junior.

188
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,240
Can you give me some time?

189
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,440
Okay.

190
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,870
Finally...

191
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,150
Finally, for once...

192
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,080
you chose me.

193
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,010
There's no time.

194
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,630
I need to expel the Black Fox
from his body now.

195
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,890
Otherwise, Qingcheng will be in danger.

196
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,720
Why can't my Power of Love
connect with Qingcheng's?

197
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,050
The power inside his body is resisting me.

198
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,500
Qingcheng,

199
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,570
you need to trust me.

200
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,080
I need you to

201
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,850
defeat the Black Fox together with me.

202
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,630
Sister, if you give the antidote
to the Soldier,

203
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,840
what about you?

204
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,670
You promised me

205
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,510
you'd stay with me.

206
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,290
Qingcheng, listen to me.

207
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,550
Go to Deer Village now.

208
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,460
It's safe there.

209
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,870
Hurry up. Go!

210
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,630
I won't leave without you!

211
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,480
What a twist of fate.

212
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,480
The Black Fox actually exploited
this opportunity.

213
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:22,750
Qingcheng,

214
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,440
I believe in you.

215
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,960
You have to believe in yourself too.

216
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,930
You must break free
from the control of the Black Fox!

217
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,910
Why...

218
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,720
Why do you still
refuse to connect with me?

219
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,950
Why did you cut off my Power of Love?

220
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,090
How am I supposed to save you like this?

221
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,650
So it was you
who instigated that spider demon

222
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,440
to awaken me?

223
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,200
I'm Quan Jingting.

224
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,550
Greetings, Queen of Qianxia.

225
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,320
What is it

226
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,870
that you truly want?

227
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,200
Back then, Your Majesty stepped forward

228
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,870
and ultimately sacrificed everyone
in your Qianxia Kingdom

229
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,030
through the Myriad Blight Formation

230
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,200
to slay the Berserk Dragon.

231
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,910
But 1,000 years have passed.

232
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,950
Your Majesty, do you know

233
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,910
which demon clan now reigns over

234
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,390
the Western Regions?

235
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,120
It's the one you hate most—

236
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,240
the cunning and treacherous
Corsac Fox Clan,

237
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,600
which left your kingdom
standing alone and helpless,

238
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,630
ultimately forcing you to

239
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,550
sacrifice your people.

240
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,910
A thousand years have passed.

241
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,240
Who still remembers
your kingdom's sacrifice?

242
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,030
The peace you bought with your blood

243
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,000
is now being enjoyed by those traitors.

244
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,440
Enough.

245
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,370
I'm already aware of what you said.

246
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,330
Now that I've awakened,

247
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,960
I naturally won't spare

248
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,370
the Corsac Fox Clan or the Dragon Clan.

249
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,360
But I don't understand.

250
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,790
Madam Black Fox asked that little spider

251
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,960
to help me escape and get revenge.

252
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,910
What exactly do you want from me?

253
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,550
And what can you

254
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,360
offer me in return?

255
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,440
Back then,

256
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,080
though the Myriad Blight Formation
you set up

257
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,840
wasn't large in scale,

258
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,500
it could help you obtain supreme power
to kill the Berserk Dragon.

259
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,790
What if Your Majesty

260
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,750
set up the Myriad Blight Formation
across the entire Western Regions

261
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,790
and sacrificed all beings in the region?

262
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,480
The power obtained

263
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:09,240
could slay 100 berserk dragons.

264
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:09,880
No!

265
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:12,550
The power obtained

266
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
would be born of tremendous hatred.

267
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,400
It could help Madam Black Fox
take physical form overnight.

268
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:21,880
From then on, love will fade
and hatred will rise in this world.

269
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,880
The Black Fox destroying the world—

270
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,000
would that appease

271
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,360
Your Majesty's lingering grievances?

272
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,590
Sounds good.

273
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,720
But to unseal the Myriad Blight Formation

274
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,880
requires the combined power of three clans

275
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,110
to activate it.

276
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,590
I wonder,

277
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,650
do any dragon demons still exist now?

278
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,880
Jin,

279
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,570
stop playing. Time to eat.

280
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,030
Today we have your favorite daylilies.

281
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,200
Jin?

282
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:26,880
Jin?

283
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,240
Master!

284
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,400
Master!

285
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,080
Master...

286
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,680
Master.

287
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,760
Can't you be a bit more composed?

288
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,310
Master,

289
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,680
the scouts report

290
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,640
that something is wrong
with the Dragon Clan.

291
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,480
Go on.

292
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,520
Recently,

293
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,730
many little dragon demons
have gone missing.

294
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,830
Their chief

295
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,110
has led many clansmen to the Saintess,

296
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,170
demanding that she deliver justice.

297
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,610
The Saintess of the Dragon Clan
will uncover the truth.

298
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,550
However,

299
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,020
most of the descendants
of the Dragon Clan are hybrids.

300
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,530
Their demon power is weak.

301
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,550
Then why abduct them?

302
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,550
Saintess of the Dragon Clan...

303
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,960
Could their target be...

304
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,200
Weiyun?

305
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,170
This is bad.

306
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,110
Come with me.

307
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,920
Let those kids go!

308
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,680
Don't be afraid.

309
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,630
It's alright.

310
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,880
Who exactly are you?

311
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,930
You don't need to know who I am.

312
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,030
I came to you today

313
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,960
for your dragon power.

314
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,200
You abducted those kids as bait

315
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,240
just to lure me out.

316
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,400
You're clever,

317
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,520
but you realized it too late.

318
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,450
A thousand years have passed.

319
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,960
The Western Regions have changed a lot.

320
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,000
Your Dragon Clan

321
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,940
still has you left—the last pure-blood.

322
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:40,830
Fine.

323
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,930
You're all going to die anyway.

324
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,860
What's your real purpose?

325
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:06,550
This is the Dream Formation
I specially prepared for you.

326
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,990
Using dreams as a prison,

327
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,920
it can make you willingly

328
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,920
offer your True Dragon Power.

329
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,550
Be good and give me

330
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,720
your power.

331
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,640
Weiyun!

332
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,640
Weiyun!

333
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,330
Master, I'll go check.

334
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:52,830
Nothing.

335
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,590
I'm afraid...

336
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,120
something's already happened to Weiyun.

337
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,610
What's this?

338
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,080
A tracking talisman.

339
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,200
Go.

340
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:19,750
Weiyun!

341
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,260
Those children...

342
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:24,750
Master.

343
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:26,560
What's this?

344
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,000
Bound by dreams,

345
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:33,250
one's life force drains away
until they perish with the dream.

346
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,350
This is a Dream Formation!

347
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,350
Dream Formation?

348
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,160
Such an ancient formation—

349
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,110
wasn't it supposed to
have been lost long ago?

350
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,310
Dragon demons are proud and willful.

351
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,880
To absorb Weiyun's dragon power,

352
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,080
you need her consent.

353
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,830
But within this Dream Formation,

354
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,690
her consciousness won't resist.

355
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:48,400
Right now,

356
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,590
Weiyun is

357
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,880
trapped in a dream.

358
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,990
When her dragon power is fully drained,

359
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,640
that will be the moment
she awakens—and dies.

360
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,230
What should we do now?

361
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,110
The only way now

362
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,290
is for me to enter the dream

363
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,640
and wake her up.

364
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:06,640
Master.

365
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,030
If you fail to return,

366
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,000
you'll just be throwing your life away.

367
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,790
Let's think of another way!

368
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,990
There's no other way!

369
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,590
I'll enter the formation first

370
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,550
to save Weiyun.

371
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,000
As for those young demons,

372
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,750
once I enter the formation,

373
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,750
I'll break a section of the barrier.

374
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:21,830
You must

375
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,710
take them away immediately.

376
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,440
How utterly foolish—

377
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,400
you actually dared to enter the formation.

378
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,920
Since you have a death wish,

379
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,410
stay trapped in the dream forever

380
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,110
with your Weiyun.

381
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:03,170
[Wedding]

382
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:07,860
[Dream Formation; Long Weiyun's Dream]

383
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,310
Ruhua.

384
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:17,790
My Lady.

385
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,830
Do you think

386
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:21,240
this hairpin goes well

387
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,570
with that lip rouge?

388
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,680
My Lady,

389
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,310
you really shouldn't worry so much.

390
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,200
You and your future husband

391
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,160
are childhood sweethearts

392
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,440
with deep feelings for each other.

393
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,400
You're a match made in heaven.

394
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,310
I think so too.

395
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,570
We're a perfect match.

396
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,480
Who are you?

397
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,720
You are...

398
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,850
a defiler who preys on innocent girls!

399
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,000
Guards...

400
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,440
Breaking into a maiden's chamber

401
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,900
in the middle of the night—

402
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,680
he really is a defiler.

403
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,320
I can lift the spell for you,

404
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,640
but on one condition:

405
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,400
no shouting or screaming.

406
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,260
You can take my wealth,

407
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,570
but not my chastity!

408
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:13,350
Weiyun,

409
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,200
think carefully.

410
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,590
You really don't remember me?

411
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,880
You're just a defiler.

412
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,510
Why should I know you?

413
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:24,830
I'm

414
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,350
not a defiler.

415
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:29,400
And you're not the young lady
of the Long family.

416
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,720
I can let you go.

417
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,310
But first,

418
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,030
tell me

419
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,550
about your husband.

420
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,880
What's wrong with you?

421
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,720
Why should I tell you about my fiancé?

422
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,780
There's something wrong with me.

423
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,680
And when my madness strikes,
I drink blood and devour raw flesh.

424
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,810
I especially love to

425
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:48,430
ruin the faces of beautiful girls.

426
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,070
You...

427
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:51,790
Don't...

428
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,030
Don't go mad!

429
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,110
Well,

430
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,840
that depends on how you behave.

431
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,110
My fiancé and I are

432
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,120
childhood sweethearts.

433
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,510
His nickname is Sigou.

434
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,160
He was frail as a child

435
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,620
and suffered from asthma.

436
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,240
When he was 12,

437
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,340
he met a soft-hearted great demon

438
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,590
who cured his illness.

439
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,750
Actually...

440
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,510
I didn't even like him at first.

441
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,510
But he was thick-skinned.

442
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,200
He kept following me,

443
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,480
calling me "Sister."

444
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,370
I couldn't even drive him away.

445
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,090
And because he was thick-skinned,

446
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,750
you fell for him?

447
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,920
Of course not.

448
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,400
Once, I encountered danger outside

449
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,660
and nearly became demonized.

450
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,480
He risked his life to save me

451
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,370
and carried me all the way back.

452
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,210
Although I was barely conscious
in his arms,

453
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,400
I still had a bit of awareness.

454
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,680
I could hear his heartbeat.

455
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,200
I knew that...

456
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,550
he truly liked me—

457
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,640
so much that I was

458
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:10,230
more important to him than his own life.

459
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:13,880
So...

460
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,720
you're going to marry him?

461
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,350
Of course.

462
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,830
Once I marry him,

463
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,830
we'll live a simple,

464
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,400
happy life together.

465
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:27,790
Weiyun,

466
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,960
is this really the perfect dream

467
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,270
in your mind?

468
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,550
So I've been

469
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,840
in your heart all along.

470
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,720
Why are you looking at me like that?

471
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,270
I-I'm telling you,

472
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,240
I'd rather die than betray my husband.

473
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,480
So...

474
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:56,870
can you still remember

475
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,970
what your husband looks like?

476
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,000
His...

477
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,350
His looks...

478
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,960
Why is it him?

479
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,930
My daughter,

480
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,440
you wouldn't come to eat when called.

481
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,500
You must be hungry.

482
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,720
We've brought you something to eat.

483
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,030
Father, Mother.

484
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,650
I think I'm haunted by an evil spirit.

485
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,680
I had such a ridiculous dream.

486
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,480
Yun,

487
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,590
it's alright.

488
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,240
I've brought back many safety talismans.

489
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,310
We'll paste them all over your room.

490
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,640
Outside,

491
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,030
I've assigned extra guards
to patrol in shifts.

492
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:03,880
Don't worry.

493
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,280
Everything will be fine.

494
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,510
"All gods above,

495
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,700
there's a night wanderer in my home."

496
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,270
I-I got the wrong one.

497
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,400
You...

498
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,180
At such a crucial moment,
you pull this on me.

499
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,790
Our daughter is getting married
in two days.

500
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:23,350
You...

501
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,030
Why are you so unreliable?

502
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,790
Mother.

503
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,480
I'm hungry.

504
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,800
I want some sweet fruit soup.

505
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,880
Alright, alright.

506
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,200
I'll get it for you right away.

507
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:33,590
Yes.

508
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,200
Who is he?

509
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,160
Weiyun.

510
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,040
I know that...

511
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,310
in this dream,

512
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,120
you're living a happy life.

513
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,830
But a dream is a dream.

514
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,400
I'll give you real happiness.

515
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,240
Heaven and earth,

516
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,000
please let my wedding with my beloved

517
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,310
go smoothly today.

518
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,210
What happened?

519
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,510
Why is everyone frozen?

520
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,000
Ruhua.

521
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,110
Ruhua?

522
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,000
What's happening?

523
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:26,890
Weiyun.

524
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,530
I've come to take you away.

525
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,270
Who are you?

526
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,560
Undo your evil spell right now.

527
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,610
I'm warning you,

528
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,720
don't delay my important business.

529
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,450
Do you know where you are going?

530
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,440
Can't you tell?

531
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,170
I'm getting married today.

532
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,550
I'm going to meet my fiancé.

533
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:56,640
Where is he?

534
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,160
Shouldn't I be

535
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,440
your fiancé?

536
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,070
What's going on?

537
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,590
This man

538
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,590
looks exactly like my fiancé.

539
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,550
That person

540
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,080
was supposed to be me all along.

541
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,440
You...

542
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,550
How can you hear what I'm thinking?

543
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,590
Because

544
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,840
I'm the one you've been thinking about...

545
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,310
Quan Rumu.

546
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,410
You must have used some evil magic.

547
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,070
Fine.

548
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,920
Let me ask you something.

549
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,790
You said you and your fiancé
were childhood sweethearts,

550
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,030
innocent companions.

551
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:45,880
Then why

552
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,670
can't you remember his face?

553
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,700
Here's another question:

554
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,240
you just said

555
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,070
I look exactly like him.

556
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,750
So why, when you first saw me,

557
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,150
didn't you recognize me?

558
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,030
You even said

559
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,550
I was a defiler.

560
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,030
Don't you think

561
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:03,160
something feels off about your world?

562
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,410
Because right now,

563
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,510
you're in your dream.

564
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,150
Every word I've said is true.

565
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:21,960
I swear it.

566
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,219
Be careful what you swear,
or the heavens will strike you down!

567
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,190
Oh, right.

568
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,320
What is that place?

569
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,360
The Thunder Pool.

You don't know?

The Thunder Pool is always
full of lightning and thunder,

with winds as sharp as blades.

573
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,610
Some say it's where demons
undergo tribulation,

574
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,270
while others say
it's where immortals ascend.

575
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,880
In any case, it's not a place
for us mortals.

576

My parents always warned me

577

that the place is dangerous

578
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,200

Could that mean the Thunder Pool

583
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:14,050
is the weakest point
in the Dream Formation?
