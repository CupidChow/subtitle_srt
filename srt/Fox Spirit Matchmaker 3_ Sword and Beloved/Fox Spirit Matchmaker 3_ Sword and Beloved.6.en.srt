The account shows

17
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,190
these medicines were sold to
the Demon Realm and the Western Regions.

18
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,150
it’s perfectly reasonable that

for this reason.

I swear on the name of the Wangquan Manor,

204
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,750
Quan Rumu

205
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,080
was threatened and framed by his father,
Quan Jingting,

206
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,480
and hence harmed you all.

207
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,450
He was also one of the victims.

208
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,610
Plus, your injuries were not serious.

209
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:19,750
I think

210
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,110
we can forgo his punishment.

211
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,790
Since Chief has given the order,

212
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,120
if we speak up,

213
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,650
wouldn’t it seem
unreasonable and stubborn?

214
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,390
Let's put this matter aside.

215
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,670
Why did you call us here today?

216
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,320
As you all know,

217
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,930
the last item of the Blue Sky Convention
is the mind battle.

218
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,510
It was originally an exchange between

219
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,550
the secret stone left
by the Third Young Master of Aolai

220
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,810
and the participants.

221
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,150
But because of what happened yesterday,

222
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,030
the mind battle

223
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,960
will have to wait
until the next Blue Sky Convention.

224
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,550
The Third Young Master's secret stone

225
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,840
will be handed over to the Chief

226
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,750
to keep it at the Wangquan Manor.

227
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,670
This is a serious matter.

228
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,130
I need to inform everyone.

229
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,720
Why is the secret stone vibrating?

230
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,890
Is there any message
from the Third Young Master?

231
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,640
Muhai.

232
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:38,790
Muhai.

233
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,200
Take your leave.

234
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:42,200
Yes.

235
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,700
Is Third Young Master’s prophecy
beginning to unfold?

236
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:20,830
Isn’t this

237
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,690
the Heavenly Gate guarded by the Priest of Tianmen?

238
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,590
Wangquan.

239
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:36,870
[Wangquan]

240
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,640
Ts this

241
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,240
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike?

242
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,460
[Wounded by emotion, unstoppable for love]

243
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,660
[Wounded by emotion, unstoppable for love]

244
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,560
What does that mean?

245
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,440
Is this Third Young Master's prophecy?

246
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,070
Someone struck 13 times
with the Wangquan Sword,

247
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,400
broke the Heavenly Gate

248
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,100
and unleashed the world-shattering beasts
beyond the bound?

249
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,480
Chief,

250
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,030
Where is the Soldier?

251
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,920
Did you hear about it?

252
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:08,710
The Third Young Master of Aolai's
bound-breaking phophecy.

253
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,640
As long as we have the Soldier,

254
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,480
Madam's wish will come true.

255
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,960
Third Young Master gave me
such a big gift.

256
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,790
This is so interesting.

257
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,530
Congratulations, Madam.

258
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,440
We'll break the bound soon.

259
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,160
Go.

260
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,170
Inform my clones in the circle.

261
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,160
Tell them to bring me the Soldier,

262
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,070
Wangquan Fugui, at all costs.

263
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,750
Yes.

264
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,550
Notify everyone.

265
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,440
Before the Yiqi Alliance

266
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,550
makes a decision about the prophecy,

267
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,510
no one

268
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,240
shall leave the manor.

269
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:56,350
Yes.

270
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,960
Are you going to keep silent, Chief?

271
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,350
When all the elites of Yiqi Alliance

272
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,150
were killed outside the circle,

273
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,440
the aristocrats of Yiqi Alliance
heard the news

274
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,640
and remained silent.

275
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,920
Chief, are you going to

276
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,320
use the same trick again?

277
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,710
Soldier has yet to unleash
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike.

278
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:23,970
It's not him.

279
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,680
If it wasn't Soldier,

280
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,640
who is the one
in the Spiritual Stone's prophecy

281
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,000
who completed 13 forms
of the Heaven-and-Earth Strike

282
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,110
and broke the bound?

283
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:31,830
Everyone.

284
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,850
Prophecy is just a warning to the future.

285
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,960
It could happen ten or 20 years later.

286
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,790
Who knows?

287
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,160
We might even be dead

288
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,890
before anything even happens.

289
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,240
What's the need to be in such a hurry?

290
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,790
On behalf of the other Master,
I would like to ask.

291
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,440
If the prophecy is true,

292
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,440
what should we do?

293
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,350
Who should make the decision?

294
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,310
If Chief hadn't insisted on

295
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,350
leading the elites beyond the boundary
back then

296
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,750
only to return in defeat,

297
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,880
Will the Yiqi Alliance so miserable?

298
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,880
Will it be suppressed by the demons?

299
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,030
If the elites are still alive,

300
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,360
we don't need soldiers.

301
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:06,960
In my opinion,

302
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,930
soldiers don't need to exist.

303
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,510
Master Sima,

304
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,310
you've gone too far.

305
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:18,880
Yes.

306
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,480
It was my fault

307
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,070
which led to Yiqi Alliance

308
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,030
for many years.

309
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,240
But have you ever thought

310
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,240
the power of the masks group

311
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,680
was the strongest of Yiqi Alliance.

312
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,820
After he got out of the circle,

313
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,350
they were almost wiped out.

314
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,640
The battle

315
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,750
was extremely tragic.

316
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,350
Those who have never faced it

317
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,240
can't imagine its fear.

318
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,030
So,

319
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,160
we can’t break

320
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,550
cannot be broken.

321
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,480
If one day

322
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,030
this circle is broken,

323
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,680
we can't just sit and do nothing.

324
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,750
This is the value of soldiers.

325
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,590
Wounded by love.

326
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,270
Driven by love.

327
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,350
In my opinion,

328
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,250
this prophecy is very subtle.

329
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,510
I'm afraid in the future,

330
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,000
Soldiers will have inner demons.

331
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,660
Soldiers have no inner demon,

332
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,110
they won’t harm Yiqi Alliance.

333
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,350
As for the prophecy,

334
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,410
the royal family will do our best to follow up.

335
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,440
Don't worry about it.

336
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:34,160
I'm afraid fairness is being compromised

337
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,640
if you defend your own son so blatantly.

338
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,080
When the Soldiers sacrificed everything

339
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,750
to help Yiqi Alliance

340
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,440
address its crisis,

341
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,600
did you mention anything about fairness?

342
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,640
Today,

343
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,760
I will be biased in favour of him.

344
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,110
So what?

345
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,240
You are so biased.

346
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,840
How can you be the leader
of the Yiqi Alliance?

347
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,070
That's true.

348
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,070
Indeed.

349
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,040
If Master Sima is not convinced,

350
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,530
you can fight it out
with the Wangquan family.

351
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,270
Today,

352
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,270
I'll bring the Soldiers out of here.

353
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,750
If anyone

354
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,310
dares to speak another word
about the Soldiers,

355
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,710
you will be the enemy
of us Wangquan family.

356
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,830
If the prophecy really happens,

357
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,590
what will you do, Chief?

358
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,960
If the prophecy comes true,

359
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:40,070
I, Wangquan Hongye, will solve it myself.

360
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,730
You all don't have to worry.

361
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,270
Fugui.

362
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,560
Let's leave.

363
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,590
Father.

364
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,400
Yes.

365
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,590
You don't like wealth?

366
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,240
We're walking in darkness.

367
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,790
Whether you like it or not,

368
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,290
only when you see the light

369
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,000
is meaningful.

370
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,030
Father,

371
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,200
I've never seen you

372
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,400
to protect me.

373
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,850
Young Master Fugui...

374
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,960
Young Master Fugui.

375
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,690
You're back.

376
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,270
Yes.

377
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,000
They said

378
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,530
can be cooked while eating.

379
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,480
It's cold today.

380
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,350
We can have some soup

381
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,410
to warm up our body.

382
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,240
I know you don't like meat.

383
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,680
So I specially prepared

384
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,240
for you today.

385
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,830
The pot smells so good.

386
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,270
without sugar.

387
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,200
I want to add

388
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,570
for our rich young master.

389
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,480
It's so cold.

390
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,110
It's so warm.

391
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:43,750
of course you should hold it with your hands.

392
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,070
It'll warm you up.

393
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,480
That's more fun.

394
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,000
Mr. Wealth.

395
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,520
Is it good?

396
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,510
Yes.

397
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,530
Did something interesting happen today?

398
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,750
You look

399
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,510
in a good mood.

400
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,880
Sanshao’s prophecy appeared.

401
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,960
Secret Stone?

402
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:20,960
I remember.

403
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,720
Young Master Fugui told me

404
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,790
the purpose of

405
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,310
for this stone.

406
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,400
So?

407
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,410
what did this stone

408
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,640
predicted?

409
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,200
Really?

410
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,310
Our little spider

411
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,160
has become human.

412
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,030
And he risked his life with the soldiers.

413
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,480
That's great.

414
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,440
Am I right?

415
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,970
One, two, five, eight, one.

416
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,200
I heard

417
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,000
your sister loves you very much.

418
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,000
Yes, Mr. Xue.

419
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,920
My sister is loyal to you.

420
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,020
What about you?

421
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,510
I'm loyal to you, too.

422
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,400
Good.

423
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,480
Mr. Xue, this...

424
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,310
What are you doing?

425
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,680
Tell me.

426
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:26,160
what gift should I give your sister

427
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,400
to make her truly loyal to me?

428
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,550
Mr. Xue,

429
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:33,760
why don't we remove one of his legs and send him to him?

430
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,920
How could he be so cruel?

431
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,770
If I pull one of his legs out,

432
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,440
he'll become a cripple.

433
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,070
Give it to me.

434
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,240
Pull out two of his legs.

435
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,790
Pull his legs out.

436
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,270
Yes.

437
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,960
12580.

438
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,750
I know.

439
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,550
Sister.

440
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:33,210
the soldiers have transformed you into a human.

441
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,880
You did very well.

442
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,830
This is your new mission.

443
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,310
Take it to deal with the soldiers.

444
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:48,430
Otherwise, the spider's legs can regenerate.

445
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,920
And your brother

446
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,680
only has one life.

447
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:15,790
Pure Eyes.

448
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,590
Mr. Wealth.

449
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,520
Is something bothering you?

450
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,440
No.

451
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:24,880
Nothing.

452
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,310
Let's go home.

453
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
After you go back,

454
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,200
practice more

455
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:57,150
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike
as soon as possible.

456
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,160
Yes.

457

I was wrong

458

I was wrong.

459
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,000
I didn't intend to punish Rumu.

460
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,270
You have never

461
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,160
about me.

462
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,640
what I said that day.

463
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,270
what I said that day?

464
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,160
If you can't see

465
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,350
what it looks like to protect the world,

466
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:40,350
I may never be able to use the sword of heaven and earth.

467
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,790
Father,

468
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,040
allow me to visit the outside world occasionally.

469
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:49,880
No need.

470
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,240
Why?

471
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,330
Do you really think

472
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:03,510
everything predicted by the spirit stone will not appear?

473
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,310
The spirit stone won't go wrong.

474
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,310
Turns out

475
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,070
Father never trusted me.

476
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,350
I thought Father protected me today

477

What I care about

480
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,400
is that you can become

481
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,160

482
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,790
Remember.

Are your entire world.

485

Only then

486
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,800
everything in the prophecy

487
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,750
will not happen.

488

Winter solstice

I really want to know

493
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,150
In your eyes,

494
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,070
am I just

495
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,880
a sword for killing?

496
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,960
Why are you here?

497
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,920
Young Master Fugui has been practicing swordsmanship for a long time.

498
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,120
I'm a little worried.

499
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,440
I heard that

Madam of the family

501
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,360

This bamboo forest

503

was planted by my father.

Okay.

Today is not New Year.

Why do people set off firecrackers?

00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,530
Today is winter solstice.

516
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,230
there are some places

this evil medicine has an ancient demon aura.

00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,960
In two hours,

569
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,110
in two hours.

570
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,710
It's up to you

571
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,150
is up to you.

572
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,480
Qingtong.

573
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,280
Yesterday at the Li family,

574
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,550
you didn't write well.

575
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:42,530
You have eyes that can see the world clearly.

576
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,160
Although you are lonely,

577
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:46,250
but the world is still bright.

578
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,970
My heart is still warm.

579
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,630
If you understand these,

580
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,040
you can master the calligraphy better.

581
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,880
After you master your name,

582
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,070
your brocade

583
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,700
has its own signature.

584
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:06,360
[Pure Eyes]

585
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,630
Practice

586
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,700
Practice hard.

587
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,480
I got it.

588
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:38,550
Mr. Wealth,

589
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,960
Rest early.

590
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:41,630
Okay.

591
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:34,950
I'm sorry, Young Master Wealth.

592
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:37,840
Qingtong is leaving.

593
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:57,410
You're finally awake.

594
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:00,550
I've been waiting for you.

595
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:02,030
Who are you?

596
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:03,800
Why am I here?

597
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:20,630
Tell me.

598
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,670
Who sent you here?

599
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:26,070
What do you want

600
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:27,230
in my senior's room?

601
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,400
I won't say anything.

602
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:38,070
Tell me.

603
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:38,870
I'll tell you.

604
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:40,910
I'll tell you everything I know.

605
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:42,030
Please

606
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,440
please spare my life.
