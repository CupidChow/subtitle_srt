[Sword and Beloved]

[Episode 29]

3
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,670
The Power of Hatred...

4
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,180
The endless, surging Power of Hatred...

00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,680
Grief Tree,

6
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,840
absorb it all

7
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,510
and grow faster.

8
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,320
I've been waiting so long

9
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,640
for this day!

10
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,770
The Myriad Blight Formation
has finally been activated.

11
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,030
Once I've regained my power,

12
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,120
Wangquan Hongye

13
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,190
and Wangquan Fugui,

14
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,680
you both

15
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,120
will die.

16
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,000
Put Qingtong down.

17
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,470
Put her down

18
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,150
and hand her over to you?

19
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,870
Why would I do that?

20
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,400
Soldier.

21
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,710
You're a walking disaster.

22
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,000
Everyone around you

23
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,400
meets a terrible fate.

24
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,470
An ill-omened offering

25
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,520
should've stayed on the altar.

26
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,320
Why did you have to leave your Palanquin,

27
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,470
condemning everyone to endless suffering?

28
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,310
My life

29
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,120
isn't for you to decide.

30
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,360
Really?

31
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,910
Go on then.

32
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,950
Let's see whose speed prevails:

33
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,190
your sword, or mine.

34
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,680
Wangquan Fugui.

35
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,430
How about I bestow upon you

36
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,680
a place of no return?

[Snow Demon's Barrier]

[Ancient Snow Demon]

39
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,360
Hello.

40
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,720
Emotion-Devouring Snow Demon?

41
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,430
You know me?

42
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,150
The Ancient Snow Demon
who never grows old.

43
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,920
Why do you do the bidding of others?

44
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,870
Others?

45
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,830
You mean that little spider?

46
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,870
That little spider is very good-looking.

47
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,480
Why shouldn't I do his bidding?

48
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,160
Besides,

49
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,870
the food he brought

50
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,630
is simply exquisite.

51
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,600
Isn't this amusing?

52
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,870
This is my world.

53
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,510
No matter how strong
a human or demon is,

54
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,560
here they can only be frozen,

55
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,240
and I'll feast upon

56
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,600
your beautiful lives,

57
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,190
bit by bit.

58
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,800
What exactly do you intend to do?

59
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,120
Kill you.

60
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,750
Isn't that obvious?

61
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:57,920
That little spider hates you so much.

62
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,710
Yet your vitality is surprisingly robust.

63
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,480
I'm curious to see

64
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,360
how long

65
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,870
you can hold out here.

66
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,800
Spare the words.

67
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,600
Just get to it.

68
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,920
What's the rush?

69
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,070
The concept of time doesn't matter to me.

70
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,040
Here, time passes

71
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,480
like water carving stone
or an iron tree blooming.

72
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,640
Since you're so pretty,

73
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,510
just stay here

74
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,390
and become an ice sculpture

75
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,120
for me to admire.

76
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,360
Li Xueyang.

77
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,630
Do you know the cruel truth of

78
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,270
what happened in the desert of
the Western Regions

79
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,200
1,000 years ago?

80
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,510
I do.

81
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,120
Even knowing all the truth,

82
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,360
you still cling to that corsac fox.

83
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,830
With behavior like this,

84
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,680
you're unworthy of being my descendant—

85
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,480
unworthy even of the surname Li.

86
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,480
This matter has nothing to do with Yunfei.

87
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,560
He's innocent!

88
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,980
You think a simple claim of innocence

89
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,950
can erase all their sins?

90
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,190
I hate.

91
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,650
My hatred runs so deep.

92
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Those who marched into the battlefield
had their bones turned to dust.

93
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,870
Why is it that
the despicable and shameless corsac foxes

94
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,070
could enjoy wealth and power
for 1,000 years,

95
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,830
while our Qianxia Kingdom
was destroyed so early?

96
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,480
I

97
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,920
must make them pay.

98
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,480
Where exactly is my husband?

99
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,240
I've sent him into

100
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,659
the Myriad Blight Formation.

101
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,380
You activated the Myriad Blight Formation?

102
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,390
That's right.

103
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,120
This time,

104
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,070
I'll lay the formation
across the entire Corsac Fox State.

105
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,720
I'll offer the Corsac Fox State
as a sacrifice,

106
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,240
let Madam Black Fox take shape,

107
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,070
and help her annihilate the world.

108
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,600
Madam Black Fox promised me

109
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,460
that she'd help me restore
the Qianxia Kingdom.

110
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,270
You want to make people 1,000 years later

111
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,510
pay for a mistake from 1,000 years ago?

112
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,120
Gulizan.

113
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,040
-You're insane!
-Xueyang, we're running out of time.

114
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,970
Leave this to me.

115
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,120
Go save Poor Dog.

116
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,310
Be safe.

117
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,440
Miss Long, let's go.

118
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,810
I know where the ruins of Qianxia are.

119
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,920
It's just two more lives.

120
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,560
The Myriad Blight Formation
has already been activated.

121
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,960
There's no turning back.

122
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,630
What,

123
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,310
you want to kill me?

124
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:33,900
It's not as simple as you think.

125
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,600
It's okay.

126
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,320
The least I can do is prevent you from

127
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,520
entering the Myriad Blight Formation.

128
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,550
Qingtong.

129
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,120
Do you know how long

130
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,990
I've waited for this moment?

131
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,480
My love for you

132
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,840
is the smallest,

133
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,120
darkest taboo within my heart.

134
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,630
It planted a seed of pain inside me.

135
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,550
That's why I was possessed
by the Black Fox.

136
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,430
Those without darkness or desire
in their hearts,

137
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,670
whether human or demon,

138
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,150
would never be targeted by her.

139
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,270
And the deepest darkness

140
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,720
within me

141
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,430
is the fear of losing you.

142
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,240
Little Spider.

143
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,270
I have to say,

144
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,920
you really calculated your every step.

145
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,460
Not only did you use your sister
as bait to trap the Soldier,

146
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,280
but you also ended up
getting your sister herself.

147
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,150
However,

148
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,960
all you've gained is her body.

149
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,640
What do you plan to do

150
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,120
when she wakes up?

151
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,270
I'll uproot the tree seed inside her

152
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,390
and let her live anew under my protection.

153
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,320
Whether she consents or not,

154
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,720
she'll belong to me.

155
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,220
You've finally made up your mind.

156
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,360
Then, as you wish.

157
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,650
As expected of the demon chosen by Madam.

158
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,440
The drama in the Western Regions
has begun.

159
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,120
Once you obtain Madam's power,

160
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,350
even if the Soldier breaks free,

161
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,080
you'll have nothing to fear.

162
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,750
Qingtong.

163
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,510
Once my blood

164
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,750
fuses with the tree seed inside you,

165
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,960
that tree seed

166
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,790
will be mine.

167
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,630
My Qingtong

168
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,480
doesn't need any power.

169
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,390
She only needs me.

170
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,360
Fan Yunfei.

171
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,790
Fan Yunfei!

172
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,870
Wake up!

173
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,550
Xueyang.

174
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,710
It's dangerous here.

175
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,510
The formation is expanding.

176
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,970
It will consume this place in the end.

177
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,030
You guys need to leave, now!

178
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,600
Why are you talking so much nonsense?

179
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,720
You're my husband.

180
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,440
There's no way I'm letting go
and leaving you behind!

181
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:43,970
Xueyang.

182
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,480
Xueyang!

183
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,330
Don't do anything stupid!

184
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,040
My father once told me

185
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,030
the Myriad Blight Formation
is driven by the power of the 3 clans.

186
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,550
If you try to save me now,

187
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,390
you'll be stepping right into their trap!

188
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,670
Shut up!

189
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,800
I'm not leaving, no matter what!

190
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:14,800
[Myriad Blight Formation]

191
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,200
The 3 clans have entered the field
at the same time.

192
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,120
Gulizan's plan has succeeded.

193
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,960
Guys,

194
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,440
the Myriad Blight Formation
has been activated.

195
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,360
Get ready to be reborn!

196
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,200
Black Grief Tree,

197
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,960
absorb the Power of Hatred
as much as you want

198
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,200
and grow quickly.

199
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,000
After thousands of years,

200
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,360
I

201
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,120
can finally regain my human form!

202
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,600
This formation is draining our strength.

203
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,270
We have to hurry and save him.

204
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,790
Qingtong.

205
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,200
Hang in there.

206
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,120
Don't worry.

207
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,750
I'm just removing the tree seed
from your body.

208
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,240
From now on,
I'll be the one to protect you.

209
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,750
Hang in there.

210
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,290
It'll be over in no time.

211
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:26,800
Qingtong!

212
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,720
Qingtong.

213
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:51,600
Qingtong.

214
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,870
You lied to me again.

215
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,440
So what?

216
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,630
No way.

217
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,140
How could the secret art
of removing the tree seed fail?

218
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,970
You've underestimated me.

219
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,600
Your power comes from the Black Fox.

220
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,080
Since I was able to accept the tree seed
that day,

221
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,510
I can purify it today

222
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,010
and break the seal you placed on me.

223
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,550
Qingcheng,

224
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,240
do you know

225
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,900
that if you remove the tree seed
from my body,

226
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,550
I'll die?

227
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,720
I had absolutely no idea.

228
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,080
Madam Black Fox,

229
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,000
you actually lied to me.

230
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,360
Tell me.

231
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,150
Where is Young Master Fugui?

232
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,800
Do you know the Ancient Snow Demon?

233
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,190
Now that your Young Master Fugui

234
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,580
has been trapped in her blizzard illusion
for so many days,

235
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,880
there's no way he can come back.

236
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,150
Qingtong.

237
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,110
I've told you long ago

238
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,200
that your Young Master Fugui
is already dead!

239
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,630
How is it?

240
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,670
Time flies here, doesn't it?

241
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,600
Another day has passed.

242
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,790
I feel so sorry,
watching your life slip away.

243
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,750
But soon, I'll be able to feast on you.

244
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,120
You're a demon king after all,

245
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,670
and yet you let the Black Fox use you?

246
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,120
What're you talking about, being used?

247
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,320
Isn't that the truth?

248
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,790
The Black Fox wants me
to break the barrier for her.

249
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,630
Before that,

250
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,230
surely she wouldn't kill me.

251
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,270
She must have had you trap me here

252
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:06,030
for some other purpose.

253
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,480
I know that.

254
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,160
She plans to activate
the Myriad Blight Formation

255
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,960
in the Western Regions
to absorb immense Power of Hatred

256
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,750
to help her take physical form.

257
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,920
And as for me—

258
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,940
I'll gain your life force.

259
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,660
The Myriad Blight Formation?

260
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,200
That's right.

261
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,510
The Myriad Blight Formation

262
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,400
is an ancient formation
from the Western Regions,

263
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,790
set up 1,000 years ago

264
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,400
by Queen Gulizan
to resist the berserk dragons

265
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,530
that threatened the Qianxia Kingdom.

266
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,590
The Ancient Snow Demon:

267
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,480
sustained by devoured spirits,

268
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,160
solitary by nature,

269
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,050
born amidst endless snow.

270
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,680
Wicked in nature,

271
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,800
yet untouched in innocence.

272
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,070
Just as the Demon Chronicles recorded.

273
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,720
Every detail rings true.

274
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,410
What's that supposed to mean?

275
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,900
You're trying to trick me?

276
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,000
No.

277
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,640
You must be bluffing.

278
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,440
After all this time,

279
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,790
there's no way your spiritual power
is still that strong!

280
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,680
Is that so?

281
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,030
Qianxia's ruins.

282
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,170
The Myriad Blight Formation.

283
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,260
If I hadn't played along with you,

284
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,680
how could I have learned that
to activate the Myriad Blight Formation,

285
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,080
you sacrificed the entire Western Regions

286
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,070
to nourish the Black Grief Tree?

287
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,680
Qingcheng...

288
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,830
The Myriad Blight Formation
has been activated.

289
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,090
It cannot be reversed.

290
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,860
So what will you do, kill me

291
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,940
or save everyone in the Western Regions?

292
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,260
Make your choice.

293
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,640
Why should he choose?

294
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,370
Young Master Fugui.

295
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,260
Hurry up and go.

296
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,920
We can't let the Black Fox have her way.

297
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,720
Leave this to me.

298
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,270
Qingtong.

299
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,310
You're too naive.

300
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,570
Do you really think you can trap me?

301
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,830
I have no time to waste fighting you.

302
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,430
The Myriad Blight Formation
is waiting for me.

303
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,400
Don't think that just because I favor him,

304
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,880
you can sabotage my plan.

305
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:26,890
[Qianji Hall]

306
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,310
Qingtong.

307
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,200
Are you really going to kill me?

308
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,810
The Black Fox's power
comes from the Power of Hatred.

309
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,550
Thank you for that strike.

310
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,750
It's made me even stronger!

311
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,960
The Qingcheng from back then

312
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,920
has long since died!

313
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,200
Or are you saying

314
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,920
that the little brother

315
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,950
who used to follow behind me,

316
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,370
loving meat and candy,

317
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,270
kind and innocent,

318
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,720
never existed

319
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,960
at all?

320
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,880
Is there really something in your heart

321
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,720
that I can't see?

322
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,350
Yes.

323
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,320
I hate those of my own kind
who once humiliated me.

324
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,350
I hate Madam Yin.

325
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,350
I hate the Yiqi Alliance.

326
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,030
I hate the Soldier!

327
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,830
I want them all dead!

328
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,790
Let me ask you.

329
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,610
If you were given another chance,

330
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,000
would you still let the Black Fox
possess you?

331
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,400
Give me 10,000 chances, and I would
make the same choice every time.

332
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,310
Why!

333
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,110
Say it!

334
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,790
Between a kind, insignificant nobody

335
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,640
and a ruthless, unrestrained powerhouse—

336
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,880
give me 10,000 chances,

337
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:02,010
and I would choose the latter
every single time!

338
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,000
But I won't pretend anymore.

339
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,680
You're mine.

340
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,550
You'll always be mine!

341
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,880
If you don't submit,

342
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,480
I'll destroy you!

343
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,070
You're planning to use the tree seed

344
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,600
to perish together with me?

345
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,240
Qingcheng.

346
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,050
The darkness in your heart came into being

347
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,600
because I failed to protect you well
since we were little.

348
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,780
I hate you for choosing the wrong path,

349
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,490
but I've never thought of
giving up on you!

350
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,370
Little Spider, hurry up and kill her!

351
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:39,030
Tear apart her tree seed
with the Power of Hatred!

352
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,760
Otherwise, we'll all die here!

353
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,750
In the next life,

354
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,400
let's be siblings again.

355
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,880
Once you've gained Madam's power,

356
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,610
you can have any woman you want!

357
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,710
Hurry up and kill her.

358
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,030
Use the Power of Hatred

359
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,560
to tear apart her tree seed!

360
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,030
If you remove the tree seed
from my body,

361
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,160
I'll die.

362
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,160
Qingtong.

363
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,880
I just hope

364
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,790
that if one day I die,

365
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,220
you'll be this sad too.

366
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,710
Don't talk nonsense.

367
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,030
My dear Qingcheng

368
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,510
will live a long life.

369
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,070
Yes.

370
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,130
I'll always be with you, Qingtong.

371
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,480
Qingtong.

372
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,960
If there's a next life,

373
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,640
let's meet again,

374
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:56,960
but not as siblings.

375
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,330
Little Spider, you've lost your mind!

376
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,570
Don't bring me along if you want to die!

377
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:07,790
Qingcheng!

378
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,830
Qingcheng.

379
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:29,920
Qingcheng!

380
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,680
Qingcheng!

381
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,160
The core of the Myriad Blight Formation

382
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,350
should be down here.

383
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:11,720
Enough!

384
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Stop!

385
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,690
If you keep this up,

386
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,350
you'll die!

387
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,960
Even if I die,

388
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,790
I won't let go.

389
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,270
This aura...

390
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,070
It's Fan Yunfei.

391
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,160
He's already at the formation core.

392
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,680
That idiot Qingcheng.

393
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,350
Costing me yet another little black fox

394
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,480
for the sake of a woman.

395
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,880
Fortunately, my transformation
into human form is already settled

396
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,210
and cannot be reversed.

397
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,640
Since the Myriad Blight Formation

398
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,310
is still connected to the Grief Tree,

399
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,440
I might as well take this opportunity

400
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,240
to stretch my limbs,
add a few tricks to the formation,

401
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,480
and help Gulizan

402
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,550
carry out her plan
to annihilate the Western Regions.

403
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,310
Oh no.

404
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,360
The storm's target is
the Corsac Fox State.

405
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,510
I must hold this formation off here.

406
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,170
Otherwise, within an hour,

407
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:31,040
the entire Western Regions
will be wiped out.

408
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:44,400
The Myriad Blight Formation
has been activated—heaven and earth

409
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,980
decay together. Your efforts

410
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,110
can only stall it for a bit.

411
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,070
If you want to die this much,

412
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,640
I'll grant your wish.

413
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,510
Kill!

414
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,760
By the might of Heaven and Earth,

415
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,640
the Five Elements converge as one!

416
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,770
Spirits, assemble—guard the source!

417
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,750
Seal!

418
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,270
How amusing.

419
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,880
Someone is actually able to withstand

420
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,610
the Myriad Blight Formation
strengthened by me?

421
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,440
Let's see how long
this little ant can endure.

422
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,170
This is bad.

423
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,900
Why is the formation storm
getting stronger and stronger?

424
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,830
Blight

425
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,540
is to be broken by life!

426
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,400
With the flame of my heart,

427
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,000
burn away this blight and desolation!

428
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,960
Purest...

429
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,590
Sun Flame!

430
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,070
Purest Sun Flame?

431
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,620
Wangquan Fugui, so it's you.

432
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,880
Excellent.

433
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,720
This way, I get to see

434
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,070
whether the legendary strongest Soldier

435
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,830

earlier than I expected.
