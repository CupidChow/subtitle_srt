[Episode 35]

3
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:56,150
You gave me the name of Qingtong

4
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,640
and taught me swordsmanship

5
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:01,310
not to be anyone's pet.

6
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,280
You are

7
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,310
no longer who you used to be.

8
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,280
My Lady.

9
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,610
You know what Young Master can do.

10
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:25,800
We

11
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,150
can't compete with him.

12
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,440
What else did he order you to do,

13
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,870
besides shutting down Zelan Hall?

14
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,120
Young Master ordered us

15
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,460
to catch some demons outside the city

16
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,060
and throw them in Asura Hall.

17
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,870
Fortunately, they are

18
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,360
just evil demons.

19
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,730
Judging from the information,

20
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,240
because Quan Jingting
obtained the Myriad Blight Formation,

21
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,400
he rose again

22
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,750
and killed Young Master Rumu.

23
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,240
Yes.

24
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,560
Young Master killed Quan Jingting
in the Western Regions.

25
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,440
According to his 4 sword attendants,

26
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,880
they saw from afar

27
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,580
that the sky was full of
ferocious Dragon Qi.

28
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,680
Young Master may have been

29
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,710
affected by the ferocious Dragon Qi.

30
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,110
That's why he's changed.

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,930
The Dragon Qi has entered his body.

32
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,800
Not just that.

33
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,480
Young Master Fugui
once absorbed dragon power,

34
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,700
but it didn't affect him.

35
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,430
You may get up now.

36
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,320
If Young Master Fugui

37
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,800
does anything out of line,

38
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,630
report to me immediately.

39
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,710
Yes, My Lady.

40
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,920
Even Young Master Fugui

41
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,160
has been possessed by Black Fox.

42
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,170
What should I do

43
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,150
next?

[Qianji Hall]

47
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,440
Since Young Master Fugui

48
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,370
has been possessed by Black Fox,

49
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,270
the demon core he absorbed

50
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,040
should be exactly the same

51
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,520
as what Qingcheng absorbed.

52
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,980
It has the Power of Hatred.

53
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,960
Young Master Fugui,

54
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,390
I know.

55
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,620
Young Master.

56
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,180
The 4 sword attendants reported

57
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,280
that many demons are gathering
outside the city.

58
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,800
Do you need to eliminate the demons

59
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,120
and get their demon cores for refining?

60
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,330
The dead

61
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,630

Wangquan Fugui,

63
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,200
I want to see

64
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,409
if you still have
the determination to wield

65
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,820
your sword at someone you grew up with.

66
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,950
Don't let me down.

67
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,809
They are controlled by Black Fox.

00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,510

69
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,720
Why?

70
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,910
Are you not happy

71
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,440
to see me again?

72
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,670
You're not Rumu.

73
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,750
Rumu is dead.

74
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,050
Alas.

75
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,510
Are you going to kill me

76
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,870
and make me

77
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,830
vanish completely?

78
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,960
I came here

79
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,270
to ask you something.

80
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,910
Do you know

81
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,440
how painful it was

82
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,030
to be pierced by my own father?

83
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,000
When I needed you the most,

84
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,080
where were you?

85
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,240
If being Quan Jingting's son is my fault,

86
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,850
then what did Long Weiyun

87
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,000
do wrong?

88
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,750
You promised me

89
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,000
that if I was gone,

90
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,530
you'd take good care of her.

91
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,320
When she was
having her dragon scales scraped,

92
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,670
horns chiseled,

93
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,600
and bones extracted,

94
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,790
where were you?

95
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,270
I forgot.

96
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,240
The real Quan Rumu

97
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,280
wouldn't talk to you like that.

98
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,820
Do you still remember?

99
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,510
When he was alive, he told you

100
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,030
he would defeat Black Fox with you

101
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,870
and live a peaceful life.

102
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,080
No matter how painful it was,

103
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,720
he always

104
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,630
wore a smile.

105
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,440
If

106
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,790
I were not your cousin,

107
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,000
there wouldn't be

108
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,240
so much pain and torture in my life.

109
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,870
If it weren't for you,

110
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,370
I wouldn't have been possessed
by Black Fox,

111
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,920
and I wouldn't be able to rest in peace.

112
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,810
Wangquan Fugui,

113
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,400
what will you use to repay

114
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,650
what you owe me?

115
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,530
I forgot.

116
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,200
You haven't even

117
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,810
tought me how to master skipping stones.

118
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,080
Rumu.

119
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,720
I can't repay what I owe you.

120
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,790
But you

121
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,510
must die.

122
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,240
Wangquan Fugui,

123
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,100
you can even kill your own family.

124
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,600
Very good.

125
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,960
You're finally on our side.

126
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,120
Jiuwei failed?

127
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,720
You fool.

128
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,900
Madam wants him to lose.

129
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,510
She wants Wangquan Fugui

130
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,230
to end his brother completely in person.

131
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,000
You're right.

132
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,080
I want to see

133
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,350
if he's completely corroded by hatred.

134
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,630
Now it seems

135
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,750
the seed of hatred

136
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,100
in Wangquan Fugui's mind has grown.

137
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,080
I can take his body

138
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,600
in peace.

139
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,510
Now,

140
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,820
I just need to wait for him
to help me break the circle

141
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,020
and offer his perfect body.

142
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,720
The tree seed in my body

143
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,670
should be the only way
to break this impasse.

144
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,790
If I can refine the tree seed in my body,

145
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,970
what about the one beyond the circle?

146
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,300
Can that one be refined as well?

147
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,230
You just need to remember:

148
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,860
Love is the lifeline of those
who have the tree seed.

149
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,110
They grow for love.

150
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,270
With love,
there's no place they can't reach.

151
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:08,360
If they can turn the threads of love
into a mighty force,

152
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,140
though mountains collapse,
seas surge, and mists enshroud the way,

153
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,840
love shall be their blade

154
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,580
to break the impasse.

155
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,000
Now I've completely refined the tree seed.

156
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,120
But,

157
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,960
how am I going to break the impasse?

158
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,350
[Dust-Seeker]

159
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,550
They grow for love.

160
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,960
With love,
there's no place they can't reach.

161
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,510
Didn't I ask you to leave?

162
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,180
Why are you still here?

163
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,720
Young Master Fugui,

164
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,230
are you really going to break the circle

165
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,550
to meet Black Fox?

166
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,790
There are some things

167
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,880
you don't need to know.

168
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,710
Then I've got another question for you.

169
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,310
To you,

170
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:49,510
who

171
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,240
am I?

172
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,880
Everyone is in this game.

173
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,030
They are just pawns.

174
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,880
Young Master Fugui,

175
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,240
if I don't leave here,

176
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,130
the next one

177
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,310
will be me, right?

178
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,790
How ridiculous.

179
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,960
I remember telling you

180
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,060
that we would journey together

181
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,890
and walk this path side by side.

182
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,450
I know it's useless to say more.

183
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,440
I'm willing to die.

184
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,240
But I will choose

185
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,010
the final destination.

186
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,860
Those with the tree seed

187
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,840
hold infinite Power of Love.

188
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,010
For those they love,

189
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,520
they'd give everything they have.

190
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:40,150
Turns out the secret of the tree seed
breaking the impasse

191
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,750
lies in giving up everything

192
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,260
for one's beloved ones.

193
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,610
Young Master Fugui,

194
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,260
thank you.

195
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,530
Thank you
for helping with my transformation

196
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,150
to let me feel

197
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,360
the sweetness

198
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,960
and joy as a human.

199
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,550
Thank you

200
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,310
for your warm accompany.

201
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,260
Over the journey,

202
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,660
I've been through countless hardships.

203
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,950
I watched precious emotions

204
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,850
flowing away from my fingertips.

205
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,880
I still remember

206
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,610
the pain of losing them.

207
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,020
Now,

208
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:43,310
I don't want to lose any family anymore.

209
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,960
You solved the problem yourself

210
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,400
and saved your brother.

211
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,480
Qingtong,

212
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,310
your efforts weren't in vain.

213
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,770
Well, Young Master Fugui,

214
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,920
shouldn't you

215
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,130
reward me with some candy?

216
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,240
I hope in the next life,

217
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:29,370
I can still have the candy
Young Master Fugui gives me.

218
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,750
Next,

219
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,590
I'll weave every view we share on the way

220
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,730
into a tapestry.

221
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,480
Deserts, snow,

222
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,790
mountains, and rivers

223
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,710
will no longer just be dreams.

224
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,400
Sure.

225
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,360
We promised to journey together.

226
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,920
No matter what happens,

227
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,070
I'll wait for you.

228
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,030
Okay.

229
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,030
It's a deal.

230
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,880
We'll journey together from now on.

231
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,240
Okay.

232
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,080
Turns out, before we knew it,

233
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,110
we've walked such a long way.

234
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,590
Unfortunately,

235
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,370
I can only accompany you here.

236
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,750
The sunset is beautiful.

237
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,760
Your last wish

238
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:24,720
has come true.

239
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:31,750
Yeah.

240
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,110
You may not know

241
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,510
how happy it is

242
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,400
to watch the sunset with you.

243
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,590
We agreed to journey together.

244
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,750
Unfortunately,

245
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,250
as we walk along,

246
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,760
there's no road ahead anymore.

247
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,590
I still remember

248
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,630
you once asked me

249
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,310
what I planned to do

250
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,400
in the future.

251
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,970
At that time,
I actually wanted to tell you

252
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:29,040
that I hoped you'd always be with me

253
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,000
in the future.

254
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,030
I even thought about

255
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,550
taking you free from chains

256
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,250
and running away

257
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,790
to a far-off place.

258
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,480
Just like the goose we saw,

259
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,920
from south to north,

260
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,240
we could spend seasons together

261
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,720
and enjoy the world's scenery.

262
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,070
What a pity.

263
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,880
The sun sinks.

264
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,410
Birds return to their nest.

265
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,030
And Little Spider

266
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,960
should go where she needs to.

267
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,200
You and I

268
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:44,290
started from Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai

269
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,280
and should end in the same place.

270
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,570
I came with you

271
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,880
to visit Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai,

272
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,590
and I have no regrets

273
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,350
in this life.

274
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,130
Young Master Fugui.

275
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,310
Can I hug you again?

276
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,550
But you said

277
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,590
I'm no longer

278
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,440
who I used to be.

279
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,070
Love that begins

280
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,070
must have an end.

281
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,880
Consider it

282
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,920
an end.

Thank you for what you've done for me.

00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:49,720
Madam,

318
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,330
the Soldier killed his little spider

319
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,900
and took the Black Grief Tree in her body.

320
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:56,960
Now,

321
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,370
he's heading to the Heavenly Gate.

322
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,350
Good.

323
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,310
Very good.

324
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,700
Wangquan Fugui,

325
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,440
you're finally willing
to help me break the circle.

326
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,830
Once I'm out of trouble

327
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,200
and take his perfect body,

328
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,110
by then, all living beings
in the Six Realms

329
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,110
will crawl under my feet.

330
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:20,900
[Heavenly Gate]

331
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,550
Wangquan Fugui,

332
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,920
you're here.

333
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,710
You've finally become like me.

334
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,310
You have no emotions,

335
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,920
except for the hatred towards fate.

336
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,330
Guys!

337
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,270
Go to the barrier

338
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,580
and wait for Wangquan Fugui
to break the circle.

339
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,060
He who slays the dragon
becomes the evil dragon.

340
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,280
Senior Fugui.

341
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:34,310
We'd rather die than let you pass today!

342
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,570
Get into formation!

343
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,680
Senior Fugui!

344
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,110
No!

345
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:35,600
Not enough.

346
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:36,790
Not enough.

347
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,340
Wangquan Fugui,

348
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,440
go ahead.

349
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,510
Among 13 moves
of the Heaven-and-Earth Strike,

350
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,240
you've just wielded one move.

351
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,880
I'm waiting for you inside.

352
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,380
You're doing the right thing.

353
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,750
Wangquan Fugui,

354
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,120
it's about to succeed.

355
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,330
Try a bit harder.

356
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:14,240
My children will help you too.

357
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,110
Guys.

358
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,110
Break the circle!

359
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,510
Come, Wangquan Fugui.

360
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,930
Come to me.

361
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,650
I can't wait.

362
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,720
By the vastness of Heaven and Earth,

363
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,070
all within a single sword!

364
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,970
The barrier
of the Third Young Master of Aolai

365
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,210
has been broken.

366
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,400
Master.

367
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:07,670
Master!

368
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,320
Senior Fugui!
