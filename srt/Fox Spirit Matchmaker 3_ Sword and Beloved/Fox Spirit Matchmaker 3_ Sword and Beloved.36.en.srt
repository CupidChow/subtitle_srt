Wangquan Fugui,

10
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,890
I've been waiting for you for ages.

11
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,280
You finally pulled off the 13th move,
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike,

12
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,010
and helped me break the circle.

13
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:44,960
Now,

14
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,970

Submit to me now.

19
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,830
How pretentious.

20
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,960
Your body is

21
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,820
doomed to be mine.

let me show you

27
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,650
how mighty your father was at his peak.

28
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,470
Oh, no!

29
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,590
These little black foxes are coming out.

30
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,240
We must stop them
from going through the gate.

how do you think

34

of your father's strength?

35
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,920
You can show no mercy

Wangquan Fugui,

no different.

40
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,240
Why don't you just give me your body

41
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,510
so as to avoid further suffering?

42
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,280
You think you can make me do this?

43
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,960
Since you're so stubborn,

44
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,560

45
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,860
Wangquan Fugui,

46
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,830
so what if you can use
the Purest Sun Flame?

47
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,430
As long as there's hatred in the world,

48
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,830
the Grief Tree will never
run out of power.

49

Do you think you can outlast me?

50

There are so many little black foxes

51
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,120
that we can't possibly kill them all!

Be careful, guys.

58
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,550
The Black Fox looks different now.

59
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,200
Why did they disappear?

60

Did they withdraw?

Don't let your guard down.

This is the power of hatred.

73

As a weapon born from hatred,

74

you should know
how terrifying this power is.

What you're doing right now is

76
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,930
a pointless act
like striking a stone with an egg.

77
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,410
It's better to quit resisting

78
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,410

You're so headstrong.

You stole
your disciple's Water-Control Orb

82
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,360

287
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:41,640
That day,

288
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,920
Father left me a way
to subdue the Black Fox,

289
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,690
[Grief Tree Seed] [Water-Control Orb]

290
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,880
but the important Tree Seed
to trap the Black Fox was

291
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,030
inside your body.

292
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,590
I knew you'd die
after losing the Tree Seed.

293
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,750
I had been racking my brain day and night,

294
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,210
yet still failed
to find a perfect solution.

295
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,240
Until then,

296
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,310
I was possessed by a trace
of the Black Fox's Power of Hatred,

297
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,200
which awakened the "demon" inside my mind.

298
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,750
Hatred raged like wildfire

299
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,400
and aroused my desire
to destroy the world.

300
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,130
To suppress this evil thought,

301
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,400
I carved nine spirit-purifying talismans

302
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,200
on the Soul-Devouring Umbrella

303
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,750
and used my life as the offering

304
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,200
to absorb life force through the Umbrella

305
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,500
and barely stay sober.

306
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,640
I forced everyone to drift away from me.

307
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:21,050
But you insisted on clinging to me.

308
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,550
The way you looked at me

309
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,170
caused me more pain than the backfire
of the Soul-Devouring Umbrella.

310
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,310
That extreme, searing torture

311
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,270
trapped me in a cage

312
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,110
of guilt and helplessness,

313
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,550
with no way out.

314
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,640
Until that day,

315
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,110
you walked slowly toward me.

316
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,750
Young Master Fugui,

317
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:48,410
the next one is

318
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,510
me, isn't it?

319
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:55,920
At that moment, I knew

320
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,660
that you had seen through it all.

321
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:03,070
You knew that handing over the Tree Seed
would get you killed,

322
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,150
yet you still did it without hesitation

323
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:07,480
and decided
to fall into the abyss with me,

324
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,160
just for a silver lining
to save the world.

325
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,590
And now,

326
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,270
everything has been reborn
after the snowfall.

327
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,750
Our sacrifice and endurance

328
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,890
have paid off.

329
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:25,590
Qingtong,

330
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,720
you and I wandered alone in this world.

331
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:32,170
Our separate ways
ultimately led us to the same end.

332
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,880
Now that my obsession has been completed,

333
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,720
even if I'm going to disappear
from the Six Realms,

334
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,030
I feel no regret.

335
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:40,550
But you're the only one

336
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,110
I feel deeply guilty about.

337
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,640
Our relationship

338
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,200
grew from dust,

339
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,290
yet upheld justice
for all beings in the storm.

340
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,770
If this love can turn
into an eternal lantern,

341
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:57,040
let it light up the darkness
in the world forever.

342
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,130
Even if it runs out one day,

343
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,030
I believe

344
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:03,830
it will rekindle somewhere in the world.

345
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,080
I hope that by that time,

346
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,100
we can let go
of all the other ties that hold us

347
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,840
and keep each other company

348
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,240
year after year.

349
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:42,400
[The first snow asks dust
how deep the love is.]

350
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:57,440
[Quan]

351
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,550
Senior,

352
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:00,770
I've always wanted to ask you something.

353
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:03,350
[Quan]

354
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:03,690
Why did you choose
to take over the Quan family?

355
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,000
Master said

356
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:09,660
that if one day,

357
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:13,680
the Wangquan Sword
disappeared from the Yiqi Alliance,

358
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,270
then the Wangquan Manor

359
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,590
and the name, Wangquan,

360
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,380
would no longer need to exist.

361
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,750
So I've made up my mind.

362
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,030
From now on,

363
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,260
I'll divide the name, Wangquan,

364
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,410
into two.

365
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,330
They're the Wangs in the mainland

366
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:32,860
and the Quans at the border.

367
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,720
I'm willing to change my surname to Quan

368
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,180
and guard the Western Regions
at the border.

369
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,730
Also, I'll choose outstanding disciples

370
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,650
and give them the surname Wang.

371
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,690
They'll guard the Central Plain.

372
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,000
I got it,

373
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:46,920
Senior.

374
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:54,630
[Quan]

375
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,100
Take it slow.

376
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,550
Here we are.

377
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:04,460
Be careful.

378
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,670
So beautiful.

379
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,240
There are flowers all over.

380
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,100
That is the Grief Tree over there.

381
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,350
Do you

382
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,790
want to hear the story

383
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,270
about Master Fugui?

384
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,830
Yes.

385
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,200
From the moment

386
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,460
the black energy infiltrated his heart,

387
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,570
it was all part of his plan.

388
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,150
What happened in the end?

389
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,790
Yeah.

390
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:26,610
The end...

391
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,720
And then,

392
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,320
his battle with Black Fox
beyond the circle was

393
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,480
unbelievably fierce and even

394
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,270
overshadowed the sun and the moon.

395
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,030
In the end,

396
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,730
he swallowed the Black Fox

397
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,180
and perished with her.

398
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,070
He was so strong.

399
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,670
How could he die?

400
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,960
He's not dead.

401
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,550
He is the strongest person in the world.

402
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,270
Yes,

403
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,400
Master Fugui is not dead.

404
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,150
He just transformed

405
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,510
into the life force
of everything in the world,

406
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,440
and he's been by our side all along.

407
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,240
Yes.

408
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,720
He's always here.

409
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,920
He looks at you every day

410
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,650
to see if you're training hard.

411
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:05,830
Mm.

412
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,830
I'll work hard to learn skills

413
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,480
and protect

414
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,180
this world in the future.

415
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,270
When I grow up,

416
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,560
I want to be a great hero

417
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,640
like Master Fugui.

418
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,550
I want to be a great hero, too!

419
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,440
Me, too!

420
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,160
Great hero!

421
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:17,880
Me, too.

422
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,510
Alright, great heroes.

423
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,020
Now,

424
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,170
we need to go back for training.

425
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,150
Work hard today.

426
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,160
After that,

427
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,490
we'll take you to hang out again tomorrow.

428
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,060
Okay.

429
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,830
Hooray.

430
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,750
Let's go back.

431
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,030
Let's go.

432
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:34,940
Great.

433
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,460
Let's go.

434
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,030
Let's go back.

435
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,860
How did you endure
the life-burning torment

436
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,820
of the Soul-Devouring Umbrella?

437
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,550
Master,

438
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,200
you had sacrificed

439
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,640
so much in your life.

440
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,640
Master,

441
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,110
we are all doing well.

442
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,530
All your expectations

443
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,400
have come true.

444
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,590
If you can see it,

445
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,290
you would be happy too.
