[Sword and Beloved]

2
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,509
[Episode 12]

3
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,030
You're quite interesting.

4
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,430
No wonder

5
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,760
the Soldier took a liking to you.

6
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,560
[Wangquan]

7
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
This sword will be

8
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,890
the Wangquan Sword for our child.

9
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,310
I'll teach him every sword technique

10
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,150
I know.

11
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:13,350
[Grand Ambition Soaring to the Heavens]

12
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,590
How are things

13
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,630
with the elders?

14
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,730
They are still waiting in the hall.

15
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,750
They said

16
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,720
if they don't get
a satisfactory answer soon,

17
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,430
they'll forge Fugui

18
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,800
into a magic tool.

19
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,240
They're set on punishing Fugui,

20
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,890
but I won't let them have their way.

21
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,680
Fei.

22
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,590
Yes?

23
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,570
Have you gone to check on Fugui?

24
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,560
Yes.

25
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:55,960
Has he

26
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,640
reflected on what he did?

27
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,240
Young Master's temper is just like yours
when you were young—

28
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,240
stubborn as hell.

29
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,670
Give him one more day.

30
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,190
If Fugui still

31
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,990
refuses to apologize tomorrow,

32
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,630
I'll personally throw those people

33
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,089
out of the Wangquan Manor.

34
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,040
Master,

35
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,570
Quan Jingting requests

36
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,159
your presence in the main hall right away.

37
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,470
[Do your best to kill demons.]

38
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,000
Quan Jingting,

39
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,800
what's the meaning of this?

40
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,360
Chief,

41
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,040
don't you think this pitiful little demon

42
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,240
looks familiar?

43
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,390
She's the one who kept the Soldier company

44
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,120
at the Cold Pool.

45
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:09,870
Nonsense!

46
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,750
If she's a demon,

47
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,200
why doesn't she carry any demonic aura?

48
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,000
The Soldier

49
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,480
used a magic tool to suppress

50
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,120
her demonic aura.

51
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I found this sword

52
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,680
on this demon

53
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,240
when I caught her.

54
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,460
Elder Shouren,

55
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,159
take a look. What kind of sword is this?

56
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,280
This is the Wangquan family's unique
sword-forging technique.

57
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,120
Hongye,

58
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,080
give us an explanation.

59
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,120
Tingyun.

60
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,300
[Dust-Seeker]

61
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,800
You really are a demon.

62
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,360
Tell us!

63
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,190
What's going on?

64
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,390
You've found me out.

65
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,150
Yes.

66
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,420
I'm a spider demon from the Silk Cave.

67
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,430
The Mistress gave me a magic tool

68
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,400
so I could take human form

69
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,050
and sneak into the Wangquan Manor.

70
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:46,920
I stole

71
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,920
this sword myself.

72
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:50,950
We demons

73
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,630
and the Wangquan family

74
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,360
will forever be sworn enemies.

75
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,610
So I intended to use this sword

76
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:00,360
to kill everyone in the Wangquan Manor!

77
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,940
You captured me today,

78
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,490
so I have nothing to say.

79
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,780
Kill me if you wish.

80
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,190
Fine!

81
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,190
As you wish.

82
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,560
Chief,

83
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,400
the Soldier having an affair

84
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,140
with a demon is a grave matter.

85
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,030
It must be investigated thoroughly.

86
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,289
To show that the Wangquan family is fair,

87
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,600
let me

88
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,039
interrogate this spider demon for you.

89
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,809
Watch your mouth, Master Quan.

90
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,600
This demon has pleaded guilty.

91
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,690
She never said
she had an affair with the Soldier.

92
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,380
You believe what a demon says?

93
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,130
The Blue Sky Assembly's prophecy—

94
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,600
I suppose

95
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,800
you all know about it.

96
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,130
Elder Shouren,

97
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,080
are you

98
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,900
going to just let it slide?

99
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,360
Gentlemen,

100
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,210
the Chief
and the Soldier are father and son.

101
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
So the Chief should recuse himself.

102
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,390
Jingting,

103
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,160
you'll interrogate this demon.

104
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,880
My age has not clouded my judgment yet.

105
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,440
Fine.

106
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,350
Spider demon,

107
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,440
be honest

108
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,000
and tell us everything.

109
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,080
How did you

110
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,150
seduce the Soldier

111
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,800
and have an affair with him?

112
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,240
Bah!

113
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,050
I don't even know the Soldier.

114
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,010
How could I have an affair with him?

115
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,010
You, on the other hand,

116
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,080
are such a hypocrite.

117
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,360
We of the Silk Cave

118
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,940
have long known what you've done.

119
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,630
You're a treacherous,

120
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,000
faithless,

121
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,530
and self-serving scumbag!

122
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,320
Looks like

123
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,270
you won't tell the truth

124
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,000
until you've suffered a little.

125
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,120
See?

126
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,990
I was right about you.

127
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,960
You're a treacherous,

128
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,200
faithless,

129
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,970
and self-serving scumbag!

130
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,510
Little demon,

131
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,530
you're quite hard to crack.

132
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,690
Will you confess or not?

133
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,200
I've told you.

134
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,960
I stole

135
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,000
this sword myself.

136
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,320
If you want to kill or torture me,

137
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,240
just go ahead!

138
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,440
I'd like to see

139
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,240
how many talismans you can survive.

140
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,970
Master Quan!

141
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,320
She said she has nothing to do
with the Soldier.

142
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,390
Must you torture her

143
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,790
into a false confession?

144
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,480
Torture?

145
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,640
Ridiculous!

146
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,810
This demon is cunning and deceitful.

147
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,390
If we don't push her a bit,

148
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,720
how can we get the truth?

149
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,960
Feng,

150
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,770
you're so exasperated.

151
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,750
Are you

152
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,200
trying to protect this demon?

153
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:26,510
You...

154
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,080
Tingyun.

155
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,900
Stand down.

156
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,960
I know…

157
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,690
now that I've fallen into your hands,

158
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,330
there's no way I'm making it out alive.

159
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,910
But even so,

160
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,630
I won't let you use me.

161
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,670
You little demon,

162
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,250
you think I want to use you?

163
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,910
Getting others to do your dirty work

164
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,510
and eliminate your enemies—

165
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,480
isn't that what you're best at?

166
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,000
Nonsense!

167
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,650
Still refusing to tell the truth?

168
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,390
You're so stubborn.

169
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,670
Are you going to tell us or not?

170
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,150
The Silk Cave's intel…

171
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,720
has never been wrong.

172
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,200
You…

173
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,610
all of you who believe Quan Jingting,

174
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,510
have you forgotten

175
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,440
how he was driven out
of the Wangquan Manor back then?

176
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,440
He is...

177
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,050
He's using you to do his dirty work.

178
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,670
He's using you

179
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,510
for personal revenge!

180
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,790
He's using all of you!

181
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,400
Senior Fugui.

182
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,280
Senior Fugui!

183
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,840
I'm Feng Tingyun.

184
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,910
Demon,

185
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,670
you'd rather die

186
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,380
than admit to an affair with the Soldier.

187
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,790
Seems the two of you are very close.

188
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,360
How do you

189
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,320
explain this?

190
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,240
This brocade was found
in the Soldier's quarters.

191
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,980
Producing silk to make brocade
with paintings as your love token.

192
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,870
How very refined!

193
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,910
