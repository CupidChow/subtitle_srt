[Sword and Beloved]

2
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,640
[Episode 25]

3
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,560
Tell me.

4
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,710
You awoke me
across a thousand years of time.

5
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,000
What do you want to do

6
00:01:58,509 --> 00:01:59,789
and what do you want?

7
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,760
I need you to deploy
the Myriad Blight Formation

8
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,590
to help Madam Black Fox escape.

9
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,350
I will satisfy

10
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,110
all you need.

11
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,400
Young man,

12
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,560
remember your promise today.

13
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,590
If you lie to me,

14
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,030
I'll let you
fall into the abyss

15
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,120
and never be reincarnated.

16
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,560
I didn't expect that sacrificing
my lifespan would be so detrimental.

17
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,160
With my physical condition,

18
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,000
I can't hold on much longer.

19
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,800
In this case,

20
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,090
I should find Qingtong as soon as possible

21
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,470
to settle one thing.

22
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,400
Fugui.

23
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,520
I just don't understand.

24
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,720
Although saving others is important,

25
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,720
no matter what,

26
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,900
you shouldn't have sacrificed
your lifespan.

27
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,340
You have been exiled.

28
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,470
You should do things

29
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,400
like planting flowers,

30
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,260
growing grass,

31
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,800
and looking for Little Spider.

32
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,360
Right?

33
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,120
Okay, I'll drink.

34
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,190
Fugui.

35
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,980
I don't mind being
your personal bodyguard.

36
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,000
But

37
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,550
you have to give me a chance
to draw my sword.

38
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,310
Next time.

39
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,250
Next time?

40
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,130
I've guessed it right.

41
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,190
I wouldn't believe you.

42
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:26,680
Fugui.

43
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,360
One day,

44
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,340
I will protect you too.

45
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,710
That's cheesy.

46
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,030
I-Is it?

47
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,079
Really?

48
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,710
Quite pretentious, yeah.

49
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,560
But I mean it.

50
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,800
Seriously,

51
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,880
you have to do me a favor.

52
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,310
You have to help

53
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,530
break the binding spell for me.

54
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,560
If you forcefully break the spell now,

55
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,360
can your body

56
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,870
take it?

57
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,750
Of course.

58
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,430
Master.

59
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,710
Celestial Master.

60
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,640
Why are you here?

61
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,190
I brought Xueyang here to see you.

62
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,530
I came here

63
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,750
to thank you for saving Poor Dog.

64
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,720
I brought some good wine.

65
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,630
Let's get drunk tonight.

66
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,460
You don't know.

67
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,860
He can't drink at all.

68
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,510
You can just give it to me.

69
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,600
I'll drink with you

70
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,800
on behalf of him tonight.

71
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,270
Well...

72
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,870
Right, Fugui?

73
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,310
Yes.

74
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,830
Seriously, Fugui?

75
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,080
You're such a heavy drinker.

76
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,770
I didn't realize it before.

77
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,610
I forgot to tell you.

78
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,040
My mother

79
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,890
could never get drunk.

80
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,600
We've really broadened our horizons.

81
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,560
Come on!

82
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,650
Let's have another drink!

83
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,960
To Fugui's first drink!

84
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,430
Cheers.

85
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,430
Drinking up this pot

86
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,720
means our friendship lasts forever!

87
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,390
Cheers!

88
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:08,970
Come on.

89
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,480
Come on.

90
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,240
Come on, come on.

91
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,560
-Let's drink.
-Cheers.

92
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,760
Don't drink too much.

93
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,470
It's okay. It's okay.

94
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:14,950
Drink.

95
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,120
Eat.

96
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,390
I cooked them all.

97
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,720
I cooked them all.

98
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:22,190
It's so delicious
that even a chef would praise it.

99
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,120
Your cooking is really good.

100
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,050
Come on, come on.

101
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,920
Can you two

102
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,750
stop holding hands?

103
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,360
Hurry up.

104
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,310
Eat this.

105
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:31,950
Eat.

106
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,510
Xueyang, eat.

107
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:36,800
Here.

108
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,159
Xueyang.

109
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,720
I want more.

110
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,270
You guys eat.

111
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,470
I don't usually show my cooking skills.

112
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,920
It's delicious.

113
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,159
Get him some of it.

114
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:49,720
This one.

115
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,190
I didn't expect

116
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,040
that Master

117
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,880
would be a Soldier of the Yiqi Alliance.

118
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,120
Let me tell you,

119
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,310
when the Water-Control Orb

120
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,240
was in his hands,

121
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,560
it had absolutely no temper at all.

122
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,510
No wonder

123
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,110
he's a Soldier.

124
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,000
Soldier?

125
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,270
What's the big deal about a Soldier?

126
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,310
Your Xue...

127
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,920
Xueyang is also a Soldier, isn't she?

128
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,850
What did you say?

129
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,950
This is precisely

130
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,680
what I want to happen.

131
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,000
You said I was terrible?

132
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,240
As ordinary people,

133
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,160
we can get drunk,

134
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,530
cry,

135
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,330
and smile whenever we want.

136
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,630
There are no disputes in the world,

137
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,220
where people can lead a free life.

138
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,000
Qingtong,

139
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,950
I'm living a normal life now.

140
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,430
But

141
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,360
where are you?

142
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,000
Seems that the wound
caused by the sacrifice

143
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,800
has extended to my vital organs.

144
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,600
I must set off to find Qingtong
as soon as possible

145
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,150
before there are any major abnormalities.

146
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,240
Cheers!

147
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,420
Celestial Master.

148
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,310
Let me tell you.

149
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,430
Back then, Master

150
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,760
refused to touch my belly, no matter what.

151
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,870
I...

152
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,750
I held back a big move.

153
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,800
I'm eating.

154
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,630
Sorry.

155
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,750
Fugui told me about this.

156
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,430
He said you held it in

157
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,430
and peed the bed.

158
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,510
When you have babies,

159
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,040
I'll surely tell them this.

160
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,870
Stop, stop.

161
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,920
My husband is stupid.

162
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,040
My husband is stupid.

163
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,750
I'm sorry.

164
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,070
Sorry.

165
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,800
Here.

166
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,800
Xueyang,

167
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,560
let's drink less.

168
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,120
Let's take a rest first.

169
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,360
Be good.

170
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm not drunk.

171
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,430
But you two...

172
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,680
I've had enough.

173
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,370
Speaking of which, Celestial Master,

174
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:36,789
I really have to thank you.

175
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,600
Without you,

176
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,510
I wouldn't have gotten such a good wife.

177
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,240
So beautiful.

178
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,600
Celestial Master, do you think

179
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,150
we're a good match?

180
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,390
Look at you.

181
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,920
As if others don't have one.

182
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,360
I almost succeeded.

183
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,770
There's something up with you?

184
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,000
Tell us.

185
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,240
I've agreed.

186
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,000
But...

187
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,560
But she hasn't.

188
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,960
It's not almost successful.

189
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,960
That's way too far.

190
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,230
But it doesn't matter.

191
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,550
Life is just like a drama.

192
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,360
I'll never get angry.

193
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,870
Someone will be happy if I get angry.

194
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,530
Besides, getting angry

195
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,550
costs energy.

196
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,910
It rhymes again.

197
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,150
Help.

198
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,860
Rhyme

199
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,080
is all you've got.

200
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,520
But Celestial Master,

201
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,030
you still have us.

202
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,630
Xueyang,

203
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,960
Master,

204
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,270
and you.

205
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,270
You guys are the most important

206
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,750
to me in my life.

207
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,120
Stop it.

208
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,080
There's a priority order
in the ranking list.

209
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,270
I!

210
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,120
It's okay. It's okay.

211
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,600
I swear here

212
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,630
that I'll look after you, Master,

213
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,270
no,

214
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,200
Celestial Master.

215
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,390
Celestial Master. Celestial Master.

216
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,110
Celestial Master.

217
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,370
And Master. I promise.

218
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:09,910
Yes!

219
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,960
Whatever Poor Dog said is right.

220
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,320
Right?

221
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,520
We'll take care of you two until you die.

222
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:18,600
Drink!

223
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,480
No more, no more.

224
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,630
I'll take her back to rest.

225
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,000
Well, are you...

226
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,870
-Xueyang.
-Really leaving me here

227
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,240
and letting me drink alone?

228
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,440
Don't worry.

229
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,110
I'll teach you later.

230
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,390
I'm married.

231
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,590
I've been through it.

232
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,360
Here.

233
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,240
Drink.

234
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,030
Fill the cup.

235
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,550
Cheers.

236
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,280
Young Master Fugui.

237
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,630
What's wrong with him?

238
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,600
His power is less than 30%
of what it used to be.

239
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
He also has severe internal injuries.

240
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,360
Did those people from the Wangquan Manor

241
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,840
really hurt you so badly?

242
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,920
Young Master Fugui,

243
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,010
I will surely seek justice for you.

244
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,540

This is for you.

248

make this yourself?

252
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,480
Yeah.

253
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,360

We promised to journey together.

00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,880
Young Master Fugui,

272
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,410
the tree seed in my body

273
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,840
is related to the Black Fox.

274
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,330
The Black Fox is after you.

275
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,040
So forgive me.

276
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,550
I can't go back

277
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,440
to you right now.

278
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,080
You used to protect me before.

279
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,440
This time,

280
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,030
I'll protect you.

281
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,910
When I can control the tree seed
in my body

282
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,970
and stop connecting to the Black Fox,

283
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,050
I will come back to you

284
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,750
and travel
all over the mountains and rivers

285
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,320
with you.

286
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,320
Little Spider,

287
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,040
this is not the way back to Qianji City.

288
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,430
Where are you going?

289
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,850
Qingtong is not in the city.

290
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,690
I also happen to take a break from work

291
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,870
to meet someone.

292
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,910
Someone I've been looking forward to.

293
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,030
I'm warning you.

294
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,320
Don't provoke him now.

295
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,080
Wangquan Fugui,

296
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,120
with the abolished sword meridian,

297
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,630
even made it to suppress the chaos
in the Western Regions.

298
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,630
You and I are no match for him.

299
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,800
All the more reason for me to visit him.

300
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,250
Let's see

301
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,610
how much power Wangquan Fugui has left

302
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,600
without the sword meridian.

303
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,000
Hya!

304
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,000
Hya!

305
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,720
Could it be

306
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,080
that someone was here just now?

307
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,880
Excuse me, are you Lantern Wang?

308
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,630
I heard that you write letters
for others in Sandstorm Town.

309
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:30,830
I especially came to ask you
to help me write a letter home.

310
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,150
You

311
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,230
don't seem to be illiterate.

312
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,270
It's not appropriate

313
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,800
to judge people by their looks, right?

314
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,480
You're right.

315
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,720
But today,

316
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,590
let's just forget it.

317
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,870
Please come again another day.

318
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,910
I came all the way here for you.

319
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,340
Are you really going to reject me?

320
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,910
All the way here?

321
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,870
I have a habit of writing letters
on behalf of others.

322
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,080
They should

323
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,250
grind the ink themselves.

324
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,240
Good.

325
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,720
You don't look well.

326
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,150
I'll do it.

327
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,680
You may speak now.

328
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,010
Listen to me carefully.

329
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,829
This letter

330
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,109
is for my sister.

331
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:22,829
Sister.

332
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,480
I know you still

333
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,240
can't get that man out of your mind.

334
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,000
But he doesn't deserve you.

335
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,640
Yes.

336
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,160
Everyone respects him for being the best.

337
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,590
So what?

338
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,000
He is hypocritical.

339
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,070
He only cares

340
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,150
about his righteousness

341
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,400
and his outstanding achievements.

342
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,200
In his mind,

343
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,310
you are nothing.

344
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,900
You're insignificant to him.

345
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,680
I'm the only one

346
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,480
who loves and cherishes you.

347
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:08,790
Why?

348
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,480
Are you scared?

349
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:16,960
You are

350
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,310
such a devoted person.

351
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,570
Then your sister

352
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,730
must be a very special person.

353
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,270
My sister is pretty.

354
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,400
She's like a gem shining in the sun.

355
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,000
If she moves slightly,

356
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,880
she'll emit colorful light.

357
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,160
We grew up together

358
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,220
and worked hard to survive together.

359
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,920
Without that man,

360
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,310
she would live better now.

361
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,770
I will be her pride

362
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,960
and her dependence.

363
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,270
I love her.

364
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:52,050
I love her more than anyone does
in the world.

365
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,030
What else?

366
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,210
That's enough.

367
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,970
What do you think
my sister would look like

368
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,420
when she sees this letter?

369
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,430
Where is Qingtong?

370
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,880
Do you think I'll tell you?

371
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,480
You took her away.

372
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,000
Was she willing or not?

373
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,110
You know who I am?

374
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,880
Where is Qingtong?

375
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:04,960
Fugui!

376
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,510
Master, are you alright?

377
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,310
Who are you?

378
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,000
Don't.

379
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:20,960
Fugui.

380
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,040
Are you alright?

381
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:24,750
I'm fine.

382
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,200
Just now,

383
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,300
I vaguely heard him say "Sister."

384
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,360
Then, is he Qingtong's younger brother?

385
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,880
He looked fierce.

386
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,940
He was up to no good.

387
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,030
No matter what,

388
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,240
Qingtong is very smart.

389
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,500
Don't worry about her.

390
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,220
She should be fine.

391
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,400
Fine?

392
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,030
He came to provoke us.

393
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,110
You call that fine?

394
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,270
But...

395
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,030
Who is Qingtong?

396
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,480
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

397
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,110
Alright.

398
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,960
I was planning to break the binding spell

399
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,160
to look for Qingtong.

400
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,750
It seems

401
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,630
that there's no time to lose.

402
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,030
No way. In such a hurry?

403
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:03,790
He came to provoke you;

404
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:04,450
you can just

405
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,520
brush him off.

406
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,370
Your health is more important.

407
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,480
Breaking the binding spell

408
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,410
is not because of his provocation.

409
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,880
I sensed the aura of Black Fox

410
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,610
on Qingtong's little brother.

411
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,960
There's something really wrong

412
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,110
with her brother.

413
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,480
I see.

414
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,650
I'll go with you.

415
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,270
Unrest is brewing

416
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,120
in the Western Regions.

417
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,370
The Quan family

418
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,880
needs you to mediate.

419
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,350
Besides, this place is the closest to
the beyond the circle.

420
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,410
I'll be more at ease

421
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,890
if you stay here.

422
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,070
Alright.

423
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,300
Come in with me.

424
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,270
Fugui.

425
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,440
How is Master?

426
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:57,440
He's fine.

427
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,270
After half an hour of circulation,

428
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,270
he should be fine.

429
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,020
Celestial Master.

430
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,590
I may be a little dull-witted,

431
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,650
but I'm not stupid.

432
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,510
Is Master not feeling well?

433
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,830
I can go with him.

434
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,790
The saddest thing

435
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,240
in my life

436
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,480
is that I wasn't with my brother

437
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,540
when he met a demon.

438
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:21,080
I don't want something like this
to happen again.

439
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,360
It's not impossible.

440
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,070
But

441
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,000
you just got married.

442
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,010
Shouldn't you go ask

443
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,590
about Xueyang's idea?

444
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,610
Of course I have to ask.

445
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,110
When Xueyang wakes up,

446
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,640
I'll discuss it with her.

447
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,350
I've never seen such a mushy man.

448
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,680
I can't really bear you.

449
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,440
Master.

450
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,240
It's time to take your medicine.

451
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,750
Okay.

452
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,440
You don't look well.

453
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,070
What's wrong?

454
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,000
Nothing.

455
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,310
It's fine.

456
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,830
I think

457
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,270
maybe

458
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,310
I've sat here for too long tonight.

459
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,200
I feel a little dizzy.

460
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,070
It seems

461
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,880
I'm really old.

462
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,110
I have to admit I'm getting old.

463
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,400
You're just too tired.

464
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,350
Since Senior Fugui and Young Master Rumu

465
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,750
left the Wangquan Manor,

466
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,240
you've been in charge of

467
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,840
all the matters in the manor.

468
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,110
Tingyun.

469
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,160
Pass my order

470
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,010
to continue to select excellent talents.

471
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,880
In 3 months,

472
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,960
I will resign as Chief.

473
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,520
Whoever is capable

474
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,230
shall take the position.

475
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,030
Master,

476
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,640
why all of a sudden?

477
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,400
Not at all.

478
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,020
I've thought about it for a long time.

479
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:15,960
Besides,

480
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,030
it's time to give a chance

481
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,830
to younger generations.

482
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,830
I don't object to your resignation.

483
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,000
But what about the Wangquan Manor?

484
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,070
What will happen to our manor?

485
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,350
Will it not exist in the future?

486
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,440
There is no making without breaking.

487
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,350
It doesn't matter
whether the Wangquan Manor

488
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,150
exists or not.

489
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,030
Besides,

490
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,110
I have

491
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,030
limited energy.

492
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,640
Yiqi Alliance

493
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,440
needs a stronger core.

494
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,000
If you've decided to resign,

495
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:55,640
it's fine.

496
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:56,960
But Master,

497
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,690
you can't work so hard anymore.

498
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,830
Okay.

499
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,830
I know what to do.

500
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,720
Go check

501
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,330
where there is chaos

502
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,720
to see if there is any trace
of Little Black Fox.

503
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,920
If anything happens,

504
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,120
tell me immediately.

505
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,030
Yes.

506
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,510
What did you ask Jiang Bo to do?

507
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,240
You actually know to come back.

508
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,070
You've been away
from Qianji City for days.

509
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:47,930
Where were you?

510
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,440
How dare you say that?

511
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,350
Since you went to the Western Regions,

512
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,880
did you see Wangquan Fugui?

513
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,790
I thought you were so happy

514
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,720
and forgot about us in Qianji City.

515
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,880
I'm asking you.

516
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,490
Why are you involving others?

517
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:06,790
Besides,

518
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,760
how can I leave you here alone

519
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,310
with peace of mind?

520
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,830
On your trip
to the Western Regions this time,

521
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:17,090
didn't you acknowledge Wangquan Fugui?

522
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,750
Now is not the time.

523
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,790
There's something more important

524
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:25,720
to do.

525
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,350
Little Spider,

526
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,520
what's wrong with Qingtong?

527
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,820
The whole city has been mobilized
to investigate Madam Black Fox.

528
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,070
I've told you before.

529
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,000
Qingtong is tracking Little Black Fox.

530
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,590
I advise you not to come out.

531
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,110
If she finds out,

532
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,160
you'll be dead.

533
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,920
You must be happy

534
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,810
about Qingtong
not acknowledging the Soldier?

535
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,550
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

536
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:03,080
Qingtong can connect
to the Black Grief Tree.

537
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,270
If she knows about Madam Black Fox's plan

538
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,530
and tells the Soldier,

539
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,590
the plan may fail.

540
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,880
So you'd better find a way

541
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,590
to keep Qingtong in line.

542
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,680
Also,

543
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,370
Madam Black Fox said

544
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,310
you'd better find a way
to remove the tree seed

545
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,480
in her body as soon as possible.

546
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,550
Otherwise...

547
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,960
What?

548
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,110
Tell Madam Black Fox

549
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,310
that she can use me,

550
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,600
but she must never
lay a finger on Qingtong.

551
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,510
Otherwise,

552
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,960
I'll fight to the death.

553
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,890
That depends on your performance.

554
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,510
The plan of the Myriad Blight Formation

555
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,570
is very important to Madam Black Fox.

556
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,000
Don't let Qingtong ruin the plan.

557
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,160
Also,

558
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,880
you need to find a way

559
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,940
to divert Yiqi Alliance's attention

560
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,750
and buy some time for Gulizan.

561
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,830
I have a good idea

562
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,000
to accomplish 3 goals in one go.

563
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:04,310
It can keep the Wangquan Manor
too busy to attend to other matters,

564
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:07,110
stop Qingtong's investigation
of Madam Black Fox,

565
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:10,070
and make her fight against Wangquan Fugui,

566
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,670
making it impossible
for them to get together.

567
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:28,650
[Martial Arts Field of the Ximen Family]

568
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,590
Wangquan Hongye.

569
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,200
How could you let a groom's child

570
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,000
be on the same level as me?

571
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,240
Why?

572
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,960
He even values Dongfang Yuechu so much.

573
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,200
The abdication?

574
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,880
The recommendation of the capable
without avoiding relatives?

575
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,830
Nonsense!

576
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,240
He just wants to control everything!

577
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,600
If you hate the Wangquan family so much,

578
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,800
why don't you replace them?

579
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,480
You're not capable.

580
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,750
You can't defeat him.

581
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,440
Who are you?

582
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,590
You want to die?

583
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,680
If you dare,

584
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:50,000
just give me a quick death.

585
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,350
A lackey who grovels
at others' feet like you

586
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,370
doesn't deserve a quick death.

587
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,350
Since you hate the Wangquan family
so much,

588
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,030
I will give you a chance to fight back.

589
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:19,340
[Demon Core Refinement]

590
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,160
This...

591
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,730
This is the practice
of refining demon cores.

592
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,240
Why?

593
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,610
You dare not practice?

594
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,260
Where should I go to catch demons?

595
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,240
You can go to Qianji City to catch some.

596
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,730
That lawless Qianji City?

597
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,070
Who are you exactly?

598
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,590
Why did you teach me this method?

599
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,960
What is your purpose?

600
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,160
I have my own plan.

601
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,790
You don't need to know.

602
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,640
You don't have to accept it.

603
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,550
I'll wait for the day

604
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,550
when you kowtow to young talents.

605
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,960
The fight between humans and demons

606
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,720
is pressing.

607
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,240
Qingtong.

608
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:46,000
As long as you kill this scum,

609
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,330
you'll be the enemy of the Yiqi Alliance.

610
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,510
By then,

611
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,030
can you still be with
your Young Master Fugui?

612
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:09,880
Alright.

613
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,790
I put the clothes and notes

614
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,480
inside.

615
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,190
Remember to come back early.

616
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,350
If someone really
makes things difficult for you,

617
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,000
remember to tell them who I am.

618
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,130
The Li Army of the Western Regions
is quite influential.

619
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,920
Don't worry.

620
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,880
Master drew a talisman
to isolate the demonic aura for me.

621
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,960
Ordinary people
can't see anything unusual.

622
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,400
Don't you have anything else

623
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,510
to tell me?

624
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,380
That's all.

625
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,260
Haven't you made yourself clear?

626
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,110
What's wrong?

627
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,350
Xueyang.

628
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,480

Don't let Royal Master wait too long.

I'll wait for you here.

648
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,320
Okay.

649
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,090
I'm leaving.

650
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,480
I'm leaving.

651
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,190

652
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:22,960

653
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,630

Don't worry.

655
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,250
I'll be back soon.

656
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,670
Wangquan Hongye,
Chief of the Yiqi Alliance,

657
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,510
is about to abdicate.

658
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,880
My Lady, bad news.

659
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:52,670
What is it?

660
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,270
Some demons near Qianji City

661
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,610
have been captured
by the Ximen family of the Yiqi Alliance.

662
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,800
Little Spider.

663
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,920
You are so cunning.

664
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,650
By just sacrificing several demons,

665
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,440
you've diverted Qingtong's attention

666
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,440
from Madam Black Fox.

667
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,480
Good.

668
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,840
Very good.

669
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,960
There's a lot to do
before finishing the plan.

670
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,000
The Ximen family is just a bait.

671
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,040
How is your subsequent plan

672
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,630
going?

673
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,150
Don't worry.

674
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,880
Everything will go as planned.

675
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,920
From now on,

676
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,800
the Western Regions and the Yiqi Alliance

677
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:37,590
are both under my control.

678
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,710
Only I

679
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,070
can make Qingtong happy.

680
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:54,920
[Ximen Family]

681
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:56,770
Who are you?

682
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,170
Where are my demons from Qianji City?

683
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,340
You lost demons,

684
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,560
but you came to the Ximen family.

685
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,320
That's too arrogant.

686
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,360
This is the territory
of the Yiqi Alliance.

687
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,890
Demons are not allowed in.

688
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,320
Leave now.

689
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,030
Where is Scum Ximen?

690
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:18,720
Let him out to see me.

691
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:19,760
Shut up!

692
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,080
Do you think a demon like you

693
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,290
is worthy of meeting the Master
of the Ximen family?

694
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:26,950
Since you don't want to leave,

695
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,730
don't blame us for being rude.

696
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:29,550
Go!

697
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,710
Brothers,

698
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,210
take her together!

699
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:24,030
I was wondering who dared
to commit murder in my Ximen family.

700
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,440
Turns out it's you, you lowly spider.

701
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,070
Master Ximen.

702
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,110
How dare you consume
demon power so recklessly?

703
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,640
These demons are innocent!

704
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,440
You want to save them?

705
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,230
They're all locked up in the dungeon,

706
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,760
almost dead.

707
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:58,150
Why don't you come with me to the dungeon

708
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,110
to let you experience

709
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,670
the pain of demon power being drained?

710
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,360
Today,

711
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,280
the revenge of Qianji City
and Young Master Fugui,

712
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,920
the old score and the new grievance,

713
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,380
will be settled together!

714
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,860
No wonder Wangquan Fugui
values you so much.

715
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,800
You have such powerful demon power.

716
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,000
If I don't drain it,

717
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:25,400
it will be a waste.

718
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,450
You're despicable.

719
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,030
You don't deserve to mention

720
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,290
Young Master Fugui's name in front of me.

721
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,500
Young Master Fugui

722
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,710
has spared no effort

723
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,930
to protect you despicable people.

724
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:53,440
Did you force him
to give up his sword meridian

725
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,670
at Wangquan Manor
because of morality and justice?

726
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,400
Because you are afraid of him.

727
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,480
You are selfish,

728
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:05,840
cowardly,

729
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,280
and greedy.

730
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,030
You don't deserve to be human!

731
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,110
I'll spare your life

732
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,970
for Chief Wangquan's sake.

733
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:28,710
Release all the demons

734
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,630
before sunset.

735
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,480
Not one less.

736
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,760
Little Spider, you miscalculated.

737
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,320
Looks like Qingtong

738
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,030
still cares about the overall situation.

739
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,590
She didn't kill the scum
of the Ximen family.

740
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,510
I don't think you can stir up

741
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,500
trouble in the Yiqi Alliance.

742
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,400
Not necessarily.

743
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,550
Qingtong.

744
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,030
As long as the whole world believes

745
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:56,670
that you killed them,

746
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,320
by then,

747
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,710
Qianji City will be your sole destination.
