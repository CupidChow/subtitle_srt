[Sword and Beloved]

2
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:50,430
[Episode 17]

3
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:56,560
I, Fei Tianqing,

4
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:00,350
the fifth-generation steward
of the Wangquan Manor,

5
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,680
am not competent enough

6
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,790
and can only walk you so far, Master.

7
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,360
I didn't fail
the Wangquan family after all.

8
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:27,960
Rumu,

9
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,590
she's the one you kept telling me about—

10
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,400
Long Weiyun.

11
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,870
Young Master Fugui,

12
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,620
your spiritual power…

13
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,000
is running low.

14
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,430
It took me so much effort

15
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,630
to get this body you care so much about.

16
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,560
How could I possibly give up?

17
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,120
You once said

18
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,190
you would never bow to threats, right?

19
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,360
Well then,

20
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,079
what if I use this body

21
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,840
to kill your woman

22
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,430
and your cousin?

23
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,300
Would there still be

24
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,680
no hatred in your heart?

25
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,540
Rumu!

26
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,810
Young Master Rumu!

27
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,350
Since your cousin

28
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,380
can't feel the hatred in his heart,

29
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,520
then…

30
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,170
you'll die first!

31
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,520
Weiyun,

32
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,020
if this were in the past,

33
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,090
I wouldn't have minded if you killed me.

34
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,520
But not this time.

35
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:37,560
Fugui.

36
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,040
Rumu,

37
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,520
I've only trapped her temporarily.

38
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:43,550
To purge the Black Fox's demonic aura
from her body,

39
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,880
she has to do it herself.

40
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:55,900
Let me try.

41
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,630
I'll use my spider silk
to enter her consciousness

42
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,830
and try to wake her up.

43
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,390
Be careful.

44
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:02,920
Okay.

45
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,920
Don't worry.

46
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,480
Long Weiyun.

47
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,190
Long Weiyun.

48
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:45,890
Long Weiyun.

49
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,590
I don't want to owe you.

50
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,310
I don't want to owe you.

51
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,430
I don't want to owe you.

52
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,750
I don't want to owe you.

53
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,430
I don't want to owe you.

54
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,720
Long Weiyun.

55
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,600
I don't want to owe you.

56
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,360
Long Weiyun.

57
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,390
Long Weiyun…

58
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,710
I don't want to owe you.

59
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,480
Oh no.

60
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,480
In her consciousness,

61
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,310
I can't touch her.

62
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,510
Quan Rumu,

63
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,870
I've searched
the Human and Demon Realms both

64
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,730
and still found no way to save you.

65
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,600
Why?

66
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,750
I don't want to owe you.

67
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,210
Long Weiyun,

68
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,090
Young Master Rumu isn't dead.

69
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,310
He's right outside.

70
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,480
If you come out with me,

71
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,630
you'll see him.

72
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,159
Long Weiyun.

73
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,210
Long Weiyun.

74
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,080
Qingtong,

75
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,600
time is running out.

76
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,730
Wake her up quickly.

77
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,870
"Having basked in morning dew,

78
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,360
Rumu could die at dusk without regret."

79
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,000
Rumu?

80
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,750
Young Master Fugui.

81
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,240
Yes?

82
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,430
What does this mean?

83
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,250
Why is Young Master Rumu's

84
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,950
name on it?

85
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,310
"Having basked in morning dew,
one could die at dusk without regret."

86
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,110
It's like these little flowers—

87
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,240
once the most beautiful rain
has touched their petals,

88
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,440
it no longer matters how long they live.

89
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,140
Young Master Rumu wrote this?

90
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,430
So,

91
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,750
this line is

92
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,800
about his story?

93
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,750
Quan Rumu...

94
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,120
I don't want to owe you.

95
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,950
I don't want to owe you.

96
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,000
"Having basked in morning dew,

97
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,110
Rumu could die at dusk without regret."

98
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,390
"Having basked in morning dew,

99
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,510
Rumu could die at dusk without regret."

100
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,750
"Having basked in morning dew,

101
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,510
Rumu could die at dusk without regret."

102
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,360
"Having basked in morning dew…"

103
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,310
"Having basked…"

104
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,000
"Having basked in morning dew…"

105
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,680
"Rumu can die…

106
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,789
at dusk without regret."

107
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:35,640
Long Weiyun.

108
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,850
Long Weiyun.

109
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,080
Who are you?

110
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,600
What does this poem mean?

111
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,120
"Having basked in morning dew,

112
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,960
one could die at dusk without regret."

113
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,690
Long Weiyun,

114
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,770
Young Master Rumu was never dead.

115
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,790
What's more,

116
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,120
he never once hated you.

117
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,390
Morning dew…

118
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,150
Rumu…

119
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,870
He actually never hated me?

120
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,670
How could there be such a fool
in this world?

121
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,750
Long Weiyun.

122
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:32,970
Your love and hate

123
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,800
shouldn't be controlled by someone else.

124
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,200
I am Long Weiyun, a True Dragon.

125
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:03,840
How could I let

126
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,590
an evil creature like you
decide who I hate or love?

127
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,390
Black Fox,

128
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,720
you're not

129
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,470
escaping today.

130
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,250
This is impossible.

131
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,150
I'm a clone of Madam,
born from pure hatred.

132
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,120
I have no physical form.

133
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,920
How could you possibly catch me?

134
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,910
Are you her only clone

135
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,320
in the circle?

136
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:15,030
Why would I tell you Madam's secret?

137
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,600
I know what you're thinking.

138
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,150
You want to save

139
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:22,010
that cold and heartless father of yours,
don't you?

140
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,000
How laughable.

141
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,840
The world has failed you,

142
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,870
and you still want to turn back?

143
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,030
You're such a fool.

144
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,480
Wangquan Fugui, listen well.

145
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,960
Those who love are destined
to be let down.

146
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,270
Only hatred

147
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,510
is eternal.

148
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,750
Wangquan Fugui,

149
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:02,150
you can't escape from Madam.

150
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:32,960
Well,

151
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,480
look.

152
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,030
It's almost dawn.

153
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,200
Lately,

154
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,070
every time I fall asleep,

155
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,630
I'm afraid

156
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,410
I won't see the sun rise again.

157
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,300
Weiyun,

158
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,960
you'll watch the sunrise

159
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,150
with me, won't you?

160
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,390
You always told me

161
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,170
to keep moving forward.

162
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,890
Since that's the case,

163
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,270
tell me—

164
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,670
how did

165
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,180
the Black Fox take over your body?

166
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,030
And why

167
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,620
did you come to Luming Valley?

168
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,380
Does it really matter?

169
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,960
It does.

170
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,480
I wanted to bring you back to life.

171
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,810
I didn't want to owe you.

172
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,930
I've traveled all over
the Human and Demon Realms,

173
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,260
but every healer I saw said
the same thing—

174
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,690
you were beyond saving.

175
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,240
They say,

176
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,000
don't force what fate has not allowed.

177
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,360
My asthma—

178
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,790
if not for you,

179
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,750
I wouldn't have lasted long anyway.

180
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,630
Quan Rumu,

181
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,220
remember this:

182
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,630
you can die from asthma

183
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,050
but not from trying to save me.

184
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,030
Later,

185
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,740
that evil creature came to me.

186
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,630
It said there was a way to save you.

187
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,330
Since you and Wangquan Fugui are related,

188
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,480
if I took his sword meridian

189
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,700
and used it
to reconnect your broken meridians,

190
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,840
you could live.

191
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,150
And you believed such a lie?

192
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,320
Everyone in the dragon clan
is trained in medicine.

193
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,790
The moment it said it,

194
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,240
I knew it was true.

195
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,600
It's just I'd never thought of it before.

196
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,360
You know me.

197
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,080
You know

198
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,670
I'd never accept that.

199
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,270
Of course I know.

200
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,120
But deep down, a voice told me

201
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,720
that maybe

202
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,320
I could kill that person

203
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,780
and force you to accept it.

204
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,080
Maybe...

205
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,460
I could finally repay everything
I owe you.

206
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,440
And from then on,

207
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,600
we'd be even.

208
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,000
That's how...

209
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,340
that evil thing took over my body.

210
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,630
Weiyun,

211
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:22,720
as you know,

212
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:23,630
I…

213
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,820
I know what you want to say.

214
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,750
You never once resented me.

215
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,490
Everything you did for me...

216
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,240
you did willingly.

217
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,360
But Quan Rumu,

218
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,030
by now you should know

219
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:42,910
what your deranged father

220
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,390
did to my mother.

221
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,600
The depth of my hatred for him

222
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,230
is matched only by the pain

223
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,120
your kindness causes me.

224
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,960
Some rifts in this world

225
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,030
just can't be bridged.

226
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,030
So, Rumu,

227
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,440
let me go

228
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,600
and move on.

229
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,120
I owe Wangquan Fugui a debt.

230
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,390
My dragon scale is proof.

231
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,790
He may ask one favor of me.

232
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,310
No matter what it is,

233
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,600
I will see it done.

234
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,330
Young Master Fugui,

235
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:39,910
do you think

236
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,000
the knot between them

237
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,160
could be untied if Quan Jingting

238
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,440
were dead?

239
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,500
There's another way to resolve this.

240
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,350
But the time isn't right yet.

241
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,320
Fugui.

242
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:00,000
I'll help you send the Black Fox back.

243
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You must never return

244
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,260
to the Wangquan Manor.

245
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,480
What suppresses and binds the Black Fox

246
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,339
is the power of my Dongfang Blood.

247
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,619
Once it leaves my control,

248
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,200
you won't be able to suppress it.

249
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,270
Fine.

250
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,109
Then send the Black Fox

251
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,510
near the Wangquan Manor.

252
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:17,829
Leave the rest

253
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,680
to me.

254
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,720
Young Master.

255
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,109
Young Master.

256
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,460
-Mr. Fei?
-I finally found you.

257
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,050
Mr. Fei?

258
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,569
What's wrong?

259
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,480
Young Master,

260
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,480
there are a few words
I must say to you alone.

261
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,550
Young Master,

262
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,720
I finally saw you again.

263
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,590
Mr. Fei,

264
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,790
what happened to you?

265
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,510
Mr. Fei!

266
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,750
Master...

267
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,030
Mr. Fei,

268
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,000
don't talk yet.

269
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,640
I already know.

270
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,680
Young Master,

271
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,560
the sword...

272
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,880
take it.

273
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,110
Young Master,

274
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,270
I

275
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,720
won't make it.

276
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,070
Mr. Fei,

277
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,110
that's nonsense.

278
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,310
Hang in there.

279
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,590
Young Master,

280
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,070
don't blame Master.

281
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:09,270
He has his own burdens to bear.

282
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,070
I understand.

283
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,350
Good.

284
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,400
Don't be too hard on yourself.

285
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,000
Even with countless burdens,

286
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,750
Madam,

287
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,030
Master,

288
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,640
and I

289
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,550
all just want you…

290
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,720
to find happiness in the end.

291
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,720
I've always known—

292
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,880
you care for me the most.

293
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,750
The spring flowers
on the hills are so fragrant.

294
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,200
The sorbet in summer is sweet.

295
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,070
Autumn fruits are all over the mountain.

296
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,830
And in winter,
nothing beats a pot of warm wine.

297
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,680
All these things...

298
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,830
Young Master,

299
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,830
you must

300
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,960
try them all.

301
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,270
Young Master Fugui,

302
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,640
y-you were so well-fed

303
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,350
when you were little.

304
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,480
Why have you

305
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,270
become so thin?

306
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,480
Mr. Fei,

307
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,720
since I was little,

308
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,720
you've always cared for me the most.

309
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,200
In this life, I have no way to repay you.

310
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,700
So in the next life…

311
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,110
let me serve you well.

312
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:03,830
Fugui,

313
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,720
we're close to the manor now.

314
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,900
Give that evil thing to me.

315
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,560
I can keep it under control.

316
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,650
Will you come back?

317
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,280
Of course I will.

318
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,280
I will come back.

319
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:35,790
No, you won't.

320
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,200
You just want to go back
and die with Quan Jingting.

321
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,950
That way, Long Weiyun could move on,

322
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,550
and you'd pay for Quan Jingting's sins

323
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,680
with your own life.

324
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,680
Am I right?

325
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,110
But Rumu,

326
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,270
you're his son,

327
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,990
and you're also my dear cousin.

328
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,560
None of this is your fault.

329
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,270
Fugui,

330
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:04,680
you…

331
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,070
He's noisy.

332
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,280
I've sealed his acupoints.

333
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,420
Keep a close eye on him.

334
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,440
Young Master Fugui,

335
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,590
I know I can't go with you.

336
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,590
But you're going there alone…

337
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,350
Don't worry.

338
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:29,200
I've already contacted
the Li Family of Peach Garden.

339
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,160
They've rallied
several prestigious families.

340
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,510
They'll be here soon.

341
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:35,850
Qingtong,

342
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,240
after I leave,

343
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,370
take Rumu to the Cold Pool first

344
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,500
and then return here

345
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,880
to meet up with me.

346
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,920
Young Master Fugui,

347
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,350
promise me

348
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,170
you'll be careful on your own.

349
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,330
I will be here

350
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,340
waiting for you to return.

351
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,480
Don't worry.

352
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:18,350
[Wangquan Manor]

353
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,110
All of you—

354
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,510
your spiritual power has been sealed,

355
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,970
your swords confiscated,

356
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,130
and you haven't

357
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,330
eaten for five days.

358
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,440
What?

359
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,330
Still not giving in?

360
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:44,680
Fine.

361
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,400
Let's see

362
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,750
how long you can hold out.

363
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,010
Let's go.

364
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,000
Senior Fugui.

365
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,640
Senior Fugui.

366
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,440
Senior Fugui.

367
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,830
Where is Master?

368
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,110
In the Sword Tomb.

369
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,130
And Quan Jingting?

370
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,400
He left.

371
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,650
It seems he went after someone.

372
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,420
He still hasn't come back.

373
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,170
He must've gone after Mr. Fei.

374
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,130
Didn't Mr. Fei get locked up
in the Sword Tomb too?

375
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,790
He escaped?

376
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,550
He gave you your sword?

377
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,510
Junior Feng,

378
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,460
you stay here with all the disciples.

379
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,480
Li Muhai should be here soon.

380
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,070
Yes.

381
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,680
Be careful.

382
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,590

00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,600
what's the meaning of this?

398
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,960
I left to suppress demons,

399
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,540
and you used the chance
to summon back your traitor son.

going to let the Soldier,

in front of all of us, the Soldier

00:38:59,030 --> 00:38:59,550
Master.

570
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,960
I have something to tell you.

571
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,570
I'm Wangquan Fugui.

572
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,150
Greetings, Master.

573
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:27,960
Fugui,

574
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:29,480
ignore them.

575
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,480
Let's go.

576
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,670
Father, I'm bidding you farewell.

577
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,730
But before I leave,

578
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,800
I have to finish one thing.

579
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,960
The Wangquan family

580
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,680
must not fail the people of this world.

581
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,280
Today,

582
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:19,800
I'll remove the Soldier's sword meridian

583
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,760
to prevent future troubles!

584
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,890
I've made up my mind.

585
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,400
Do it now.
