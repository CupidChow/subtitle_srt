I don't know which one you prefer.

378
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:13,350
I personally prefer this one.

379
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,480
Alright.

380
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,160
I won't make things difficult for you.

381
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,640
This Jinlan Mask

382
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,960
was made personally by Huaizhu.

383
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,690
To have a true confidant in life

384
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,940
is like finding a sworn sibling,
also called "Jinlan".

385
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,750
Try it on.

386
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,960
So of course I prefer this one.

387
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,960
I know

388
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,080
you've been mocking my taste

389
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,000
for a long time.

390
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,510
Do you remember?

391
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,110
On your birthday,

392
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,200
you put on this mask

393
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:15,960
and asked me

394
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,920
about the story behind it,

395
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,590
and yet I

396
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,400
almost strangled you to death.

397
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,400
I want to know why!

398
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,030
Why did you do that?

399
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,480
That Hongye under the mask

400
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,540
is already dead!

401
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,590
He died beyond the circle,

402
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,910
under that black Grief Tree!

403
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,960
Your closest friends and loved ones

404
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,820
dying one by one before your eyes—

405
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,930
do you know what that sight is like?

406
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:53,010
That Hongye underneath the Jinlan Mask

407
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,930
lost because of his emotions.

408
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,590
He'll never forgive himself!

409
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,310
I won't allow you to follow in
his footsteps!

410
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,350
At that time,

411
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,070
you must have thought

412
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,960
that I hated you, right?

413
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,020
So

414
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,680
what did you think

415
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,880
I hated you for?

416
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,590
I thought

417
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,790
it was because Mother died because of me

418
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,240
that you hated me, Father.

419
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,550
I don't hate you at all.

420
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,070
When you put on that mask that day,

421
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,310
what I saw

422
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,510
was myself.

423
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,160
The one I wanted to strangle to death

424
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,110
was myself.

425
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,310
Because

426
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:18,590
I've never been able to forgive myself.

427
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,400
Why was it that the Mask Group
was nearly wiped out,

428
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,130
Quzhuo returned half-alive,

429
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,170
and yet only I came back unscathed?

430
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:29,110
Why did the crisis of the Yiqi Alliance

431
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:32,070
have to be resolved
at the cost of Huaizhu's life?

432
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,720
Why did the things we,
the older generation,

433
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,030
failed to accomplish

434
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,290
have to be achieved by sacrificing you

435
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,720
and putting you through so much pain?

436
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,310
That's why I hate.

437
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,240
I hate myself.

438
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,400
Back then,

439
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:06,240
everyone in our Mask Group

440
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:10,270
had made thorough preparations

441
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,410
before trying to break out of the circle.

442
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,960
But in the end,

443
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,960
we still lost.

444
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,730
The Black Fox is a master of
manipulating hearts.

445
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,920
Kinship, friendship, love—

446
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,750
she turns them all

447
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,080
into her blades.

448
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,310
In the end,

449
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,010
they all met their ruin beyond the circle.

450
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,480
At that time, I thought

451
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,900
it was love and attachment

452
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,930
that brought about our defeat.

453
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,160
Father, all this time,

454
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:04,040
you've made me keep my heart and body
in utter simplicity...

455
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,940
Because you feared
I'd be undone by emotions,

456
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,400
the same way you once were.

457
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,110
Fugui.

458
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,969
All I hoped for

459
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:26,320
was that you would return alive

460
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,620
after fighting the Black Fox
beyond the circle.

461
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,110
I naively thought

462
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,630
that as long as you could come back alive,

463
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,880
I could slowly make up for

464
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,230
everything I owed you.

465
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,070
But reality

466
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,030
proved me wrong.

467
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,630
Who in the world could return

468
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:06,890
those 20-some years
you spent in loneliness to you?

469
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,840
Why must you bear the burden of

470
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,550
my devotion to the Way, to duty,

471
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,800
and to all living beings?

472
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,360
I was wrong.

473
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,920
So very, utterly wrong.

474
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,000
Father...

475
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,190
Is this...

476
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,600
the Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai?

477
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,070
Young Master Fugui

478
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,280
has always wanted to visit
the Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai.

479
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,190
I wonder

480
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,000
if what I've woven looks anything like it.

481
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,320
It does.

482
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,280
It looks a lot like it.

483
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:20,920
Father!

484
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,760
Uncle Hongye!

485
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,550
Father.

486
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:24,710
It's...

487
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:25,910
It's nothing.

488
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,150
I'm fine.

489
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:31,920
Fugui.

490
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,110
Come with me

491
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,060
to the Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai,

492
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,590
will you?

493
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,710
Okay.
