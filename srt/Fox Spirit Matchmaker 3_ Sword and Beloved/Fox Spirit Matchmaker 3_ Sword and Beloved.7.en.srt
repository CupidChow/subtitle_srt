[Sword and Beloved]

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,460
[Episode 7]

3
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,770
Young Master Fugui,

4
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,980
please rest early.

5
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:03,560
Okay.

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,170
[Silk Cave]

7
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,240
This is the only way

8
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,960
to save Young Master Fugui.

9
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,400
It's weird.

10
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,960
Why did I fall asleep here?

11
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,630
Why am I so sleepy today?

12
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,590
You really poisoned him?

13
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,630
Yes.

14
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,800
I've used the Seven Bitterness you gave me

15
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,590
on Wangquan Fugui.

16
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,360
The Soldier treats you so well,
yet you poisoned him.

17
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,590
You must

18
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,430
really hate me, right?

19
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,240
I don't.

20
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,040
He's a Soldier, and I'm a demon.

21
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,710
This is my home.

22
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,190
You didn't lie to me?

23
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,470
Your intel network is everywhere.

24
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,079
I dare not lie to you.

25
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,530
At least you're still clear-headed.

26
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,000
I'll trust you this time.

27
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,170
Well, Mistress,

28
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,690
what about my brother?

29
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,150
Can you release him now?

30
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,280
His leg has been reattached.

31
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,190
He's

32
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,240
perfectly safe now.

33
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,600
Thank you, Mistress.

34
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:12,750
Mistress,

35
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,310
I have another request.

36
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,160
Go ahead.

37
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,130
I was poisoned by that same toxin.

38
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,920
Please

39
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,590
give me the antidote.

40
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,630
What do you mean?

41
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,030
How did you get poisoned?

42
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,690
That Soldier is extremely vigilant.

43
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,870
So every time I poisoned him,

44
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,930
I had to try his food first.

45
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,390
You're indeed poisoned.

46
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,360
He actually made you test it?

47
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,750
Humans are all hypocrites.

48
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,720
Thank you, Mistress!

49
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,650
What's the rush?

50
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,600
I'll give you the antidote
after I get confirmation

51
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,600
that the Soldier is truly poisoned.

52
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,830
Thank you, Mistress.

53
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,160
I searched the entire Wangquan Manor
and found no trace of Qingtong.

54
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,490
And since this morning,

55
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,430
my qi and blood have been surging,

56
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,360
and my inner power has been draining—

57
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,600
almost depleted.

58
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,040
Where is the little spider?

59
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,800
Come out!

60
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,800
Senior Fugui,

61
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,480
do you know that little spider

62
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,140
was a spy sent by the Silk Cave?

63
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,890
How could your inner power
be draining like this?

64
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,830
Someone poisoned you?

65
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,540
Ordinary poison doesn't work on you.

66
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,000
This is Gu poison.

67
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,190
Who could be so cruel?

68
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,040
It was that little spider, right?

69
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,830
Where is she?

70
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,000
Little spider, come out!

71
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,800
Stop yelling.

72
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,930
Qingtong has left.

73
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,560
Qingtong?

74
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,070
You even gave her a name?

75
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,720
Senior Fugui,

76
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,560
You and she...

77
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,310
I told you.

78
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,310
She has left.

79
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,240
I thought you were in the dark,

80
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,010
but it turns out you knew everything.

81
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,510
I'll have to tell Master.

82
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,430
No.

83
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,520
I'll deal with the poison

84
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,630
in my body.

85
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,250
Then why didn't you let me tell Master?

86
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,380
She harmed you so much,

87
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,250
and you still want to protect her?

88
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,930
This is my business.

89
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,210
I'll take care of it myself.

90
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,120
You bastard.

91
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,630
Today is your death anniversary.

92
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,270
Back then,

93
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,950
you built the Silk Cave

94
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,260
to create the top intelligence network
in the Demon Realm.

95
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,600
So I followed your dying instructions

96
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,710
and have always protected the Silk Cave

97
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,070
you left behind well.

98
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,680
Back then,

99
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,159
you forcibly recruited people

100
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,490
to build this Silk Cave for my sake.

101
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,510
Wangquan Hongye

102
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,310
came to Mount Baiwu with his men

103
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,320
to hold you accountable.

104
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,750
It was the human race who started it,

105
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,750
yet they forced you
to destroy your own inner core

106
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,310
to stop the war.

107
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,950
But they promised

108
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,220
to only destroy your cultivation

109
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,770
and spare your body
so you could rebuild your cultivation.

110
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,930
And they sealed you

111
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,600
inside this golden crown.

112
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,690
Who would have known

113
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,000
that very night,

114
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,430
you would meet your end?

115
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,120
Good and evil always
come with consequences. I accept that.

116
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,200
I accept that!

117
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,440
But
they shouldn't have deceived me like that—

118
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,150
giving me hope

119
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,440
and then crushing it completely.

120
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,200
The Wangquan family

121
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,630
must

122
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,720
pay the price!

123
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,080
I want you—

124
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,120
Wangquan Hongye—

125
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,120
taste the pain

126
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,030
of losing your loved ones.

127
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,420
Master,

128
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,800
it's time to eat.

129
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,670
I've fallen to such a state,

130
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,600
yet you still serve me as you used to.

131
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,550
Sit.

132
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,250
Have a drink with me.

133
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,600
Lu,

134
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,790
when did you start working for me?

135
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,650
It was after you

136
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,350
went to the Western Regions,

137
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,480
at the screen wall of your residence.

138
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,270
Screen wall?

139
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,240
That half‑collapsed wall

140
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,540
buried in weeds?
You call that a screen wall?

141
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,510
I remember it clearly.

142
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,320
When I first arrived,

143
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,890
the whole residence was desolate.

144
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,720
There was only one bed

145
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,780
with 4 intact legs.

146
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,510
All the servants

147
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,370
were old, weak, ill, or disabled.

148
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,750
None of the disciples

149
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,360
listened to me.

150
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,790
Most of them were disciples

151
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,050
the Yiqi Alliance sent

152
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,480
to the Western Regions,

153
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,350
and all they wanted back then

154
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,710
was to embarrass you.

155
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,390
Do you know

156
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,240
why I chose you to be my attendant?

157
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,510
You're just a servant's son.

158
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,030
Yes.

159
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,320
You once said

160
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,440
I had the same

161
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,710
ambitious look in my eyes as you.

162
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,960
Yes.

163
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,390
Ambitious.

164
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,480
I was born in troubled times.

165
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,730
I want to be the one holding the knife,

166
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,170
not the meat on the chopping block.

167
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,980
Even back in the Western Regions,

168
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,030
I thought the same.

169
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,870
Without the Wangquan family name,

170
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,480
I still have my sword.

171
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,480
I can always fight my way out!

172
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,080
When the disciples didn't listen,

173
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,790
I killed some to warn others.

174
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,150
Demons ran rampant
across the Western Regions.

175
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,080
That was my chance to prove myself.

176
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,760
I was tougher than anyone else,

177
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,550
and I refused to lose.

178
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,960
But the result...

179
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,080
What was the result?

180
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,910
They set you up

181
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,390
and lured you
into the dragon demon's trap.

182
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,550
You almost died;

183
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,480
I was the one who carried you back.

184
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,320
I almost died...

185
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,550
In the ruined house
of the master of the Quan family,

186
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,550
they...

187
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,790
were all waiting for me to die.

188
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,840
He won't be able to make it this time.

189
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,200
This lunatic

190
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,600
who doesn't even care about his own child.

191
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,000
Heaven is punishing him.

192
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,600
Get lost!

193
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:45,870
Let's go.

194
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,550
I can't die.

195
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,390
I, Wangquan Jingting,

196
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,150
will not die...

197
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:10,080
in this godforsaken place.

198
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,230
Someone as vicious as you

199
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,840
would even frighten

200
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,360
the King of Hell.

201
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,020
Who are you?

202
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,910
Who the hell are you?

203
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,790
Come out!

204
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,720
I'll kill you!

205
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,420
[Taisui, a little black fox]

206
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,670
Wangquan Jingting,

207
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,080
your talent is mediocre.

208
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,200
How can you compare to Wangquan Hongye?

209
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,030
Talent?

210
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,600
Is talent everything?

211
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,120
I have something they don't!

212
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:07,080
What is that?

213
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,480
The willingness to sacrifice.

214
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,200
To become the strongest,

215
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,670
you'd give up everything—

216
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,630
conscience, love, family, right?

217
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,630
Am I right?

218
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,240
You hate him, don't you?

219
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,390
How about I take revenge for you?

220
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,120
Are you willing to give up everything

221
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,960
to follow our Madam?

222
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,510
The Black Fox Madam?

223
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,390
You do have some knowledge and courage.

224
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,120
The Madam said

225
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,720
you won't die,

226
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,930
and that she'll even give you
a great gift.

227
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,390
Wha-what gift?

228
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,550
Do you know the greatest secret

229
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,750
in the Western Regions?

230
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,790
The True Dragon Power.

231
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,030
That day,

232
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,720
she not only gave me power,

233
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,670
but also told me that

234
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,440
to obtain the True Dragon Power,

235
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,750
I must acquire a dragon scale,

236
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,550
a dragon spine, and a dragon core

237
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,600
that possess it.

238
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,390
So that's why

239
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,960
you were fighting the dragon clan
in the Western Regions?

240
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,270
What did you get?

241
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,480
The dragon clan has long declined.

242
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,720
Those with True Dragon Power

243
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,670
are extremely rare.

244
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,670
After years of searching,

245
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,840
I only obtained

246
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,580
a reverse dragon scale

247
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:53,150
and fused it into my arm.

248
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,840
Congratulations

249
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,370
on achieving it in one step.

250
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,720
I thought

251
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,720
I was sure to win.

252
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,990
But for the other two things,

253
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,140
I searched desperately for years

254
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,700
and finally got a piece of intelligence.

255
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,670
It says

256
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,910
the Wangquan family ancestors

257
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,960
had actually slain a true dragon

258
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,060
and forged a sword with its spine.

259
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:25,000
But the sword's murderous energy
was too strong,

260
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,030
so they sealed it

261
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,080
in the Sword Tomb.

262
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,080
That's why

263
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,510
you returned to the Wangquan family

264
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:40,080
under the pretext
of the Blue Sky Conference?

265
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,820
I was fully prepared.

266
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,030
If I won,

267
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,560
I would take the Sword Tomb;

268
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,320
if I lost,

269
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,000
I would guard it.

270
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,330
I was sure to win.

271
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,990
But that Soldier

272
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,380
actually destroyed my cultivation.

273
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:06,680
Wangquan Hongye,

274
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,000
Wangquan Fugui,

275
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:10,680
you both

276
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,829
must die!

277
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,680
This is Gu poison.

278
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,750
Who could be so cruel?

279
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,720
There are hundreds of spiders
in the Silk Cave.

280
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,720
We're all as worthless as weeds.

281
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,180
If I go back empty-handed,

282
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,470
I'll definitely die.

283
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,730
Do you really think

284
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,720
the Spiritual Stone's prophecy
won't come true?

285
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,270
I forgot to give you
a birthday gift yesterday.

286
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,400
This chrysanthemum

287
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,130
is for you, Young Master Fugui.

288
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,400
Wangquan Manor
and that Palanquin...

289
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,440
are your entire world.

290
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,900
Also, nobody knows

291
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,240
what you really want, Young Master Fugui.

292
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,920
You long to see the scenery outside

293
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,720
and to get out of that Palanquin.

294
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,850
I want to stay to repay your kindness.

295
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,350
I'll be your little spider

296
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,480
in life and in death.

297
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,130
Soft-heartedness!

298
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,070
Attachments!

299
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,480
Unwillingness!

300
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,990
Those are all emotions

301
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,920
that a Soldier shouldn't have.

302
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,960
The weakness deep within your heart

303
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,620
is the reason why you can't unleash
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike!

304
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,350
This Seven Bitterness poison
really is vicious.

305
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,550
It seems I can't remove it

306
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,590
by myself.

307
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,800
Only when one's heart is free of dust

308
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,000
can they see clearly.

309
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,920
Young Master Fugui,

310
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,830
though I'm a tiny low-grade spider demon,

311
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:58,510
I still

312
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,590
care about certain things

313
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,360
and certain people.

314
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,400
Can you help me save my brother?

315
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,680
I'm begging you.

316
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,630
Please, Young Master Fugui.

317
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,550
Truth can't be faked.

318
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,750
Qingtong must have been threatened
by Madam Yin

319
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,920
to poison me.

320
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You did a good job.

321
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,830
The Soldier is truly poisoned.

322
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,760
It was your brilliant planning.

323
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,920
Your eyes are red.

324
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,710
Do you feel sorry for him?

325
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:34,830
Mistress,

326
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,350
I don't.

327
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,350
There's nothing wrong

328
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,080
with loyalty and devotion.

329
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,040
But you gave your heart
to the wrong person.

330
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,880
The Soldier is a bloodthirsty sword.

331
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,750
If you fall for him,

332
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,160
you'll surely die.

333
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,750
Since I, No.12580,

334
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,730
have completed my task,

335
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,700
can you give me the antidote
you promised me?

336
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,790
This is the only antidote

337
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,560
for the Seven Bitterness

338
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,960
in the entire world.

339
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,800
Remember to use your demon power
to absorb it as soon as possible.

340
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,470
Thank you, Mistress.

341
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,240
I will never forget

342
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,350
your great kindness.

343
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,610
What about my brother?

344
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,480
Since I said I'd spare him,

345
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,790
I will.

346
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,160
As for when

347
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,720
and how—

348
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,030
that's up to me.

349
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,350
If you're willing

350
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,580
to send my brother away,

351
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,830
I'm willing to stay

352
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,550
and serve you for life.

353
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,300
You are so capable.

354
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,250
Even the Soldier was manipulated by you.

355
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,350
How do I know you are sincere with me?

356
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,570
I, No.12580,

357
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,640
vow to serve you faithfully for life,
Mistress.

358
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,310
Good!

359
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,960
Then stay here in the Silk Cave

360
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,630
and keep me company forever.

361
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,000
Take her to see No.12581.

362
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,550
Soldier,

363
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,310
your death is near.

364
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,200
Let's go to Mount Baiwu.

365
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,850
Young Master,
we weren't informed of this mission.

366
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:43,480
Young Master,
should we report to the Master first?

367
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,480
Let's go to Mount Baiwu.

368
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:48,490
Yes.

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,790

00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:50,400
♪ We never ask if fate is fair ♪

381
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,270
I...

382
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,810
can't just stand by and watch her die.

383
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:16,960
Sister.

384
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,880
Sister, you're finally awake.

385
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,880
You've been in a coma for a long time.

386
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,720
No.12581?

387
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,720
It's great to see you!

388
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,440
Turn around.

389
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,840
Let me take a look at you.

390
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,430
I'm fine, Sister.

391
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,880
Don't worry about me.

392
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,110
No.12581,

393
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,160
it must hurt, right?

394
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,880
I'm really fine.

395
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,480
You must be in pain too.

396
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,830
I'm fine.

397
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,720
As long as Qingcheng is fine.

398
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,400
What does

399
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,640
Qingcheng mean?

400
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,030
Remember,

401
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,030
from now on, this is your name.

402
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,160
In the world outside the cave,

403
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,480
everyone has a name.

404
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,520
I have one too.

405
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,270
My name is Qingtong.

406
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,240
A very good person

407
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,880
give me this name.

408
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:12,960
Okay.

409
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,830
I see.

410
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,110
Oh, right.

411
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,560
They said you were poisoned.

412
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,310
Mistress has given you the antidote.

413
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,590
Have you taken it?

414
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,920
No hurry.

415
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,510
Qingcheng.

416
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:25,960
Yes?

417
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,240
Are you ready

418
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,200
to leave here with me?

419
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,640
Leave here?

420
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,960
How?

421
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,310
I can take human form.

422
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,270
A human used a winged spirit pearl
to convert

423
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,920
his spiritual power into demon power
and gave it to me.

424
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,110
Now I'll give you

425
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,030
half of it.

426
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,510
Mistress,

427
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,240
we just discovered that No.12580

428
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,700
ran away with her brother.

429
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,550
What?

430
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,000
Ran away?

431
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,240
No.12580, you bitch!

432
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,970
There's one more thing.

433
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,640
The Soldier is on his way to Mount Baiwu.

434
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,270
Where are they heading?

435
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,550
It seems they're coming

436
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,070
toward our Silk Cave.

437
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,550
The Soldier came suddenly this time,

438
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,130
but he's already deeply poisoned

439
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,480
and no longer a threat.

440
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:28,920
Mistress,

441
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,530
shall we send people to hunt down No.12580

442
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,680
and No.12580?

443
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,410
Compared
with my blood feud against the Soldier,

444
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,960
they are nothing.

445
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,550
Forget her.

446
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,680
Round up everyone in Silk Cave
who can fight

447
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,880
and have them come with me

448
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,010
to kill the Soldier.

449
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,590
Yes.

450
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,360
Up ahead is Mount Baiwu.

451
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,210
Soldier, why did you come here?

452
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,270
Step back.

453
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:04,790
Well...

454
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,640
Yes.

455
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,550
Yes.

456
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,000
Come out!

457
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,350
You truly are a Soldier.

458
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,830
You are poisoned and still so arrogant.

459
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,680
Where is No.12580?

460
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,410
I have something to ask her.

461
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,510
As expected, whether human or demon,

462
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,680
no one can escape love.

463
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,530
Why are you looking for her?

464
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,070
That ungrateful bitch

465
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,750
has run off with her brother.

466
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,440
Are you saying

467
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,790
she and her brother have escaped?

468
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,880
Yes.

469
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,000
Soldiers,

470
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,380
does it hurt in your heart?

471
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,830
How does betrayal feel?

472
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,240
This little pain,

473
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:17,120
compared to my pain for losing my husband,

474
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:20,030
is nothing!

475
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,030
Today,

476
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,030
I will avenge my deceased husband.

477
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,790
Go!

478
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,160
Kill him.

479
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,510
Why?

480
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,550
You're poisoned.

481
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,760
Why can you still use your sword?

482
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,680
I am poisoned,

483
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:03,070
but I'm still more than capable
of dealing with you.

484
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,550
Anyone who doesn't want to die,

485
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,480
stand up!

486
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,030
Kill him!

487
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,590
What should we do?

488
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,000
He's a Soldier.

489
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,910
No one survives Wangquan Sword.

490
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,640
We'll die if we go.

491
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,040
We'll die too if we don't.

492
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,560
You're asking for death!

493
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,510
Soldier, save us!

494
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,830
Please!

495
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,270
Save us!

496
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,110
We were forced.

497
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,830
We don't want to die!

498
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,660
This seal has been lifted.

499
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,220
Whether you stay or go,

500
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,750
it's up to you.

501
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,070
Let's go!

502
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:02,960
This is...

503
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,340
the spiritual power
of the Dongfang family?

504
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,510
Now it's just you.

505
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,350
Don't bother the little spider anymore,

506
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,000
or...

507
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,930
you'll face the consequences.

508
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,880
Soldier,

509
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,150
this time I underestimated you.

510
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,310
Next time,

511
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,680
I will make the Wangquan family

512
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,720
pay.

513
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,410
Qingcheng.

514
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:54,690
Qingcheng!

515
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:57,940
Qing...

516
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:17,590
Sister.

517
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,660
[Qingcheng,
a spider demon in the Silk Cave]

518
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,200
Come here.

519
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,520
Come here.

520
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:28,920
Sister.

521
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,510
Our Qingcheng looks so handsome

522
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,400
in human form.

523
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:35,910
By the way,

524
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,640
this is for you.

525
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,650
All these years,

526
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,070
I've secretly collected many gems.

527
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,440
They're all here.

528
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,440
Keep it safe.

529
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,840
Sister, you're amazing.

530
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,030
Listen to me.

531
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,270
Later,

532
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,510
just go straight along that road.

533
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,000
Then you'll see a village.

534
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,400
It's Deer Village,
home of the deer demons.

535
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,110
They're not hostile to outsiders.

536
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,320
Give them

537
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,650
half of these gems.

538
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Use the other half

539
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,160
to buy some good food.

540
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,480
Okay.

541
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,640
Replenish your strength.

542
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,440
Got it?

543
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,220
Are you coming with me?

544
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,030
I...

545
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,050
have something else to do.

546
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,270
Once I'm done,

547
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,330
I'll go find you.

548
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,930
Sister, what else do you need to do?

549
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,640
By the way, where is the antidote?

550
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,440
Haven't you taken the antidote?

551
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:22,400
I...

552
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,480
Are you going to give the antidote
to the Soldier?

553
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,160
No.

554
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,110
Have you forgotten

555
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,960
how the people of the Yiqi Alliance

556
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,350
used to abuse us for fun?

557
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,480
They all deserve to die!

558
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,140
Qingcheng.

559
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,550
There are good and bad demons.

560
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,720
Humans are the same.

561
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,750
If the Soldier
hadn't passed his spiritual power to me,

562
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:42,720
how could the two of us

563
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,110
have taken human form?

564
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,680
If you give the antidote to the Soldier,

565
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,010
what will happen to you?

566
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,790
You promised me

567
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,680
you'd stay with me.

568
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,440
Qingcheng, listen to me.

569
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,680
Go to Deer Village now.

570
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,610
It's safe there.

571
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,000
Hurry up. Go!

572
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:05,000
I won't leave if you don't come.

573
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:12,960
Qingcheng,

574
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,720
promise me,

575
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,030
you must take good care of yourself.

576
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:28,750
Sister!

577
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,160
Young Master Fugui,

578
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,750
wait for me.

579
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:34,960
[Wangquan]

580
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,680
You demon,

581
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,180
how dare you come back?

582
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,240
Lady Feng.

583
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,640
Who's your Lady Feng?

584
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,270
Although Senior Fugui
has been covering for you

585
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:52,110
and denying that he was poisoned,

586
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,590
I'm not an idiot.

587
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,030
You must have something to do

588
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,840
with him being poisoned.

589
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,240
Lady Feng,

590
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,350
I'll explain

591
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,570
everything to you.

592
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,550
Look.

593
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,000
This is the antidote
for Young Master Fugui.

594
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,230
I came to deliver it.

595
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:09,960
Look.

596
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,219
You still dare to harm him?

597
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,070
Lady Feng,

598
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,960
this really is the antidote.

599
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,030
Lady Feng!

600
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,750
I'm sorry, Lady Feng.

601
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,510
Senior Feng,
how did this demon get in here?

602
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,360
Cut the crap.

603
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,550
Use the talisman!

604
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,090
You still won't give up?

605
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:19,070
Even if I have to die here today,

606
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:21,730
I must give this antidote
to Young Master Fugui.

607
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,490
Young Master Fugui...

608
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,010
Young Master Fugui!

609
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,660
Young Master Fugui...

610
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,440
Young Master Fugui!

611
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,010
Young...

612
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,630
Lady Feng...

613
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,550
I'm really here to deliver the antidote.

614
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,320
Please, trust me.

615
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,220
I'm really here to deliver the antidote.

616
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,550
Lady Feng...

617
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,510
-Young Master Fugui...
-Senior Fugui, why?

618
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,670
She hurt you so much.

619
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,660
Why are you still protecting her?

620
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:16,510
I will

621
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,090
handle this myself.

622
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,510
Aren't you afraid I'll tell Master?

623
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,150
She has her reasons we don't know about.

624
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,410
I have to ask her first.

625
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:27,880
I don't care.

626
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,150
I will tell Master.

627
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:37,840
Young...

628
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,760
Young Master Fugui...

629
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:08,920
Senior Fugui,

630
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,320
why?

631
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,150
Humans and demons have different paths.

632
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:15,750
Why are you so protective
of that spider demon?

633
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,800
Senior Fugui,

634
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,510
do you know what you are doing?

635
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:30,240
[Beautiful Spring Scenery]

636
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,090
Young Master Fugui,

637
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,250
I brought the antidote.

638
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,800
Take it now.

639
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,810
What happened to your face?

640
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,400
I...

641
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:56,360
I'm fine.

642
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,380
Just some minor injuries.

643
00:37:59,110 --> 00:37:59,920
Anyway,

644
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,440
we spiders are ugly to begin with.

645
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,070
It doesn't matter.

646
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,710
Madam Yin threatened you
with your brother.

647
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,240
That's why you poisoned me.

648
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,880
Why didn't you tell me?

649
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,360
You...

650
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,740
You found out everything?

651
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:21,710
Yes.

652
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,740
Why didn't you tell me?

653
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,190
Because...

654
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,710
Because Madam Yin threatened

655
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,590
that if I told you,

656
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:47,320
they would kill my brother.

657
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,840
Although,

658
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,150
I still poisoned you

659
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,840
and betrayed your trust.

660
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,570
Young Master Fugui,

661
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,280
take the antidote first.

662
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,840
Although I controlled the dosage

663
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,280
of the Seven Bitterness,

664
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,920
it's still bad for your health.

665
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,320
Take it first.

666
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:21,640
Young Master Fugui,

667
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,190
please take it now.

668
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,000
Okay.

669
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:41,840
Great.

670
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,280
Great.

671
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,440
Now that

672
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,760
you've gotten the antidote,

673
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,120
I can finally...

674
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,880
rest assured.

675
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,170
Why did this little spider

676
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,000
do this?

677
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,000
Fugui,

678
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,030
you called me all the way back

679
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,110
just to watch you

680
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,230
feed the medicine to the little spider?

681
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:44,430
Now that you've given her the antidote,

682
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:45,440
what about you?

683
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,230
I'm telling you,

684
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,190
in 5 days,

685
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,030
the poison will reach your heart.

686
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:50,840
Follow me.

687
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,070
Did you hear me?

688
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,400
When you called for me,

689
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I knew it had to be something urgent.

690
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,230
You talk too much.

691
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,480
Tell me.

692
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,710
Why did you call me here?

693
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,150
Tonight is the 7th night.

694
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,190
The gu has fully formed.

695
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,920
It's the right time to expel it.

696
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,510
But...

697
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,030
But your qi and blood

698
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:18,960
are in turmoil.

699
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,000
So you need my help.

700
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,240
That's right.

701
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,680
Seal my spiritual veins.

702
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,540
Rumu!

703
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:48,630
Again!

704
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,550
A sword forged to vanquish evil

705
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:23,080
has somehow gained warmth?

706
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,030
Wangquan Fugui has actually

707
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:29,280
fallen for a lowly little demon.

708
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,630
Once a person develops feelings,
they gain weaknesses.

709
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:35,360
How are my clones
inside the circle coming along?

710
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,710
Madam,

711
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,040
the nails have been planted.

712
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,960
Your four clones inside the circle—

713
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,840
Taisui, Gukui, Guifeng, and Jiuwei—

714
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,070
are all on standby.

715
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,360
Good.

716
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,400
It's time for Taisui to meet

717
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,960
our old friend from the Western Regions.
