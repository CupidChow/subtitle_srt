[Dust-Seeker]

4
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,000
Young Master Fugui,

5
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,440
you're giving this sword to me?

6
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,840
Qingtong,

7
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,630
we each have

8
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,330
our own path to walk.

9
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,150
If fate allows,

10
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,170
we'll meet again.

11
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,350
I know

12
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,889
you have things you must do.

13
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,870
So do I.

14
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,310
I...

15
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,010
want to become a better version of myself.

16
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,430
Young Master Fugui,

17
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,630
let's say goodbye.

18
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,150
Tomorrow,

19
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,150
go back with me.

20
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,190
Go back where?

21
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,650
The Yiqi Alliance.

22
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,590
It's impossible for me
to take over the Zhang family.

23
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,450
But the Chief might at least let me

24
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,680
spend the rest of my life in comfort

25
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,670
and leisure in the Zhang family.

26
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,410
But what about them?

27
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,120
They don't have a life left to live.

28
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,680
Jiu

29
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,180
was a little demon
of the raccoon dog demon clan,

30
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,980
900 years old.

31
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,280
Because of its love for food and fun,

32
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,940
it accidentally cultivated
into a great demon.

33
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,870
The Wu couple—

34
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,960
one human and one demon.

35
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,520
They were once locked in a cage
and dunked in water.

36
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,290
The wife, a water-snake demon,

37
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,150
broke off her tail

38
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,960
to help her husband escape.

39
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:30,690
Qiu Hanlin,

40
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,750
a young master from a noble family

41
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,210
and Fuying's benefactor.

42
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,030
Fuying took human form

43
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,690
upon hearing his flute.

44
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,200
And it's not just these demons
I mentioned.

45
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,650
Many humans and demons in the village

46
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,910
don't have a future anymore.

47
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,430
And all of this

48
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,150
was because of me.

49
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,680
Do you still think

50
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,360
I can go back with you?

51
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,040
I understand.

52
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,310
But Zhang Qi,

53
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,430
Yiqi Alliance already knows

54
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,200
what happened in Peach Village.

55
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,390
This is the Ximen family's territory.

56
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,650
They won't allow Peach Village to exist.

57
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,670
Even if the Ximen family
doesn't kill them,

58
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,480
they're weak beings

59
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,560
rejected
by both the human and demon realms.

60
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,220
Where could they possibly go?

61
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,070
How can they live?

62
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,600
Tonight as I sit here,

63
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,750
I've cursed myself countless times

64
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,080
for being deceived by Qingli

65
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,920
and causing everyone's death.

66
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,950
How foolish

67
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,040
and unforgivable.

68
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,830
But Soldier,

69
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,290
I've always believed
Peach Village was never wrong.

70
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,630
We cultivate,

71
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,230
not to compromise with this chaotic world.

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,330
Whether human or demon,

73
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,390
strong or weak,

74
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,850
everyone deserves a home.

75
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,330
Even after all the betrayal

76
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,830
and slander,

77
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,280
you still don't regret it?

78
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,390
Do you know

79
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,159
how I purified the miasma
around Peach Village

80
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,190
back then?

81
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,040
You used miasma-repelling talismans,

82
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,700
linking them into a formation

83
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:57,360
to keep it outside the village.

84
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,240
That's right.

85
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,310
I burned all 12 talismans

86
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,870
that could block the miasma.

87
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,480
Starting tomorrow,

88
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,040
the miasma will once again
shroud Dingling Mountain.

89
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,480
All paths leading to Peach Village

90
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,430
will be cut off.

91
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,360
The Ximen family

92
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,240
will never enter again.

93
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,270
But if so,

94
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,690
Peach Village
will also be covered in miasma.

95
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
Come with me.

96
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,240
You wrote this miasma-repelling talisman

97
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,480
with blood,

98
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,600
using this peach tree
as the formation's core

99
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,430
to activate this defense formation.

100
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,800
Since you want to protect Peach Village

101
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,200
and keep outsiders away,

102
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,000
why didn't you use
the 12 bamboo talismans?

103
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,430
There was no time.

104
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,300
The bamboo talismans' spiritual power
is limited.

105
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,500
It took me seven years to weave them into

106
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,830
a formation back then.

107
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,960
Without me maintaining it,

108
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,800
once their spiritual power fades,

109
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,600
the Ximen family
will surely enter Peach Village.

110
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,990
And I no longer have another seven years.

111
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,530
Talismans are Yin, and weapons are Yang.

112
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,800
Humans are the weapons
of heaven and earth.

113
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,370
If I offer my own flesh and blood
as a sacrifice,

114
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,680
Peach Village can be preserved forever,

115
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,850
free from the miasma's corrosion.

116
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,500
If you do that,

117
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,159
once the talisman is activated,

118
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
you'll die.

119
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,680
My dream

120
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,930
started here,

121
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,400
so it will also end here.

122
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,950
I won't fail Zhang Qi from back then.

123
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,460
Soldier,

124
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,880
I have no spiritual power left.

125
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,960
Could you please

126
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,280
activate the formation for me?

127
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,200
I know

128
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,110
I shouldn't have entrusted this to you,

129
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,270
but it's the only way
to protect Peach Village.

130
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
Forgive me.

131
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,540
I can only count on you now.

132
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,400
I understood.

133
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,760
You're a Soldier of the Yiqi Alliance.

134
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,630
By helping me
protect Peach Village this time,

135
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:24,210
you'll likely pay a heavy price
in the future.

136
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,870
As you said,

137
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,480
we cultivate,

138
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,910
not to compromise with this chaotic world.

139
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,000
Well then,

140
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,720
thank you.

141
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,510

Why didn't you bring Zhang Qi back?

Why didn't you kill the demons?

230
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,730

The producer of the Chakuwa is dead.

232
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,380

235
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,320
Those are demons.

236
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,000
A human territory has now become

237
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,760
Peach Village,
a place where humans and demons coexist,

238
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:34,600
and it

239
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,870

240
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,840

241
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,720
Yes.

242
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,950
From now on, before I slay a demon,

243
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,670
I will ask for the reason.

244
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,670
Demons that shouldn't be killed—

245
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,430
I won't

246
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,510
kill them anymore.

247
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,120
Why?

248
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,830
Father, do you think Zhang Qi was wrong?

249
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,240
If it weren't for
that despicable moth demon

250
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,109
deceiving him,

251
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,960
he would still be

252
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,480
the Black Sword now.

253
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,270
He...

254
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,680
was so wrong!

255
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,810
But I don't think so!

256
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,270
Zhang Qi was deceived,

257
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,720
but his dream was not wrong.

258
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,970
Whether human or demon,

259
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,160
strong or weak,

260
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,960
everyone deserves a place to live.

261
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,430
You are a Soldier,

262
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,400
born to slay demons.

263
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,680
If a Soldier is bound

264
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,830
to be the strongest blade
without right or wrong,

265
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,830
then what is wrong

266
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,040
is the idea of a Soldier itself.

267
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,200
I'm here to discuss with you.

268
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,480
Maybe killing alone

269
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,060
isn't our only option
for dealing with the Demon Realm.

270
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,400
Is Zhang Qi really the only thing

271
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,000
making you waver like this?

272
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,350
Father,

273
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,680
this isn't wavering.

274
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,040
It's just that I now understand

275
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,300
what wielding a sword truly means

276
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,160
as a Soldier.

277
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,720
Even under the pressure
of the Blue Sky Assembly's prophecy,

278
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,980
you will still do this?

279
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,880
Then what about me

280
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,920
and Wangquan family?

281
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,580
If Yiqi Alliance has no rules,

282
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,450
how will we ever lead others
against the demons?

283
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,440
I'll give you another chance.

284
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,160
Go to Peach Village right now

285
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,800
and kill every demon there.

286
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,400
I, Wangquan Fugui,

287
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,270
stand without regret

288
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,040
and with a clear conscience.

289
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,850
I'll take my leave.

290
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,680
Stop!

291
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,310

292
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,240
Yes!

293
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,360
The Soldier violated the family rules.

294
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,270
Subject him to clan punishment!

295
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:26,960
Yes!

298
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,030
Master,

299
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,830
Young Master Fugui is injured.

300
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,510
That many lashes

301
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,590
are enough.

302
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,680
You even sealed his spiritual power.

303
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,400
You're killing him!

304
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,000
Demons

305
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,130
are cruel and brutal to humans,

306
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,440
yet he showed mercy

307
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,920
to demons.

308
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,720
Give me the whip!

309
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,830
Master!

310
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,760
Young Master!

311
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,070
Just give in, okay?

312
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,720
Fei.

313
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,590
From today on,

314
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,830
you will no longer
celebrate your birthdays.

315
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,550
Why?

316
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,070
As a Soldier, you need

317
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,730
absolute loneliness and concentration.

318
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,110
These worldly things

319
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,840
will only distract you.

320
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,830
Let's begin.

321
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,000
Can I keep this?

322
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,880
This ebony sword

323
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,750
was a gift from you.

324
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,130
Then let's start with this sword.

325
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,200
Break it.

326
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:19,750
Master!

327
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,350
Forty lashes have been carried out!

328
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,570
Forty lashes have been carried out!

329
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,160
Soldier,

330
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,380
do you admit your mistake?

331
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,960
I did nothing wrong.

332
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,210
Since he doesn't admit it,

333
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,460
keep him hanging until he does.

334
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,200
No one is allowed

335
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,510
to approach—

336
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,180
let this serve as a warning!

337
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,790
Why am I still unable to subdue

338
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,480
the Dragon Spine Sword?

339
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,110
Quan Jingting,

340
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,070
are you giving up so easily?

341
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,720
I brought good news.

342
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,790
The Soldier

343
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,750
protected Peach Village.

344
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,510
Even heaven stands on my side.

345
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,550
I won't lose.

346
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,680
Good.

347
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,350
That's right.

348
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,550
Then let me...

349
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,350
help you.

350
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,200
You finally submitted to me,

351
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,790
Dragon Spine Sword.

352
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,920
It's my time to take the stage!

353
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,720
Masters, you've traveled through the night

354
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,160
[Do your best to kill demons.]

355
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,110
and must be exhausted.

356
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,200
Shall I arrange for you

357
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,900
to rest at the manor first?

358
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,790
The weather is changing,

359
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,800
and you're still thinking about rest, Fei?

360
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,880
It won't come to that.

361
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,430
Elders, please be patient
and wait a little longer.

362
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:34,550
[Elder of Yiqi Alliance,
Master of the Ximen family]

363
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,480
Our Chief

364
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:35,990
has always been fair.

365
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,310
I believe

366
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,830
he'll give you a satisfactory answer.

367
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,180
The Chief has arrived!

368
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,110
Elders,

369
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,350
you came in such force

370
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:06,110
and even brought your disciples—

371
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,810
what's the matter?

372
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,880

373
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,140
do you really not know?

374
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,630
About the Blue Sky Assembly,

375
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,240
I've already discussed it

376
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,030
with you all,

377
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,790
and we've reached a consensus.

378
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,210
The Soldier

379
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,640
will never go astray.

380
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,030
Never go astray.

381
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,290
Then how do you explain

382
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,160
the incident in Peach Village?

383
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,590
That's right.

384
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,720
As we all know,

385
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,510
Peach Village in Dingling Mountain

386
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,370
is the Ximen family's territory.

387
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,900
But now, it has become a place
where humans and demons coexist.

388
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,510
I also heard that

389
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,720
the evil drug, Chakuwa,

390
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,240
originated from there.

391
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,400
The Soldier

392
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:00,030
actually blocked all paths
leading to Peach Village

393
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,550
to help those demons.

394
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,200
This is nothing less
than a slap in the face

395
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,600
to both the Ximen family
and Yiqi Alliance.

396
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,050
The Soldier's fault

397
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:11,310
was merely a moment of weakness,

398
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:15,090
and I've already punished him
according to our family law.

399
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,790
Chief.

400
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,750
Do you really think

401
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,590
a few lashes are enough to cover up

402
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,120
the Soldier's wrongdoing?

403
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,030
Quan Jingting,

404
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,920
why are you here

405
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,320
instead of at the Sword Tomb?

406
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,130
Since entering the Sword Tomb,

407
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,920
I've spent my days

408
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,550
with the ancestors.

409
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:44,830
But recently,

410
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,880
a voice

411
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,030
has been crying in my ears—

412
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,750
mournful

413
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,590
and sorrowful.

414
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:58,240
That was the voice
of the Wangquan ancestors crying.

415
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,350
They told me that

416
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,750
Yiqi Alliance will face a great calamity,

417
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,200
and that disaster

418
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,250
will come from the Soldier,

419
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,550
Wangquan Fugui.

420
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,480
How dare you!

421
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,350
What right do you have

422
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,970
to speak against the Soldier?

423
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,060
Under the guidance of the ancestors,

424
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,920
I obtained a peerless sword.

425
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,160
This sword

426
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,350
is my right.

427
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,480
What sword?

428
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,920
Nonsense!

429
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,680
Listen.

430
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,310
How sorrowful

431
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,750
this wailing sounds.

432
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:03,510
One misstep can lead to eternal regret.

433
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,570
Before the Soldier

434
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,110
commits an unforgivable sin,

435
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,240
the ancestors have asked me
to step forward

436
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,680
and uphold justice,

437
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,110
to make him turn back
before it's too late,

438
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,240
and to turn the tide.

439
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,750
What a joke.

440
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,160
How could the ancestors

441
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,880
let a man with wolfish ambitions

442
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,920
to take charge?

443
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,550
However ambitious I may be,

444
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,110
it's for Yiqi Alliance.

445
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,410
But what about you?

446
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,400
Back then,
you insisted on getting out of the circle

447
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,590
and caused the deaths
of so many young masters and elites.

448
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,960
But you gave birth to a Soldier

449
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,830
and now dominates Yiqi Alliance.

450
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,880
Everyone,

451
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,110
is the existence of the Soldier

452
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,070
really good

453
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,200
for Yiqi Alliance?

454
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,550
In the Peach Village incident,

455
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,550
the Soldier's mindset has changed.

456
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,480
Will the prophecy come true?

457
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,760
Everyone,

458
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:05,920
those who spend their days training hawks

459
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,870
will one day have their eyes
pecked out by the hawk.

460
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,750
Who hasn't been reckless in youth?

461
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:16,030
Hongye has been in charge of Yiqi Alliance
for many years

462
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,550
and his merits are undeniable.

463
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,110
We're arguing here today

464
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,550
only because we're worried the Soldier

465
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,080
will break the circle
and side with our enemy.

466
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,300
This magic tool is called Wuchen.

467
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,750
It can strip away all worldly thoughts

468
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,470
from the Soldier

469
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,830
and elevate him

470
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,330
into a merciless,
emotionless, and peerless blade.

471
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,720
Master,

472
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,070
he's trying to turn the Young Master

473
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,880
into a monster.

474
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,330
As long as I, Wangquan Hongye,
am still in the Yiqi Alliance,

475
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,430
no one can lay a finger on him.

476
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,350
I have overseen
Yiqi Alliance's punishments for years

477
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,550
and know the law well.

478
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,240
I understand

479
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,070
the bonds of family.

480
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,740
How about this?

481
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,790
Before sunset tomorrow

482
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,880
I hope the Soldier can mend his mistakes

483
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,280
and give us a satisfactory answer.

484
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,590
Otherwise,

485
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,760
don't blame Yiqi Alliance
for being ruthless.

486
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,270
Quan Jingting,

487
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,200
do you think this show of force

488
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,920
can bring down the Soldier?

489
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:16,210
Wangquan Hongye has been
in charge of Yiqi Alliance for years.

490
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:19,030
That's his son with Dongfang Huaizhu.

491
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
His heart

492
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,270
is not truly cold.

493
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,590
He will risk his life to protect his son.

494
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,480
I need another blade

495
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,510
to strike him and his son.

496
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,400
Good.

497
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,790
No wonder our Madam chose you.

498
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:41,070
Then I'll give you

499
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,550
the blade you want.

500
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:07,810
[Deer Village]

501
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:07,720
Sir,

502
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,400
I'm done looking.

503
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:08,960
How is it?

504
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:09,750
Are you satisfied?

505
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,640
It's very good.

506
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,110
Is it enough?

507
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,270
Yes.

508
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,450
Thank you, sir.

509
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,550
I have a question.

510
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,720
You're renting

511
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,600
two rooms for yourself—

512
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,550
isn't that a bit wasteful?

513
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,440
How about I switch it to a smaller one

514
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,270
so

515
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,070
the rent's cheaper?

516
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:38,880
No need.

517
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,740
Thank you, sir.

518
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,440
My sister will come in the future.

519
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,260
This big room

520
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,640
is for her.

521
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:47,730
Alright.

522
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,030
But let me remind you.

523
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,200
Don't run around,

524
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,840
especially to the east.

525
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,680
Whatever you do, don't go there.

526
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,640
What's wrong with the east?

527
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,350
Three hundred li east of Deer Village
is a city called Qianji City.

528
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,200
Its lord

529
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,960
is a devil in human skin.

530
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,929
They hunt demons everywhere.

531
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,440
Male or female,

532
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,510
old or young—

533
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,940
they take them all.

534
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,550
Let's not talk about these bad things.

535
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,360
Remember,

536
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,440
don't fall behind on your rent.

537
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,219
Thank you, sir.

538
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,190
I see.

539
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,800
Don't run around.

540
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,630
Okay. Bye, sir.

541
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,760
Sister,

542
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,480
we have a home now.

543
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,510
From now on

544
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,530
we don't have to be afraid.

545
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:44,710
Here.

546
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,440
Have some.

547
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,750
Thank you.

548
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:49,590
Here.

549
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:00,840
I know

550
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,480
you just lost your home.

551
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,070
But trust me.

552
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,210
Deer Village

553
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,800
will also be a wonderful place.

554
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,360
They are willing to accept everything.

555
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,960
Because my brother is there.

556
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,000
That place

557
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,320
will be your new home.

558
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,340
Thank you, Miss Qingtong.

559
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,900
Thank you, Miss Qingtong.

560
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,110
Great.

561
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:26,280
Eat up.

562
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,600
If your master were still alive,

563
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,230
he'd want you to pull yourself together,

564
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,320
live well,

565
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,630
and write more songs.

566
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:44,810
Here.

567
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,600
Eat something first.

568
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,320
Eat more.

569
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,530
We'll be on the road again soon.

570
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:09,590
Oh no.

571
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,960
Everyone, get up!

572
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,000
Follow me!

573
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:13,800
Hurry!

574
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,150
Hurry up!

575
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:16,920
Keep up!

576
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,530
Hurry up!

577
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,030
Hurry!

578
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,230
Hurry!

579
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,710
Run straight

580
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,800
along this road!

581
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,800
Catch all the demons.

582
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,800
Don't let a single one get away.

583
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,280
You're quite interesting.

584
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,550
No wonder

585
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,760
the Soldier took a liking to you.
