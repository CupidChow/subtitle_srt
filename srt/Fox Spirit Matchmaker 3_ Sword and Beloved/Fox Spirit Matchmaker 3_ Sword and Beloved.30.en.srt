[Sword and Beloved]

2
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:50,700
[Episode 30]

3
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,400
We made it.

4
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,040
Miss Long.

5
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,590
Thank you.

6
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,560
Where is Rumu?

7
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,790
Celestial Master...

8
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,760
He's still with Gulizan.

9
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,490
Let's go.

10
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,970
Celestial Master,

11
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,210
may misfortunes never befall you.

12
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,079
The peace of the Western Regions

13
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:32,280
needs to be maintained by the four of us.

14
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,140
Celestial Master?

15
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,290
What happened?

16
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,360
Nothing.

17
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,030
I...

18
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,360
I was being too anxious.

19
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,630
What kind of stunt is he pulling?

20
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,190
We can't let this situation go on.

21
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,310
I've heard that in the Western Regions,

22
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,030
there's a mouth-to-mouth
energy transferring method.

23
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,360
It may help him restore spiritual energy

24
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,310
and wake him up.

25
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,840
Good job,

26
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,990
my dear disciple.

27
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,630
Poor Dog,

28
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,560
are you sure of that?

29
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,470
Yes, I'm sure.

30
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,150
Master and I read about the secret art
of the Western Regions.

31
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,010
The book does record
this method.

32
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,910
Miss Long,

33
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,400
don't members of the Dragon Clan
all have good medical skills?

34
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,329
Why don't you...

35
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,150
Miss Long,

36
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,520
at this point,

37
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,160
there isn't a better option.

38
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,240
What’s wrong, Miss Long?

39
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,800
You two…

40
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,120
I got it.

41
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,649
Poor Dog, come out with me.

42
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,570
Why do you have to be so nosy?

43
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,870
Stop looking at them!

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,750
I'm not!

45
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:15,850
Weiyun,

46
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,800
what

47
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,560
was ringing just now?

48
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,550
Nothing was ringing.

49
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,180
You heard it wrong.

50
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,780
Was that so?

51
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,490
But I heard it

52
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,630
quite clearly.

53
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,650
Now that you've recovered,

54
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:36,710
I should get going.

55
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,750
Weiyun!

56
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,630
Weiyun!

57
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,610
Where are you going?

58
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,720
The task I promised to tackle with you
has been completed.

59
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,120
Of course I'm leaving for
where I should be.

60
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,190
Miss Long,

61
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,450
where are you heading?

62
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,970
Are you leaving right now?

63
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes.

64
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,560
To celebrate the victory against Gulizan

65
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,750
and the fact

66
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,870
that we can continue defending
the Western Regions,

67
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,390
Xueyang is holding a party
at the military camp tonight.

68
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:05,830
Right.

69
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,510
Won't it be nice to drink,
sing, and watch the moon

70
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,210
together?

71
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:10,870
Yeah, Weiyun.

72
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,720
Don't you want to go with me

73
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,920
and make friends with the like-minded?

74
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,430
That's right, Miss Long.

75
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,720
We've just built good rapport
between each other.

76
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,190
Why not stay and celebrate

77
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,480
with us tonight?

78
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,870
Please stay.

79
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,600
-Come on!
-Come on!

80
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,800
Fill up your glasses.

81
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,720
To the four of us

82
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,360
defeating Gulizan with concerted efforts

83
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,950
and safeguarding the peace
of the Western Regions.

84
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,830
Cheers!

85
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,480
Cheers!

86
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,680
Cheers, Miss Long.

87
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,340
Bottoms up.

88
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,070
Weiyun,

89
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,060
I've never seen you

90
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:34,430
smile so happily.

91
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,870
Given General Li's utter hospitality,

92
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,510
I surely must enjoy this party.

93
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,040
Don't read too much into it.

94
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,090
In addition,

95
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,270
after tonight,

96
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,120
you'll have to stop following me.

97
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,190
How can I stop?

98
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:56,720
Come on.

99
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,190
Let's drink.

100
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:58,950
Come on, have a drink.

101
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:59,430
Let's drink.

102
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,160
Drink up.

103
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,470
There's a hot pot here?

104
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,680
What a great atmosphere tonight!

105
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,070
Why not dance with us?

106
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,160
Let's do it!

107
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,890
Come with me!

108
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:09,680
Guys!

109
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,040
Move!

110
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,120
Boss is joining us!

111
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,750
I can't dance.

112
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,600
-Go. What do you mean you can't dance?
-Miss Long, come along.

113
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,360
No more dawdling. Hurry!

114
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,820
I've never danced before.

115
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,630
Let's go!

116
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,180
Come on.

117
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,120
Let's

118
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,240
dance!

119
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,080
Weiyun,

120
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,690
I saw a bracelet on the way here.

121
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,150
I thought it'd definitely

122
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,150
look great on you.

123
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,770
Weiyun, in your heart,

124
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,630
I'm never the only one.

125
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,330
But I won't forget each and every word

126
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,790
you've said.

127
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,650
Are you alright?

128
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,920
Young Master Fugui,

129
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,670
suppose

130
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,270
we become stronger

131
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,860
through cultivation,

132
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,030
but only end up

133
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,150
losing the person we care most about.

134
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,630
Then what's the meaning

135
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,960
of our cultivation?

136
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,030
As Zhang Qi once said,

137
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,510
making a compromise

138
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:14,290
with this chaotic world
shouldn't be the purpose of cultivation.

139
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,440
Qingtong,

140
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,030
rebuild the Peach Village here.

141
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,530
Let all the helpless souls adrift
in troubled times

142
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,270
have a place to call home.

143
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:38,750
This is a proclamation from the governor
of Qianji City to the world—

144
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,360
This city invites

145
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:42,140
[Edict]

146
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,290
those of insight and vision to come

147
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:46,050
and inaugurate a prosperous era
where humans and demons coexist.

148
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,960
From today on,

149
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,200
all the humans and demons

150
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,720
that choose to settle in Qianji City

151
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,080
will be considered comrades

152
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,540
and protected by the city.

153
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,140
With Master by Miss Qingtong's side,

154
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,560
Qianji City will surely become
the best city of all times.

155
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,010
Poor Dog.

156
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,390
We must work hard too.

157
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:09,390
Yes,

158
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,360
My Love!

159
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,910
Aren't you silly?

160
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:24,180
[Edict]

161
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,730
Master,

162
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,790
Senior Fugui and Qingtong
have made huge contributions.

163
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,670
They not only found

164
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,750
the culprit
behind the Night of Frost's Descent

165
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,880
and thus solved Elder Shouren's case,

166
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:30,910
but also

167
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,600
destroyed the Myriad Blight Formation
in time

168
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,060
to prevent a catastrophe.

169
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,000
It takes actual actions to create

170
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,880
a prosperous and peaceful era.

171
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,390
It has to be like this,

172
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,550
starting from a small city.

173
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,550
As long as

174
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,840
there's hope in the heart,

175
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,850
even a single spark
can start a prairie fire.

176
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,080
Master,

177
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,230
put your mind at ease.

178
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,010
Everything is looking up.

179
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,090
Young Master Fugui.

180
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:34,840
Yes?

181
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,420
It's late at night.

182
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,450
Still working on the compass?

183
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,980
I'm doing okay.

184
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,810
Did you drink alcohol?

185
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,650
Is the smell too strong?

186
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,240
I did drink a bit.

187
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,440
Are there no humans or demons

188
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,250
migrating to Qianji City?

189
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,910
There are.

190
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,080
It's just not that many.

191
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,040
Every now and then,
there comes a new resident.

192
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,600
One is a boar demon

193
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,400
that weighs over 100 kilograms.

194
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,530
He eats 20 steamed buns in one meal.

195
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,910
Everything takes time.

196
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,960
Zhang Qi spent seven years

197
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,170
building up the Peach Village.

198
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,840
To build Qianji City

199
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,090
into a shelter like the Peach Village,

200
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,180
there's still a long way for you to go.

201
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,030
Got it.

202
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,330
Young Master Fugui,

203
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,720
how's it going with the study
of the magic tool

204
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,320
that can track the Black Fox?

205
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,190
I guess I've made some progress.

206
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:53,120
If this compass is successfully developed,

207
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,180
it'll detect the Black Fox's energy.

208
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,680
But before that,

209
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,860
there's a long way for me to go too.

210
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
Hangover cures

211
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,790
are all bitter.

212
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,830
You solved the problem yourself

213
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,200
and saved your brother.

214
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,320
Qingtong,

215
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,120
your efforts weren't in vain.

216
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,580
Then, Young Master Fugui,

217
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,600
shouldn't you

218
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,080
reward me with some candy?

219
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,330
The candy has indeed

220
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,880
made me feel better.

221
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,290
The mission was already completed.

222
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,870
Yet you're still following me.

223
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,550
Why?

224
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,670
I'm here

225
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,000
to verify one thing.

226
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,150
I know

227
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,150
the Dragon Bone Bell rings

228
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,000
when you fall in love.

229
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,630
Previously, at the Li Army's camp,

230
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,150
I heard the bell ring.

231
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,760
Very clearly.

232
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,330
You heard an imaginary sound.

233
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,690
I don't believe it.

234
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,650
How about this?

235
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,490
Let me take a look at the bell

236
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,730
for confirmation.

237
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,609
Why would I let you?

238
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:10,109
You dare not do it.

239
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,690
Because I said it right, didn't I?

240
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,109
Do you hear it?

241
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,830
It's not ringing.

242
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,470
Will you just give up?

243
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,730
It shouldn't be like this.

244
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,790
I know what the problem is!

245
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,240
This must be it—

246
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,070
I don't look cool enough
in this posture right now.

247
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,000
Give me a moment.

248
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,210
What about now?

249
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,830
Has the bell rung?

250
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,440
I'll adjust my posture.

251
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,440
One, two, three!

252
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,400
Now,

253
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,920
it should be ringing.

254
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,070
T-The bell

255
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,160
must be broken.

256
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,200
Or perhaps...

257
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,510
it has been affected

258
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,510
by today's

259
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:00,960
bad weather.

260
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:01,880
Right?

261
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,720
Right.

262
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:09,590
Weiyun,

263
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,640
look!

264
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,240
Auspicious iridescent clouds!

265
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,480
So beautiful.

266
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,880
It's said

267
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,200
that such clouds come with good news.

268
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,830
Does it mean...

269
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,310
we...

270
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,640
Anyway,

271
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,840
I've thought it through.

272
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,400
From now on,

273
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,110
I will never part with you again.

274
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,770
It was my fault for stupidly

275
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,590
saying

276
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,530
that I'd leave you alone

277
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,880
and set you free.

278
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,750
I was being foolish.

279
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,640
I said that nonsense

280
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,170
in the moment of silliness.

281
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,550
Weiyun...

00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,510

285
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:27,400
I'll keep waiting and waiting

286
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,590
right here!

287
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:55,750

Weiyun, look.

Oh, right.

296

How dare you run?

414
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,990
Chongming bird demons
and members of prestigious families,

415
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,850
why are you chasing after a child?

416
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,750
That boy

417
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,400
is the son
of a Chongming bird demon and my senior.

418
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,570
He shouldn't live!

419
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,350
We the Chongming bird demons
are highly talented.

420
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,640
How can we let humans
take advantage of us?

421
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,100
It's against nature to let

422
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,790
this half-human half-demon live!

423
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,590
Nature?

424
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:05,160
Don't try to frame it on the nature.

425
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,470
Girl demon,

426
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,890
do you have a death wish or what?

427
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:11,600
Qianji City is a shelter
for humans and demons in need.

428
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,830
Killings are to be avoided here.

429
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,830
If you don't want to lose your lives,

430
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,440
scram now.

431
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,070
You are

432
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,440
the Qianji City Lord?

433
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,920
So what if I am?

434
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,400
You cowards!

435
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,310
Powerful though Qianji City is,

436
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,280
it's not invincible, is it?

437
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,920
Guys, charge!

438
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,810
Young Master Fugui,

439
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,360
let's take the boy back.

440
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,960
Little Bun,

441
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,440
cry if you want.

442
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,480
I can't cry.

443
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,240
When I cry,

444
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,640
blood appears.

445
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,920
Then they'll recognize me.

446
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,990
It's indeed a feature

447
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,490
of Chongming bird demons.

448
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,430
Tell me.

449
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,510
Where is your father?

450
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,750
He...

451
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,680
was beaten

452
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,740
to death by bad people.

453
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,120
Sir,

454
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,790
why do they dislike me?

455
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:47,590
Is it because I don't behave well enough?

456
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,440
I swear

457
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,310
I'll eat carrots from now on.

458
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,830
I won't be picky anymore.

459
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,420
You've behaved well enough, Little Bun.

460
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,430
Those bad guys just enjoy

461
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,070
bullying you.

462
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,250
Go to sleep.

463
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,550
Don't worry.

464
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,440
I'm here for you.

465
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,510
But I'm scared.

466
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,310
Sir,

467
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,240
can you

468
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,270
sing me to sleep?

469
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,590
I'm not

470
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,640
much good at singing.

471
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,110
How about I recite

472
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,360
some lines from a sword manual instead?

473
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:26,830
Okay.

474
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,940
"Spread your arms like a phoenix
to intimidate the enemy."

475
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,500
"Aim for the shoulders
and attack from both sides."

476
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,370
“Make your sword move
like dancing snowflakes.”

477
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:40,280
"With that you can fend off
many an opponent."

478
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,750
"Charge with an elegant gait
as you launch a fatal strike "

479
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:47,280
"Blades will meet in a shower of sparks
as bright as moonlight."

480
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,160
Qingcheng,

481
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,830
do you see?

482
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,510
Our ideal of a home

483
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,750
is being built little by little.

484
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,920
I will try my best.

485
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,070
The coexistence of humans and demons

486
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,000
won't be a dream.

487
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,310
I didn't expect Young Master Fugui

488
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,400
to lull the boy to sleep by reciting lines

489
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,530
from a sword manual.

490
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,620
Is this nerve-soothing soup?

491
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,200
Yes.

492
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,160
Chongming bird demons
get frightened easily.

493
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,960
I'm afraid
regular nerve-soothing soup won't do.

494
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,270
Look,

495
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,590
tomorrow,

496
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,650
I'll go collect some other herbs.

497
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,200
Okay.

498
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,590
Master.

499
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,240
The medicine prescribed by Dr. Xin

500
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,070
is indeed very potent.

501
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,280
I can't believe I just fell asleep.

502
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,640
Is it time to set out

503
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,550
for the selection of a new alliance chief?

504
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,350
Yes, Master.

505
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,550
But I have a report to make now.

506
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:02,440
Go ahead.

507
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,550
A few days ago,

508
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,790
the young master saved a kid
that's half human and half demon.

509
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,440
The news

510
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,370
has been spread to both realms.

511
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:24,480
Is he

512
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,030
still in Qianji City?

513
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,440
Yes.

514
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,230
The peach blossoms in the Peach Village

515
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,790
have been truly deeply rooted

516
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,030
in his heart.

517
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:40,680
Master,

518
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,160
since you've decided

519
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,070
to pass the position of chief
to a promising young member

520
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,240
of Yiqi Alliance,

521
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,610
why not ask the young master to come back?

522
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,160
Those stubborn old men
who were against him

523
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,310
have all gone by now.

524
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,880
I have

525
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,200
devoted my entire life to Yiqi Alliance.

526
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,070
But, Shuang,

527
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,920
right now,

528
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,070
I just want to be a selfish father

529
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,750
and let Fugui

530
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,830
grow the peach blossom in his heart.

531
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:22,920
Isn't it nice?

532
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,510
Maybe not meeting

533
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:34,350
with each other again is the best ending

534
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,080
for him and me as father and son.

535
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,110
Soldier,

536
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,340
do you admit your mistake?

537
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,640
I did nothing wrong.

538
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,880
If he doesn't admit,

539
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,480
keep him hanging until he does.

540
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,010
Father, don't blame yourself.

541
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,150
I've long anticipated and prepared

542
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,409
for everything that has happened today.

543
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,710
I just hope you can understand

544
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,030
the Way I deem right.

545
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,230
Fugui,

546
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:33,070
it seems our last parting
has turned out to be forever.

547
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,190
I may not

548
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,760
live to see

549
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,219
the day you practice the Way
with your sword.

Quan Jingting,

567
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:26,730
Madam is giving you a chance
to make up for your mistake.

568
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:30,110
Though Gulizan's body and soul
have vanished,

569
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,920
she did leave something behind.

570
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,190
You'll regain your power with its help.

571
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,110
But you must

572
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,760
clear all the barriers

573
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,280
for Madam.

574
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,110
How thoughtful and farsighted Madam is.

575
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,960
I promise I won't let her down.

576
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,340
Whether I can change my fate or not

577
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,550
depends on this one move.

578
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,960
As I expected,

579
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:40,760
you can't recreate
a complete Myriad Blight Formation,

580
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,320
but you can

581
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,150
assist me in absorbing power.

582
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,550
The power is not enough, though.

583
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,590
I'll take you to the Dragon Cave

584
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,420
where you can take in
plenty of dragon power.

585
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:01,150
I, Quan Jingting,

586
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,440
will rise again.

587
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,070
My rebellious son...
