However...

280
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,760
the medicine he used was too potent,

281
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,000
which is why you were unconscious

282
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,360

Rumu, listen to me.

288
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,360
I committed all those evil acts

289
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,640
because I was possessed by the Black Fox.

290
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,570
None of that was my true intention.

For as long as I can remember,

292
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,840
I've been very clear about

00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,370
what kind of person you are.

294
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,920

00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,850
Although my methods

297
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,560

If you really think I deserve to die...

302
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,040
then I do.

303
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,320

Are you afraid of death?

307
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,480
I'm not afraid of death.

308
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,800
I'm afraid

309
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,700
that after I die...

310
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,000
you'll be left all alone in this world.

311
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,900
You have to believe me.

312
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,200
Everything I did
was because of the Black Fox's influence.

313
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,240

Yes.

344
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,740
It wasn't easy.

345
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,400

From now on,

you'll stay here at Wangquan Manor.

349

If you don't like the Cold Pool,

350
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,280
you can ask the Master

351

to find you another place to stay.

352
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:10,880
No need.

353
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,640
The Master also said that

354
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,810

355
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,400
you can make them.

356
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,340
Give me another sword.

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,760

♪ Who dares to break this chaos? ♪

374
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:19,520

♪ Who else dares to fight alone like me? ♪

379
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,260

that with your talent,

393
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,680
you should never lay down your sword.

394
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:52,390
Fugui.

395
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,770
I'll treasure this gift

396
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,220
and live up to your expectations.

397
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,100
So what if I must lay down my sword?

398
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,320
I'll decide my own fate with one strike.

399
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:02,920
Fugui,

400
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,230
I look forward to meeting you again.

401
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,830
The world is so interesting.

402
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,120
I'll live on.

403
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,720
Where am I?

404
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,680
Oh no.

405
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,170
Why can't I remember anything?

406
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,480
Sister?

407
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,940
Sister, you're awake.

408
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,640
Sister.

409
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,600
Qingcheng?

410
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,960
Why are you dressed like this?

411
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,600
Why are you here too?

412
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,050
What is this place?

413
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,080
Sister, listen to me.

414
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,930
This is Qianji City.

415
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,520
Qianji City?

416
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,040
That day, I received news

417
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,700
and rushed to Wangquan Manor.

418
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,000
The Yiqi Alliance was about to kill you.

419
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,600
I fought with all my might
to bring you here.

420
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,680
Qingcheng,

421
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,760
there's

422
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,890
something very important I need to do.

423
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,960
I'm going out for a while.

424
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,290
Sister, are you going to find the Soldier?

425
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,760
I'm afraid it's too late.

426
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,380
You've been in a coma for 10 full days.

427
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,560
That day, the Soldier used

428
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,840
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike
in front of everyone.

429
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,100
They believed the prophecy of

430
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,000
the Third Young Master of Aolai
had come true.

431
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,530
They would never spare him.

432
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,640
I was in a coma for 10 days?

433
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,140
Young Master Fugui...

434
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,790
I don't believe it.

435
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,600
I'm going to find him.

436
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,120
Sister!

437
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,510
Qingcheng!

438
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,580
Are you alright, Chengcheng?

439
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,050
Sister, do you think

440
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,120
saving you from the Yiqi Alliance

441
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,320
was that easy for me?

442
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,130
In your heart,
there's only your Wangquan Fugui.

443
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,040
Does my life

444
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,640
mean anything to you at all?

445
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,320
Sister...

446
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,210
Sister, you can leave if you want.

447
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,440
Just like last time.

448
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,440
I thought you'd leave
and abandon me again,

449
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,920
just like last time.

450
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,520
Here.

451
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,600
Take the medicine first.

452
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,840
I know you're still worried about
the Soldier.

453
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,080
Sister, don't worry.

454
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,400
I've sent people to find out
his whereabouts.

455
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,720
Please be patient,

456
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,480
okay?

457
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:09,830
Okay.

458
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,090
Pick whatever you like.

459
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,120
Sir,

460
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,920
I can tell you're from the south.

461
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,160
You've been here for some time,

462
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,600
but every time you only order
a bowl of milk.

463
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,140
Are you not used to the food here?

464
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:28,840
I'm fine.

465
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:35,270
May I ask, are you here for travel
or for another reason?

466
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:36,980
To settle down here.

467
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,640
Sir, you have good judgment indeed.

468
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,440
The whole Western Regions

469
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,640
can be quite chaotic.

470
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,680
Only this town is the most peaceful.

471
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,730
From the look of you,

472
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,960
I can tell you haven't yet experienced
the full fury of the sandstorms here.

473
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,400
Sand painting show!

474
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:03,520
Well, 1,000 years ago,

475
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,640
the Western Regions was an ocean.

476
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,000
In that vast ocean

477
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,580
stood Penglai Island,

478
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,890
home to the dragon clan
led by True Dragons

479
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,560
and the ancient human kingdom of Qianxia.

480
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,520
The dragon clan

481
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,160
had a sacred relic,

482
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,400
the Water-Control Orb!

483
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,630
The dragons' demon powers were unmatched,

484
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:27,090
making their clan supreme
among all demons.

485
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,360
However, this Water-Control Orb

486
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,020
was full of murderous energy.

487
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,880
Every True Dragon who used it

488
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,680
eventually

489
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,890
turned into a berserk dragon.

490
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,640
It slaughtered ceaselessly

491
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,680
throughout the Western Regions.

492
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,720
The other demon clans,

493
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,440
in order to survive,

494
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,670
had no choice but to join forces
with the human race

495
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,800
to resist the berserk dragon together.

496
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,870
Later,

497
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,280
the Corsac Fox Clan among the demons

498
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,080
stood out,

499
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,420
joining forces with the human Li Army

500
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,520
to fight against the berserk dragon.

501
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,540
That war went on for a long time.

502
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,600
To slay the berserk dragon,

503
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,120
both clans suffered countless casualties

504
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,640
and nearly went extinct.

505
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,720
Finally, the dragon clan forced
the Li Army

506
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,760
and the Corsac Fox Clan

507
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,400
to jointly unleash an ultimate formation—

508
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,280
the Myriad Blight Formation!

509
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,680
Though powerful,

510
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,100
this formation

511
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,080
drew its power from the lives

512
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,120
of living beings.

513
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,120
The Corsac Fox Clan and the Li Army

514
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,580
sacrificed countless members of their own,

515
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,660
and only then

516
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,710
was the berserk dragon finally destroyed,

517
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,680
bringing peace to the Western Regions.

518
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,440
If there was the Li Army,

519
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,020
why is the Western Regions
still so chaotic?

520
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,200
Rumor has it
that whoever has the Water-Control Orb

521
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,260
can rule the entire Western Regions.

522
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,360
Where is the Water-Control Orb now?

523
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,680
Let me tell you,

524
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,880
the Water-Control Orb

525
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,400
was reportedly obtained by chance

526
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,080
by a group of bandits recently.

527
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,200
That's why the situation here
is so chaotic.

528
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,460
The Water-Control Orb

529
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,760
might actually be in the Western Regions?

530
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,620
I can't just turn a blind eye to it.

531
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,640
Looks like

532
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,880
I need to investigate this carefully.

533
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,650
Frozen Grace Spear,

534
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,500
[Li Xueyang, General of the Li Army]

535
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,960
Li Xueyang.

536
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:43,720
Hya!

537
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,200
Hya!

538
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,240
Wangquan Fugui,

539
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:04,400
you've finally comprehended
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike.

540
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,200
The day of breaking the circle

541
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,440
is near.

542
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,580
Congratulations, Madam.

543
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,550
However, this time you've lost two clones.

544
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:14,540
Should we have

545
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,080
Jiuwei go deal with the Soldier?

546
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,840
Jiuwei is a clone

547
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,760
born from a tail I severed myself,

548
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,199
specifically prepared to
possess the Soldier.

549
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,530
We can't use it lightly.

550
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,760
How is Guifeng now?

551
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,639
Madam,

552
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,400
Guifeng has gone to that lowly demon.

553
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,360
Good.

554
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,170
That lowly demon is crucial to my plan.

555
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:38,679
Send my orders

556
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:41,280
to Guifeng to do everything
in his power to provoke hatred

557
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,070
and revive my Grief Tree

558
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,679
before the Soldier breaks the circle.

559
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,480
Yes, Madam.

560
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,200
Young Master Rumu, you wanted to see me?

561
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:09,360
I heard the Demon Realm has been
unstable lately.

562
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:10,760
Yes.

563
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,580
Now that the Soldier has left
our alliance,

564
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,840
and with Quan Jingting's

565
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,840
recent massacre in the Demon Realm,

566
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,810
the situation is indeed unstable.

567
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,040
I'll go with you to subdue the demons.

568
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,200
But the Master said
you still need to recuperate.

569
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:23,930
Lead the way.

570
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,500
Miss Qingtong?

571
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:42,900
Miss Qingtong?

572
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:02,720
Come out.

573
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:07,690
What did you find out?

574
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,680
Your brother has managed
the city flawlessly.

575
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,060
I made no discoveries.

576
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,680
Then,

577
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,360
help me pass a message to Madam Yin.

578
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,200
Tell her

579
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,240
to please help me find out
Young Master Fugui's whereabouts.

580
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,840
Yes, I'll do it right away.

581
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,400
Something must be wrong with this city.

582
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:33,910
Qingcheng appears to
care for me meticulously,

583
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,380
but in reality,

584
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,760
he's locked me up,

585
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,410
depriving me of my freedom.

586
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,160
I need to get out of here
as soon as possible

587
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,520
and find Young Master Fugui.
