00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:45,970
[Sword and Beloved]

2
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,400
[Episode 8]

3
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,510
A sword that's meant to slay demons

4
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,000
has somehow grown warm.

5
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,030
Wangquan Fugui has actually

6
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,190
fallen for a petty little demon.

7
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,430
Feelings make people weak.

8
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,030
Is my clone in the circle ready?

9
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,800
It's ready at any time.

10
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,280
Lady Feng?

11
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,170
Don't look at me like that.

12
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,560
Do you know

13
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,150
my senior will be in trouble
if you stay here?

14
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,350
You have two choices:

15
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,680
die

16
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,400
by my sword,

17
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,140
or leave right now!

18
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm dying anyway.

19
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,080
But there's still

20
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,710
one last thing I need to do.

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,360
I can't leave here yet.

22
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,010
What do you mean?

23
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,880
Lady Feng,

24
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,079
have you been to
the Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai?

25
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,000
Why are you asking that?

26
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,750
Just answer me.

27
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,480
Cut the crap!

28
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,750
I tried to get the antidote
from Madam Yin,

29
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,310
so

30
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,440
I took the Gu poison myself too.

31
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,680
I don't buy it.

32
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,790
You used such a foolish way
to get the antidote?

33
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,680
I'm just

34
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,030
a lowly spider demon.

35
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,360
I couldn't think of a better way.

36
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,030
But…

37
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,280
but I've done

38
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,680
all I could.

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,200
I have no regrets now.

40
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,800
Her spiritual power is heavily depleted,

41
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,170
but the poison in her body
is clearly gone.

42
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,720
Let me see how long you little spider
can keep pretending.

43
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,310
Lady Feng,

44
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,120
how much longer…

45
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,400
how much longer do I have left?

46
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,920
At most,

47
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,950
three days.

48
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,240
Three days?

49
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,390
So soon.

50
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,000
Looks like…

51
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,409
looks like I can't finish my embroidery.

52
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,480
Lady Feng,

53
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,510
have you ever been to
the Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai?

54
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,040
Can you take me there,

55
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,720
Lady Feng?

56
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,159
Let go!

57
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
Why ask that?

58
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,090
Because Young Master Fugui

59
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,560
always wants to know

60
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,090
what that place looks like.

61
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,360
Before I die,

62
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,690
I want to embroider that place for him.

63
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,390
If you take me there,

64
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,750
I can finish it sooner.

65
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,720
Aren't you afraid

66
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,880
I'll drop you mid-flight

67
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,410
and shatter you to pieces?

68
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,920
You won't.

69
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,160
You may be strict,

70
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,560
but you have a soft heart.

71
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,310
Lady Feng,

72
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,750
please, just once, take me there,

73
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,480
will you?

74
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,190
You've been cured of the poison.

75
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,310
Liar!

76
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,760
Don't try to look all pitiful before me.

77
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,720
Humans and demons walk different paths.

78
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,750
If you keep staying here,

79
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,240
you'll only bring my senior trouble.

80
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,950
I'll report you to Master!

81
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,120
Lady Feng.

82
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,310
Lady Feng!

83
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,980
The poison in me

84
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,480
has been neutralized?

85
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,430
This is all
just that little spider's ploy.

86
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,159
Feng Tingyun, don't be fooled.

87
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,510
She's a demon.

88
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,800
Once she's dead,

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,330
Senior Fugui will come back to his senses.

90
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,680
But

91
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,050
he's lived so lonely all his life.

92
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,290
Only lately has he begun to look happy.

93
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,040
Do I really…

94
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,360
have to do this?

95
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,720
Master.

96
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,000
Tingyun?

97
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,200
Why are you here?

98
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,480
You want to see me?

99
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,310
Master.

100
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,840
Is something troubling you?

101
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,510
Why are you hesitating?

102
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,950
That's not like you at all.

103
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,170
You know you can tell me anything.

104
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,680
Tingyun,

105
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,190
you want to see me?

106
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:10,990
Senior Fugui,

107
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,690
do you remember the first time we met?

108
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,160
I was nine.

109
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,000
My village was slaughtered by demons.

110
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,720
You saved me.

111
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,590
Of course I remember.

112
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,140
You rushed into the Palanquin

113
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,510
the moment it landed,

114
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,510
all covered in blood.

115
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,570
I was ridiculous, wasn't I?

116
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:41,750
No.

117
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,159
Not ridiculous at all.

118
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,450
You clearly told me where the demons were.

119
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,520
You were very brave.

120
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,360
Only you would think that way.

121
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,390
I think I fell for you right then.

122
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,490
I followed you every day in secret,

123
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,370
just to watch you practice your sword

124
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,050
and to copy your handwriting.

125
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,240
I dreamed that one day

126
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,720
I'd be as strong as you

127
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,360
and fight by your side.

128
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,750
Senior Fugui,

129
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,430
I know

130
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,510
you don't like me.

131
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,000
But what I don't understand is…

132
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,430
why her?

133
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,600
Why that frail spider demon?

134
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,120
Tingyun,

135
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,240
it's not what you think.

136
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,720
Every life in this world deserves respect.

137
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,720
I just…

138
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,570
didn't want her to be killed like that.

139
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,070
That's not it.

140
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,600
If it were really just about saving her,

141
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,750
if it were only sympathy,

142
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,720
then why didn't you

143
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,630
ever feel the same for me?

144
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,130
If I hadn't felt sympathy for you,

145
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,960
would you even be here now?

146
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,800
Senior Fugui,

147
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,790
I just want to know one thing today.

148
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,270
Do you…

149
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,270
like her?

150
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,310
Senior Fugui,

151
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,000
a demon

152
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,260
will always be a demon.

153
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,510
Humans and demons walk different paths.

154
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,240
Moreover, you're the Soldier.

155
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,330
There's no future between you and her.

156
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,550
I'll handle it

157
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,080
in my own way.

158
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,510
I'm leaving.

159
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,160
Senior Fugui.

160
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,030
Why aren't you ever afraid

161
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,010
I'll go tattling to Master?

162
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,140
Because you're Feng Tingyun.

163
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,640
Your sword essence is

164
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,750
free as the wind

165
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,060
and graceful as drifting clouds.

166
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,000
Master,

167
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,000
I like someone.

168
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,840
But he doesn't like me back.

169
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,000
Then, Tingyun,

170
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,200
how do you plan to handle it?

171
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,790
Let go,

172
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,270
or

173
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,670
keep chasing him?

174
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,630
Yeah.

175
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,610
Whether Senior Fugui likes me or not,

176
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,480
I am Feng Tingyun,

177
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,550
Swordswoman Feng Tingyun.

178
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,910
I walk

179
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,390
my own path.

180
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,680
Young Master Fugui,

181
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,480
I have a question for you.

182
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,670
Go ahead.

183
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,390
You never took the antidote.

184
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,440
You gave it to me.

185
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,600
Right?

186
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,150
Yes.

187
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,350
Then what about your poison?

188
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,250
The poison in my body

189
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,360
has already been neutralized.

190
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,390
You solved the problem yourself

191
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,720
and saved your brother.

192
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,800
Qingtong,

193
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,980
your efforts weren't in vain.

194
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,210
Then, Young Master Fugui,

195
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,000
shouldn't you

196
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,510
reward me with some candy?

197
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,620
I don't have any candy.

198
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,880
Young Master Fugui!

199
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,450
Young Master Fugui,

200
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,030
I like everything

201
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,870
you've done for me.

202
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,390
I'll forever remember

203
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,670
your kindness to me.

204
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,240
I will never forget it.

205

207
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,690
How does it feel
to fail at the finish line?

208
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,620
It's all the Soldier's fault.

209
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,630
Can Madam

210
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,000
help me obtain the Dragon Spine Sword

211
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,330
to wash away this shame?

212
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,150
I want the entire Yiqi Alliance

213
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,910
to kneel before me.

214
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,720
There is a way,

215
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,270
of course.

216
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,000
But once you have the Dragon Spine Sword,

217
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,240
what will you do with it?

218
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,320
I'll make Wangquan Hongye and his son

219
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,670
pay the price.

220
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,080
But what Madam wants
is for Wangquan Fugui

Why did you go to Silk Cave
without approval?

226
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,970
Why didn't you slay the demons there?

227

or harming innocents.

231
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,960
That's fine.

232
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,400
Given how powerful you are,

wiping out the lesser demons in Silk Cave

234
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,160
would've been easy.

235
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,640
Why did you do something unnecessary?

236
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,490
It's said in the Demon Realm

237
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,750
that the Soldier tried to win over
the demons in Silk Cave.

238

-that's…
-I'm asking him!

241
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,530
There were countless demons in Silk Cave

243
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,150

You're willing to damage your reputation

just to protect those demons?

249

There are good and evil demons.

not to show compassion?

Compassion

271
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,450

it's meaningless

That warmth

between good and evil.

And humans and demons aren't so different.

00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,960
If I could wish for one thing,

376
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,510
I'd want

377
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,660
to create a small world
where humans and demons live together.

378

There,

379
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,590
humans and demons can be equal

380
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,110

381
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,370
When that day comes,

382
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,810
Young Master Fugui

383
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,100
will be happy for me, won't he?

384
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,010
Rumu, let's talk about you.

385
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,110
Did you find the person
you were looking for?

386
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:12,880
Me?

387
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,010
I don't have much to say.

388
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,070
Forgot your own dying words

389
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,720
by the river, huh?

390
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,450
"If you ever

391
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,180
meet a dragon demon
with a snowflake gourd,

392
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,530
tell her this for me:

393
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:25,590
Rumu

394
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,400
never once

395
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,680
blamed her."

396
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,350
So cheesy.

397
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,350
No way I said that.

398
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,160
No way.

399
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:35,960
Mm.

400
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:36,920
Indeed.

401
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,830
Fugui, look at that cloud.

402
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,720
Doesn't it look like a dragon?

403
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,350
Nope.

404
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,960
If you talk like this,

405
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,900
we can't chat anymore.

406
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:50,550
Fine. It does.

407
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,400
Okay.

408
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,790
As you know,

409
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,510
my father went to the Western Regions.

410
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,590
For some reason,
he clashed with the dragon clan

411
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,450
and killed a lot of dragon demons.

412
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,790
One day,

413
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,410
a descendant of a dragon demon

414
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,790
kidnapped me.

415
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,400
Pretty lady,

416
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,510
why is this tree

417
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,160
half-dead and half-alive?

418
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,750
Did you tie that bell

419
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,790
on the branch?

420
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:28,960
It looks nice.

421
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,110
Why doesn't it ring, though?

422
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,200
How old are you?

423
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,310
13 years old.

424
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,920
I'm short now,

425
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,760
but my parents are both tall.

426
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,030
I'll be tall too.

427
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,000
Then you should realize

428
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,080
you've been kidnapped.

429
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,200
Yeah, I know.

430
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,590
And I also know you're super powerful.

431
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,320
You could kill me with one slap.

432
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,480
Then why…

433
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,070
Am I

434
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,350
too excited?

435
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,160
Should I be acting

436
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,310
more scared and nervous?

437
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,600
Did you bring that water

438
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,720
for me to drink?

439
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,250
You're talking so much,

440
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,100
so I guess you're not thirsty.

441
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,440
So not only are you pretty,

442
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,960
but you've also got a kind heart.

443
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,890
Just so you know,

444
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,800
if I have an asthma attack later,

445
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,160
don't panic.

446
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,870
It only lasts a little while.

447
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,750
I'll be fine.

448
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,470
Don't be afraid.

449
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,140
She was so unlucky to have kidnapped you.

450
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,070
Exactly.

451
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,750
She was so unlucky.

452
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,280
She kidnapped me

453
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,720
to trade for her mother's dragon scale.

454
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,790
But she didn't know

455
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,680
my father didn't care if I lived or died.

456
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,320
He even wanted to kidnap her.

457
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,510
So,

458
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,350
she took me and ran.

459
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:03,830
And then?

460
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,680
Then I

461
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:08,040
shamelessly followed her around.

462
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,160
She might

463
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,790
look fierce,

464
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,510
but deep down,

465
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,770
she was softer than anyone I had ever met.

466
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,080
Every time I had asthma,

467
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,000
she saved me.

468
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,290
She never said it out loud,

469
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:21,920
but I know—

470
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,420
she cared about me more than anyone else.

471
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,400
And slowly,

472
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,720
I started to have

473
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,240
different feelings for her.

474
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,700
And just like that,

475
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,790
we wandered together

476
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,960
for over ten years.

477
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,200
But how did you practice swordsmanship?

478
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,110
I chased her.

479
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,070
She got annoyed

480
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,020
and hid from me,

481
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,230
so I kept chasing her.

482
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,400
But she was too powerful,
and I couldn't catch up.

483
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,000
So,

484
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,590
I started training.

485
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,070
Unlike you,

486
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,090
I had no sword manuals.

487
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,490
I learned by imitation.

488
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,270
In the desert,

489
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,110
I watched how bugs took flight,

490
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,400
how cacti breathed,

491
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,240
and how lizards walked.

492
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,560
When the demon wind came,

493
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,830
I watched how bugs stayed grounded.

494
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,000
And from that,

495
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,030
I found my sword path.

496
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,000
So your Heart of Sword

497
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:20,170
comes from observing all things.

498
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,720
Half right.

499
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,350
I'll tell you…

500
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,400
the rest someday.

501
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,750
So in the end,

502
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,000
you two still got separated?

503
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,530
Why else do you think

504
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,900
I keep looking for her?

505
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,960
But it's okay.

506
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,630
I'll find her no matter what.

507
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,510
I'm off.

508
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:43,840
All right.

509
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,550
Take care.

510
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,240
Fugui,

511
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,920
the only "impossible" in this world

512
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,720
is the one we place on ourselves.

513
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,750
[Heaven and Earth Hall]

514
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:13,140
[Grand Ambition Soaring to the Heavens]

515
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,200
Good.

516
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,310
You may go now.

517
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,440
Yes.

518
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,160
Master,

519
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:32,200
we've traced the source
of the evil medicine Chakuwa

520
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,510
sold by Xiyun Hall.

521
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:37,960
You have?

522
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,110
Then why do you look

523
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,070
unsettled, Fei?

524
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,380
The people from Xiyun Hall

525
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,960
were nearly all wiped out.

526
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,230
Thanks to Young Master Fugui's advice,

527
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,370
we found the person

528
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,040
who traded with Xiyun Hall.

529
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,750
He said

530
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,110
Chakuwa

531
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,330
was sold to him by a powerful demon.

532
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,640
A powerful demon?

533
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,200
Yes.

534
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,720
Who is it?

535
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,790
This demon was extremely cautious,

536
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,720
using a disguise during the trade.

537
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,950
We couldn't even tell

538
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,680
if it was male or female.

539
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,720
But the middleman

540
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,830
was clever too.

541
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,520
He left a tracking talisman on them

542
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,810
and found out where they were from.

543
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,680
Where?

544
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,650
Peach Village in Dingling Mountain.

545
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,440
That village is in a valley,

546
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,360
still part of
the Yiqi Alliance's territory.

547
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,960
The valley was shrouded
in miasma for years.

548
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,020
No one lived there.

549
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,250
I sent scouts to investigate.

550
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:38,830
They've just

551
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,400
sent word back.

552
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,270
Fei,

553
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,360
what's wrong this time?

554
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,880
Why are you hesitating?

555
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,640
Master,

556
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,680
do you remember Zhang Qi, the Black Sword?

557
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,680
Of course.

558
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,720
He's the heir of Zhang Zheng,
the former master of the Zhang family.

559
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,720
When he was young,

560
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,080
he had great insight.

561
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,550
Back when I lost

562
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,110
my Heart of Sword outside the circle
and returned,

563
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,440
he offered me guidance.

564
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,590
The miasma in that valley
in Dingling Mountain

565
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,720
has been dispelled.

566
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,240
A village has been built there

567
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,200
where humans and demons live together.

568
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,480
And the village chief is Zhang Qi.

569
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:27,840
[Peach Village]

570
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,170
You're back.

571
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,210
Mr. Zhang, you're back.

572
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,000
Yeah.

573
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,190
Mr. Zhang, you're back.

574
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,820
[Zhang Qi, the Black Sword,
master of the Zhang family]

575
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,550
Yeah.

576
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,010
Mr. Zhang, you're back.

577
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,880
Don't mention it.

578
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:43,550
Thank you.

579
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,880
Mr. Zhang, you're back.

580
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,160
Yeah.

581
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,110
Mr. Zhang, you're back!

582
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:52,830
Jiu.

583
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,830
Be careful.

584
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,530
[Jiu, a raccoon dog demon]

585
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,600
You're finally back.

586
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,720
Mr. Zhang, you're back.

587
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,000
Yeah.

588
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,720
Have you eaten yet?

589
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,480
I just made some rice cakes. Have a taste.

590
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:01,750
Thanks!

591
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,350
Nope,

592
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,200
he hasn't eaten.

593
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,960
Give all the food to me.

594
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,220
Give all the food to me.

595
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:08,720
Mr. Zhang,

596
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,720
these are balsam flower seeds.

597
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,520
Lady Qingli is sure to love them.

598
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,350
Thank you.

599
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,160
Give it to me. I'll carry it.

600
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,510
You must be exhausted, Mr. Zhang.

601
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,720
Go get some rest.

602
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,550
Step aside, everyone.

603
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,160
-Let Mr. Zhang go back to rest.
-I'll head up first.

604
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,000
Be careful.

605
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:32,880
[Qingli, a butterfly demon]

606
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,200
Qingli.

607
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,400
Qingli!

608
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,400
Mr. Zhang is back!

609
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,240
Look.

610
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:01,030
Here are lots of rice cakes
made by Granny Shui,

611
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,400
and flower seeds too.

612
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,880
These rice cakes look…

613
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,880
really tasty.

614
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,030
Except for the balsam flower seeds,

615
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,030
the rest is yours.

616
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,440
Really?

617
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,160
Then I won't refuse.

618
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,190
I'll leave you two alone now.

619
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,000
See you.

620
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,480
Qingli.

621
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,480
You've been gone for half a month.

622
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,310
This time,

623
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,440
I can only stay for one night.

624
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,640
I have to leave again tomorrow morning.

625
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:52,720
But don't worry.

626
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:53,720
I've nearly wrapped up

627
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,070
my family affairs.

628
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,400
When I go back this time,

629
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,510
I'll give back the Black Sword

630
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,440
and step down as the family master.

631
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,450
Then I'll never

632
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,640
leave you again.

633
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,400
Really?

634
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,310
When have I ever lied to you?

635
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,400
I'll be back

636
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,950
before the night peach blossoms bloom.

637
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:11,640
Okay.

638
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,030
I'll wait for you.

639
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,880
Young Master Rumu has left?

640
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:29,590
Yeah.

641
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,920
He's actually

642
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,640
a very good person.

643
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,530
Young Master Fugui,

644
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,920
try the peanuts.

645
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,120
They're really good.

646
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,110
If we made them into candy,

647
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,300
it'd be delicious!

648
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,640
What will you do next?

649
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,480
Actually,

650
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:58,270
last night, I overheard your conversation

651
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,880
with Young Master Rumu.

652
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,440
Young Master Fugui…

653
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,800
Young Master.

654
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,890
It's Mr. Fei.

655
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,510
I'll take my leave now.

656
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:16,670
Mr. Fei.

657
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:17,710
How come you didn't bring

658
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,440
a new mission scroll this time?

659
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:23,070
Am I that grim in your eyes?

660
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,360
I don't just bring you new missions.

661
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:26,880
Here—

662
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,480
this is

663
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,840
what you requested.

664
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,840
See if it meets

665
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,969
your requirements.

666
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,770
Thank you, Mr. Fei.

667
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:40,840
This time, I didn't come

668
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,969
to tell you to slay any powerful demon.

669
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,020
But there is

670
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,110
a task.

671
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,400
The evil medicine, Chakuwa,

672
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,659
traced back to Zhang Qi's Peach Village,

673
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,000
but that doesn't mean

674
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,710
Zhang Qi himself made it.

675
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,000
That's true.

676
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,280
But both humans and demons
live in Peach Village.

677
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,740
It's the biggest suspect.

678
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,840
Zhang Qi is the son of Zhang Zheng.

679
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,030
And I believe

680
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,230
you know who Zhang Zheng is.

681
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,230
I do.

682
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,440
He was Father's sworn brother.

683
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,030
Yeah.

684
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,940
He died outside the circle

685
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,480
over 20 years ago.

686
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:23,880
That was

687
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,970
one of Father's deepest regrets.

688
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,400
It's not that Master is

689
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,930
covering for an old friend.

690
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,260
It's just that he and I

691
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:37,320
both know Zhang Qi,
the Black Sword, very well.

692
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,120
He would never

693
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,030
do such a thing.

694
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:41,920
So,

695
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,110
Master wants you

696
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,840
to go to Peach Village

697
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,440
and bring Zhang Qi back.

698
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,550
Understood.

699
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,210
I won't let anything happen to him.

700
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,630
I know,

701
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,320
Master is

702
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,720
too strict with you,

703
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,960
but some pain...

704
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,690
he can only keep it bottled up inside,

705
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,470
unable to say it out loud.

706
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,480
Last night,

707
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,550
he was really upset.

708
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:16,030
I hope this time you'll return in triumph.

709
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,320
Don't…

710
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,030
disappoint him again.

711
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,080
Don't worry, Mr. Fei.

712
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,800
I know who I am.

713
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:31,440
And I know

714
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,220
why I was brought into this world.

715
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,070
Good.

716
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,590
Then I'll take my leave.

717
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,240
Young Master Fugui,

718
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,510
you've got a new mission?

719
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,410
You still haven't answered my question.

720
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,110
Just now, you asked me

721
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,440
what I plan to do next.

722
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,920
Actually,

723
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,870
I haven't figured it all out yet.

724
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:19,770
But for now,

725
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,080
I'll go find my younger brother.

726
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,510
As for the future,

727
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,550
I'm still not sure.

728
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:30,150
Then before you've found your path,

729
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,890
come with me
to Peach Village for the mission.

730
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,280
Lady Feng.

731
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,400
She went out.

732
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,000
Why are you here?

733
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,280
Lady Feng,

734
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,720
I came to bring you some clothes.

735
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,510
Mind your own business.

736
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,280
You're apparently up to no good.

737
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,840
Just get out!

738
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:27,920
Lady Feng,

739
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,320
I made

740
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,550
this new outfit for you by hand.

741
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,960
I hope you like it.

742
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,590
Stop.

743
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,070
This is

744
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,150
a lotus?

745
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:55,030
Yes.

746
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,840
I've gotten over Senior Fugui.

747
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,190
But that doesn't mean

748
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,520
you two can be together.

749
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,250
Don't worry, Lady Feng.

750
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,360
I've already decided to leave.

751
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,280
I won't

752
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:14,880
come back again.

753
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,130
I've thought carefully

754
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,440
about what you said.

755
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,880
My staying here would indeed

756
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,280
cause Young Master Fugui trouble.

757
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:22,960
Lady Feng,

758
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,280
please,

759
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,440
stay well.

760
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,450
Take good care of yourself.

761
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,440
I'm leaving.

762
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:38,800
Qingtong.

763
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,280
If only you weren't

764
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:45,840
a demon.

765
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,090
But if I weren't a demon,

766
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:56,670
maybe I never
would've met Young Master Fugui.

767
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,360
Am I right?

768
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,300
In this world,
only power commands respect.

769
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,630
Only if I find the Dragon Spine Sword

770
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,110
can I crush the entire Wangquan family

771
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,480
beneath me.

772
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,070
Master, your courage is unmatched.

773
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,360
You're one in a million.

774
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,690
You mustn't give up now.

775
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,320
Lu,

776
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,280
I know

777
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:45,150
you followed me
into the Sword Tomb willingly.

778
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,900
That unfilial son of mine…

779
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,550
he'd rather see me dead.

780
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,320
Only you…

781
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:59,400
are truly loyal to me.

782
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,920
I will definitely help you

783
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,360
make it out alive.

784
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,070
Then serve me

785
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:16,110
with your whole heart, will you?

786
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,590
The Black Fox was right—

787
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,360
a true dragon craves blood.

788
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,550
You want blood?

789
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,200
I'll give you blood.

790
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:21,510
Wangquan Hongye,

791
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,070
I don't believe

792
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:26,360
I'll keep losing to you.

793
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,670
Quan Jingting,

794
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,880
your powers are gone.

795
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,800
Are you ready for the Dragon Sigh Sword

796
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,150
to enter your body

797
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:46,670
and penetrate your tendons?

798
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,880
It'll be a long and painful process.

799
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,400
You'll slowly become
half-human and half-demon.

800
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Those who stand in my way have to die.

801
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:59,320
Those who hold me back
have to be abandoned.

802
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:02,320
Do it now!

803
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,070
Remember your promise:

804
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,840
when the time is right,

805
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,760
push the Soldier

806
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:11,320
into darkness.

807
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:25,800
Raise the Palanquin.

808
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,190
We set off for Peach Village
in Dingling Mountain.
