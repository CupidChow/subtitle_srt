00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,979
[Sword and Beloved]

2
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,590
[Episode 14]

3
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:53,759
Look.

4
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:56,990
What a beautiful fish-shaped lantern.

5
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,259
Before today,

6
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,850
I never thought that besides sword skills,

7
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,850
I could actually
learn to make fish-shaped lanterns.

8
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,330
Yeah.

9
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,670
In fact, Young Master Fugui,

10
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,400
you've really changed.

11
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,080
At least, you smile more often

12
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,310
now.

13
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,800
I finally found you,

14
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,310
Soldier.

15
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,630
Take care.

16
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,470
Are you Quan Rumu,

17
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,520
the man
who's been looking for a dragon demon?

18
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,030
What?

19
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,670
Don't I look like it?

20
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,160
I'm indebted to Mr. Lei
from the Western Regions.

21
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,730
Since he personally asked me to help you,

22
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,660
I'll definitely render aid to you.

23
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,120
However,

24
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,590
you look like a weak scholar.

25
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,170
You don't seem like a friend of Mr. Lei's.

26
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,000
My friend,

27
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,410
you can't judge people

28
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,630
only by their looks.

29
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,780
Take you as an example.

30
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,610
Despite that stubbly beard,

31
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,610
I bet you're a female demon

32
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,410
in disguise of a man
in order to protect yourself.

33
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,480
Members of the All-Hear Sect,
including you,

34
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,840
have profound knowledge.

35
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,000
How can you not know
what I, Quan Rumu, look like?

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,430
Now, do I seem like

37
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:27,780
a friend of Mr. Lei's?

38
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,680
Long Weiyun last showed up

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,260
in Dingling Mountain.

40
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,310
Then, she disappeared.

41
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,310
No one has seen her ever since.

42
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,920
The right kind of demon power.

43
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,590
It's her.

44
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,310
As a human,

45
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,030
why are you so persistently

46
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,560
looking for a dragon demon?

47
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,770
Thank you for the information.

48
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,680
Goodbye.

49
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,840
Is he really that crazy man
who rose to fame

50
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,240
with a sword strike
in the Western Regions?

51
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,720
How come he's not intimidating at all?

52
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,430
Quan Rumu,

53
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,930
you haven't found Weiyun yet.

54
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,100
No matter what,

55
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,670
you must make it through.

56
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,280
[Gukui, Black Fox Junior]

57
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,560
Soldier,

58
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,160
how did it feel to have your heart
pierced by 10 thousand swords?

59
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,360
My name is Gukui.

60
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,680
I'm a clone
of Madam Black Fox in the circle.

61
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,240
Madam sent me here

62
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,240
because she feels very sorry
for what happened to you.

63
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,310
You've made great contributions
to Yiqi Alliance

64
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,270
only to

65
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,390
end up like this.

66
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,830
Now, demons hate you.

67
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,190
Humans also hate you.

68
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,159
Is it truly worthwhile for you

69
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:36,220
to protect this world of hypocrites?

70
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,480
Why not

71
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,830
join Madam's team?

72
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,860
As long as
you help Madam out of the circle

73
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,920
with an Earth-and-Heaven Strike,

74
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,800
the order of the world will be rebuilt.

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,060
When that happens,

76
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,430
Madam and you
will both be the rulers of this world.

77
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,040
All the humans and demons that hate you

78
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,170
will have to submit themselves to you.

79
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,240
This...

80
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,310
is what what's truly meant for you,
Wangquan Fugui.

81
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,970
Absorbing hatred
to control someone's mind...

82
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,390
Is this the power of the Black Fox?

83
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,030
Making me leave the mountain

84
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,830
and sowing hatred in my heart...

85
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,040
All that was part of your plan, right?

86
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,070
Why?

87
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,960
Why isn't there hatred
in your heart at all?

88
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,070
You've been slandered,

89
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,870
betrayed,

90
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,560
and had your heart pierced
by 10 thousand swords.

91
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,480
Why isn't there resentment in you?

92
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,390
I, Wanggquan Fugui, will never
surrender myself to anyone's control.

93
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,990
Want to get out of the circle?

94
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,500
Dream on.

95
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,070
You're not harboring any hatred

96
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,720
because you're not

97
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,630
in complete despair yet!

98
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,360
Sooner or later,

99
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,040
you will take our side.

100
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,630
I'll be waiting for you at the extremity

101
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,510
of hatred!

102
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,560
The Black Fox...

103
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,400
Young Master Fugui.

104
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,090
It's time to eat.

105
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,160
I spent a long time cooking this porridge.

106
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,120
Young Master Fugui,

107
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,320
eat it while it's hot.

108
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,160
You too.

109
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,600
Okay.

110
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,560
Young Master Fugui,

111
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,950
from now on,

112
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,750
please stay in the house for repercussion.

113
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,280
Don't go to the brook again.

114
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,600
It's too cold there.

115
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,600
Okay.

116
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,040
I know

117
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,270
you don't want me to see your wounds.

118
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,870
As it happens,

119
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,159
the house

120
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,680
needs to be furnished.

121
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,120
I'll go out later,

122
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,900
while you heal yourself here.

123
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,600
Oh, right.

124
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,800
I bought this for you at the market.

125
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,780
They said this candy is sweet.

126
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,159
You may have a try.

127
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:07,450
[grocery]

128
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,290
Sir,

129
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,650
are you here
for medical advice or medicine?

130
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,950
Do you have the Reviving Powder?

131
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,160
If not, find some for me.

132
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,560
I'll pay big money for it.

133
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,430
I want it soon.

134
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,970
The Reviving Powder

135
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,840
must be used with caution.

136
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,840
Such a potent drug is usually taken
by those who want to see their families

137
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,150
for one last time
after their meridians have all been broken

138
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,360
on the battlefield.

139
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,750
It could shorten your life.

140
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,670
I need to take it

141
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,200
also because I want to see my family

142
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,480
for one last time.

143
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,680
No need to observe me.

144
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,080
My meridians are all ruined.

145
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,360
Sir,

146
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,150
young though you look,

147
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,080
you've used the Reviving Power
more than once, right?

148
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,840
Just get me the medicine.

149
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,600
I'll be waiting for it in the log cabin
on the mountain.

150
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,410
Such powder comes from the Demon Realm.

151
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,200
Please

152
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,720
pass on the message there.

153
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,630
Okay.

154
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,230
I'll put the word out right away.

155
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,120
I've bought many things today.

156
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,080
When I'm back,

157
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,140
I'll cook much nutritious food
for Young Master Fugui.

158
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,580
As long as you
help Madam out of the circle

159
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,630
with a Heaven-and-Earth Strike,

160
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,390
the order of the world will be rebuilt.

161
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,440
This...

162
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,720
is what's truly meant for you,
Wangquan Fugui.

163
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,680
I'm the Black Fox's target.

164
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,530
I must restore my power
as soon as possible.

165
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,790
Why am I still having an odd feeling?

166
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,390
Mistress?

167
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,840
You traitor,

168
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,350
stop calling me that!

169
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,510
Today,
I'm here to kill you and the Soldier.

170
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,690
Young Master Fugui has prepared for this.

171
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,880
Mistress, I suggest

172
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,050
you leave as soon as possible.

173
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,150
You think I'd believe your lies?

174
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,110
You inferior No.12580.

175
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,550
I'm not inferior.

176
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,290
I have a name now.

177
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,240
It's "Qingtong."

178
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,840
When the Soldier named you that,

179
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,100
had he seen the spider's nest
you were born into?

180
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,750
Had he realized
how much dirty mud and water

181
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,670
you gulped down for survival?

182
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,750
Had he known
how you servilely begged for mercy

183
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,480
when you worked undercover

184
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,630
in Chuanshu?

185
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,630
I didn't servilely beg for mercy.

186
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,840
You're defending the Soldier

187
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,080
only to break free of your lowly station

188
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,320
and to leech off him.

189
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,430
It's not true!

190
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,690
Of course you wouldn't think it that way,

191
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,680
because you're even lying to yourself.

192
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,550
Ask yourself.

193
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,550
If he were just a rustic,

194
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,440
would you risk your life for him?

195
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,900
You wouldn't!

196
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:38,440
Qingtong...

197
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,730
You just took a human form not long ago.

198
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,080
I advise you not to act recklessly.

199
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,830
If you dare to stand in my way again,

200
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,000
I'll send you to hell right away!

201
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,150
Even if I have to die here today,

202
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,750
I won't let you get through!

203
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,480
I hate hypocrites most.

204
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,180
After destroying someone else's happiness,

205
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,710
you're here acting like
you're fully devoted to your loved one.

206
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,720
Save your breath.

207
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,410
As long as you step aside

208
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,960
admit you're faking
your affection for the Soldier,

209
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,490
and humbly beg for my mercy,

210
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,000
I'll spare your life.

211
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,010
Young Master Fugui hasn't recovered yet.

212
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,880
I'm afraid he's no match for her.

213
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,510
I must keep her here today,

214
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,410
even at the expense of my life.

215
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:52,000
You're actually attempting to explode
your demon core for the Soldier?

216
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,750
Not a chance!

217
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,790
Young Master Fugui!

218
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,750
Wangquan Fugui,

219
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,790
you're indeed severely injured,
and your power is weakened.

220
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,550
Very good.

221
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,400
I'll send you to the nether world

222
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,800
to meet my late husband!

223
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,070
We're trapped.

224
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,240
What should we do?

225
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,780
Hold your breath and concentrate.

226
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,380
Do as I say and break through.

227
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:44,900
Break!

228
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,390
How are you?

229
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,390
I'm fine.

230
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,600
Young Master Fugui,

231
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,530
are you alright?

232
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,360
I'm fine.

233
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,790
How ridiculous.

234
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,480
The mighty Soldier

235
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,440
has actually

236
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,150
reduced himself to protecting
an inferior little demon, a slave.

237
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,320
No.12580,

238
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,030
good for you.

239
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,330
Young Master Fugui!

240
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,910
Let me say this again.

241
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,240
Her name is not No.12580.

242
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,400
And she's by no means inferior.

243
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,360
Stop bluffing.

244
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,720
What can you do to me,

245
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,640
given your current condition?

246
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:52,910
Today,

247
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,960
I'll kill her in front of you,

248
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:58,360
so that you can feel the pain
of losing a loved one.

249
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,950
As long as
I have a nice sword in my hands,

250
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,000
nobody can hurt her.

251
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,720
Now that you've left the Wangquan Manor,

252
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,480
how would you get hold of a nice sword?

253
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,320
Can you

254
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,390
create a sword out of thin air?

255
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,010
How is it possible?

256
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,570
Your power is clearly weak.

257
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,600
Why are you still able to
harness the Purest Sun Flame?

258
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,480
Although my power is weak,

259
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,790
I'm still alive.

260
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,880
And I'm the Soldier

261
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,080
that you and your fellows fear most!

262
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,080
You actually forged a sword
by burning your life for her?

263
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,610
Since you have a death wish,

264
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,180
I might as well grant it!

265
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,000
Young Master Fugui!

266
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,570
Yes.

267
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,550
My love,

268
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,200
I failed to take revenge

269
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,960
on Wangquan Fugui for you.

270
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,830
I'm coming to meet you
in the nether world now.

271
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,640
Kill me.

272
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,650
When did my father kill your husband?

273
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,350
Your husband's name
isn't on the list of the demons

274
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,080
slayed by the Wangquan family.

275
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,160
Years ago, my husband

276
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:07,440
was killed by your father Wangquan Hongye.

277
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,830
I saw it with my own eyes.

278
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,000
After my husband
exploded his own golden core,

279
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,590
he lied to me

280
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,240
that he'd survive.

281
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,110
His words turned out to be a fib!

282
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,240
I must make the Wangquan family

283
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,030
pay a price!

284
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,540
I have a question.

285
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,550
When a spider senses danger,

286
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,600
would it enter a state
of suspended animation?

287
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,240
So what if it would?

288
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,830
It means that golden-core spider demon

289
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,400
would appear to be dead
in the past 20-odd years

290
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,660
after losing all his cultivation power.

291
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,350
Being blinded by hatred,

292
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,480
you certainly wouldn't think of that.

293
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,350
You...

294
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:55,510
You...

295
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,220
You're saying...

296
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,880
my husband is still alive?

297
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,030
Fortunately, you didn't throw away

298
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,240
this golden crown.

299
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,200
I'll lift the seal on your husband now.

300
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,730
Then you'll know the truth.

301
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,200
My love...

302
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,720
You punk,

303
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,510
I suffered so much because of you!

304
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:50,930
Soldier,

305
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,510
I apologize

306
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,170
for all my wrongdoing.

307
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,940
I'm ready to be punished.

308
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,000
Take my life...

309
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,630
as you please, Soldier.

310
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,960
I only hope

311
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,610
that you can spare my husband's life.

312
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,780
Your life as a demon

313
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,600
shouldn't be restricted to these things.

314
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,380
Your husband just woke up.

315
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,940
Take good care of him.

316
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,930
Live your life to the fullest.

317
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,160
You may leave now.

318
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,150
But remember, don't do evil again

319
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,800
in the future.

320
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,720
Soldier,

321
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,750
my husband and I owe you a huge favor.

322
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,010
If you ever need help,

323
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,350
just let that little spider...

324
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:53,260
I mean Qingtong,

325
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,500
send a message to the Silk Cave.

326
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,560
Qingtong,

327
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,970
your journey with the Soldier

328
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,600
is destined to be rough,

329
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,240
but also wonderful.

330
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,920
Anyway,

331
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,260
I wish you all the best.

332
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:47,920
Qingtong.

333
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:52,730
Why did you attempt to
explode your demon core?

334
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,030
I...

335
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,030
If I'm gone

336
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,880
one day,

337
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,510
will you wait for me

338
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,770
just like how Madam Yin

339
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,160
waited for her husband?

340
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,340
We promised to journey together.

341
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,530
No matter what happens,

342
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,640
I'll wait for you.

343
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,550
Okay.

344
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,590
It's a deal.

345
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,590
We'll journey together from now on.

346
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,070
Okay.

347
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,680
Don't worry.

348
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,200
From now on,

349
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,190
I’ll grow stronger—strong enough

350
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,140

How dare you mention the Soldier to me?

447
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,640
The Soldier was hit by countless arrows

448
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,590
and expelled from Wangquan Manor.

449
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,200

Young Mistress of the Qingmu Family]

Ever since Young Master Fugui
went down the mountain,

453
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,830
demon kings everywhere have been

454
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,560

and causing chaos.

to assist?

460
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,860
Except for the Li Family of Peach Garden,
only a few responded.

461
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,590
Lately,
these prestigious  families' attitudes

462
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,050
have become very strange.

463
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,880
When Young Master Fugui was around,

464

not even blindness,

Keep a close eye on him for me.

484
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,350

502
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:26,730
Quan Jingting,

503
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,720
instead of reflecting on yourself
in the Sword Tomb,

504
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,550
you came here to stir up trouble!

505
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,440
There's no funeral in the family.

506
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,500
Why are you wearing

507
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,110
that mourning band?

508
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,500
This mourning band

509
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,680

00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,830
watch your words and actions.

513
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,550
My patience

514
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,310
has its limits.

515
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,720
Master,

516
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,790
I was born in the greatest
prestigious family in the world

517
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,590
and have always been loyal to it.

518
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,490
Yet Wangquan Hongye banished me
from the family

519
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,110
over a trivial matter,

520
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,440
stripped me of my family name,

521
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,500
and exiled me
to the Western Regions.

522
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,160
Even so,

523
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:19,510
I've always been defending
the Wangquan family.

524
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,310
In life or death,

525
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:23,110
I am a Wangquan.

526
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,720
But recently,

527
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,750
during my cultivation in the Sword Tomb,

528
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,000
I finally realized

529
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,470
that if I keep hiding the truth
for the sake of family ties

530
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,750
and self-interest,

531
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,720
the spirits of our heroic ancestors

532
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,310
and the wronged souls who died

533
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,570
will never forgive me.

534
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,640
So I came here today

535
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,030
to expose my own kin to uphold justice,

536
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,090
and to tell everyone in Yiqi Alliance

537
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:50,150
that the so-called Black Fox
beyond the circle

538
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,030
was nothing but a lie

539
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,830
fabricated by Wangquan Hongye.

540
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,160
Quan Jingting!

541
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,330
Do you know what you're talking about?

542
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,720
Of course I do.

543
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,310
Over 20 years ago, your father,

544
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:09,200
Wangquan Shouzhuo, lost control
while practicing swordsmanship,

545
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,480
putting Wangquan Manor
on the brink of collapse.

546
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,240
Seeing the family about to fall,

547
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,200
you made up a lie about a Black Fox

548
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,730
beyond the circle
bringing doom to the world.

549
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,670
Your purpose

550
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,790
was to make everyone believe you,
obey you,

551
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,880
and fight against an enemy
that never even existed!

552
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,110
Nonsense!

553
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:23,920
Guards!

554
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:24,720
Wangquan Hongye!

555
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,200
Yes!

556
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,930
You want to rule over everything!

557
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:31,050
But there are still people
who see the truth.

558
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,690
You used that lie as bait,

559
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,400
luring the young masters of every family

560
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,720
to follow you beyond the circle
on a dangerous quest,

561
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,580
slaying the so-called Black Fox.

562
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,080
And what was the result?

563
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,550
Look at the names on it.

564
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:46,790
Look.

565
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,880
Look at the names on it!

566
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,510
The young masters and elites
of every prestigious family,

567
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,200
and even your own sister,

568
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,960
Wangquan Zui,

569
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,610
all died beyond the so-called circle.

570
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,880
Quan Jingting,

571
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,590
are you crazy?

572
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:02,750
Zui

573
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,520
was my dearest sister.

574
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,270
Without sacrifice,

575
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,250
how could your lie be convincing?

576
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:15,150
Yet my innocent cousin Zui
ended up as nothing

577
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,720
more than a pawn in your grand ambition.

578
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,720
Quan Jingting!

579
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,160
Masters,

580
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,790
I came here today

581
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,710
not expecting to leave alive.

582
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,830
But can you...

583
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,780
really just stand by and watch him

584
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,880
cover up the truth
and silence those who speak it?

585
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,420
Well...

586
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,270
It's...

587
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,160
It's a lie?

588
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,680
What should we do?

589
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,960
How could it be?

590
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,640
There's no Black Fox?

591
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,000
It's all a lie?

592
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,160
There's no such thing as a Black Fox?

593
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,360
He's been deceiving us all these years?

594
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,500
Who has seen it?

595
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,920
No one has seen the Black Fox.

596
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,360
Yes.

597
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,110
No one.

598
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,670
The Black Fox doesn't even exist.

599
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,190
-He's been deceiving us all these years.
-Hongye's been deceiving us all these years?

600
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:14,920
He lied to us!

601
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:15,760
Masters,

602
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,699
many years ago,

603
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,860
I, Wangquan Hongye, did fail you.

604
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,070
But back then,

605
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,739
my brothers and sisters and I
fought the Black Fox

606
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:24,070
with everything we had,

607
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,360
and they died a heroic death.

608
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,960
Though I survived,

609
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,050
every day since has been agony.

610
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,480
I did my best

611
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:34,150
to take care of you.

612
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,030
And now you would let yourselves

613
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:43,150
be swayed by the words
of that despicable man, Quan Jingting?

614
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,440
Your so-called "care"—

615
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,250
is that when the Zhang family
has a talent like Zhang Qi,

616
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:51,980
you sent the Soldier to Peach Village
to have him killed?

617
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,510
Quan Jingting,

618
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,840
watch your tongue!

619
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,250
When Master sent the Soldier,

620
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,140
he repeatedly instructed him

621
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,280
to bring Zhang Qi back alive!

622
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,840
But he's dead now.

623
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,110
They can say

624
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:08,110
whatever they want.

625
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,800
What about you? With all your accusations,

626
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,710
do you even have proof?

627
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:11,480
Proof?

628
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,510
You want proof?

629
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,360
Alright.

630
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,150
Today,

631
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:20,190
I'll show you the proof.

632
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,880
Master Tianmen has arrived!

633
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:36,420
[Tianmen Wenlu,
Descendant of Taoist Tianmen]

634
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,670
I am Tianmen Wenlu,

635
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,530
son of the Taoist Tianmen.

636
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,150
Greetings, everyone.

637
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,960
Tianmen, there's no need for formality.

638
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,760
Let me ask you.

639
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,070
Over 20 years ago,

640
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,030
was it true as the rumor
in the martial world

641
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:48,840
that Wangquan Hongye led a group
across Heavenly Gate,

642
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,670
which your father guarded,

643
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,110
into the so-called world
beyond the circle?

644
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:54,670
Yes.

645
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,300
Eight people went out
and only two returned,

646
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:58,920
leaving

647
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,000
many dead there,

648
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,030
right?

649
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:02,960
Yes.

650
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,020
Over 20 years ago,

651
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,760
did Chief Wangquan claim

652
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,020
that everything he did

653
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,920
was to slay the Black Fox

654
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,440
and bring an end

655
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,640
to the Eternal Night?

656
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,000
No!

657
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,850
Before they went beyond the circle,

658
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,910
the Chief came to Heavenly Gate,

659
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,150
threatening and bribing my father

660
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,410
into setting up a Mind-losing Formation

661
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:36,190
in that so-called world beyond the circle.

662
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,920
That Mind-losing Formation

663
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,780
drove the young masters mad,

664
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,760
making them turn on and kill each other.

665
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,110
The so-called Black Fox

666
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,390
never existed at all!

667
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,150
It's been so many years.

668
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,550
We don't even know
what happened back then.

669
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,920
Tianmen,

670
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,960
do you know what you are talking about?

671
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,320
Of course I do.

672
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,480
I have evidence.

673
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,590
This

674
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,530
is a Mind-losing Talisman,

675
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,710
written in blood by the Chief himself

676
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,030
over 20 years ago.

677
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,230
There were seven of these talismans
in total.

678
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,280
Together,
they can form the Mind-losing Formation,

679
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,190
which can make people turn against
and kill each other—

680
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,510
but they won't harm

681
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,180
the one who created it.

682
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,290
The Mus are masters
of talisman arts.

683
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,370
Master Mu, please take a look.

684
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,790
This is indeed a Mind-losing Talisman.

685
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,590
Everyone, take a step back.

686
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,890
[Exterminate All Demons]

687
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,510
A blood spell

688
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,320
only protects its owner.

689
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,050
It truly was written

690
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:19,870
in the Chief's blood.

691
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,320
This is a frame-up!

692
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,670
A frame-up?

693
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,630
If it wasn't his blood,

694
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,110
who would have used it 20 years ago

695
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,810
to frame him?

696
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,510
If you weren't the mastermind,

697
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,760
why were you the only one who came back?

698
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,670
The Black Fox...

699
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:37,760
Quan Jingting,

700
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,110
you two are in league!

701
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,710
Listen, everyone.

702
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:44,710
Our Chief

703
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,960
is lying again.

704
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,630
But today,

705
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,990
no one will believe you anymore.

706
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:52,880
You...

707
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,280
are the one full of lies,

708
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,070
framing and slandering others!

709
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:58,670
Everyone,

710
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,380
please ask yourselves honestly

711
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,940
what kind of man Master truly is

712
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,150
and how much he has done
for Yiqi Alliance over the years.

713
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,950
And what sort of treacherous man

714
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,440
is Quan Jingting?

715
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,240
My father, Taoist Tianmen,

716
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,360
was a hero his whole life.

717
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,710
Since he was coerced by Wangquan Hongye,

718
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,530
he was haunted by his conscience

719
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,360
and died in depression.

720
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,110
Today,

721
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:42,990
I'll clear my father's name with my blood!

722
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,280
Tianmen!

723
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,400
Tianmen Wenlu

724
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,550
proved the truth
of his words with his life!

725
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,590
Brothers, let's go!

726
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,320
Fei!

727
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,480
Stop!

728
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,280
Quan Jingting,

729
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,320
today it is not that I,
Wangquan Hongye, cannot fight,

730
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,070
but that I cannot bear
to see the people of Yiqi Alliance

731
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,400
slaughter each other.

732
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,110
Tingyun.

733
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:33,760
Master!

734
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,810
Drop your sword!

735
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,400
Cousin,

736
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,630
I won't let you die so easily.
