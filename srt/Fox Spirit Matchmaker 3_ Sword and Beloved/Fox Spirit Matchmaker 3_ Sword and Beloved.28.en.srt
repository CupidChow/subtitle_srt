00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,950
[Sword and Beloved]

2
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,460
[Episode 28]

3
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,479
Qingtong is Wangquan Fugui's
only weakness.

4
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,400
He and those fools from Yiqi Alliance

5
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,040
will all be trapped in my scheme,

6
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,080
too busy
to bother with the Western Regions.

7
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,920
This plan may be risky,

8
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,800
but I must say

9
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,800
it's a brilliant move.

10
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,320
Relax.

11
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,160
I'd already set everything in motion
before I left.

12
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,760
Everything is still under my control.

13
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,680
Master,

14
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,800
the 3 kids from the Dragon Clan

15
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,329
have been safely sent back.

16
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,160
I'm afraid

17
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,010
this isn't over yet.

18
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,880
Send people

19
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,320
to investigate
the Dream Formation immediately

20
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,280
and find out

21
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,760
who's behind it.

22
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,080
Yes.

23
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,490
Everything about this feels strange.

24
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,930
When Weiyun wakes up, I need to ask her.

25
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,480
For now, the top priority

26
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,079
is to send word to my brother.

27
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,960
Don't worry, Royal Master.

28
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,490
They can't escape forever.

29
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,520
It's okay.

30
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,660
Your tone is quite similar

31
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,880
to the Celestial Master's.

32
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,760
Fugui,

33
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,960
something's happened
in the Western Regions.

34
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,720
A woman with a golden serpent-bone scepter

35
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,840
who can control minds

36
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,120
has been capturing people for sacrifice.

37
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,050
Even Long Weiyun was caught by her.

38
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,210
But don't worry.

39
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,900
I've already rescued her.

40
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,900
I'll keep investigating.

41
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,160
I'll let you know immediately

42
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,360
if I get any new leads.

43
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,360
A serpent-bone scepter?

44
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,880
Mind control?

45
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,600
I once read the secret histories
of the Western Regions in your house.

46
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,600
They mentioned a scepter like that.

47
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,380
It was said to belong to

48
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,260
the queen of Qianxia Kingdom.

49
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,520
Qianxia Kingdom?

50
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,360
Didn't Qianxia Kingdom perish long ago?

51
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,159
That's right.

52
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,960
A thousand years ago,

53
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,140
it was indeed destroyed
because of the Dragon Clan.

54
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,940
Why did it suddenly reappear?

55
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,159
Yunfei,

56
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,840
go investigate this thoroughly

57
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,760
with Rumu.

58
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,080
If I leave,

59
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,060
what about you?

60
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,360
This

61
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,580
must have something to do
with the Black Fox.

62
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,000
Don't worry.

63
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,120
I can go to Qianji City alone.

64
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,680
Let's stay in touch.

65
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:23,800
Sister.

66
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,860
You finally came to see me.

67
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,290
Did you think of a way to save me?

68
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,220
Qingcheng,

69
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,880
I can let you go,

70
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,010
but you must abandon
the Black Fox inside you.

71
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,280
I need the Black Fox's power

72
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,930
to keep that Soldier away from you.

73
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,680
Even now,

74
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,780
you still show no remorse.

75
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,520
Why should I feel remorse for anything?

76
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,680
Seeing you turn against that Soldier
because of me

77
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,960
made me so happy.

78
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,960
Enough nonsense!

79
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,480
Get out

80
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,560
of my brother's body.

81
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,960
The power of the tree seed

82
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,960
can actually hurt the Black Fox?

83
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,560
It hurts.

84
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,260
You have power strong enough
to threaten me?

85
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,520
But it's useless.

86
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,720
As long as I'm in his body,

87
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,560
you can't do anything to me

88
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,400
without hurting him.

89
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,520
Qingcheng needs me.

90
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,000
He needs my power.

91
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,360
Look at you.

92
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,880
You're full of contradictions.

93
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,960
Your power shares the same origin as ours,

94
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,700
yet you don't feed on the Power of Hatred.

95
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:58,040
Why don't you side with the Madam?

96
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,160
She'll help you

97
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,320
gain the supreme Power of Hatred.

98
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,040
Think about it.

99
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,860
After all, even if you kill your brother,

100
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,280
you can't do anything to me.

101
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,680
Fine.

102
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,780
Since that's the case,

103
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,200
I'll trap you

104
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,840
in Qianji City forever,

105
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,180
so you'll never be able to accomplish

106
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,400
what you want to do.

107
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,840
Qingtong!

108
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:43,230
[Li]

109
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,280
Boss,

110
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,120
this Poor Dog...

111
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,520
Before they got married,

112
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,760
he came by

113
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,840
every day.

114
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,000
But ever since he got married,

115
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,480
we haven't even seen him.

116
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,010
Do you think they...

117
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,280
I'm telling you, they're doing just fine.

118
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,610
Maybe they just went out on some business.

119
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,720
How do you know everything?

120
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,920
What's that question?

121
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,520
Without me,
they wouldn't even be together.

122
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,600
I'm telling you, Poor Dog

123
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,400
should be thanking me right now.

124
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,520
Thank you.

125
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,570
You're welcome.

126
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,420
Poor Dog...

127
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,320
No.

128
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,880
Young Master Yunfei.

129
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,920
You must be tired from the journey.

130
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,560
Let me.

131
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,280
No need.

132
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,040
This is a gift I brought for Xueyang.

133
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,620
There are some for you too.

134
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,320
Alright.

135
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,140
How do you feel?

136
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,039
Nothing.

137
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,520
What is this?

138
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,580
It's called a facial mask.

139
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,560
It's a gift I bought for Xueyang.

140
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,160
You bought it for General?

141
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,280
Then why did you apply it on our face?

142
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:49,920
Yeah.

143
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,020
I've got to test it first, don't I?

144
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,880
What if my Xueyang

145
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
is allergic to it?

146
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,920
That makes sense.

147
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,720
That makes sense.

148
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,250
We don't need faces anyway.

149
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,960
Don't say that.

150
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,320
Here, let me put on some more.

151
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,790
More, more.

152
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,000
Here.

153
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,160
-Here too.
-Here.

154
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,220
What are you doing?

155
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:12,920
General.

156
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,600
What is this?

157
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,120
Boss, I'm Zhao.

158
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,120
I'm Xiang.

159
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,720
What's that on your faces?

160
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm doing an experiment.

161
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,200
I bought you a facial mask.

162
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,280
It's good for your skin.

163
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,120
Very good.

164
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,720
Very good.

165
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,130
I missed you so much.

166
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,800
I'm glad you're back.

167
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,120
I missed you so much.

168
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,450
Let me take a look at you.

169
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,840
You've lost weight.

170
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,380
And you got tanned.

171
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,040
Young Master.

172
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,800
I look better darker.

173
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,200
Young Master? Young Master?

174
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,920
Do you still need us?

175
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,480
I...

176
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What do you think?

177
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:46,960
Got it.

178
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,000
Let's go.

179
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,560
Xueyang,

180
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,040
I picked all of these especially for you.

181
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,350
What do you think?

182
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,320
Do you like them?

183
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,200
Yes.

184
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,040
Oh, right.

185
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,480
There's...

186
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,080
this one.

187
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,920
This lip balm is from Xifang Studio.

188
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,240
It's hard to buy.

189
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,880
Smell it.

190
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,090
Smells good.

191
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,520
Let me

192
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,760
put some on you.

193
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,520
Okay.

194
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,880
Pretty?

195
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,360
Yes.

196
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,200
Beautiful.

197
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,080
How did the mission go this time?

198
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,840
Perfectly.

199
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,180
I helped the Master find his wife.

200
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,080
Really?

201
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:51,840
Yes.

202
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,560
Amazing, right?

203
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,280
My Poor Dog never lets me down.

204
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,200
Since I did such a great job,

205
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,130
don't you think I deserve a reward?

206
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,130
What kind of reward do you want?

207
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,360
I've been talking for so long

208
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,080
that my lips are a little dry.

209
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,800
Well...

210
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,810
Since you've found Miss Qingtong,

211
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,880
why didn't they come back together?

212
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,120
Master sent me back

213
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,200
to investigate a woman

214
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,880
with a serpent-bone scepter.

215
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,160
A serpent-bone scepter?

216
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,900
Golden, inlaid with a gem?

217
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,370
You've seen her?

218
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,280
I met someone like that a few days ago

219
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,320
during a patrol.

220
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,150
She was very similar to your description,

221
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,480
but I didn't get a clear look

222
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,520
at her face.

223
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,420
I only saw a golden scepter

224
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,600
with a gemstone in her hand.

225
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,920
Who is she?

226
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,280
I've never seen her before.

227
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:21,840
Boss,

228
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,250
her name's Gulizan.

229
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,200
She's the leader

230
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,360
of a newly founded sect

231
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,880
in the Western Regions.

232
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,040
I heard she's fabulously wealthy,

233
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,000
and lately she's been spending a fortune

234
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,530
recruiting disciples
to establish her sect.

235
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,320
Send someone to keep an eye on her.

236
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,980
I want to know her background.

237
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,680
Yes.

238
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,960
So according to you,

239
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,640
the person Master asked me
to keep an eye on

240
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,700
should be Gulizan.

241
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,280
What's going on with her?

242
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,520
I don't know the details.

243
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,080
I only know she's connected

244
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,140
to the recent demon disappearances.

245
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,400
Master

246
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,400
suspects it has something to do
with the Black Fox.

247
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,060
Alright...

248
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,080
Zhao.

249
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,440
Yes.

250
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,290
General, what is it?

251
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,280
How's your investigation of the new sect

252
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,940
I asked you to look into going?

253
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,880
I heard

254
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,960
they're recruiting disciples

255
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,040
with very high
spiritual power requirements.

256
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,600
But with the amount of money
they're offering,

257
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,260
plenty of people joined them.

258
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,480
There's something strange.

259
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,120
The food they buy

260
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,480
and the fertilizer they produce every day

261
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,600
haven't increased at all.

262
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,730
Haven't increased?

263
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,320
Yes.

264
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,560
Go to the Quan family

265
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,020
and invite Quan Rumu over.

266
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,640
Yes.

267
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,800
No need.

268
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,280
He's already here.

269
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,340
Celestial Master?

270
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,050
Long time no see!

271
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,220
Celestial Master!

272
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,540
Did you miss me?

273
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,620
Alright, alright.

274
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,450
I can't breathe.

275
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,920
Not bad.

276
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,320
You not only completed the mission,

277
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,480
but also found...

278
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,360
-Miss Qingtong.
-Miss Qingtong.

279
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,090
It's all thanks to my training.

280
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,920
Who is this?

281
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,720
This...

282
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,280
This must be Celestial Master's wife,
right?

283
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,560
The one...

284
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,280
you dated for a while?

285
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,920
Don't go spouting the obvious.

286
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,040
I'm not his wife.

287
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,620
I'm of the Dragon Clan.

288
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,050
The Dragon Clan?

289
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,440
The Dragon Clan
that has a thousand-year feud

290
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,120
with your Corsac Fox Clan and the Li Army.

291
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,000
The Li Army

292
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,720
has a thousand-year blood feud

293
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,320
with the Dragon Clan.

294
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,050
What is your purpose

295
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,920
in coming here today?

296
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,960
The Li Army and the Corsac Fox Clan

297
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,090
also have a thousand-year blood feud.

298
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,440
Have you forgotten, General Li?

299
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,560
My family affairs

300
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,640
are none of your concern.

301
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,280
Since you're here today,

302
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,400
I'll make you repay your blood debt
with blood!

303
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,520
Don't!

304
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,640
Celestial Master,

305
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,870
what should we do?

306
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,980
What else can we do?

307
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,200
Go talk to Xueyang.

308
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,400
And I'll talk to Weiyun.

309
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,320
We must not let those two meet again.

310
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,760
Cut the crap.

311
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,220
-Let's go.
-Wei...

312
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,640
That scent from your sleeve earlier

313
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,840
smelled really nice.

314
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,320
What?

315
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,800
This is my newly brewed perfume.

316
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,440
Amazing.

317
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,200
Can you teach me to make it?

318
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:16,840
I'll give you some.

319
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,080
Thank you, Miss Long.

320
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:20,960
Teach me.

321
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,720
Celestial Master,

322
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,680
did they...

323
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,200
fight just now?

324
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,920
They must...

325
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,080
have,

326
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,920
though somehow it also looked like...

327
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,650
they didn't.

328
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,600
No, no, no.

329
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,080
Wait.

330
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,600
The Dragon Clan and the Li Army

331
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,840
had a deadly feud a thousand years ago.

332
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,120
Aren't you going to get revenge?

333
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,320
Didn't you say?

334
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,330
It was a thousand years ago.

335
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,520
What's the point
of fighting over this now?

336
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,580
Right now, the peace
in the Western Regions is more important.

337
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,120
Yes.

338
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,160
Then you just...

339
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,140
Just...

340
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,010
They just...

341
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,570
greeted each other.

342
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,880
They greeted each other.

343
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,480
It was how girls

344
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,040
greet each other.

345
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,800
So you were greeting each other.

346
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,360
Right?

347
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,600
Since we're here,

348
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
shouldn't you...

349
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,560
offer some hospitality?

350
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,600
Xueyang,

351
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,320
eat more.

352
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,450
You've lost weight.

353
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,400
Let me try.

354
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,920
Here, have some more.

355
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,490
Celestial Master, don't just watch. Eat.

356
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,800
Weiyun.

357
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,280
Have some meat.

358
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:48,640
Here.

359
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,170
Eat more.

360
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,440
-I'm not hungry. I'll just drink.
-Xueyang, this is good.

361
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,200
Miss Long, drink as much as you like.

362
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,120
There's plenty.

363
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,760
Thank you.

364
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,500
Here, Xueyang.

365
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,840
I didn't take anything
from the spicy side.

366
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,920
Only this side.

367
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:07,599
It's...

368
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,560
for me?

369
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,140
I don't eat spicy food.

370
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,760
I'll eat it.

371
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,089
Let's get down to business.

372
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,920
What's the deal

373
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,980
with this Gulizan?

374
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,160
We still don't know her background.

375
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,880
But to rise so fast

376
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,010
in such a short time,

377
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,320
her strength must be extraordinary.

378
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,880
We don't know what to do yet.

379
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,320
I heard

380
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,680
she pays a lot to recruit disciples.

381
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,120
Then tomorrow morning,

382
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,560
let's disguise ourselves

383
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,360
and respond to her recruitment.

384
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,080
I know.

385
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,040
It's called "no risk,

386
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,560
no reward."

387
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,720
[Gulizan's Mansion]

388
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,280
Gulizan only accepts people
with strong spiritual power.

389
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,340
We'll have to show our real strength.

390
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,160
Weiyun's dragon power was damaged before,

391
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,080
and she has directly confronted Gulizan.

392
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,210
She can't go with us.

393
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,880
But she has disguised herself
as a kitchen maid

394
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,940
and infiltrated to assist us inside.

395
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:26,960
My Lady,

396
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,440
these have all passed
the preliminary tests.

397
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,200
What topic

398
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,520
should we give them today

399
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,450
for the next round of competition?

400
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,280
I'm a little tired today.

401
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,520
I'll pick some who catch my eye.

402
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,000
Yes.

403
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,780
This one is too fat.

404
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:51,840
No.

405
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,180
This one...

406
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,480
has no hair.

407
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:56,760
No.

408
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,340
This one is too old.

409
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,800
No.

410
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,120
I just look old.

411
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,200
I'm perfectly healthy,

412
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,120
and my hearing is great.

413
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,180
Maybe I'll even grow a little taller
in a couple of days.

414
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,600
I'll go. I'll go.

415
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,780
You can use a spear?

416
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,480
Yes.

417
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,520
It's a family technique.

418
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,300
A woman stronger than any man.

419
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,600
I'm lucky

420
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,480
to have met you.

421
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,210
Alright.

422
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,290
You can stay.

423
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,520
You may leave.

424
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,400
As for these two,

425
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,140
I need more time to decide.

426
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,320
Gentlemen,

427
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,420
let me hear about your strengths.

428
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:12,800
Wait.

429
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,520
This scene...

430
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,800
why does it feel so familiar?

431
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,530
Beauty,

432
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,920
what's your name?

433
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,400
How about I give you a chance tonight?

434
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,120
Massage here.

435
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,240
Why are you wearing it?

436
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,520
My Lady,

437
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,720
my name is Situ Wuming.

438
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,090
You may not know,

439
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,560
but I have excellent character

440
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,680
and am skilled in swordsmanship.

441
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,600
People call me

442
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,660
the No. 1 swordsman

443
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,250
of the Western Regions.

444
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:40,760
He's good.

445
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,560
That's right.

446
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,880
He should be your lucky guy tonight.

447
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,640
Yes.

448
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,320
No hurry.

449
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,130
I still want to hear about your skills.

450
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:51,920
I...

451
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,680
My Lady,

452
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,000
as the saying goes,

453
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,720
you should always compare
before you buy, right?

454
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,050
Look at this gentleman—

455
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,160
elegant on the outside,

456
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,600
mysterious on the inside,

457
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,530
and he stands so tall and straight.

458
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,280
I'm simply no match for him.

459
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,880
I'm just average.

460
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,320
Look at this friend here—

461
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,320
so strong.

462
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,120
Look.

463
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,480
Well... My Lady,

464
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,120
you may not know,

465
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,680
but I'm all show.

466
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,320
I'm weak inside,

467
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,920
and my waist is not good.

468
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,260
If I stand too long,

469
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,450
my legs give out.

470
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,560
My Lady,

471
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,200
I sleepwalk.

472
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,000
When I'm asleep, I...

473
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,000
go rummage through junk
in the middle of the night.

474
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,640
Really!

475
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,680
When it gets really bad,

476
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,360
I...

477
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,120
I even...

478
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,120
eat shit.

479
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,680
Then I'll just have to pick the best
from the worst.

480
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,560
Carry on.

481
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,080
Poor Dog,

482
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,920
are you serious?

483
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,320
I'm sorry.

484
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,020
A husband's virtue matters more.

485
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,480
My Lady,

486
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,880
since you have high hopes for me,

487
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,840
I shouldn't hide anything.

488
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,170
I'll tell you the truth.

489
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:17,960
I...

490
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,320
was born with only one kidney.

491
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:21,600
And...

492
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,320
I often lack energy.

493
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,020
I often feel dizzy,
and my ears ring a lot.

494
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,010
I'll see this through with you.

495
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,160
My Lady, I...

496
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:30,560
My Lady!

497
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,040
I...

498
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,600
I...

499
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,200
I can't see it all of a sudden!

500
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,680
Maybe it's due to lack of energy again.

501
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,320
I...

502
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,840
What?

503
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,580
My Lady, I think he can still be saved.

504
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,600
Celestial Master!

505
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,660
Celestial Master!

506
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,900
Celestial Master!

507
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,160
Celestial Master, wake up!

508
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,240
Wake up!

509
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,650
Since he passed out,

510
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,680
I'll choose you tonight.

511
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,690
Actually...

512
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,120
I think...

513
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,520
he can be...

514
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,480
s—

515
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,240
saved.

516
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,620
I really think he can be saved.

517
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,680
He will wake up. Really!

518
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,400
He...

519
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,460
Celestial Master!

520
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,280
Stop pretending.

521
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,550
Get up!

522
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,680
Stop pretending!

523
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,680
Stop pretending!

524
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,160
Wait,

525
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,280
I...

526
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,880
He can wake up!

527
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,640
Save him,

528
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,640
and he can wake up!

529
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,960
Wait, I...

530
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,160
I have a wife!

531
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,520
Weiyun?

532
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,080
Why are you here?

533
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,930
Let's talk outside.

534
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,920
Why are you so nervous?

535
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,720
Relax.

536
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,760
It's daytime.

537
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,280
He's...

538
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,240
not necessarily going serve her
in the bedroom.

539
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,160
Maybe...

540
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,600
They'll...

541
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,840
just talk.

542
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,360
Really?

543
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,560
Yes.

544
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,700
He wouldn't dare, anyway.

545
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,640
How much does Her Ladyship pay us a month?

546
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,960
If it's too little, I'll quit.

547
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,540
I have a family to support.

548
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,760
I need to raise

549
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,320
some chickens, ducks, fish, geese,
and so on.

550
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,290
They're all no ordinary martial artists.

551
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,530
This Gulizan really is something.

552
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,200
Yeah.

553
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,160
She has recruited quite a few people

554
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,690
by paying them generously.

555
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:10,800
Miss Long,

556
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,760
have you found anything?

557
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,080
She recruits
not only many humans and demons,

558
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:15,940
but also maids.

559
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,530
So I managed to sneak in.

560
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,880
As long as I'm careful,

561
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,160
I won't run into her.

562
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,370
Then you must have found
a lot of information.

563
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,120
We still don't know

564
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,480
who she really is

565
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,810
and what she's up to.

566
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,680
But

567
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,720
there's indeed something wrong

568
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,520
with the experts she recruited.

569
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,850
What's wrong with them?

570
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,840
Many demons with demon power

571
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,690
disappeared shortly after

572
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,980
entering her mansion.

573
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,660
There's a very suspicious place
in her mansion.

574
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,490
We can go take a look.

575
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,000
Look.

576
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,010
An abandoned warehouse

577
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,620
with masters guarding it.

578
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,890
There must be something wrong with it.

579
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:14,800
Don't!

580
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,800
What are you doing?

581
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,800
Don't act rashly.

582
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,360
I know

583
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,280
you are in a bad mood.

584
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,200
But I still think

585
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,060
it's better not to alert them.

586
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,730
It's wiser to be strategic.

587
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:37,920
Sirs,

588
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,540
what are you doing?

589
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:40,900
Who are you?

590
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,200
I'm new here today.

591
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,210
I just want to ask

592
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,080
how much our Lady Guli

593
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,460
pays us each month.

594
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,520
I heard

595
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,000
it's quite a lot.

596
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,200
Go away.

597
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,480
You didn't deny it.

598
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,520
So it really is a lot, huh?

599
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,320
Well...

600
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,080
I came to the right place.

601
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,520
To be honest,

602
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,440
I came here

603
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,640
to make money.

604
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,160
I need to support my family.

605
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,420
What's wrong with you?

606
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,720
Everyone is here to make money.

607
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,320
Right.

608
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,700
That's different.

609
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,040
I'm not only

610
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,240
making money from Her Ladyship,

611
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:12,920
but also

612
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,800
from

613
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,400
all the rich gentlemen here.

614
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,640
Come.

615
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,160
Come here.

616
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,050
This is a top-grade fox demon whip.

617
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,240
Want it?

618
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,440
Looks like...

619
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,560
you don't need it.

620
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,980
This Celestial Master

621
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,700
is exactly like Poor Dog said—

622
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,400
full of tricks.

623
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,320
Come here.

624
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,480
What?

625
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,410
Want me to come over
and invite you myself?

626
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,880
Bring me the grapes

627
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,400
on the table.

628
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,680
You're standing so far away.

629
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,010
How am I supposed to eat?

630
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,960
Bring them here.

631
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,520
Sweet?

632
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,620
What kind of demon are you?

633
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,120
A... corsac fox demon.

634
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,000
Such a handsome corsac fox demon.

635
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,280
Are you married?

636
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,960
Xueyang and the Celestial Master
told me to hide my identity,

637
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,240
but they didn't say I should hide
the fact that I'm married.

638
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,440
Do you need

639
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,240
to think that long to answer?

640
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,080
I'm married.

641
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,640
Then why are you here in my mansion

642
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,540
instead of being home with your wife?

643
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,160
I need to make money.

644
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,600
But...

645
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,880
I sell my skills, not my body.

646
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,400
Then tell me about your wife

647
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,680
to entertain me a little.

648
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,380
You're a corsac fox demon?

649
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,160
Save my brother.

650
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,400
I'm begging you.

651
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,080
Calm down.

652
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,160
Talk to me.

653
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,320
There's something wrong...

654
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,240
with Gulizan.

655
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,410
She isn't really recruiting talents.

656
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,850
All the demons with demon power

657
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,120
who came here

658
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,980
were taken by her to an unknown place.

659
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,360
My brother

660
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,240
is one of them.

661
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,460
Where is your brother?

662
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,880
I don't know.

663
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,640
I only remember

664
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,680
he went to Gulizan's room

665
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,880
with her,

666
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,140
and when her yellow scepter flashed,

667
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,080
he disappeared.

668
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,850
Then why are you still here?

669
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,640
That vicious woman said

670
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,610
the formation is already full.

671
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,610
Once it finishes

672
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,000
absorbing this batch of demons,

673
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,200
she'll send me in.

674
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,780
I'll get you out first.

675
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,000
No.

676
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,040
If you save me,

677
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,320
it will be exposed.

678
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,680
And my brother

679
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,120
will definitely die.

680
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,840
So Gulizan used her scepter

681
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,360
to send many demons into an evil formation

682
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,480
to absorb their power?

683
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,080
Yes.

684
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,170
I've fought her before.

685
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,320
That woman's background is unknown,

686
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,880
and her magic is unfathomable.

687
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,440
If we try to seize the scepter by force,

688
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,800
we might not succeed,

689
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,090
but the demons inside the formation
will surely die.

690
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,920
That's right.

691
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,240
We don't have to take it by force.

692
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,520
I suggest

693
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,480
we use our wits.

694
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,760
Why...

695
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,080
are you all looking at me?

696
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,120
Let me ask you something.

697
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,880
Does Lady Gulizan...

698
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,680
like you?

699
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,040
No.

700
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,440
No?

701
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,880
No!

702
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,400
Be honest with us.

703
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,320
Well, maybe...

704
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:34,960
a little.

705
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,320
A little's good enough.

706
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,840
As the saying goes,

707
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,840
"When Heaven is about to place
a great responsibility on some dog..."

708
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,600
It's okay to make a little sacrifice

709
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,160
for your people.

710
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,320
You'll use your charm

711
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,520
to steal the scepter,

712
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,960
then Xueyang will disable

713
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,020
the scepter's teleportation spell.

714
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:53,960
I'm not going.

715
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,000
You have to go.

716
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,680
[Listen]

717
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,880
Don't be nervous.

718
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,760
Relax.

719
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,880
I've put an eavesdropping talisman here.

720
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,640
You're not going to do anything naughty.

721
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,440
There's nothing to be afraid of.

722
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,080
Just follow

723
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,720
what I taught you.

724
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,040
Sacrifice a little

725
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,480
for the greater good.

726
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,080
Right, Weiyun?

727
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,360
Stop dawdling.

728
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,280
Go!

729
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,380
Little Spider,

730
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,180
we can't stay in this damn place forever.

731
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,720
The plan in the Western Regions

732
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,250
should be nearly complete.

733
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,360
We need to find a way out.

734
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,920
Don't worry.

735
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,890
Everything is going according to my plan.

736
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,560
Feel it carefully.

737
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,200
The power on the spell pillar
is weakening.

738
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:02,920
I can also feel

739
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,320
the magic in the spiritual chain
is fading.

740
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,800
On the day of the new moon,

741
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,040
the Grief Tree seed
will inevitably backfire.

742
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,719
On this day,

743
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,340
Qingtong's power drops significantly.

744
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,120
If she forcibly refines the tree seed now,

745
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,639
she'll only harm herself.

746
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,199
At this time,

747
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,159
her perception of the outside world
is also at its lowest.

748
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,880
This is Qingtong's weakness.

749
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,400
Tonight

750
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,280
is the perfect time for us
to carry out our plan.

751
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,440
I'll help you

752
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,850
break free from this chain.

753
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,320
Qingcheng was right.

754
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,640
Qingtong really is

755
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,360
at her weakest tonight.

756
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,400
Your Majesty,

757
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,360
I'm your...

758
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,210
[Listen]

759
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,040
Go on.

760
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,480
Your Majesty,

761
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,520
I'm your admirer.

762
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,360
Don't you remember it very well?

763
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,880
Why aren't you saying it?

764
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,960
Why don't you take it?

765
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:36,260
[Listen]

766
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,870
[Listen]

767
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:44,780
[Listen]

768
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,020
Forgot the lines to seduce me?

769
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,170
The next line after "Your Majesty"

770
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,560
should be "I am your admirer."

771
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,240
Yes.

772
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,400
I am your admirer.

773
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,720
I have

774
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,760
plenty of money,

775
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,400
but

776
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,720
it depends on your performance.

777
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,520
My Lady, your scepter is beautiful.

778
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,650
It must be...

779
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,220
v-very expensive, right?

780
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,920
This is my magic tool.

781
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,840
The Snake Demon King's intact bone,

782
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,380
fused with a red bloodstone refined from

783
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,540
a golden-winged bird demon's heart,

784
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,640
can amplify spell power

785
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,160
to the maximum.

786
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,760
You like that scepter?

787
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,040
Yes.

788
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,640
I like it very much.

789
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,400
Then...

790
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,760
go take a look.

791
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,050
[Listen]

792
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,800
You wouldn't be interested in this scepter

793
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,680
and want to take it, would you?

794
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:56,760
N-

795
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,120
no.

796
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,840
How about

797
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,800
I teach you how to make this scepter

798
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:04,960
glow?

799
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,280
What do you mean?

800
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,680
Fan Yunfei,

801
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,610
you're cautious
and have strong demon power.

802
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,640
It took me a lot of effort

803
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,440
to teleport you
into the Myriad Blight Formation.

804
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,600
Oh no.

805
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,050
We've been tricked.

806
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,640
Traitors in Corsac Fox State

807
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,080
must die!

808
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,200
Where did you take my Yunfei?

809
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,800
Quan Rumu, Master Quan.

810
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,800
Long Weiyun,

811
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,760
the last True Dragon.

812
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,080
Li Xueyang, General Li.

813
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,720
Nice to meet you.

814
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,360
You...

815
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,640
You know us?

816
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,170
What formation is this?

817
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,080
Is it absorbing my demon power
to activate the formation?

818
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
It's using me as the formation core?

819
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,840
Power of Hatred.

820
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,120
Endless Power of Hatred!

821
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,920
Grief Tree,

822
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,960
absorb all the power

823
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,760
and grow quickly!

824
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,820
I've been waiting for this day

825
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,880
for a long time!

826
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,320
The Myriad Blight Formation
has finally been activated.

827
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,440
Once I've regained my strength,

828
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,480
Wangquan Hongye,

829
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,640
Wangquan Fugui—

830
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,040
both of you

831
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,520
will die.
