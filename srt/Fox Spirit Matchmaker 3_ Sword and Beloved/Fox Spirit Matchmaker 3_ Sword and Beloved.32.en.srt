It's...

7
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,680
It's okay.

8
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,950
I'm fine.

9
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,710
Fugui,

10
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,920
come with me

11
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,870
to the Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai,

12
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,280
will you?

13
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,400
Okay.

[Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai]

15
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,280
Everything's changed,

16
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,840
yet after all these years,

17
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,050
the Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai

18
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,280
remains the same.

19
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:09,910
Is this...

20
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,710
where you and Mother

21
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,150
met?

22
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,030
Your mother and I

23
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,520
met in Nanchui.

24
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,000
This is where

25
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,400
we fell in love with each other.

26
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,030
I couldn't recite poetry

27
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,000
or sing,

28
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,430
play the zither or chess,
paint, write calligraphy,

29
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,890
or cook,
nor could I do laundry or housework.

30
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,360
All I'm good at

31
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,910
is fighting.

32
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,680
What do you think?

33
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,130
Are you disappointed?

34
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,079
As the old saying goes, "A woman's beauty

35
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,000
lies in grace,

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,800
in music and dance,

37
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,400
and in calligraphy and art."

38
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,470
Come on!

39
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,400
Since the world uses such words
to judge women,

40
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,280
let's wear no makeup

41
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,210
and let our beauty shine naturally
among the clouds!

42
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,140
Your mother

43
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,630
was no ordinary woman.

44
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,190
She was a woman of strong character,

45
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,040
free-spirited,

46
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,540
like wind through a bamboo grove,

47
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,920
refreshing and intoxicating.

48
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,720
At that time,

49
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,110
my mask was ugly.

50
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,750
Every time she saw me,

51
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:42,190
she asked me to turn around.

52
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,310
Later,

53
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:52,870
she made this Jinlan Mask herself.

54
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,950
She and I...

55
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,800
shared only a few fleeting years of joy.

56
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,160
Later,

57
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,020
I returned
from the world beyond the circle,

58
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,120
defeated and broken,

59
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,020
having lost my Heart of Sword.

60
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,370
The elites of Yiqi Alliance were all gone.

61
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,360
Your mother risked her life
to give birth to you,

62
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,680
making you a Soldier

63
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,320
to maintain the peace of Yiqi Alliance

64
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,880
and prevent the Black Fox

65
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,800
from returning.

66
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,920
When she left,

67
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,240
she told me that

68
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,510
if one day you wish to leave,

69
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,240
I should let you go.

70
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,630
Your mother truly loved you.

71
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,270
But I...

72
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,830
failed to fulfill my duty as your father.

73
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,310
As the Chief of Yiqi Alliance,

74
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,600
I became increasingly

75
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,890
narrow-minded and biased.

76
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,480
Your mother once told me

77
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,630
I was a great hero,

78
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,950
but what kind of hero am I really?

79
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,920
But in Mother's eyes,

80
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,360
you were her great hero.

81
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,240
Ever since I was young,

82
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,920
I've been used to being a Soldier.

83
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,800
Back then, I followed your Way

84
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,360
willingly.

85
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,920
But later, I realized

86
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,120
my Way

87
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,920
was not the same as yours.

88
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,360
The moment I left Wangquan Manor,

89
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,040
my resolve was firm.

90
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,950
But you...

91
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,070
came back eventually.

92
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,690
Because I believed that

93
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,370
if I could prove my Way with my own life,

94
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,360
my father

95
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,950
would turn back

96
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,170
from the wrong path he took.

97
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,560
Heroes make mistakes and grow old.

98
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,070
But your Heart of Sword

99
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,680
has never changed.

100
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,000
You think,

101
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,720
as a soldier,

102
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,070
the world owes me a lot.

103
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,800
But after

104
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,360
seeing the world outside

105
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,940
and experiencing so much,

106
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,360
I realized

107
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,070
that letting go

108
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,080
is also not the final destination.

109
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,240
Fugui,

110
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,840
why can't you let it go?

111
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,750
I hope you do.

112
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,390
Before,

113
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,270
I was a sword you forged.

114
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,630
And now,

115
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,080
I am still that sword—

116
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,700
the sword that guards this world.

117
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,260
As long as the threat beyond the circle
remains,

118
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,030
peace within it

119
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,960
will never be achieved.

120
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,240
The sacrifices
you and the Mask Group elites made

121
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,600
must not be in vain.

122
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,390
Your Heart of Sword

123
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,480
is to protect this world.

124
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,990
Though you once strayed from your path,

125
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:47,930
your Heart of Sword

126
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,150
was never wrong.

127
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,960
I once wished

128
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,320
to remain a selfish father

129
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,200
and let you live as you wish.

130
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,630
Father!

131
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,600
Father, to carry on your will

132
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,240
is my wish.

133
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,080
Fugui,

134
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,750
the time has come.

135
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,120
It's time for me to accompany your mother.

00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,310
Could there be...

393
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,870
something...

394
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,240
I could help you with?

395
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,590
It seems you'll be busy for a while.

With no one watching over there,

402
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,590
I'm worried.

00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,510
you're still sad.

But you are always like this.

410
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,070
No matter how sad you feel,

411
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,970
you always keep it to yourself

412
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,480
and never say a word.

413
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,290
But Young Master Fugui,

414
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,400

Why didn't you tell me earlier?

505

How foolish.

532
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,270

539

I made so many dishes.

540

541
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,270

would let a demon like you

549

550
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,480

00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,000
You beast!

560
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,830
Rumu is your own child!

561
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,890
How could you do this to him?

562
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,320
My son exists

563
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,230
to serve me.

564
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,710
Otherwise, his life is worthless.

565
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,320
He's still young

566
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:52,150
and doesn't know much
about you dragon demons.

567
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,360
But I, his father,

568
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:57,590
know all too well.

569
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,290
Dragon demons are cruel by nature,

570
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,710
yet hopelessly devoted in love.

571
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,360
Once you fall in love,

572
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:08,230
it's as if you've been tamed.

573
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,590
The one you love can decide

574
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,670
whether you live or die.

575
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,880
Back then, your mother

576
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,760
willingly let me

577
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,070
cut off her horns and strip her scales.

578
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,710
Every arrow you shoot at me

579
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,150
will be borne by Rumu, the one you love.

580
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:41,630
Come.

581
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,510
Do it.

582
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,510
If Rumu dies,

583
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,590
I'll have you die with him!

584
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,320
Alright.

585
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,360
I'll let him die!

586
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,190
Rumu!

587
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:00,880
Stop!

588
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,510
Stop!

589
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,120
Dragon demon,

590
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,590
seal your demon power.

591
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,590
Or I'll make you watch

592
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,840
as Rumu, the one you love,

593
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,550
is tortured to death before your eyes!
