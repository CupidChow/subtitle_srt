00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,229
Dragon demon,

00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,710
seal your demon power,

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,789

6
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:59,039

[Wangquan Manor]

00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,800
Just add a little bait as a lure,

10
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,490
and this compass will be able
to track the Black Fox.

11

The Wangquan Sword
and the Purest Sun Flame

The Water-Control Orb can
be easily borrowed from Fan Yunfei.

Why is my sword meridian weakening?

17
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,680
Your sword meridian
is in Young Master Rumu.

18
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,960
He's in the prime of his life;

19
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,620
this shouldn't be happening.

20
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,150
I have a bad feeling.

21
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,710
I must return
to the Western Regions immediately.

22
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,030

three sword attendants at once.

23
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,360

24
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:33,840
Yes.

25

You're awake.

26
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,150
Tell me.

27
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,680
What else do you want me to do?

28
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,630
I want you to see someone.

32
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,630
What a pity—

33
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,070

34
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,440

35
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,870
break her dragon horns

36
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,120
and peel off her dragon scales.

37
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,480
How tragically beautiful that was.

38
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,240
Back then, I should have

39
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,740
killed you with my sword!

40
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,630
How dare you talk to me like that?

41
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,190
Fine.

42
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,580
You care about her, right?

43
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,360
Then I'll, right in front of you,

44
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,560
with my own hands,

45
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,830

No!

48
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,360
Stop.

49

No!

52
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:40,680
Impossible.

53
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,680
How could you

54
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,400
be stronger than my True Dragon Power?

55
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,800
Someone like you—

56

57
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,270
cruel,

58
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,159
heartless, and loveless—

59

60
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,800
the power of love and duty.

61
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,420
Let all illusions run rampant.

62
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,680

with a single sword stroke!

67
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,030
I would never see you again.

68
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,980

69
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:43,260
when you kill,
always make sure to finish your enemy off.

70
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,600

71
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,020

getting weaker and weaker?

91
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,120
It will.

92

It will, Rumu.

I can marry Long Weiyun as my wife.

101

We of the True Dragon Clan…

is wait for it to take root
and sprout in Wangquan Fugui's heart.

254
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,880
Once his heart

255
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,880
is completely consumed by hatred,

285
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,440

do you remember this?

292
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,110
I heard that in the Western Regions,
humans and demons live together,

293
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,350

is still blurred.

Yeah.

302
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,830
Although it's perfect for stone-skipping,

303
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,880
there are no lakes in the Western Regions.

304
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,140

is to die!
