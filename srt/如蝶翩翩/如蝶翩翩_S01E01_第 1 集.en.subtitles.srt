1
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:16,433
SON, FOOD'S IN THE FRIDGE
I LOVE YOU

2
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:17,475
KEEP IT UP!

3
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,042
My condolences.

4
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,385
Deok-chul, over here.

5
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,595
Oh, hey.

6
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:41,059
-Hi. You came.
-Nice to see you.

7
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,942
By the way, not many of us
showed up today.

8
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,195
There's fewer and fewer every time.

9
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:57,784
Jong-hui is still recovering
from his cataract surgery.

10
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:00,370
Guk-hwan has to take care of his wife.
She's very sick.

11
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,872
Gap-su is visiting his son in Canada.

12
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,415
Why?

13
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,626
What else? To babysit his grandkids.

14
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:10,130
Why would he go all the way there
to do that?

15
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,965
His son never even calls him.

16
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,175
But he's still his son.

17
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,594
At our age,
we either wear diapers ourselves

18
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:20,390
or change our grandkids' diapers.

19
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,102
That makes sense.

20
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,729
That does make sense,

21
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,775
but it's sad.

22
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,319
Deok-chul, let me pour you one.

23
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,822
Me? I quit drinking.

24
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:40,910
You said soju is the greatest joy in life,
so why?

25
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,621
Because I turned 70.

26
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,208
Gosh, you're boring.

27
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,419
You won't live long anyway.

28
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,629
Why would you want to live long?

29
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,132
Why do we meet twice a month,
in the first place?

30
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,593
We have nothing to do, and our wives nag.

31
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,220
We don't want to hang out
at community centers, either.

32
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,638
We're the youngest there.

33
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:06,644
I should have planned
my life after retirement better.

34
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:10,189
Before I knew it, I turned 70.

35
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:15,320
I'm going to quit drinking
starting tomorrow.

36
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,237
Goodness.

37
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:22,076
But today, I'm drinking
for Yong-pil's sake.

38
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,125
But it's odd.

39
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,755
Why aren't I crying?

40
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,927
As you get older,
you get used to goodbyes.

41
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,742
Gyo-seok, I'm on my way now.

42
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,827
Don't forget to bring Kaoliang liquor.

43
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:05,954
My goodness.

44
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,049
TRADITIONAL CONFECTIONERY

45
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,790
EPISODE 1

46
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,297
Stop!

47
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,972
Hey, can't you focus?

48
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,560
You're auditioning for the National Ballet
in a few days.

49
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,936
Get it together.

50
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:03,816
You gave up on international competitions
and chose to go for this audition instead.

51
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,278
What's going on here?

52
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:11,616
Mr. Ki, Chae-rok injured his knee.

53
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,911
Also, I played too slowly.

54
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,454
No, you didn't.

55
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,376
I need a ten-minute break.

56
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,554
He's been a little strange lately.

57
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,265
He's probably in a slump.

58
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:47,401
Hey, what's wrong? What is it?

59
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,112
Why are you hesitating?

60
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,079
Is this about your father?

61
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,123
I don't have a father.

62
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,212
I feel a little heavy, that's all.

63
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,427
Ten minutes are up. Come out.

64
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:41,831
GRACIAS NURSING
AND REHABILITATION CENTER

65
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,837
Where's my Kaoliang liquor?

66
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,630
You want to go through hell again?

67
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,342
You moron. I hope you live forever.

68
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,597
How are you doing? Are you sleeping well?

69
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:03,144
Deok-chul, I'll tell you what.
Even though my body is getting weak,

70
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,564
my mind has never been clearer.

71
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,193
I even remember
my first bank account number

72
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:15,114
that I opened in 1971
at Chohung Bank in Jongno.

73
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,868
It's getting clearer by the day.

74
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,370
That's some great news.

75
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:25,583
And I remembered something else, too.

76
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,961
My ship, the Forward.

77
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:33,215
The ship that I named
but never got to build.

78
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,553
I sold ships all my life,

79
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:42,224
but ended up getting old
without ever building my own ship.

80
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:48,147
I wanted to sail out into the ocean
on the Forward.

81
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,317
Cutting through the waves,

82
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,320
soaked in the salty sea wind,

83
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,449
I might have even encountered a whale.

84
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,997
And I would have chased the whale
to the horizon.

85
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,333
Forward and forward!

86
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,508
I can't stop thinking about it these days.

87
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,223
What about you?

88
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:28,020
Do you have any long-cherished wishes?

89
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,357
The time is now, Deok-chul.

90
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,984
It's still not too late for you.

91
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,320
While your legs are strong
and your head is clear,

92
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,614
do what you've always wanted to do.

93
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,837
My, look at Eun-ho.

94
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,755
-She looks all grown-up.
-Here it comes.

95
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,299
Is that a cake?

96
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,301
Stay healthy, Father.

97
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,679
Make a wish and blow out the candles.

98
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,645
-It's not much, but go eat something nice.
-Thanks.

99
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,814
-My goodness.
-Thanks a lot.

100
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,191
-Stay healthy, Father.
-Oh, my.

101
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,111
Grandpa, what did you wish for?

102
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,199
-Well…
-First of all,

103
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,161
he wishes for his children's
good health and success.

104
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:29,874
Second, he hopes he can stay healthy
so that he won't become a burden for you.

105
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,250
Just those two.

106
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,378
Eun-ho, there's nothing else
that people at our age wish for.

107
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,713
Right, honey?

108
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,507
Well, that's right.

109
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,678
By the way, why is Seong-gwan late?
He has nothing to do anyway.

110
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,849
He must be on his way.
Let's wait a little longer.

111
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,561
You're so generous.

112
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,939
Is that why you also make us wait so long?

113
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:58,360
Sorry? What do you mean?

114
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,362
How many more elections
are you going to lose?

115
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:06,535
Oh, that's what you mean.
I'm sorry for making you worry.

116
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,370
-It's okay.
-I'm sorry.

117
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,247
Seong-san, what is with you?

118
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,876
You've never even visited
his campaign office, have you?

119
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,253
I think I've done enough.

120
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:20,299
Yes, you have.
I couldn't feel more indebted to you.

121
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,135
We'll pay you back this year,
so don't worry.

122
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,970
Why are you bringing that up now?

123
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,015
-I know this is about money!
-How much is it?

124
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,808
-Enough, everyone.
-I'll pay you back.

125
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:33,229
Seong-san, you should stop now.

126
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,731
Mom, can't I even say this much?

127
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:38,359
Also, do you really think
this is about money?

128
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:42,696
You know Mother has a soft spot
for Seong-suk. That's enough.

129
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,994
-Eun-ho, I heard that you got a job.
-Yes.

130
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,498
It must have been hard to get into
such a big company. Congratulations.

131
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,667
-I'm just an intern.
-Is that so?

132
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,131
Oh, Uncle.

133
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,427
-What a mess.
-Here he comes.

134
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,179
-Hi.
-You came.

135
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,973
-Seong-gwan, you're here.
-Yes.

136
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,902
Stop staring.

137
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,742
Eun-ho, work hard,

138
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,494
or you'll end up like your uncle.

139
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,039
After quitting the hospital
out of the blue,

140
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,083
look how he ended up.

141
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:37,918
How pathetic.

142
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,882
How can you have an appetite?

143
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,511
Father and Mother
are worried sick about you.

144
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,224
Seong-san.

145
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,352
I said I didn't want to come.

146
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,356
You insisted we celebrate
Father's 70th birthday together,

147
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,610
but what's the point?
We always end up fighting.

148
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,445
Come on.

149
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:07,489
What did you just say? We're family.

150
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,659
I'm sick of your obsession
with your family.

151
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,204
Father, happy birthday.

152
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:18,292
-Mom, stay healthy.
-Why don't you finish your meal?

153
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,253
Seong-gwan, take care.

154
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,383
Seong-gwan, get back here right now!

155
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,218
Is that brat serious?

156
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,346
Enough.

157
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,306
Gosh.

158
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,618
Do you have my bankbook?

159
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,828
Are you giving more money to Seong-suk?

160
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,165
You can't look after her forever.

161
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,459
Live your life now.

162
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,003
How can you be so cold?

163
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,423
Don't you even feel sorry for her
struggling alone?

164
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,884
My children's lives are my life.

165
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:37,538
HWANG YE-WON
NOVEMBER 1, 1974 - JANUARY 20, 2016

166
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,922
Mom, I have an audition this week.

167
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,931
But Father will be released from prison
that day.

168
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,354
I'll visit again soon.

169
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,332
YOU DON'T DESERVE A GOOD LIFE, DO YOU?

170
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,377
All right. You can take a break.

171
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,926
-Hello.
-Hello.

172
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,886
-Hello.
-Hi.

173
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,726
Hi, Ex-husband.

174
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,106
Hey, what does it mean to be in a slump?

175
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,359
What exactly is it like?

176
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,071
You're annoying.

177
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,784
I just don't understand.

178
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,245
I'm sure you don't.

179
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:46,583
Who is in a slump, anyway? Bom?

180
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:51,046
No. Chae-rok seems
to be having trouble adjusting.

181
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:23,579
HWIJUNG HIGH ADVANCES TO
NATIONAL FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINALS

182
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,390
Part-timers aren't allowed to be late.

183
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:46,226
-Everyone's glaring at you.
-Whatever.

184
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,740
HYOGYEONG TAKES THE LEAD
FOR YOUR FUTURE

185
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,037
Let me see.

186
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:35,025
I never got to congratulate you properly.

187
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:38,654
It's lunchtime, right?
Let me buy you lunch.

188
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,364
I'm in the lobby.

189
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,462
Grandpa.

190
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,464
I'm sorry, but I already had lunch.

191
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:00,175
Oh, you did?

192
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,137
I should have called beforehand.

193
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,641
It's okay. Buy me lunch some other time.

194
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,395
I have to go now. Get home safe.

195
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,813
I will.

196
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,564
Make sure you eat well.

197
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,613
What should I have for lunch?

198
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,183
Hi.

199
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,522
Maybe I should work here
as a delivery man like you.

200
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:58,317
Goodness. It looks easy, right?

201
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,778
The other day, Chang-seon came to try it,

202
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,239
but he quit after one day.

203
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,658
Riding a motorbike is the same,

204
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:10,037
but delivering hamburgers
is nothing like working as a mailman.

205
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,997
What's the difference?

206
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,626
Back then, we could at least feel proud
of being a civil servant.

207
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,673
A single day lasts so long.

208
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,344
I don't know what to do.

209
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:30,724
It's been many years since I retired,
but I suddenly feel this way.

210
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,435
My gosh. What's there to worry about?

211
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:36,354
Go hiking and go on trips
with your wife and such.

212
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,816
I only keep myself busy
because my wife passed early.

213
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,612
Score some points with your wife.

214
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,324
Order number 41 is ready.

215
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:50,118
I have to get going.
Let me buy you makgeolli soon.

216
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,245
-Okay. You should go.
-See you.

217
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,929
-Did you hear?
-What?

218
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,348
College-graduate interns
will be here on Monday.

219
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,769
That must be why it's been
so chaotic all week.

220
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:19,189
And they get paid more than we do.
Does that make sense?

221
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,359
No one forced you to become a part-timer.

222
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,152
But I want to go see Messi.

223
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:28,448
This is unfair. I feel very upset.

224
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:36,832
Who said I'd grow taller in the military?
I didn't grow at all.

225
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,210
Welcome…

226
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:05,694
You haven't seen him
since graduation, right?

227
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,197
Did he know that you work here?

228
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,297
Oh, right. Chae-rok.

229
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,925
Your dad will be released
from prison soon?

230
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:38,185
Life is unfair, don't you think?

231
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:42,189
After ruining other people's lives,
how can he be released so soon?

232
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,773
Am I wrong?

233
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,194
Chae-rok.

234
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,449
You don't deserve a good life, do you?

235
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:57,287
Ho-beom, you're out of line…

236
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:05,128
See you around, okay?

237
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:09,507
Sir, you haven't paid.

238
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,676
Don't worry. I'll pay.

239
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:15,096
Why the heck should you?

240
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,363
Ho-beom.

241
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,205
-My dad's situation is too--
-You son of a…

242
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,753
You ran away saying
you don't want to play football anymore.

243
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,964
Now you come asking for help?

244
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,674
You selfish bastard.

245
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,711
HANKUK UNIVERSITY OF ARTS
SCHOOL OF DANCE ANNUAL SHOW

246
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:41,808
I'm not here to see you.

247
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,478
Me neither. Where's Chae-rok?

248
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,773
Working. He'll come
as soon as he's finished.

249
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,233
Is he still working?

250
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,360
I know.

251
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:55,864
I've been telling him to quit,
but he won't listen.

252
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:59,200
He doesn't even have
enough time to practice.

253
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,703
What should I do to make him quit?

254
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,332
Just let him be.

255
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,293
He'll quit on his own sooner or later.

256
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:11,379
Once his ambitions become bigger
and his goals clearer,

257
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,632
he won't leave the studio
in order to improve himself.

258
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,969
We stayed up all night practicing too,
haven't we?

259
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,640
No, I haven't.

260
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,186
I always slept as much as I wanted.

261
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:55,752
They're good.

262
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,491
Want to get something to eat together?

263
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,117
What should we eat?

264
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,787
Are you hungry?

265
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,580
No, I'm not.

266
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,543
I'm off to practice.

267
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,552
Jeez.

268
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,933
OH JOONG-SIK ORTHOPEDIC CLINIC

269
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,938
Just a second!

270
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:42,483
-What is it?
-Open the door.

271
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,569
Gosh, why does it have to be now?

272
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,906
Hey.

273
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,366
Hang on a second. I'm sorry.

274
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,703
I was finally having my moment.

275
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:58,333
I was saving the world
from terrorists, you know?

276
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,836
Just save yourself. You look like a mess.

277
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,797
Have you been playing games all day?
Is it even fun?

278
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:09,802
It's just like you dancing every day
with an injured knee.

279
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:14,474
Once the audition is over,
please take a break.

280
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,060
And go through rehab.

281
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,104
Fine.

282
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:24,192
How's your back?

283
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,362
-Well, it's okay.
-Let me see.

284
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:33,326
-That hurts.
-I really should move far away from you.

285
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,640
Damn it.

286
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:29,799
What are you doing?

287
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,469
You call this ballet?

288
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,849
What else would it be?

289
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,353
There's no emotion in your moves.

290
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,773
You're just mechanically following
the routine.

291
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:50,403
How can the audience feel anything
when you don't?

292
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:00,204
This is not ballet.
It's a workout. It's labor.

293
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,958
What did you tell me when we first met?

294
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:48,419
What is going on here?

295
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,804
Do you even know what this is?

296
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,432
Don Quixote.

297
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,976
I mean, what were you thinking?

298
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:05,728
What was I thinking?

299
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,985
I wasn't really thinking.

300
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,989
I just followed my emotions.

301
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,075
You said, emotions.

302
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,788
I don't know what is happening to you,

303
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:28,167
but forget about the audition if you're
going to keep pushing yourself like this.

304
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,296
You don't deserve to dance.

305
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,610
Honey, are you sleeping?

306
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,654
No, I'm not.

307
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,491
I can't sleep.

308
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,079
I saw a performance today.

309
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:08,875
Those young dancers were amazing.

310
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:13,963
But I couldn't find anyone as old as me
on stage or in the audience.

311
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:16,757
I guess that's only natural.

312
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,385
What was I expecting?

313
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:20,678
Okay.

314
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,890
And I sat there, feeling envious.

315
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:28,728
My father, who forbade me to dance,
is long gone.

316
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:32,648
But I never had the courage
to even give it a try.

317
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:36,194
Everyone lives that way.

318
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:41,073
I've lived that way all my life,

319
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,410
and I'm 70 now.

320
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,163
I know it is too late.

321
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:51,334
I should give up.

322
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,155

00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,264
FATHER'S RELEASE
TODAY 9:00 AM

324
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,677
-Is he there?
-Give me a second.

325
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,224
-Wait.
-What?

326
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,642
Did he show up?

327
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:37,565
Yes, he's here.

328
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,944
-All right.
-Who is he, anyway?

329
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:46,782
If he stood out to you,
he must have an awful lot of potential.

330
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:50,161
He'll be the lead role
at the National Ballet within a year.

331
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,997
LEE CHAE-ROK

332
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,516
10:06 AM
SEPTEMBER 21, MONDAY

333
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:53,474
Number 10, Mr. Jung Chun-gu,
and number 11, Mr. Lee Chae-rok.

334
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,644
Mr. Lee Chae-rok?

335
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,854
Let me go check.

336
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,321
Mr. Lee Chae-rok?

337
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:33,305
Wait! Does this bus go
to Anyang Correctional Institution?

338
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:37,036
MR. KI

339
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:03,562
What is it?

340
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,397
Deok-chul, what are you up to?

341
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,984
Are you not coming today?

342
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,903
Are you out of candy?

343
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,531
I can't today,
but I'll be there next week.

344
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:16,617
Don't throw it away, okay?

345
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,535
What?

346
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,453
Don't throw it away.

347
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,164
Gyo-seok.

348
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:24,250
Get me some ginger candy.

349
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,460
Gyo-seok.

350
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,837
Goodness, is it him again?

351
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:32,508
He should have been good
to his family when he was young.

352
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:36,762
How come his family never visits him
all these years?

353
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:39,807
That's why he keeps calling you.

354
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,100
Come out. Let's eat.

355
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:42,893
Okay.

356
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:07,835
HAPPY CHANGES MAKE HAPPY CIVILIANS

357
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,042
Excuse me.

358
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:34,588
I'm waiting for inmate number 1352.
His name is Lee Mu-yeong.

359
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:36,715
Why isn't he coming out?

360
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,843
-One moment, please.
-Okay.

361
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,554
He's already been released.

362
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:43,597
Pardon?

363
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:47,142
He was released this morning at 7 a.m.
You must have missed him.

364
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,231
Thank you.

365
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,790
Hello?

366
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:13,168
Hello?

367
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:16,088
Hello?

368
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,466
-Who is this?
-Chae-rok.

369
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,140
I've been released.

370
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:28,892
A friend of mine found me a job,

371
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,519
so I'm in Daecheon.

372
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:37,901
I'll be in touch.

373
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:08,932
Is that all you have to say to me?

374
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,267
FATHER

375
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:19,985
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

376
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:52,911
Hello?

377
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,384
I ran here as soon as I heard a loud thud,

378
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,678
but all I found was this letter.

379
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,175
Do you hear that?

380
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:58,393
It's the sea!

381
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:00,979
The ocean!

382
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:05,525
I see a whale!

383
00:49:58,036 --> 00:49:59,955
Forward!

384
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:03,083
Sail forward!

385
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:07,379
I'm sailing out into the ocean.

386
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:10,966
Into the vast, endless ocean!

387
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,688
Deok-chul.

388
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:29,401
We have known each other
for almost 50 years now.

389
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:31,361
But it's time to say goodbye.

390
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:37,033
When my own family abandoned me,
you've visited me all these years.

391
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,703
I can't thank you enough.

392
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:45,500
Lately, I keep hearing
the ocean in my ear.

393
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:50,005
There are whales swimming
in the vast, deep ocean,

394
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:54,468
and I sail across it

395
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,721
on the Forward.

396
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:02,559
But just when I think
I'm about to move forward,

397
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,687
I keep waking up.

398
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:11,067
Am I asleep or intoxicated on medicine?

399
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:14,070
I can't tell anymore.

400
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:17,032
Deok-chul.

401
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:20,702
My pain is getting worse and worse.

402
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,873
I want to be happy

403
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,043
at least in my last moment.

404
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:43,058
Are you out on the ocean now?

405
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,269
Have you spotted any whales yet?

406
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,909
Why did you back out
after going all the way there?

407
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:08,959
Answer me.

408
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:14,172
Fine.

409
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:16,341
Let's end this.

410
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,011
My father…

411
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,932
I went to see my father.

412
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:30,981
But I couldn't meet him.

413
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:37,028
I'm sorry.

414
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,759
You little brat.

415
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,803
Do your homework after school.

416
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,306
What are you doing here?

417
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,099
Father, did you see that?

418
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,019
How can a person fly up like a bird?

419
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:53,980
Is that why it's called Swan Lake?

420
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,941
Father, I want to be a swan, too.

421
00:53:56,524 --> 00:54:00,779
What? Do you want to be a boy
who dances with makeup on?

422
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:03,657
Do you want to live
the rest of your life in poverty?

423
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:07,410
Who do you think I work my ass off for?
No way.

424
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,454
Father, please.

425
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:11,206
I said, no.

426
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:13,625
Come on.

427
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:31,393
Forward, sail forward.

428
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:26,031
What is it?

429
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,575
You were standing here the other day, too.

430
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:31,036
Why are you watching me?

431
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,456
Didn't you hear me?

432
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:36,875
I said, why are you watching me?

433
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:40,462
I want to do ballet.

434
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:43,089
What?

435
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:45,633
I want to do ballet.

436
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:14,037
Do you happen to be
ballet dancer Ki Seung-joo?

437
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,038
Yes, that's me.

438
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:19,042
I'm a huge fan. I can't believe this.

439
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:21,377
I've been to all your performances
in Korea.

440
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:24,130
This is such an honor.
I didn't expect to see you here.

441
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:27,300
I heard that you want to do ballet.

442
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:28,843
Yes.

443
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:32,180
This place is just for practice.
I don't give lessons here.

444
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:33,598
Please go back.

445
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:38,144
If I was going to give up so easily,
I wouldn't have come.

446
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:41,189
I'll pay you
and do whatever you tell me to do.

447
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:44,150
Please just give me a chance.

448
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,860
I beg you.

449
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:48,613
I'm stronger than I look.

450
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:50,907
If you need a hobby or exercise--

451
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,367
No, it's not that.

452
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:54,702
I genuinely want to do ballet.

453
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:56,663
Then go to ballet class.

454
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,248
Can't…

455
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:00,792
I learn here?

456
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:09,300
He can barely stand straight,
let alone keep his balance.

457
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:15,765
Hello.

458
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:29,571
Mr. Ki, I'm off to work.

459
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:31,197
When are you going to quit?

460
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:34,409
Don't you think it's a waste of time?

461
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,162
You're already 23.

462
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:40,081
You know that ballet dancers retire early.

463
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,459
Why are you suddenly saying that?

464
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:45,879
Next to that white-haired old man

465
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:48,756
desperately begging me
to teach him ballet,

466
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,341
you look pathetic.

467
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,886
It's that old man who's pathetic.

468
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,263
If he's so desperate,
why didn't he start earlier?

469
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,182
Anyway, I'm off.

470
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:03,688
You better not be late
for evening practice.

471
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:18,870
I'm just going to watch a little.

472
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:21,998
Sure, suit yourself.

473
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:25,627
Fifth.

474
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:29,672
Shoulders down.

475
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,676
Eyes straight ahead.

476
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,729
-That's right.
-I thought so.

477
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:46,898
Here they come.

478
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,694
Look how shiny everything is.

479
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:54,364
Mr. Sim cleaned the whole place.

480
00:58:58,368 --> 00:58:59,702
You didn't have to.

481
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:03,665
Don't worry. I'm happy to do this
as long as you let me watch.

482
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:05,083
I'm sorry, sir.

483
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:08,545
Would it be okay for me
to come back tomorrow?

484
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:09,671
No, you can't.

485
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:12,799
I see.

486
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,770
He reminds me of you four years ago.

487
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:21,951
Why do you want to do ballet, anyway?

488
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:29,375
I've never done anything
I wanted to do my entire life.

489
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:35,548
I've been too busy making ends meet
and supporting my family

490
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:38,509
to even dream of it.

491
01:00:39,093 --> 01:00:41,262
I thought it was only natural.

492
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:45,767
And now…

493
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:49,896
I'm finally trying to do
what I want to do.

494
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:56,986
I know very well that I'm old and weak.

495
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,697
Still, I want to try it.

496
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:05,161
I don't care if I lose to reality.

497
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:09,999
I want to give it a shot at least.

498
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:21,886
These interns will be training here
for six weeks.

499
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:23,888
Ms. Cho Min-jae and Ms. Sim Eun-ho.

500
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:25,348
Please introduce yourselves.

501
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,475
Hello, I'm Cho Min-jae.

502
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:29,644
I'm Sim Eun-ho. Nice to meet you.

503
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:38,736
Min-jeong, can you show them
around the hall?

504
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:40,071
Okay.

505
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:42,615
All right, let's start
prepping for dinner.

506
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,034
-Let's do this!
-Let's do this!

507
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:51,207
Excuse me.

508
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:56,963
Excuse me.

509
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:05,221
Do you have any recommendations
for two people?

510
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:07,598
-Recommendations?
-Yes.

511
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:12,019
Well… Let me see.

512
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:20,820
Sir, would you mind
if I give you some recommendations?

513
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,488
Please go ahead.

514
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:25,074
When you're two people,

515
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:29,078
you can enjoy more dishes
at a cheaper price if you order a set.

516
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:33,082
This set on the first page
is the most popular.

517
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,835
-Then we'll have that.
-Sure.

518
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:44,051
Why did you interact with customers
when you're not ready?

519
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:46,637
-It's because--
-Don't act up.

520
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:49,182
Next time, just ask
one of our employees for help.

521
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:51,225
Yes, sir.

522
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:55,772
I hope they're not like that
during the whole training period.

523
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:56,814
I'm sorry.

524
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:05,490
Did we jump through hoops
to land this measly job?

525
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:07,200
Eun-ho.

526
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:09,452
Come here please.

527
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:13,164
-This is for table number 11.
-His name did sound familiar.

528
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:15,249
Turns out, he's the coach's son.

529
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:18,503
My cousin is in a youth football club.

530
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:20,588
He says it was a huge deal back then.

531
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:22,340
-Why?
-What do you think?

532
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:24,801
The football club was disbanded,
and everyone split up.

533
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:28,012
-Gosh, it sounded terrible.
-What a bother.

534
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:29,388
Excuse me.

535
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:35,978
I was in that football club
you just mentioned.

536
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,440
Were you more affected by it
than I was? No.

537
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:42,235
Then keep your mouths shut.

538
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:58,501
Narcissism is a disease.

539
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:01,045
Get to the point and leave.

540
01:04:02,296 --> 01:04:05,424
An old man in his 70s came by
and asked me to teach him ballet.

541
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:09,428
-So?
-I said no, of course.

542
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,055
My hands are full with Chae-rok.

543
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:13,808
Then what's bothering you?

544
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:16,686
He's been coming every day since.

545
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:18,354
He'll stop soon.

546
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:22,233
Right? I guess he will.

547
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:27,488
But the look on his face…

548
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:31,075
I can't stop thinking about what he said.

549
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:44,213
What the hell?

550
01:04:47,174 --> 01:04:48,676
What a weird old man.

551
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:54,307
Hey, come here.

552
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:57,226
I asked him to come over.

553
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:58,811
Mr. Sim, please come over here.

554
01:04:58,895 --> 01:04:59,937
Okay.

555
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:05,067
Don't tell me
you're going to teach him ballet.

556
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:07,028
No.

557
01:05:07,778 --> 01:05:10,489
I'm not going to teach him. You will.

558
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:12,992
What?

559
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:32,720
SPECIAL THANKS TO CHO SEONG-HA

560
01:05:57,286 --> 01:06:00,581
-Father, have you been working out?
-No, I haven't.

561
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:02,166
Not at all.

562
01:06:02,249 --> 01:06:03,334
All I do is breathe.

563
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:06,087
Don't you know you're making things
difficult for everyone?

564
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:08,589
I'm in no position to be picky.

565
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:10,383
It's for me.

566
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:11,842
-Could you recommend some?
-Sorry?

567
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:15,846
If you manage to master this in a week,
I'll teach you ballet.

568
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:17,306
Yes. I can do it.

569
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,308
Gosh, I'll be dead by then.

570
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:21,477
Why would you smash your face
into the mirror?

571
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:23,604
Whenever you're ready.

572
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:30,319
