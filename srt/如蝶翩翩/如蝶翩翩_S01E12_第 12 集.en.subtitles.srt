1
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,008
Deok-chul, wake up.

2
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,177
It's your show today.

3
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,226
Deok-chul.

4
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,853
Yes?

5
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:08,276
Goodness. Wake up.

6
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,157
Who are you?

7
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,420
Who are you?

8
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,976
Do you recognize me?

9
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,439
Who am I?

10
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,943
Don't startle him.

11
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,199
Deok-chul.

12
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,078
Excuse me.

13
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,331
Do you know me?

14
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,585
Let's go to the hospital.

15
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,463
Okay. I'll call a cab.

16
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,681
NEUROPSYCHIATRIST
PARK JEONG-EUM

17
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:23,518
Has he been taking
his prescribed medication on time?

18
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,647
Yes.

19
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,775
Anything else other than
cognitive disorder?

20
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,318
Hallucinations or delusions?

21
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,736
I don't think so.

22
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,989
That's a relief then.

23
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,699
Let's get a checkup

24
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,368
and then see if he needs to up his doses.

25
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,120
There may be side effects,

26
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:46,541
and the amount should be enough
for his guardian to manage.

27
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,626
Let's get a checkup first

28
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,254
then meet again when the results come out.

29
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,589
Don't worry too much.

30
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,716
-Thank you.
-No problem.

31
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,343
Deok-chul, let's go.

32
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,596
Where are we going this time?

33
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,350
-Mom, wait outside with him.
-Okay.

34
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:13,985
Jeong-eum.

35
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,446
-Yes?
-Would it be possible

36
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,158
for him to perform

37
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,746
in front of an audience?

38
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,543
Right.

39
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,518
I'm afraid he won't be able to perform.

40
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,063
We should head home.

41
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,066
We should let Chae-rok know
as soon as possible.

42
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:58,446
Honey, do you remember
what you used to do?

43
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,616
Sorry?

44
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,245
Well…

45
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,998
Let's see…

46
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,711
-Let's take him to the studio.
-What?

47
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,382
Maybe it'll help jog his memory.

48
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,176
He practiced day and night.

49
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,428
Let's go.

50
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,765
Come on.

51
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,268
Mom.

52
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,901
FINALE

53
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:58,256
THE MAN WHO WILL SOAR
SIM DEOK-CHUL

54
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,750
Mom, I'm performing today.

55
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,209
HWANG YE-WON
NOVEMBER 1, 1974 - JANUARY 20, 2016

56
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,378
After this,
I'll be entering a competition.

57
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,257
Dad's coming today too.

58
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,927
Are you watching from above?

59
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,982
So this is where you practiced.

60
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,535
This place…

61
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:14,499
I used to do ballet here.

62
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,542
You're right. Ballet.

63
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,129
I even filmed your documentary here.

64
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,174
"Documentary"?

65
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:29,013
You still have time,
so slowly jog your memory.

66
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:33,893
Today is a very important day for you.

67
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,354
But…

68
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,149
I don't know what I did here

69
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,736
or who else was present.

70
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,031
I don't remember.

71
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,161
En bas. Lift your arm.

72
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,537
Lower your shoulders.

73
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,707
-Bring it down slowly.
-That's me.

74
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,377
Slowly.

75
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:46,090
Put your feet closer.
Tighten your inner thighs.

76
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:51,095
Lower your shoulders. Come down slowly.

77
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,852
Chae-rok.

78
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,772
Chae-rok?

79
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,275
Chae-rok.

80
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,361
Father!

81
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,159
-This is him.
-Chae-rok.

82
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,621
-Chae-rok.
-You can grab the bar.

83
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,039
Yes, I remember.

84
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,375
-I remember you, Chae-rok.
-Do you?

85
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,418
What?

86
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,047
-Hae-nam.
-You remember me too!

87
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,674
Father, what about me?

88
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,093
You're our youngest son, Seong-gwan.

89
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,430
-Father.
-What about today's performance?

90
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,935
You're supposed to perform on stage today.

91
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,022
But…

92
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,443
I don't remember the moves.

93
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,907
It's all tangled up in my head.

94
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,786
-I should call Chae-rok.
-No.

95
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,666
You should tell them yourself.

96
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,336
Chae-rok and the rest

97
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,421
have no idea and are waiting for you.

98
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:11,676
Tell them face to face that you're sick.

99
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:17,014
Tell them that you're sorry and grateful
for everything.

100
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,817
I should do that.

101
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,156
KIM HEUNG-SIK BALLET COMPANY
2021 ANNUAL SHOW, NAVILLERA

102
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,536
Start with Plie.

103
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:43,040
Préparation and then demi-plie.

104
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,210
Port de bras. Grand plié.

105
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,798
Why isn't he coming?

106
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,890
ARE YOU ON YOUR WAY?

107
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,814
Grand plié. Sous-sous up.

108
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,070
You can take the piano.

109
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,031
What?

110
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,450
My gift to you
since you've finally become human.

111
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,035
Aren't I so generous?

112
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,245
It was mine to begin with.

113
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,457
Forget it.

114
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,460
You don't want it?

115
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,420
No.

116
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,422
What are you scheming?

117
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,091
You'd better not ask me for a new one.

118
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,179
Why are you smiling?

119
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,598
What is this? I can't see through you.

120
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,309
See? You never know
the most important part.

121
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,271
By the way, I don't see Mr. Sim.

122
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,405
SEONG-GWAN

123
00:10:58,532 --> 00:10:59,700
Hello?

124
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,517
I had no idea.

125
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:28,020
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

126
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,439
I'm sorry.

127
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,442
I really am.

128
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:37,571
I remember doing ballet.

129
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,617
I also remember
that I'll be performing today.

130
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,620
But other than that,

131
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,622
I don't quite remember.

132
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,919
Due to my illness,

133
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,255
I've only become a nuisance.

134
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,925
I'm truly sorry.

135
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,683
Mr. Sim, do you think you can perform?

136
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,394
I can't remember

137
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,815
parts of the choreography.

138
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,235
I knew

139
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,488
this was bound to happen one day.

140
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:24,535
But I didn't expect it to happen so soon.

141
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,290
I wanted to put on a great show

142
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,834
with Chae-rok.

143
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,838
But I ruined everything.

144
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,008
I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

145
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,099
The show will begin in a few hours.

146
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,935
What should we do?

147
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,773
We should still get ready.

148
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,406
Seung-joo.

149
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,619
We don't have much time to rehearse
and prepare.

150
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,621
I'll tell the dancers to rehearse.

151
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,007
Let's go.

152
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,972
Then Chae-rok will perform alone.

153
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,561
Mr. Ki.

154
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,900
I can't do it alone.

155
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,114
Mr. Sim.

156
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,409
What's my name?

157
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,289
Lee Chae-rok.

158
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,251
My ballet instructor.

159
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,713
You recognize me. You can do this.

160
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,551
No. I can't, Chae-rok.

161
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:07,513
I can't perform in this state.
It won't be perfect.

162
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:12,393
I'm really okay. Don't mind me.

163
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,519
I made a promise.

164
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,232
I won't let go of your hand.

165
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,070
As long as you are with me
and recognize me,

166
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,699
I'll teach you ballet anytime.

167
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,994
Thank you, Chae-rok.

168
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,454
Listen carefully.

169
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,626
Even if it's not perfect,
your body will remember.

170
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,129
The memory is still inside you.

171
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,591
We'll split the choreography into parts.

172
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,301
You can do it.

173
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,722
That's what I taught you.

174
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:53,934
Do you trust me?

175
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,565
Put your trust in me, and let's do this.

176
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,530
I said no. Don't be stubborn.

177
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,073
My heart breaks for him too.

178
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,118
But how will he perform
when he can't even remember?

179
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,162
I'll make it work at all costs.

180
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,455
Just trust me on this.

181
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,789
This isn't about trust!

182
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,291
Remember what you said?

183
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,085
You didn't want me to sit in the audience.

184
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,962
I feel the same way.

185
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,049
I don't want him
sitting in the audience either.

186
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,552
This can't be the end for him.

187
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,805
He should at least perform on stage.

188
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,142
Please.

189
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,591
-Chae-rok.
-Mr. Sim.

190
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,677
Let's go on stage together.

191
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,638
What?

192
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,348
Chae-rok.

193
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,312
You can do it, Mr. Sim.

194
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,941
Thank you.

195
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,821
Deok-chul, you can do it. Okay?

196
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,581
Dad.

197
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,084
Let's take my car.

198
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,336
How come?

199
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,756
We're going to see Grandpa,
so we should take Bungbung.

200
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,553
He'd love that. Let's do that.

201
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,096
Then should I drive?

202
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,932
I'm a good driver, Dad. Don't worry.

203
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,269
-Should I give her a chance?
-Sure.

204
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,480
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

205
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,318
Since Father likes roses…

206
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:11,739
He likes baby's breath.
You're the one who likes roses.

207
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:12,906
Is that so?

208
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,368
How do you know him better than I do?

209
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,663
I've known him for over a decade.
This is a given.

210
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,665
After all, he's our father.

211
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,128
I'm well over 40, and I had no idea.

212
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,882
-Gosh…
-Mr. Byun.

213
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,800
What a decent guy you are.

214
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,636
I know. You should pay.

215
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,181
Ma'am, we'd like to buy
all your baby's breath.

216
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,850
-Sure.
-How much are they?

217
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,852
They smell wonderful.

218
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,271
Goodness. Hey, Mom.

219
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,149
-Hey.
-Hey.

220
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,697
How are you?

221
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:55,407
They're over there.

222
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,369
-Mom, we're here.
-Hello, Mother.

223
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,580
-Hello.
-You guys came early.

224
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,173
Mr. Sim.

225
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:54,842
Yes?

226
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,723
Here. It's a gift.

227
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,395
I've put a spell on these,

228
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,647
so don't worry about a thing.

229
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,249
Thanks, Chae-rok.

230
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,960
I truly mean it.

231
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,429
They're starting now.

232
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,751
Are you confident?

233
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:13,921
Yes.

234
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,362
Mr. Sim, you can do this, right?

235
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,216
Yes.

236
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,845
You're up next. Get ready.

237
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,830
You can come out now.

238
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:35,961
Let's go, Mr. Sim.

239
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,810
Chae-rok, you're on the other side.

240
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,074
We're up next.

241
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:08,827
You're confident, right?

242
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,003
Mr. Sim.

243
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,297
Mr. Sim.

244
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,716
Mr. Sim.

245
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,635
What's my name?

246
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,887
Chae-rok.

247
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,680
Where are we?

248
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,015
At the theater.

249
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,267
What do you like the most?

250
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,936
What's your favorite piece?

251
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,397
Swan Lake.

252
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,525
You're doing what you love

253
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,778
and yearned to do the most.

254
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,032
You can do it.

255
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,455
Chae-rok.

256
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,798
Grandpa and Chae-rok are up next.

257
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,442
Mr. Sim.

258
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,237
Mr. Sim.

259
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:34,032
Just focus on what you've been
practicing with me.

260
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,159
Then, you can do it.

261
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,080
Your body will remember.

262
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:42,666
The memory is still inside you.

263
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,609
What is it?

264
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:53,945
Why are you watching me?

265
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,949
I want to do ballet.

266
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:01,536
I want to do ballet.

267
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,757
It's a gift.

268
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:27,218
I've put a spell on these,

269
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,221
so don't worry about a thing.

270
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:33,516
THE MAN WHO WILL SOAR
SIM DEOK-CHUL

271
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,864
It feels like a dream.

272
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:00,960
Deok-chul,
thank you for keeping your promise.

273
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,378
My dream also came true.

274
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:07,675
Father, you were incredible yesterday.

275
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,844
I was deeply moved.

276
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,220
Me too, Father.

277
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:13,848
You too, right?

278
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:15,516
Yes.

279
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,311
Father, how many candles do you want?

280
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:20,730
-Put them all on.
-Should I?

281
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,315
-Yes.
-I'll light them.

282
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:23,650
Guys.

283
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,486
I have something to say.

284
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,573
Let's do it later.

285
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,201
It's about time

286
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,204
I went to a nursing home.

287
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,667
Honey.

288
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,711
Father, what are you talking about?

289
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:48,049
What happened yesterday
is bound to occur again.

290
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,761
Even with time,

291
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,681
my memory won't come back to me.

292
00:32:56,557 --> 00:33:00,311
Eventually, I won't recognize any of you.

293
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,147
I…

294
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,984
don't want you to see me like that.

295
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,278
Why would you worry about that?

296
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:12,573
She's right. That's what family is for.

297
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,077
We'll take good care of you

298
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,704
to make you feel comfortable at home.

299
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,998
Can't you give it some more time?

300
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,792
Don't go against my will.

301
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,422
I choose where I will live.

302
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,634
I've already reserved a nursing home.

303
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,302
The same place Gyo-seok stayed.

304
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,473
Father, do you really need to go this far?

305
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,435
You can visit me often.

306
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:45,440
I don't want to get admitted
after I turn into a fool.

307
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,402
I should go now if I want to adjust better

308
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,237
and make new friends.

309
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,614
Just…

310
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:58,786
think that
I'm going on a picnic or a trip.

311
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,497
Grandpa.

312
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:06,753
Deok-chul, I understand how you feel,
but--

313
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,004
If you do,

314
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,340
then please respect my decision.

315
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:40,036
-What are you doing?
-What?

316
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:44,248
You should go before the roads
get too icy.

317
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,293
Why? Are you going to drop me off?

318
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,254
-What?
-Whenever it rained,

319
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,966
you'd pick me up from school.

320
00:34:56,010 --> 00:35:00,640
I was a clumsy girl
who'd always forget to bring an umbrella.

321
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,685
I'd always have a cold
during the summer as well.

322
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,313
Every time it rained,

323
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,982
you'd wear that yellow raincoat

324
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,653
and wait for me
in front of the school gate, remember?

325
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,489
Yes, I do remember.

326
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:24,080
I told myself that I'd do the same

327
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,750
for my children.

328
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:32,797
But now that I think of it,
it's truly a relief.

329
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,218
Instead of repaying my own children

330
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,429
for what you've done for me,

331
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,060
I guess it was meant for me to repay you.

332
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,157
Seong-suk.

333
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:01,534
You have done

334
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:06,372
everything for me
and have taken good care of me.

335
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,459
Now, let me return the favor.

336
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,673
If you have trouble speaking,

337
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,468
I can teach you.

338
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,847
If you can't read,

339
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:26,642
I'll teach you Korean. Okay?

340
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,479
So, Father…

341
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,608
please don't leave.

342
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,112
Please?

343
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,532
Please stay with us, okay?

344
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:00,760
BALLET GALA, NAVILLERA

345
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,766
Mom, Dad's here as well.

346
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,271
It would've been great had you been there.

347
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,109
You were watching, right?

348
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:21,364
HWANG YE-WON
NOVEMBER 1, 1974 - JANUARY 20, 2016

349
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,562
Who's calling me at this hour?

350
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:54,981
This is your wake-up call.

351
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:58,776
Mr. Sim.

352
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:06,659
Deok-chul,
I thought your ballet class was over.

353
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:07,994
What's with the bag?

354
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,788
I have one last thing to do.

355
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:11,831
Where's Seong-gwan?

356
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:14,542
You must be clearheaded today

357
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,752
since you know that he's not home.

358
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,422
He went out last night
and won't be home for a few days.

359
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:22,216
Wait here. I'll drop you off.

360
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,010
I'm really okay.

361
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:25,636
Thanks.

362
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,600
-Honey, I'll be off now.
-Okay.

363
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,440
I'm off now.

364
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:40,568
-Okay. Drive safely.
-Okay.

365
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:43,029
-Bye.
-Okay. Have a good day.

366
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:50,202
Why did he call me?

367
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,257
Chae-rok.

368
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,677
Why are you here?

369
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,846
Isn't it obvious?

370
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:11,140
-I'm your manager.
-What?

371
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,893
I've already soared. Now, it's your turn.

372
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:17,897
As your manager, I'll stay by your side
and help you soar.

373
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,398
You will?

374
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:23,194
By the way, why were you so late today?

375
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,698
Arrive an hour early starting tomorrow.

376
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,909
There you go nagging again.

377
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:32,036
The competition is only two weeks away.

378
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,996
Come on, Mr. Sim!

379
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,749
You shouldn't slack off.

380
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:43,714
-How are you feeling today?
-I'm feeling okay.

381
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,341
Really? You're feeling okay?

382
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:48,886
He's feeling okay.

383
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,890
Shoulders down. Jump!

384
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,477
Bigger!

385
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:01,774
You keep looking downward. Look up.

386
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:11,409
Look up.

387
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,966
Mr. Sim never fails to impress me.

388
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,050
I know.

389
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,805
Why did you call me over?

390
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,607
-Here.
-What is this?

391
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,823
It cost me more than the first one.

392
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,367
It looks like it.

393
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,081
I'm proposing to you.

394
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,126
I know.

395
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,838
Then why the lukewarm reaction?

396
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,923
What's the matter?

397
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,385
I'm not sure.

398
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,431
Don't tell me it's me.

399
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,393
Forget it then.

400
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,567
I'm home.

401
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,829
What's this glove?

402
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,009
It's from your grandpa.

403
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:01,644
I had played baseball
up until middle school.

404
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,605
-You did?
-Yes.

405
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,816
Does it not suit me?

406
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,530
That's not why. I'm just surprised.

407
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,990
I thought you were a bookworm.

408
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,828
I only studied because I could no longer
play baseball.

409
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,919
Were you happy when you played baseball?

410
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:34,093
Yes. I was.

411
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,640
At least you know what made you happy.

412
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,186
Eun-ho.

413
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,899
I hadn't realized this

414
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,443
until now.

415
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:55,573
Thank you.

416
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,410
And I'm sorry.

417
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,873
Watching your grandpa perform on stage

418
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,793
reminded me of you.

419
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:13,757
I wondered if you'd also smile
from ear to ear

420
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:17,761
if you did what you loved.

421
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:21,890
Dad.

422
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,523
Eun-ho, follow your heart
and do what you love.

423
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,484
Do what makes you happy.

424
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:35,821
Okay.

425
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:46,332
Why did you gather us here
so early in the morning, Seong-gwan?

426
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:47,833
Is Yeong-il running late?

427
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,586
-He's at the orientation.
-Hello, Dad.

428
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:52,755
-Please sit down.
-Okay.

429
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,215
Is today a special day or something?

430
00:43:55,758 --> 00:44:00,054
Seong-gwan, are you going on a blind date?

431
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,683
You'll find out, Father.
Let's watch together.

432
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,688
Shoulders up.

433
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:14,610
Devant. Slowly brush your foot.

434
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,905
Raise your leg. Relevé lent.

435
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:21,241
Passé.

436
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:24,286
Keep your knee up.

437
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,996
Keep your knee up.

438
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,499
Keep your knee up.

439
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:29,583
Your knee.

440
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:31,710
Keep it…

441
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,339
Let me try again.

442
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,216
Tighten your abs.

443
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,928
Elbows up.

444
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:47,768
Father.

445
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:01,281
Gosh.

446
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:07,121
I can see that you've been practicing
every day.

447
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:10,165
Right? I didn't lie, Chae-rok.

448
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,459
I can testify to that.

449
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,395
THANKS FOR WATCHING THE DOCUMENTARY
BALLERINO SIM DEOK-CHUL

450
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:30,162
You turned me into a stunning man
when I'm nowhere close to that.

451
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,582
Thank you for recording my finale.

452
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:41,673
Do you know what I desperately longed for

453
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,052
after finding out about your illness?

454
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:48,931
Time.

455
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:55,771
I wished you'd remember me
for a bit longer.

456
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,400
I wished you'd stay by my side
for a while longer.

457
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,029
I thought I was the only one
who felt that way.

458
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:05,697
But while editing the video,

459
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:08,575
I could see that you felt the same.

460
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:15,123
The time you had spent doing ballet
was extremely precious to you.

461
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:18,085
Seong-gwan.

462
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:21,797
I'm…

463
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,467
going to return to the hospital.

464
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,177
What?

465
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,931
What patients need the most is time.

466
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:34,893
And doctors can prolong it.

467
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,606
I'm going to put my heart into it.

468
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:41,858
Good.

469
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:44,945
You made the right decision.

470
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:03,672
Thanks.

471
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:22,899
Here.

472
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:28,905
My uncle told me to give it to you later,
but I thought it would help.

473
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,368
I had thought you were born with it.

474
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:36,288
So I was extremely jealous.

475
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:38,790
But watching that made me feel bad.

476
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:41,585
I could see how much time
you spent practicing.

477
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:44,963
Give it your best shot, Chae-rok.

478
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,049
Okay.

479
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,677
By the way,

480
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:52,971
I found it.

481
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,016
You did?

482
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,810
I knew you would. Congratulations.

483
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:02,314
This was a first.

484
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:04,232
A colleague introduced it to me

485
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,943
and I went to the radio station
without expecting much.

486
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:11,615
The normal me would've said no to it.

487
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:16,578
But that day, I thought,
"I don't care anymore.

488
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:17,954
Let's just give it a try.

489
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:23,251
I'll do it until I find something
that I truly love."

490
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,546
And that's where you found it.

491
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,090
Yes.

492
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:31,426
Calling this a "dream" is too grand.

493
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,679
But one thing I can say for sure

494
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:36,098
is that each day is exciting.

495
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:40,977
I feel happy when I enter the studio.

496
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:44,940
It's all thanks to you. Thanks, Chae-rok.

497
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,114
I hope you'll continue to stay happy.

498
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:55,951
I'll look forward
to your own radio show one day.

499
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:58,120
Okay.

500
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:13,927
Chae-rok.

501
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:18,056
-Let's go.
-Okay.

502
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:38,452
Mr. Sim.

503
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:42,080
He insisted on seeing you off,
so I tagged along.

504
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,460
Right. This is my dad.

505
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:51,590
I apologize for the overdue greeting.
I'm his dad.

506
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:55,260
Hello. I had always wanted to meet you.

507
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:58,305
I don't know how to thank you.

508
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,933
Thank you so much
for taking good care of him.

509
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:05,228
Not at all. He was the one
who took good care of me.

510
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,313
I'm more grateful.

511
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:11,651
Chae-rok, have you packed everything?

512
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,362
Don't get sick or injured.

513
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:17,491
Make sure you eat
even if you don't like their food, okay?

514
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:23,288
-You stay healthy too.
-Okay.

515
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,626
I'll go alone from here.

516
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:29,753
All right.

517
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:32,672
Goodbye.

518
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,176
Good luck.

519
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:41,723
Bye, Mr. Ki.

520
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:51,710
Chae-rok!

521
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:03,096
I shouldn't forget your face.

522
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:20,447
That's enough.

523
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:24,784
You should go now.
You're going to be late.

524
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:32,834
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

525
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:55,792
3 YEARS LATER

526
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:01,047
Oh, dear.

527
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,426
He's left again.

528
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,303
You have a letter.

529
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:09,347
-A letter?
-Yes.

530
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:14,269
I'M SORRY.
MY HUSBAND IS A BIT ILL.

531
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:16,104
PLEASE CALL THE NUMBER BELOW

532
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:25,780
SIM DEOK-CHUL'S CURRENT LOCATION

533
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,994
You have a letter.

534
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:32,954
He's back again.

535
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,207
How did you come this far?

536
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:39,377
-I'm sorry, ma'am.
-It's okay.

537
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:43,923
Let me go.
I still have more letters to deliver.

538
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,301
You can do it tomorrow.
Let's go, Deok-chul.

539
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:48,303
Wait. Who are you?

540
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:50,472
Why are you dragging me?
I don't want to go.

541
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:53,224
Who do you think I am? I'm Hae-nam.

542
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:55,977
I bought ice cream.
Are you really not going to go home?

543
00:55:57,312 --> 00:56:00,231
-Ice cream?
-Yes. Vanilla ice cream.

544
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:01,775
Then let's go.

545
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:05,820
By the way, who are you?
Why are you buying me ice cream?

546
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:07,572
I said I'm Hae-nam!

547
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:14,370
Deok-chul, Chae-rok is coming.

548
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:17,123
-I see.
-Do you remember him?

549
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:24,506
I told Chae-rok

550
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:28,134
not to be hurt
even if you don't remember him.

551
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:31,221
He said it was all right

552
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:34,224
because he still remembers you.

553
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:37,977
Isn't he so sweet?
Aren't you proud of him?

554
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,899
When will it snow?

555
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,278
There you go asking about snow again.

556
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:58,164
So, you want to try ballet?

557
00:56:59,124 --> 00:56:59,958
Yes.

558
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,961
I could do splits in my 20s.

559
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:06,881
My ankles are still thick and sturdy.

560
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,383
As long as I know how,

561
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:12,345
I think I'll be able to do
up to 30 or 40 turns at once.

562
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:14,639
-That many?
-Yes.

563
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:15,890
Do you want to see?

564
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:20,186
A bit more.

565
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,564
-You can go down a bit more.
-I'm sorry.

566
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:27,944
-Come to class starting next week.
-Sorry?

567
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:30,613
-Please, come.
-Are you serious?

568
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:37,078
Thank you, sir.
How would you like me to pay?

569
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:38,413
You can pay next time.

570
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:40,415
Thank you very much.

571
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:02,103
Another one?

572
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:04,689
And a rookie at that?

573
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:08,401
Hey. That's not how a coach should treat
a troupe's leader.

574
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,445
Don't forget how you treated Heung-sik.

575
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:12,155
This is different.

576
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,241
I'm your husband.

577
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:24,334
Never in my wildest dreams did I think
I'd be running a ballet company with you.

578
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,169
Me neither.

579
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:28,421
It's fun, though.

580
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:32,717
It's all thanks to Chae-rok and Mr. Sim.

581
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,887
You met him at the orthopedic clinic.

582
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:36,971
Did he remember you?

583
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:40,225
No, he didn't.

584
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,561
Maybe it's because
I'll never see it again,

585
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:47,565
but I think about Mr. Sim's performance
of Swan Lake from time to time.

586
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,108
Me too.

587
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:52,487
He was the most magnificent swan
I've ever seen.

588
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,407
Chae-rok must've landed.

589
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:07,835
I'm afraid our third interview
fell through.

590
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:11,172
They're neither picking up
nor reading my texts.

591
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:13,633
What? Why didn't you tell us sooner?

592
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:16,052
Sir, let's find a replacement first.

593
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:19,305
Since we're in a hurry,
let's just do a call-in.

594
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:21,099
Any candidates?

595
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:24,435
What about Professor Song Jeong-hui?

596
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:27,939
We've spoken before. She's in the Climate
and Environment Association.

597
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:29,399
She even published a thesis recently.

598
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:31,818
-Good. Call her right now.
-Okay.

599
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:32,944
Hurry.

600
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:34,946
I told you to check on time.

601
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:44,122
HEAD CONSULTANT

602
00:59:56,801 --> 01:00:00,722
Don't forget Chae-rok is coming today.
Everybody, be home by 7:00 p.m.

603
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:04,392
Seong-san, you just don't change, do you?

604
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:10,023
-Sir, I'm done organizing the materials.
-Yes?

605
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,274
Right.

606
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:14,235
Good job.

607
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:25,997
AE-RAN: YOU JUST NEVER CHANGE. OKAY.
SEONG-GWAN: I AGREE.

608
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,248
SEONG-GWAN: I'LL HURRY

609
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:29,083
SEONG-SUK: I CAN'T BE LATE
WHEN I MOVED NEXT DOOR

610
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,335
YEONG-IL: I'LL SEE YOU LATER!

611
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,924
Why isn't this kid replying?

612
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:40,178
EUN-HO: OKAY!

613
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:41,846
Good.

614
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:44,766
LEE CHAE-ROK'S HOMECOMING PERFORMANCE

615
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:51,439
You've come to the right place.

616
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:56,277
I was the physician who took care
of ballerino Lee Chae-rok.

617
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:58,655
When it comes to ballet,

618
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:02,325
you'll have to do things like fondu.

619
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:06,037
And… You'll have to use your muscles.

620
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,247
You must know quite a bit about ballet.

621
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:12,001
I must've become famous.
Many dancers visit me and--

622
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:14,087
-Hey.
-Hi, Seung-joo.

623
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:17,090
-You should've called.
-Chae-rok has succeeded.

624
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:19,300
Look who's talking. I heard you won.

625
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:23,137
-That's not news.
-Is this your third or fourth win?

626
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:28,768
Go forward!

627
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:32,355
-Right side is clear!
-Over here!

628
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:34,440
Go in! Right there!

629
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,859
Ho-beom! Watch the line!

630
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:42,782
-Good job!
-Nice shot!

631
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:51,916
We shouldn't have worn the same uniform.

632
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,710
I agree, you bastard.

633
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:56,462
How will you make it
into the First Division?

634
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:01,884
Hey, did you read the news?
Chae-rok is coming back.

635
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:04,095
Yes. He called.

636
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:07,348
Everyone is talking about him.

637
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:09,058
He's not the Chae-rok I once knew.

638
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,820
KOREAN BALLET STAR LEE CHAE-ROK RETURNS

639
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:29,245
LEE CHAE-ROK,
FROM STUDENT TO STAR BALLERINO

640
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:31,205
BECOMES TOP DANCER
AFTER 1 YEAR OF JOINING

641
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:39,130
Hello, this is the soccer club.

642
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:44,135
LEE CHAE-ROK'S HOMECOMING PERFORMANCE

643
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:55,730
When will it snow?

644
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,208
It's snowing.

645
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:49,659
STOP

646
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:23,234
Mr. Sim.

647
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:27,405
I'm back.

648
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,475
Did you soar?

649
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:22,144
Deok-chul.

650
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,982
Even if you lose your memory entirely,

651
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:29,902
I truly hope you'll remember
this one thing.

652
01:06:31,612 --> 01:06:33,823
Don't forget

653
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:36,909
that you used to do ballet

654
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:41,372
and that you had a dream.

655
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:44,250
Okay?

656
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:47,878
What are you doing?
Aren't you going to practice?

657
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:49,380
I'm coming!

658
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:05,771
I've taught this so many times,
why are you still terrible?

659
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,482
Nobody's good right off the bat.

660
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:10,109
I was good from the start.

661
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:13,320
