00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,563
He shouldn't have rushed.

NOVEMBER 7
CHAE-ROK'S COMPETITION

4
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:24,167
OCTOBER 5, DRANK ICED AMERICANO
HAD DIARRHEA ABOUT 3 TIMES

5
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,587
Gosh, this is a human rights violation.

6
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,924
How much did he write?

NAME: SIM DEOK-CHUL
ADDRESS: 11, SILLIM-RO 3GA-GIL, GWANAK-GU

8
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:37,722
This is so old-fashioned.

NAME: SIM DEOK-CHUL
ADDRESS: 11, SILLIM-RO 3GA-GIL, GWANAK-GU

10
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:47,232
MY NAME IS SIM DEOK-CHUL.
I HAVE ALZHEIMER'S.

11
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:02,747
MY NAME IS SIM DEOK-CHUL.
I HAVE ALZHEIMER'S.

12
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,162
Are you saying I have…

13
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,289
Yes, you have Alzheimer's.

14
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:47,500
A neurodegenerative disease
and the most common cause of dementia.

15
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:48,626
Dementia…

16
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,381
What am I supposed to do now?

17
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:57,051
-Did you come here by yourself?
-I did.

18
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,470
First, tell your family.

19
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:03,600
At this early stage,
you only forget things occasionally

20
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,727
and your condition progresses slowly.

21
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,687
But it may suddenly take a turn
for the worse.

22
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,232
It's best to tell them as soon as possible
and receive help.

23
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,903
Can I get another checkup?

24
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,571
What year is it?

25
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,281
It's 2020.

26
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,284
Remember these three things
that I'm about to tell you

27
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,287
and say them back to me when I ask you to.

28
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,373
Cherry blossoms, car, and hat.

29
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,418
"Cherry blossoms, car, and hat."

30
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,629
-What is 100 minus 7?
-It's 93.

31
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,089
Say A, B, C, D backwards.

32
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,717
D, C, B, A.

33
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,386
What am I holding?

34
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,304
A pencil.

35
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,265
What are the three things I told you?

36
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,144
Well…

37
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,814
They were…

38
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,068
Hold on.

39
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,237
They were…

40
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,575
If you can't tell your family right away,
it may help to start taking notes.

41
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,911
From what you ate to whom you met,

42
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,996
write down every little thing

43
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,540
and turn them into habits.

44
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,544
Even if your symptoms worsen,
your habits will remain.

45
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,214
Like you'll never forget
how to use a spoon.

46
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:19,759
But if you start having trouble
remembering the things you wrote down,

47
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,636
please do come back for a check-up.

48
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,888
Give up driving as well.

49
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:58,089

SENDER: SIM DEOK-CHUL

51
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,650
It's such a beautiful day.

52
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,737
So sunny and clear.

53
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,952
So why…

54
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,956
Why on earth…

55
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,006
Mom. Dad.

56
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,344
What do I do now?

57
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,843
EPISODE 8

58
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,862
NAME: SIM DEOK-CHUL

59
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,868
MR. SIM

60
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,383
Can we stop celebrating
my birthday together?

61
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,468
I'll be 40 soon.

62
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,930
-Here.
-Do I have to wear this?

63
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,432
Once you get married,
we'll stop doing this.

64
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:22,061
Hey, don't you know we're doing this
so that you won't feel lonely?

65
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,772
-Do you think I have no friends?
-You don't.

66
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,609
Then I might as well not have…
Mom, tell me I'm adopted.

67
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,612
-Gosh, don't say such a thing.
-Goodness.

68
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,739
When is Father coming? He's late.

69
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,200
He's picking up a picture.

70
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,368
Picture?

71
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,829
Do you mean the one

72
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,082
you took at the studio recently
on your wedding anniversary?

73
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,792
Yes, that one.

74
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,461
He and I had never taken any photos
just by ourselves.

75
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,923
You guys have become more lovey-dovey
with age.

76
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,384
I refuse to take any photos
past the age of 60.

77
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:56,304
-I'll be too wrinkly and ugly.
-Honey.

78
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,348
Fine, don't. Do you think
we took them to impress anyone?

79
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:03,144
I was only talking about myself.
Sorry, Mom.

80
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,229
You talk too much.

81
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,690
And did that affect you at all?

82
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:11,027
-You always twist my words like that.
-I must be adopted for sure.

83
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,863
-You're the one who started it.
-It was you.

84
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:14,780
Did I ever say

85
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,449
-that you inconvenienced me?
-How nice.

86
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,171
Chae-rok.

87
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,924
What are you doing here?

88
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,345
-I was just…
-Come in.

89
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,764
Wait.

90
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:46,520
Aren't you here to see my grandpa?
Let's go inside then.

91
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,481
No, that's not necessary.

92
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:51,609
Hello.

93
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,570
Goodness. I'm glad you're here.

94
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,489
Say hi.

95
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,075
He's your dad's ballet instructor.

96
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,787
-He's Chae-rok. Lee Chae-rok.
-I see.

97
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,373
Wait. "Lee Chae-rok"?

98
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,749
Who's Lee Chae-rok?

99
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,502
Oh, that Lee Chae-rok?

100
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,671
-Sit down. Hello.
-It's nice to meet you.

101
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,632
Judging by his outfit,
he must be a ballet instructor indeed.

102
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,509
-Right.
-I was practicing before coming here.

103
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,595
Please drink some water and calm…

104
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,349
-Damn it!
-Oh, no. I'm sorry.

105
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,522
I've never met a ballerino before.

106
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,982
You have a great body.

107
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,067
Nice seeing you again.

108
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:35,277
-Yes.
-What?

109
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:36,987
Do you know each other?

110
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:39,949
It seems like you do as well.

111
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,243
No, I don't.

112
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:46,705
By the way,
how come you guys came here together?

113
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,958
-Well--
-When I was an intern, he was there too.

114
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,627
-That's so fascinating.
-It is.

115
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:55,256
-That's wonderful.
-I doubt you were an intern.

116
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,715
Were you a part-timer?

117
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,467
Dancers must have a lot of free time.

118
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,803
They teach ballet
and work part-time as well.

119
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,805
You have the most time,

120
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,348
being nosy.

121
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,934
-What?
-Seong-san, that's enough.

122
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,353
Have some manners
in front of the instructor.

123
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,355
-I'm fine.
-I'm not.

124
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,816
How dare you mistreat my guest?

125
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,819
If you're going to keep this up
in front of your dad, just leave.

126
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,697
Come on, Mom. What did I do so wrong?

127
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,324
Fine, I'll stop.

128
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,702
-What? I think he's here.
-What?

129
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,996
-Dad.
-I'm sorry for being late.

130
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,581
-Hello.
-Hello.

131
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,168
What? Chae-rok.

132
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,796
What? Is something wrong?
What brings you here?

133
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,592
Come to the studio earlier from now on.

134
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,927
We'll be prolonging our class
by 30 minutes.

135
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,723
That long? Wait. Is that why you're here?

136
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,517
Now that you know, I'll get going.

137
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,311
No, stay. Have dinner with us.

138
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,062
-Yes, eat with us.
-Yes.

139
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,857
-We have delicious marinated crabs.
-He's right. Sit down.

140
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,610
-Eun-ho, make room for him.
-Sit over there.

141
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,530
You've changed, Seung-joo.

142
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,657
What is it this time?

143
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,869
You went all the way there
just for Mr. Sim.

144
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,747
You know how to comfort others now.

145
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,957
Are you finally human?

146
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,128
Not yet, but I do know
how to comfort people now.

147
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,713
But why all of a sudden?

148
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,132
He looked graceful.

149
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,009
When that old man

150
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:25,429
reached out his arms and lifted his legs
with all his might…

151
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:29,391
It wasn't even a repertoire.
Just some center exercises.

152
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,351
But I was moved.

153
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,688
Perhaps, that's what ballet is all about.

154
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:39,318
The audience can be impressed
by 32 fouettés, but they won't be moved.

155
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,281
You've matured.

156
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,661
I've matured ages ago.
I was just enlightened.

157
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,329
You'll be a great coach.

158
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,249
-You won't get paid much, though.
-I'm not doing it.

159
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,964
There's only crabmeat in here.
It's very delicious.

160
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,716
Have a spoonful. Like this.

161
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:04,885
Okay.

162
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,431
Good.

163
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,643
How long have you been doing ballet?

164
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,688
-It's been about four years.
-I see.

165
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,732
That's not that long, is it?

166
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,778
Those who pursue art or sports
usually start from the age of 6 or 7.

167
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:26,282
-You're right. I did start late.
-I see.

168
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,785
-Are you any good?
-Seong-suk.

169
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,162
Yes.

170
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,836
I didn't expect you to say that.

171
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,089
I like you. I'll give you a pass.

172
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,384
How about our father?

173
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,637
Why would you ask him that?

174
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,765
Exactly. It's obvious what he'll say.

175
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,935
Even I feel sore all over after hiking.

176
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,063
Since he's much older,
it'll be quite difficult.

177
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,567
He actually debuted today.

178
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,570
He did? Where?

179
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,071
My god, really?

180
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,867
What? It wasn't much. I just performed
for a bit in front of some people.

181
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,660
Goodness.

182
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,495
That's what a debut is.

183
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,290
He performed in front of a ballet troupe.

184
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:19,627
He was terrific. They applauded him.

185
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,420
He received an applause?

186
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,884
You're truly amazing. You're the best.

187
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,761
This is what I'm talking about.

188
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,930
People need to challenge themselves.

189
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:35,017
This cheers me up. I feel great.

190
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,061
May I have some ginseng liquor?

191
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,188
Gosh, you and your mood.

192
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,857
Do you enjoy emptying our liquor?

193
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,735
You finished the raspberry wine as well,
didn't you?

194
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,528
You're truly the best.

195
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,406
Don't drink too much.

196
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,702
-Just have one drink. Mom.
-Here is the ginseng liquor.

197
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:58,332
-He's impossible.
-My mother-in-law made it herself.

198
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,502
Does anyone else want some?

199
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,837
-Do you want some?
-No, I'm good.

200
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,381
You should have a glass.

201
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,174
No thanks.

202
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,224
Happy birthday.

203
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,351
Whatever.

204
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,189
I can't believe we do this every year.

205
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,024
I envy you.

206
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,945
At least you have a family
to celebrate it with.

207
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,202
Did you come out for some peace and quiet?

208
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,330
Thanks.

209
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,043
Uncle, I'm sorry.

210
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,467
This is how family is like, Chae-rok.

211
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,521
By the way,

212
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,649
did something happen to Grandpa?

213
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,900
What?

214
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,821
You kept staring at him.

215
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,574
Oh, that?

216
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,327
I just wanted to see
how he was like at home.

217
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:21,498
Why? Did he say something to you?

218
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,418
No, he didn't.

219
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,338
No one except for my dad

220
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,759
disapproves of him doing ballet.

221
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,637
And like you saw back there,
Grandma scolded him as well.

222
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:40,559
He's healthy,
so I'm sure no one is worried.

223
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:58,202
-You can head home.
-Let me walk you just to there.

224
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,079
I'm not a kid.

225
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,291
Mr. Sim.

226
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,337
It's dark out.
Will you be able to go home safely?

227
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,923
I'm not a kid, Chae-rok.

228
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,050
Your bus is here.

229
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,095
Get home safe. Thanks for today.

230
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,222
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

231
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,698
I can check this off my list now.

232
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:24,079
-Deok-chul.
-Coming.

233
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,019
-Mr. Sim.
-Yes?

234
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,521
-Aren't you forgetting something?
-I already paid.

235
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:54,026
Right. I forgot about that.

236
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,661
Mr. Sim!

237
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,497
Where have you been?

238
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:10,292
You had me worried.
I looked everywhere for you.

239
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,669
You looked for me? Why?

240
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,070
Eun-ho.

241
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,739
-Yes?
-Check if Mr. Yoo Seung-min is on his way.

242
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,157
Okay.

243
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,534
-Ms. Kim, can you come here?
-Okay.

244
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,580
Do you have his number?

245
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,542
Right.

246
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,930
Are you on your way? Hello?

247
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,098
Who are you?

248
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,517
I'm Sim Eun-ho.

249
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,312
Ms. Sim.

250
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,995
Hold on. What's my agenda for today?

251
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,714
Where is it?

252
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:58,775
I found it.

253
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,235
I left it here.

254
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,945
Thank goodness I found it.

255
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:04,323
What did you leave behind?

256
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,534
What? Hey. It's nothing.

257
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:12,289
Hey, I really like my name tag.

258
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,374
It wasn't me.

259
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,044
Gosh, are you shy?

260
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,837
-Get changed already.
-Okay.

261
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,760
I feel great since Chae-rok's so nice.

262
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:34,853
Gosh, they've aged a lot.

263
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:40,358
He finished the entire bottle
and is still asleep.

264
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,360
He's sleeping like a baby.

265
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:46,114
Tell me about it.
I told him to only have one glass.

266
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,742
Hey, jobless politician.

267
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,535
Get up!

268
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,287
Aren't we going home?

269
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:58,001
You can stay and have lunch.

270
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,512
-Mom.
-Why? Do you not want to?

271
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,265
I'm going to stop trying.

272
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,357
Seong-suk.

273
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,717
Try it yourself.

274
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,070
What was it again?

275
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,406
What's the next step again?

276
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:12,909
Concentrate. It's fondu to the back.

277
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:14,536
Try it.

278
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,204
Sorry.

279
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,374
To the back. Straighten both of your legs.

280
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:20,876
Turn out your knees.

281
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,253
Keep your toes tense.

282
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,761
SO-RI

283
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,398
Come on.

284
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:44,983
KIM HEUNG-SIK

285
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,826
SO-RI

286
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:00,790
Hey, So-ri. Can you not find someone else?

287
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,209
Stop calling.

288
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,960
Then don't pick up. Should I hang up?

289
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,214
Seriously…

290
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,383
What will you do if I agree to do it?

291
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:13,970
Forget it.

292
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:15,555
Give me back my piano.

293
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:19,392
Fine. Every visit is worth two keys.

294
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:22,604
-Hey, then how many times do I--
-Deal.

295
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,320
God, she's a devil.

296
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,206
Chae-rok, I'm done.

297
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,377
Chae-rok.

298
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,882
What are you thinking about?

299
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:55,095
-Are you already done?
-Yes.

300
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,596
Do it again.

301
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:58,682
I did it three times.

302
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,100
You only did it once.

303
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:04,271
That's not true. That's really not true.

304
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,022
Wait. Mr. Ki.

305
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:10,235
I have something urgent to tell you.

306
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,071
Sure. This way, please.

307
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:14,197
Thank you.

308
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,784
I'm telling you. I did it three times.

309
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,287
What is this about?

310
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,208
I was really nervous
that I'd make a mistake.

311
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,544
My mind went completely blank.

312
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:30,755
But just like what he said, I told myself

313
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,258
to follow through even if I made mistakes.

314
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,260
You did well.

315
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:39,431
Speaking of which,
if it's not too much trouble,

316
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:42,225
may I tag along to the rehearsal
from time to time?

317
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:45,186
I'd just like to watch them perform.

318
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:49,024
Chae-rok told me that watching
others perform would also help.

319
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,192
Sure.

320
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,611
Is that a yes? Thank you, sir.

321
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,406
You can watch and also perform at times.

322
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,242
"Perform"? Me?

323
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,039
Then I should go practice.

324
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,833
Chae-rok, take your time. Thank you.

325
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,504
What was that about?

326
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,841
I have been intrigued by him as well.

327
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:17,302
Did you see how he just ran out?

328
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,930
Even if he can't perform on stage,

329
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:24,142
I'd like him to solely focus on ballet
when he's dancing.

330
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,811
I should give him some motivation.

331
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,108
Mr. Ki.

332
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,278
About Mr. Sim…

333
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,738
What is it?

334
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:40,992
Never mind.

335
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,212
-Let's call it a day.
-Okay.

336
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:03,181
Class is prolonged by 30 minutes
starting from today.

337
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,314
By the way, is it going to rain?

338
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,650
I feel heavy.

339
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:18,029
At times like this, I should go
to the bathhouse and soak myself.

340
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,115
It's nice to relax in some hot water.

341
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,699
What are you talking about?

342
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,493
Take a shower and stretch at home.

343
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,578
Bathhouses are different from showers.

344
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:28,873
It's always great to have some banana milk
after taking a bath.

345
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:32,669
Men tend to bond better at bathhouses.

346
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:37,382
-So Chae-rok, let's go together.
-No, thanks.

347
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,675
Come on.

348
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,385
Let's go together.

349
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:43,805
Come and scrub my back.

350
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,893
I understand. Who would want to go there
with an old geezer?

351
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,353
That's not it.

352
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,689
After my kids grew up,
I've been going alone.

353
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,399
It's all right.

354
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:58,778
I won't be able to scrub my back.
I wonder who will do it for me.

355
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,322
Don't be cheap like that.

356
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,284
Do you think the guy next to me
would scrub it for me?

357
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,204
Whatever. Let's just go.

358
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,331
My house is this way.

359
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,000
You need to scrub your back.

360
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,460
Then you're coming with me?

361
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,962
You're paying.

362
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,672
Of course!

363
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,758
The banana milk is on me as well.

364
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,885
I feel great. I'll buy you two of them.

365
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,223
Gosh, that feels great.

366
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,018
It feels like I'm taking a bath
with my grandson.

367
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,937
You might as well consider me one.

368
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,981
I'm sure they all think that way.

369
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,566
Do you think so?

370
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:39,110
Goodness, my grandson scrubs so well.

371
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,237
You're skilled, and it doesn't even hurt.

372
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,036
Do you think it'll get better?

373
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,955
What? What do you mean?

374
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,124
My relationship with my dad.

375
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:57,337
Do you think we'll be able to bond
if we took a bath together?

376
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:05,094
I don't have many memories with him.

377
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:09,808
I remember being trained, scolded,

378
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,726
and beaten.

379
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,853
That's all I remember.

380
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:21,152
I'm sure you've guessed it
after the billiard hall incident.

381
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,655
My dad…

382
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,033
beat his students while coaching them.

383
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,537
That's why he went to prison.

384
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,458
And that's when

385
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,503
my mom passed away.

386
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,550
I really hated him.

387
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,970
I didn't want to ever see him again.

388
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,599
But I keep thinking about him.

389
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:55,895
Chae-rok.

390
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,486
Two adults, please.

391
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:30,555
-Deok-chul.
-Yes?

392
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,057
I'm sorry.

393
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,981
Those words melted my heart.

394
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:44,485
I thought I was the only one who was sad
about not pursuing ballet.

395
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:48,698
But that was when I found out
that my dad felt the same way.

396
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,453
I'm sure your dad feels the same way.

397
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,914
He just didn't say it out loud.

398
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,209
And of course, there are memories.

399
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,630
You were just too little to remember.

400
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:08,968
I'm sure your dad took you
to bathhouses and streams.

401
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,473
It'll get better, Chae-rok.

402
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,976
Like it did for my dad and me.

403
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,660
Look at this majestic snow.

404
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,120
It's not majestic.

405
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:39,707
Chae-rok, I've finally begun
to like snow again.

406
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,419
As an adult, I never liked snow.

407
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,547
I had to clean it up
because it'd get slippery.

408
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,468
I'd get grumpy since it'd be difficult
to deliver the letters.

409
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:54,555
But now, it's fascinating to see snow.
It gives me butterflies.

410
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,641
I feel like something's going to happen.

411
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,559
Aren't I strange?

412
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:04,816
No, you're not. People are capricious.

413
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:08,319
Anyway, go home and review
what you learned today.

414
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,947
Do 100 reps of ab workout this weekend.

415
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,283
I'll be testing you on Monday,
so do a proper job.

416
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:15,785
A hundred reps?

417
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:18,079
-Then how about 200?
- No, 100 seems good.

418
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,790
Chae-rok, see you next week.

419
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,961
Don't run, or you might trip.

420
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,130
Don't worry!

421
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:43,479
You recently went to Chuncheon to find
your deceased patient. How did it go?

422
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:44,564
Did you find them?

423
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:45,982
No.

424
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:49,569
It was a flop. See?
I knew you wouldn't be able to find them.

425
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:52,613
Cut this nonsense and come back.

426
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,574
I'm going with plan B.

427
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:56,659
Plan B, my ass.

428
00:33:56,743 --> 00:34:00,955
You need to be doused with rain
to your underwear to come to your senses.

429
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,207
I'm off.

430
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:07,336
Hey. It was your birthday recently.

431
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,631
It's not much, but spend it
on your documentary.

432
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,133
What is this?

433
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:13,634
Do you not want it?

434
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,682
Bye.

435
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,599
It's to your right.

436
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,181
Well done, Mr. Sim.

437
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:50,857
YOUR GRANDFATHER IS A BIT UNWELL

438
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,578
YOUR GRANDFATHER HAS ALZHEIMER'S

439
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,463
Why did I say, "I'm Sim Eun-ho"?

440
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:17,091
It's so embarrassing.

441
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,678
They gave me an earful.

442
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:25,600
I need to learn how to make calls
all over again at this age.

443
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,270
How serious is this
that you're even buying me coffee?

444
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:30,855
What?

445
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,360
Well…

446
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,864
I was just kidding.

447
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,450
But I guess you do have something to say.

448
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:46,037
I have to be careful with my words
around you.

449
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,122
You really take after Mr. Sim.

450
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,168
I just wanted to get coffee with you.

451
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:55,463
Thanks for the coffee.

452
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:15,483
Hey! I was on a stakeout.

453
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,276
What is this? Why are you alone?

454
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,071
Did your girlfriend not give you a ride?

455
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,572
We're not dating.

456
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,783
Why the long face?

457
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:25,701
Don't tell me…

458
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:29,038
Did you two break up already?
Did you get dumped?

459
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,915
No.

460
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,584
Then what is it?

461
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,341
I couldn't tell Eun-ho.

462
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,386
I didn't know if it was right.

463
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:48,891
It's driving me crazy.

464
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,728
I scored a goal today.

465
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,941
What the hell are you talking about?

466
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,818
Why would a goalkeeper score a goal?

467
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:01,320
Exactly. It doesn't make any sense.

468
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:05,199
But that's exactly what you're doing
right now.

469
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,452
As the goalkeeper,
you should defend your goal post,

470
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,329
not try to score a goal.

471
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:12,873
Mr. Sim is the striker.

472
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,127
He's the one who must overcome

473
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,672
his opponents' tackles and score a goal.

474
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,050
Quit kicking the ball yourself.

475
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,680
Just have his back and be patient.

476
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,266
Is it too nerve-racking?

477
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:32,560
Then cheer for him.

478
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:33,978
Applaud him.

479
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,107
Then he'll score that goal.

480
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,068
Do you really believe so?

481
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,111
I do.

482
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,572
Trust your striker.

483
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:59,045
Thirty-one, thirty-two,
thirty-three, thirty-four…

484
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:02,048
Hae-nam, do you want to work out with me?

485
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,217
I'll be tested on Monday.

486
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,097
Mom.

487
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,726
I'm going to stop trying.

488
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,942
Seong-suk.

489
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:26,030
I'm going to listen to him.

490
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:30,034
The fortune-teller said
that I'd at least have one son.

491
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,080
But I guess it's not true.

492
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,420
Goodness, my poor baby.

493
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,633
My poor, beautiful child.

494
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,185
Hae-nam.

495
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,300
He always gave me wake-up calls
even on the weekends.

496
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,430
Hey.

497
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:36,892
Do you know
why dads become cooks on Sundays?

498
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,353
Because they don't need to work.
It's their day off.

499
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,439
Then was I to endure the pain?

500
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:45,776
Look at you. Then why haven't you
been visiting me lately?

501
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,404
You can't even compete this time.

502
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,197
How did you know?

503
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:52,533
My best friend told me.

504
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,659
Your best friend?

505
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:54,785
Mr. Sim.

506
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,914
He came here every day and asked

507
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,749
if you had stopped by,

508
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,169
how long your injury would last,

509
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,129
and if there was anything he could do.

510
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:07,631
Hey, you.

511
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,885
Do not taint my reputation

512
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,929
or betray your manager's devotion.
Got that?

513
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,265
I'll come by often, so stop nagging.

514
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:20,603
Good. But please come
during my working hours.

515
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,105
Stop bothering me during my free time.

516
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,565
Fine.

517
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,612
-Does it hurt?
-Yes.

518
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:58,140
I have a clear head today.

519
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,687
What is all this?

520
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,314
I'm making some deodeok wine.

521
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,942
-Are you going out right now?
-Yes.

522
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,819
Why are you making this out of the blue?
Who's drinking it?

523
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,155
Yeong-il.

524
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:14,782
Yeong-il?

525
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,326
You said

526
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:21,872
he was considerate, and you were right.

527
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:25,417
I thought he was always out
because he had no kids,

528
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,211
so I'd give him an earful.

529
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:29,255
"Mother."

530
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,800
He's never sulked in front of me.

531
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:36,887
I'm sure he was always forcing a smile.

532
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:40,724
Deok-chul.

533
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,018
Seong-suk…

534
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,355
wants to stop trying.

535
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,485
-Do you want my help?
-It's okay.

536
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,781
You're taking a test today, right?
Make sure you ace it.

537
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:57,741
Okay.

538
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,509
Maybe I should've picked him up.

539
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,987
-Hurry up and get changed.
-Okay.

540
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:44,413
Get close to him! Defend!

541
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:46,665
-Stop the ball! Hurry!
-Shoot!

542
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,836
Hey, we blocked it.

543
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,048
-I blocked it.
-Stop him.

544
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:58,427
Oh, come on!

545
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:14,693
Coach Shin, I need to go to Seoul.

546
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:17,821
Right. You said he got hurt.

547
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,785
Yes. I wasn't that great of a parent.

548
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,662
I should at least visit him.

549
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:29,291
Good thinking. Feed him some good food.

550
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:34,880
Yes.

551
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,091
I will.

552
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:46,308
I think I forgot something.

553
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:50,270
What day was today?

554
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:52,856
What was it?

555
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,744
HANGYEOL HOSPITAL 11 A.M.

556
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,886
-What's going on? Aren't we having class?
-What?

557
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:26,723
Are you weaseling your way
out of the test?

558
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:30,352
-I won't go easy on you so--
-Chae-rok, I need to stop by my house.

559
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:33,230
My wife is having a severe headache.

560
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:34,815
Let me buy some medicine for her.

561
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:38,402
-She is? I'll come with you.
-No. I won't be long.

562
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,613
-Mr. Sim!
-Chae-rok.

563
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:45,409
-What is it?
-Did you skip rehab last week?

564
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:46,994
The doctor just called.

565
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,954
-I was too busy and forgot.
-Hey.

566
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:51,957
Why would you be busy?

567
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:53,459
Get ready to leave.

568
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:56,003
He told you to come right now.
I'll drop you off.

569
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,713
I need to go with him.

570
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,341
He's not a kid. Worry about yourself.

571
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,260
We have class today as well.

572
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:06,138
You can ask him to push back an hour.

573
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,682
Get changed and come out.

574
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:22,905
MR. SIM, GO AHEAD AND PRACTICE WITHOUT ME

575
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:29,870
I'LL BE BACK AFTER MY REHAB TREATMENT

576
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:48,764
To be honest, I forgot
that I had our appointment today.

577
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:51,391
We can't stop the progression.

578
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:56,230
But your note-taking is meticulous.

579
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,398
I think you're still doing pretty well.

580
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,153
Are you taking your medication on time?

581
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,906
-Yes.
-Good.

582
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:09,326
You still shouldn't lower your guard.
You need to stay alert.

583
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:12,037
Your memory is slowly fading,

584
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,956
and it'll happen more frequently.

585
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,917
You may forget what you've jotted down

586
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,378
or get lost like you did last time.

587
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,507
Have you not told your family yet?

588
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:28,679
No. I can't bring myself
to tell them just yet.

589
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:38,021
Please say
the Republic of Korea backwards.

590
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,942
"Republic of Korea"?

591
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,030
Korea, of, Republic.

592
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:51,660
Plane, pencil, and pine tree.
Remember these three things.

593
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:57,583
"Plane, pencil, and pine tree."

594
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:58,834
What year is it?

595
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:04,673
Mr. Sim?

596
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:15,809
It's the year

597
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:20,063
I started ballet.

598
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:22,899
Sorry?

599
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,156
What's the day today?

600
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:34,745
It's the day my wife goes
to the bathhouse.

601
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:37,164
Which season is it?

602
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,513
I don't want to forget

603
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,850
any of the seasons.

604
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,564
I'm sorry, doctor.

605
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,650
I think…

606
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:07,986
I should leave.

607
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,891
He should've been back already.

608
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:49,444
Your memory is slowly fading,

609
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:51,446
and it'll happen more frequently.

610
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:55,534
You may forget what you've jotted down

611
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:57,828
or get lost like you did last time.

612
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,125
I'm sorry, sir.

613
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:04,543
It's okay.

614
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:46,251
Ever since that geezer beat you,
you haven't been doing well.

615
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:50,756
Right. I saw him on my way here.
Chae-rok's manager.

616
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,217
And?

617
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,720
Just saying.

618
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,504
MR. SIM

619
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:36,968
The call cannot be connected.
You will be forwarded to voicemail.

620
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,804
Please leave a message after the tone…

621
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:53,944
-Yes?
-Hello, ma'am. It's Chae-rok.

622
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,321
How's your headache?

623
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:58,532
-"Headache"?
-Mr. Sim said--

624
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:02,077
Is Mr. Sim not there?

625
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,622
What do you mean?
We haven't been in touch since he left.

626
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:10,377
Maybe he went to the convenience store.
I thought he had gone home.

627
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,712
It would've been great had he come home.

628
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,923
I'm busy, so I'm hanging up.

629
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:56,673
-Gosh, I lost again.
-What? What's that?

630
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,342
-He's still there?
-What?

631
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,109
What is it?

632
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:18,695
What?

633
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:21,573
Sir, look at me.

634
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,117
Do you really not recognize me?

635
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,870
My name is Sim Deok-chul.

636
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:31,458
Wife, Choi Hae-nam.
Eldest son, Sim Seong-san.

637
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:35,295
-Second child, Seong-suk. The youngest…
-Unbelievable.

638
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:39,674
-My home address is Seoul…
-Hey, look inside his bag.

639
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:42,928
-He must have a phone.
-No.

640
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:46,598
-Sir, one minute.
-Give it back. No.

641
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:51,269
No. Give it back.

642
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:53,730
It's mine.

643
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:56,274
MY NAME IS SIM DEOK-CHUL.
I HAVE ALZHEIMER'S.

644
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:07,619
-No. Give it back.
-One minute, sir.

645
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,956
-Give that back. It's mine.
-Does it work?

646
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:13,208
-There's no battery left.
-Damn it.

647
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:15,043
Give it back.

648
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:21,341
It's mine. Give it back.

649
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:25,345
No. Give it back. No.

650
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:26,972
Yang Ho-beom!

651
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:34,437
-No.
-What? Is he crazy?

652
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:37,107
-You bastard. Are you crazy?
-Let go.

653
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:38,900
-Hey.
-Give it back.

654
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:42,153
That's enough.

655
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:47,909
Goodness.

656
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:56,501
Damn.

657
00:54:58,962 --> 00:54:59,879
Let's go.

658
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:02,382
This bastard.

659
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:09,431
Mr. Sim. Are you okay?

660
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:14,561
Mr. Sim…

661
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:25,363
I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT MY MEMORY
CAME BACK AFTER SEEING HIS BALLET

662
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:36,416
Mr. Sim, look at me. Mr. Sim.

663
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:40,170
Don't you know sous-sous?
Don't you remember this?

664
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,337
After turning…

665
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,926
Hey. What is he doing?

666
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:48,970
What's he doing?

667
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:40,021
I lost my memory that day as well.

668
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:47,695
I don't remember how I got there.

669
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:52,909
I just heard some music

670
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:56,579
and saw a ballerino before me.

671
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:01,126
The boy soared,

672
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:05,255
and he reminded me of the ballerino
I once saw when I was little.

673
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:06,798
JOONGANG THEATER

674
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:11,302
I saw my angry father and my young self.

675
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:15,431
That's when I managed
to come to my senses.

676
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:17,600
Ever since that day,

677
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:21,438
the sight of him dancing
was burned into my mind.

678
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:24,441
I want to do ballet.

679
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:27,485
Can't I learn here?

680
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,070
I WANT TO LEARN BALLET. NO, I MUST LEARN.

681
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:40,475
Chae-rok.

682
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,209
Chae-rok.

683
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,304
You're the main character
of my documentary starting today.

684
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,139
-I'll do my best, Father.
-Me, too.

685
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,058
Why are you looking at the camera?

686
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:24,602
Pretend I'm not here,
and you're just by yourself.

687
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:27,730
Ballet is becoming more and more fun.

688
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,816
They don't just put anyone up on stage!

689
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:31,651
An audition? Me?

690
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:34,862
You're putting
the rest of your life on the line.

691
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:39,701
I finally realized how desperately
Father wanted to do ballet.

692
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:46,040
-Chae-rok.
-I'm telling you to quit ballet.

693
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:50,795
