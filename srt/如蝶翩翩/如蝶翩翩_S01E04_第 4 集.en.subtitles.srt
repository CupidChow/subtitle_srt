1
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,631
FAMILY CHAT ROOM

2
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,307
-Did you send it?
-Yes.

3
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,814
WIFE

4
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,030
-Hello?
-Come home this instant!

5
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:27,629
Not picking up?

6
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,756
Why aren't they picking up?

7
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,303
Why won't they answer?

8
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,354
Emergency family meeting.

9
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,273
Everyone be there by eight o'clock.

10
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,284
Mr. Sim.

11
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,125
Be confident.

12
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,001
Okay.

13
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,628
You can do it.

14
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,215
Thanks, Chae-rok.

15
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,270
EPISODE 4

16
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,491
Since when?

17
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:42,162
Do you think this makes any sense? Ballet?

18
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,955
Well, you see…

19
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,582
Are you all for it?

20
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,335
Say something, will you?

21
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,879
-Yeong-il.
-Yes?

22
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:57,510
Right. Well… You see…

23
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,430
Don't bother asking. We're all against it.

24
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,098
I finally have a reason to like you.

25
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:04,559
I didn't say that for your sake.

26
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:08,438
Father, you should just go hiking
with Mom.

27
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,231
Why ballet of all things?

28
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,692
I had no idea he liked ballet.

29
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:13,985
Did you?

30
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,530
If she did, she wouldn't have sat still.

31
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,118
Father, about that photo…

32
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:28,499
What if others find out?

33
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,293
So what if they do?

34
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,338
You should butt out of this.

35
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,758
Ae-ran, come on.
He can't do ballet at his age.

36
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,510
If he gets injured,
our mother will be the one suffering.

37
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,804
Don't worry about something
that hasn't even happened.

38
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:45,058
She's right. He's still very healthy.

39
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,685
And even if he does hurt himself,
technology these days--

40
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:51,231
See? Only those who aren't
from this bloodline are okay with it.

41
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,693
Seong-gwan, say something.

42
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,696
Speak not only as his son,
but as a doctor.

43
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,073
Dissuade him.

44
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,658
I'm for it.

45
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,578
-What?
-What's so wrong about it?

46
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,706
Did you really have to hold
a family meeting for this?

47
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,126
Is that all you can say?

48
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,128
Why are you so full of complaints?

49
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:17,924
You should stop being nosy
and interfere in other people's business.

50
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,342
What did you say?

51
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,387
I'm not being nosy. I'm concerned.

52
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,597
-Father.
-Yes?

53
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,852
Tell them incessantly
that you like ballet.

54
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,397
If you keep at it,

55
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,275
they'll stop with their nagging.

56
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,567
Goodbye.

57
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,445
-He's unbelievable.
-You bastard. Where are you going?

58
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,198
-I'm not done talking.
-Sim Seong-gwan!

59
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,409
Look what you've done.

60
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,689
I'm sorry.

61
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,150
Why are you apologizing?

62
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,486
Stop frowning.

63
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,947
I'm not frowning.

64
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,532
Do you know what your problem is?

65
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,826
That's enough, you two.

66
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,870
I'm too troubled. You should all leave.

67
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:32,206
Mother, may I take the leftover cake?

68
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,084
How unbelievable. You're so dense.

69
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,587
It's Ae-ran's fault for buying the cake.

70
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,422
We didn't come here to party.

71
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,592
By the way, where is she?

72
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,178
That day,

73
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:49,557
I knew you had stopped by.

74
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,544
Gosh, you're okay.

75
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,139
Mom.

76
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,810
I want to start working again.

77
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,064
I know you were behind me,

78
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,608
holding Eun-ho who was crying.

79
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,696
You just stared at my back.

80
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,287
Don't give up.

81
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,414
Do what you want to do.

82
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,504
Thank you, Ae-ran.

83
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,732
How could you support him?

84
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,069
How could you be against it?

85
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,700
I mean, why are you so harsh on him?

86
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,743
I'm not.

87
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,246
Isn't he the one who's being harsh?

88
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,665
I have no idea what kind of grudge
he has on us

89
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,959
to do something so ludicrous.

90
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,838
But I'm really trying my best.

91
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,339
But ballet?

92
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,717
I'm so flabbergasted.

93
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,927
Is he seriously doing ballet?

94
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,596
-Yes.
-No.

95
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,934
What? Is he or isn't he?

96
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,529
What do you think?

97
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,366
I'm not sure.

98
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,660
You don't need to be adventurous.

99
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,704
It's right to choose a piece

100
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:20,500
that you're the most confident at
and that can accentuate your skills. But…

101
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,335
You need to be a finalist.

102
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,546
You need to consider
the judges' dispositions.

103
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,800
I'll just overwhelm them with my skills.

104
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:34,347
Hey, nothing can be taken for granted

105
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,641
when you're on the stage.

106
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,018
You can't let your guard down.

107
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,854
Oh, please. I should at least have
this much confidence.

108
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,898
That's arrogance.

109
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,654
Which piece do you want?

110
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,030
Don Quixote.

111
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:54,033
Your knees won't be able to handle
all that jumping.

112
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,454
I'll give it a try.

113
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,332
I bet I'll be far more superb than you.

114
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,006
Fine, then. You can do Le Corsaire
and Paquita for the first two

115
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,092
and Don Quixote for the final performance.

116
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:13,594
Okay. I'll buy some coffee.

117
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,907
I wonder if he received their permission.

118
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,933
What?

119
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,647
Honey. Where are you going?

120
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,988
They're all like that at first.

121
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,866
My wife won't speak to me.

122
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,578
-She's in stage two.
-What?

123
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,246
I'm speaking from experience.

124
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,915
When a man announces
that he's going to do ballet,

125
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:28,127
his family's response is similar
to that of the five stages of grief.

126
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,882
Denial, anger, compromise, depression,
and acceptance.

127
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,926
Your wife has passed the first stage
and is enraged.

128
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,349
Hang in there.

129
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,397
It will get better.

130
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,072
-What do you think?
-What?

131
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,657
Is it too long?

132
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,076
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

133
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,994
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

134
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,499
-Mr. Sim.
-Yes?

135
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,042
Aren't you forgetting something?

136
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,169
I already paid.

137
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,967
Right. I forgot about that.

138
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,889
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

139
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,975
Slowly brush your foot forward.

140
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:28,604
Did you get that? Let's see you do it.

141
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,941
Turn out your legs a bit more.

142
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,777
Tighten your inner thighs.

143
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,779
Let's start with devant first.

144
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,572
Slowly brush your foot forward.

145
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,783
Point your toes.

146
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,453
Okay. Now, brush your foot
and go back. Slowly.

147
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,206
Try an à la seconde.
Go to the side. Brush.

148
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,130
-Why aren't you concentrating?
-I'm sorry.

149
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:57,883
What's with that camera?

150
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,052
Are you filming me?

151
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,221
Hey, let's do that again.

152
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:05,182
You're wrong. I'm not filming you.

153
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,268
Then why is it propped up?

154
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:11,272
"Chae-rok, competition".

155
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:15,025
How incredible.
You're entering the competition?

156
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,529
Yes. I need to submit a demo
to be accepted.

157
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:22,241
Gosh, you're truly incredible.

158
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,120
-It's only the beginning.
-I know you'll do well.

159
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,249
CHAE-ROK, COMPETITION

160
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:34,086
-You should add one more star.
-What?

161
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,339
Fine. Here's a gigantic star for you.

162
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,634
Happy?

163
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,015
They've become too close.

164
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,393
Why isn't So-ri picking up?

165
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,291
Sang-su, again.

166
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,628
At this rate, you're not going to win.

167
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,842
By the way, you should be busy
preparing for the competition.

168
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,844
Are you sure we can continue our class?

169
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,930
Don't worry uselessly.

170
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,641
If a mere 70-minute class
becomes a hindrance,

171
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,351
then I should just quit.

172
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,436
I'm just worried about bothering you.

173
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,896
Don't make me repeat myself.

174
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,982
Oh, hello.

175
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,066
Hello.

176
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,193
I guess you've recovered.

177
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,780
Yes. It's all thanks to you, Doctor.

178
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,074
We were actually on our way to see you.

179
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,535
Goodness. What is it this time?

180
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:32,746
Chae-rok will be entering a competition.

181
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,625
I thought maybe you could
take care of him up-close.

182
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,586
Mr. Sim, let's go.

183
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,921
How should I put it?

184
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:44,425
You'd be like
the national athletic team's physician.

185
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:50,055
Doctor, please help us out.

186
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:53,517
Gosh. I'm flattered.

187
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,606
We'll do a medical checkup
tomorrow morning, so come here by 8 a.m.

188
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:02,526
-Thank you, Doctor.
-Goodbye, then.

189
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:09,366
Since we're here already,
how about you get acupuncture?

190
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,369
Chae-rok.

191
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,538
MEDICINE

192
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,252
What's wrong? Are you sick?

193
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,504
Oh, this?

194
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,929
I have a headache.
I couldn't sleep well last night.

195
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,806
Are you already getting ready
for the final interview?

196
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,978
I wish that was the case but…

197
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,566
Forget it.

198
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,659
I want to quit.

199
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,036
Why? Is something wrong?

200
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,996
No, that's not why.

201
00:15:56,914 --> 00:16:00,292
There's something else
I need to focus on. It's important.

202
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,504
Thank you for everything.

203
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:08,008
You didn't even give me the chance
to dissuade you by saying goodbye first.

204
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,015
I'm sorry. I'll come by again later.

205
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,725
Just put it on the table.

206
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,185
Okay.

207
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,647
It's not very urgent, right?

208
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,650
Can you at least work
until we find your replacement?

209
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,943
Sure.

210
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:29,530
We'll look for another part-timer
as soon as possible.

211
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,658
Okay. Thank you.

212
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,120
I'm sad to hear you go.

213
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,178
Wait.

214
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,724
Are you quitting?

215
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,769
Yes. I've decided to put all my energy
into something

216
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,230
like you do.

217
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,484
I hope we both succeed.

218
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,280
Wait.

219
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,868
I have a question.
You said you do ballet, right?

220
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,704
Yes. Why do you ask?

221
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,416
Is it possible to learn ballet
despite one's age?

222
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,670
I'm sure
you're not talking about yourself.

223
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,756
Who is it?

224
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,675
Well, you see…

225
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,054
It's my grandpa.

226
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,099
I also know a grandpa who does ballet.

227
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:40,893
Really?

228
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,103
Yes.

229
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,106
Your grandpa can definitely
learn ballet as well.

230
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,416
Why didn't you pick up?

231
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,503
I'm sure it wasn't anything important.
Why are you here?

232
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,297
Are you here to pry?

233
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,175
Why would I do that?

234
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,843
Then at least look at me.

235
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,970
I'm just watching.

236
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,265
Is he performing Le Corsaire?

237
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,893
Chae-rok picked that as well.

238
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,646
He just made a mistake.

239
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,731
Sang-su.

240
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,278
Leave.

241
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,614
I will.

242
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,909
How about we let them practice together?

243
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:39,952
No.

244
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,371
It's good. They'll motivate each other.

245
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,498
No, thanks.

246
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,667
What is it? Are you not confident?

247
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,962
Let's do it.

248
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,674
I don't mind. What did Chae-rok say?

249
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,011
It's two to one.

250
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,518
Win the competition if you can.
Sorry I can't be there.

251
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,061
You don't need to come.

252
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,397
I'll be busy seeing Messi in person.

253
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,858
Did you get the ticket?

254
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:14,695
I've been slaving away here
to purchase that precious ticket.

255
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,281
I'm so excited. My heart's fluttering.

256
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,784
Me too. I really want to do well.

257
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:51,023
HYOGEONG GROUP FINAL INTERVIEW
WILL BE HELD MONDAY, NOVEMBER 9

258
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:55,903
MANAGER
NEW MESSAGE HAS ARRIVED

259
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,700
This needs some revision.

260
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:05,162
I promise to give you a high score
on the evaluation. Thanks in advance.

261
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,644
Honey, I'll be going now.

262
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:32,564
What's your secret to becoming
so successful in the beauty business?

263
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,524
My main goal

264
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,945
was to create products
that were safe for everyone.

265
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:42,699
I used only natural ingredients
so that the products

266
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,244
would even be safe enough to consume.

267
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,871
Inhale. Slowly.

268
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,415
Look far away.

269
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,294
Straighten your pelvis.

270
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,880
Come back up.

271
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,758
Lower your shoulder.

272
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,971
Put your pelvis forward.

273
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,223
Inhale.

274
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,477
End of discussion. I've made myself clear.

275
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,896
Look what you've done.

276
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,445
Honey, I'll be going now.

277
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,533
Slowly.

278
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,704
Okay. Slowly.

279
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,420
I told you to focus. Are you hurt?

280
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,338
I think…

281
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,049
I strained my back.

282
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,261
Let's call it a day. You should go home.

283
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,763
-You should massage your muscles.
-Okay.

284
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,935
Can you go home by yourself?

285
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,063
Of course. It's not that serious.

286
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,985
KI SEUNG-JOO BALLET STUDIO

287
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:14,458
Hey, Mom. Did you have breakfast?

288
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,793
-Where's Dad?
-He left again.

289
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:20,130
Dissuade him, will you?
He always listens to you.

290
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,923
Not this time.

291
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,217
Is he mad at me or something?

292
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:27,763
Why would he be?
You've done nothing wrong.

293
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,348
I shouldn't have brought it up.

294
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,726
I'll talk to him, so don't you worry.

295
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,394
He'll stop eventually.

296
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,313
Don't trouble yourself with this.

297
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,649
Okay. Bye.

Don't bother waiting.

301
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:18,522
Sorry?

302
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:21,817
It's usually like this.

303
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:23,985
Quiet and empty.

304
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:30,534
Take a look at the previous charts,
and you'll understand.

-Okay.

308
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,084
Hey, about my dad…

309
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,131
Ae-ran…

310
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,927
Kim Ae-ran, you're unbelievable.

311
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,773
I can go home alone.

312
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:47,194
I'm sorry your manager is such a nuisance.

313
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,655
-It's okay, so don't say that.
-Okay.

314
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,032
It's normal to get hurt.

315
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,951
Every single dancer out there
has gotten injured.

316
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,163
But not like what happened today.

317
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,457
You were drifting and being careless.

318
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,545
Is it because of your wife?

319
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,591
It keeps bothering me.

320
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,470
You should go now. I'm almost home.

321
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,181
What? Seong-gwan!

322
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,437
What are you doing here?

323
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:26,316
Oh, this is Chae-rok.

324
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:28,985
He's my ballet teacher.

325
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,863
Chae-rok, he's my youngest son.

326
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:33,531
I see.

327
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,284
Hello.

328
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:37,994
It's nice to meet you.

329
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,497
Your bus is here.

330
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,541
Give that to me and go. Hurry.

331
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,585
-Chae-rok, you too.
-Will you be okay?

332
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,379
Of course. Go on, now.

333
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,674
-Hurry up and catch that bus. Go on.
-Okay.

334
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,050
-Bye.
-Bye.

335
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:23,832
-Sir, your shoe…
-No need to call me sir.

336
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:25,875
Okay.

337
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,753
Take good care of him.

338
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,622
What are you going to film?

339
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,207
A documentary.

340
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:15,675
I'll cut to the chase.
Please kick my father out.

341
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,471
Why should I do that?

342
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:22,766
How could you say that?

343
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:25,310
He has lived a quiet life
as a civil servant.

344
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:28,355
He wants to do ballet at his age?
How ludicrous is that?

345
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,190
He could get hurt.

346
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:33,693
But most of all…
I hope you don't get offended,

347
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,321
but this is humiliating.

348
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:38,656
And as his son, I won't stand it.

349
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,326
-I should stop--
-You've never watched ballet, have you?

350
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,747
That's not important right now.

351
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,458
I understand that people
could have prejudice,

352
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:51,044
-but you're more ignorant than I thought.
-Look here.

353
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:53,088
I have no right to kick him out.

354
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,715
He was the one who found our studio.

355
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,301
It's his choice to leave or not.

356
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:01,679
It's his decision to make, not me.

357
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:07,560
I'll invite you
to a ballet performance soon.

358
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,896
I'm surprisingly accommodating,

359
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:12,690
so you'll probably see your father
perform on stage.

360
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,901
Look here.

361
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:18,029
We have no tea.
Please drink some water and calm…

362
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,492
-Oh, no. I'm sorry.
-Damn it!

363
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,623
Forget it.

364
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,169
Sir…

365
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,508
Hey, that was so obvious.

366
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,009
I meant it to be.

367
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,595
"Humiliating"?

368
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,850
I had no idea his family was against it.

369
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,979
Despite that, he's been coming here
every day. I'm impressed.

370
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,106
His youngest son supports him, though.

371
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,986
By the way, did you mean it?

372
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,363
Is Mr. Sim really going to perform
on stage?

373
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,115
Of course not.

374
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,661
God, you're a sociopath.

375
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:25,430
Mom, if Dad refuses to bend,
then I'm not going home.

376
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,808
Is ballet more important
than his own kids?

377
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,977
That'll be all.

378
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:52,081
PAIN RELIEF PATCH

379
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,770
I'm home.

380
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,130
Gosh.

381
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,447
I'm sorry, honey.

382
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:09,325
If you're sorry, then quit now.

383
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:11,828
Why is ballet so important?

384
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:16,332
Why would you go so far
to trouble your children?

385
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,170
Have you forgotten what kind of lives
they've lived growing up because of you?

386
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,049
Seong-san, Seong-suk, and Seong-gwan.

387
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:29,178
We couldn't do much for them,
but they all grew up well.

388
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,682
And I'm truly thankful for that.

389
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:38,104
We couldn't even give wings to them.

390
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,025
At the least, we shouldn't be a burden.

391
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,112
Don't you feel sorry for them?

392
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,782
Won-bae would never do that.

393
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:53,328
I'll look for him,
so don't you worry. Okay?

394
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:56,998
-I can fix this.
-Mom.

395
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,792
Seong-san didn't go to school.

396
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,504
What do you mean?

397
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,340
Why wouldn't he?

398
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,342
Where is he right now?

399
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:15,058
1980 SCHOOL SUPPORTING FEE
COLLECTION CARD

400
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,143
First period is math class.

401
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,743
Mom.

402
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:36,621
Why aren't you at school? Get up.

403
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,835
What's gotten into you? Get up right now.

404
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,338
Sim Seong-san.

405
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:50,510
The teacher told me not to come.

406
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,178
What?

407
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:56,099
I'm not allowed to go to class
because I didn't pay the supporting fee.

408
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,809
That's what the teacher told me.

409
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:02,480
It's okay. I can study by myself.

410
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,191
I can be the top student by myself.

411
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,779
Mom.

412
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,281
Mom.

413
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:18,079
Don't you know what they've gone through?

414
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:22,041
Those poor kids are vehemently against it.

415
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,672
I'll stop, honey.

416
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,593
You're right.

417
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,762
It's nothing important.

418
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,544
What could it be?

419
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,382
Something's missing.

420
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,470
Why do I feel this way?

421
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:01,682
Right. My wake-up call.

422
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,495
This is hers.

423
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:28,835
Yours is pink. Dad's is orange. Okay?

424
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,838
Goodness, it's so pretty.

425
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:36,175
-It's a very bright color.
-Right? I picked that one out.

426
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:39,053
You picked the perfect one for me.

427
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,515
You should try yours on as well.

428
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,268
If it fits, let's go straight
to Mount Bukhan.

429
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:47,603
Do you not like it?

430
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,689
I do.

431
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:54,652
Seong-suk, how did you know
that orange was my favorite color?

432
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:56,696
I picked it out.

433
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:59,282
I see. It's a perfect fit.

434
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,618
-There are so many pockets as well.
-Right?

435
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:04,787
It's nice.

436
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:12,336
-They don't look heavy.
-What?

437
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,047
-Are those pants light?
-They are.

438
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:25,183
CHAE-ROK

439
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,823
Hey, Chae-rok.

440
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,618
Where are you?

441
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:46,495
Not only did you forget to wake me up,
but you're not even here.

442
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:49,916
You see…

443
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,002
I don't think I can do it anymore.

444
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,086
What?

445
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:59,008
-Dad. Hurry.
-I'm coming.

446
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,719
Chae-rok, I'll call you again later.

447
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:02,845
Wait.

448
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,180
Mr. Sim!

449
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:08,976
-Let's go.
-What was that?

450
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,313
-Answer me.
-It was nothing.

451
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,611
Hey, where's Mr. Sim?

452
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:23,115
-Mr. Sim, I'm here.
-Me too.

453
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,576
Where is he?

454
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,126
Isn't this nice?

455
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,087
What? Yes.

456
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:40,258
See? Hiking is the best for the elderly.
Don't you agree, Mom?

457
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,759
Just eat.

458
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:48,975
What are you doing when we're eating?

459
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:52,270
You see, I got a new business card.

460
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:56,107
Take a look. I've improved the design

461
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,984
so I'd look more reliable.
What do you think?

462
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,320
Shouldn't you focus more on yourself
than the card?

463
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,659
Of course, Mother.
I'll do my best to improve myself.

464
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:08,327
That was harsh.

465
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,454
I was only stating a fact.

466
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:16,002
-Enjoy.
-Eat up. Why aren't you eating?

467
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,291
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye.

468
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,003
-Goodbye.
-Bye, Mom.

469
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,422
-Bye.
-Goodbye, Father.

470
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,049
Rest up.

471
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:15,978
Hey, Ho-beom.

472
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:27,782
I won't hit you. Don't be scared.

473
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,159
You must be afraid
since your old man isn't here.

474
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,747
Mind your own business.

475
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,749
You little bastard.

476
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,631
Do you really want to die? Do you?

477
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:48,094
No matter how much you torment me,
you can't get to me anymore.

478
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,889
I don't want to waste my talent or time.

479
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,433
What? You bastard.

480
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:58,354
I'm good at ballet.
I'm going to win the Grand Prix

481
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:00,439
and join an international ballet troupe.

482
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,274
But what about you?

483
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,985
What can you do?

484
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:08,114
Hey. Don't you know why I'm in this rut?

485
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,031
You're right!

486
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,952
The football team was disbanded
because of my father.

487
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:14,995
But was that all?

488
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,416
Are you sure you weren't talented enough
to be scouted?

489
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,543
Shut the hell up.

490
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:25,089
Had you not given up and improved,

491
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,842
you would've gotten
into any team somewhere.

492
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,302
But you did nothing.

493
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,515
While I attended the School of Dance
and Se-jong went to college,

494
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:37,726
you were still stuck in that field
from four years ago.

495
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,356
Do you still not get it?

496
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,484
I said, shut the hell up!

497
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,195
Is this the only thing you're good at?

498
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:51,574
Ho-beom.

499
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:20,728
This is why Hyogyeong needs to pick me.

500
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,355
Ever since I was young,
I've always dreamed

501
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:26,525
of doing business
in the international market.

502
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:28,736
Especially since natural resources
are lacking--

503
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,446
Isn't the final interview tomorrow?

504
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,406
Good luck.

505
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:36,952
-Thank you.
-Can we eat this right now? Thank you.

506
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,288
I'm sure both of you will get in.

507
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,791
Eun-ho, remember when you said
we should ask our customers

508
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,836
if they're allergic to anything?

509
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,546
I loved that.

510
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,257
Are you a slow starter?

511
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,011
-Anyway, you were impressive.
-Thank you.

512
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:56,472
She's a go-getter. She's very hardworking.

513
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,143
You're the type
Hyogyeong would want to hire.

514
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:05,689
-Eun-ho.
-Yes?

515
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,274
May I speak with you?

516
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,276
Okay.

517
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:23,874
Hello?

518
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:26,627
Yes.

519
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,464
Really? I already sent it.

520
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:55,072
I'm here. Why did you want me
to come to the school?

521
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,657
Don't ask why. Just come.

522
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,097
Long time no see.

523
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:23,309
Didn't you tear your cruciate ligament?

524
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:24,727
Aren't you going through a slump?

525
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,521
-Me?
-Yes.

526
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,023
As if.

527
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:30,983
What is this?

528
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:33,068
I want you two to compete.

529
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,321
You can prepare
for the competition together.

530
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,449
But then again,
I know you're incomparable.

531
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,950
Are you looking down on Sang-su?

532
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:43,203
It's okay. I'll prove myself to him.

533
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:48,542
What? Are you going to focus
on just your techniques once again?

534
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,545
-If you're jealous, just say it.
-You're the one who's jealous.

535
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,340
-Your moves lack soul.
-Are you crazy?

536
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:55,341
Shut up, you two.

537
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,095
Are you sure?

538
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:04,433
Yes, I am. He didn't go
to the ballet studio today.

539
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:08,187
We went to Mount Bukhan
with Seong-suk and her husband.

540
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,814
So don't worry about a thing
and focus on your work.

541
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,775
I'm relieved.

542
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,778
I'll swing by after work.

543
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:19,198
I got gym memberships for you two.
You should work out together.

544
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:21,241
You shouldn't have spent that money.

545
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:25,663
I'm getting a call.
Mom, I'll see you in the evening.

546
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:38,634
Honey, Seong-san is coming this evening.

547
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:40,219
What? Okay.

548
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:43,597
I'm going grocery shopping.

549
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,628
Are they out?

550
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:15,123
Father.

551
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,589
Why are you doing this?

552
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,550
Seong-san, you see--

553
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:27,553
Mom said you quit. Was that not true?

554
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:31,014
I wanted to try it on for the last time.

555
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:33,934
"For the last time"?
Do you seriously think I'd believe that?

556
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,978
I said I didn't like it.

557
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:38,188
I wasn't going to say this.

558
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:41,567
Father, do you think
I always got what I wanted?

559
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,695
-What?
-I've given up on so many things

560
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:46,780
because of my siblings.

561
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:50,617
That's not all. Do you know what
I had to give up because of you?

562
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:55,163
Why did I have to worry about being poor
when I was only eight?

563
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,624
-Why?
-Seong-san.

564
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:01,628
This is the first time
I ever asked you for a favor.

565
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,380
Can't you just yield?

566
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:08,093
Is it truly that difficult
to give up on ballet? Is it?

567
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,887
What's so great about it?

568
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:13,223
Is ballet more important to you
than your kids?

569
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:17,519
No. That's not true, Seong-san.

570
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,938
Then please stop.

571
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:22,649
You made me carry all the burden
as you lived comfortably.

572
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,444
Continue doing that!

573
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:29,823
How dare you?

574
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:31,658
Mom.

575
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:33,952
"Lived comfortably"?

576
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,538
Do you think he lived comfortably?

577
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:40,459
-Hae-nam.
-Don't you know how he lived?

578
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:45,047
He had worked day in, day out
no matter how harsh the weather was,

579
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,007
so how dare you say that?

580
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,969
He did everything he could

581
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:54,181
and worked relentlessly,
but it was still difficult.

582
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:59,728
Fine. We're sorry
that we didn't have much to give.

583
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,230
We've always been sorry.

584
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:07,402
But still, you shouldn't talk like that!

585
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:09,946
What did I do so wrong?

586
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,115
Why does our son's success

587
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,285
have to make us feel so small?

588
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:17,913
Why does your father

589
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:21,667
have to feel sorry
when you've grown up so well?

590
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,460
Why?

591
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:27,172
-Mom…
-Why?

592
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:14,845
Do it if you want.

593
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:21,309
If you love it that much, then just do it.

594
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,521
Hae-nam.

595
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:29,359
You'll have to take care of yourself
if you get injured.

596
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,694
Thank you.

597
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,563
Congratulations.

598
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:09,900
Mr. Sim, I thought
I'd never see you again.

599
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:11,943
This studio felt so empty without you.

600
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,945
Thank you, everyone.

601
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:17,616
I'm sorry for not showing up
all of a sudden.

602
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:21,036
I'll do an even better job
as Chae-rok's manager.

603
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,288
That's something I should hear.

604
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:27,417
That was absence without notice
and dereliction of duty.

605
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:28,794
Chae-rok.

606
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:30,212
I'm sorry.

607
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:33,256
I hope you'll continue to teach me.

608
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:36,092
Congratulations.

609
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:40,305
Then will you do me a favor?

610
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,516
What is it?

611
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:45,894
Look.

612
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:52,526
So you want me to drive that?

613
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,569
The name is Bungbung.

614
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:59,449
Right. You want me to drive Bungbung
and appear like they do in commercials?

615
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:04,538
Yes. It'd be even better if you posed
so that Bungbung would stand out.

616
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,331
It's already standing out…

617
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:09,292
No. I've never driven in traffic before.

618
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,253
I've never driven
after getting my license.

619
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:13,630
Well, today's your chance.

620
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,215
Mr. Sim,

621
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,759
I want to live a long life.

622
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:19,594
I have so much I want to do in life.

623
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,471
I even took it to the repair shop.

624
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:24,975
The owner said it'll work just fine
for the next five years.

625
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:28,186
Five years? I'd be surprised
if it lasted five minutes.

626
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,730
No, Bungbung is just fine.

627
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,816
No, I beg to differ.

628
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:35,694
Chae-rok. I beg you.

629
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:42,951
Gosh. Whom are you giving this junk to?

630
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:47,998
-Mr. Lee Yeong-u?
-Yes.

631
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:49,541
-Ms. Choi Se-ryeong?
-Yes.

632
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:51,209
Ms. Sim Eun-ho?

633
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,044
Yes.

634
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:03,054
-What was that?
-Take it easy.

635
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:04,806
Go to your right.

636
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,267
-Right?
-Turn your blinkers on.

637
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,561
-Blinkers.
-Yes. Turn them on.

638
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,480
-What's going on?
-Not those.

639
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:15,525
-What are you doing?
-It's done.

640
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:19,195
-Take it easy.
-I don't think I can do it.

641
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,615
You'll be fine
as long as you take it easy.

642
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,742
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

643
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:25,827
Take it easy.

644
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:32,125
Why would you change lanes so slowly?

645
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:34,836
Why are you getting mad at me?
This is all your fault!

646
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,505
What? I'm not mad at you.

647
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:40,216
-Take it easy.
-Stop saying that!

648
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,428
-Then drive slowly.
-Gosh!

649
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:49,392
-Did the interview go well?
-I guess so.

650
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,561
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

651
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,282
Eun-ho, are you free today?

652
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:15,043
Grandpa.

653
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:18,088
Eun-ho, here.

654
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,216
How was the interview?

655
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:23,843
I'm sorry I didn't know
about your interview.

656
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:27,973
Don't be.
But, why did you want to meet here?

657
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:32,477
Well… I didn't get you anything
when you first got your job.

658
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,229
But now, I have a gift for you.

659
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:35,772
-A gift?
-Yes.

660
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:43,738
Hey. Come out now.

661
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:54,457
What should I do?

662
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:05,510
Gosh.

663
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:19,441
Eun-ho, that's my gift for you.

664
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:25,071
I said I couldn't do…

665
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,490
Why is he here?

666
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:31,619
What's going on?

667
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:35,957
Then was he talking about you?

668
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:40,545
What do you mean?
Do you two know each other?

669
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,176
Yes.

670
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,638
Gosh.

671
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,808
I can't believe you were friends.

672
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:55,685
We're coworkers, not friends.

673
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:59,189
Just be friends.

674
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:01,608
It's nice to see you.

675
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:05,695
Right. Me too.

676
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:16,456
Grandpa, is your gift that old car that
you've been riding for over 30 years or…

677
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:18,333
him?

678
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:20,210
-What?
-Or are they both my gifts?

679
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:28,051
Since you gave me a gift,
I'll treat you to a meal.

680
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,719
How about you come over
for dinner on Friday?

681
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:33,890
I'd love that. I'd get to see both of you.

682
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:37,143
That's my last day at work.

683
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:39,604
I'm going to quit.

684
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:44,901
Really? Goodness, good for you.
Good thinking.

685
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:49,114
You two get along from now on. Okay?

686
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:10,844
-Don't get out. Eun-ho, go home safely.
-Yes?

687
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:13,847
-Goodbye, Grandpa.
-Goodbye.

688
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:26,943
Thank you, Bungbung.

689
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:31,614
Please take good care of Eun-ho.

690
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:52,510
This was an interesting encounter.

691
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:57,140
Well, I guess so.

692
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:00,768
Is my grandpa good at ballet?

693
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,480
He's not bad.

694
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:06,399
That's amazing.

695
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:10,737
Both of you are incredible.

696
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:15,074
Please take good care of him.

697
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,077
Sure.

698
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,725
Hey, Eun-ho.
Isn't this your grandpa's car?

699
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,186
He gave it to me.

700
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:46,356
What? Then what is he driving?

701
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,734
He said he's going to walk
and ride a bicycle.

702
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:51,945
He needs to grow
muscle strength for ballet.

703
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:55,240
He's unbelievable.

704
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:58,034
Apparently, he's good at it.

705
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,830
-Was the interview all right?
-Yes.

706
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:06,042
Good work. Let's go home.

707
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:33,194
How frustrating.

708
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:36,739
I could've slept a bit longer. Gosh.

709
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:42,203
DAD

710
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:51,546
Hey, Dad.

711
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:54,382
Eun-ho, what's going on?

712
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:57,093
What? What do you mean?

713
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:01,931
What?

714
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:05,810
You got dressed up today.

715
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:10,315
Of course. I ought to dress nicely
when my granddaughter is treating me.

716
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:11,774
You look good.

717
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:15,820
You look great in anything.

718
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:22,201
Why did I receive a C?

719
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:26,748
-Why?
-Eun-ho.

720
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:30,501
I get to decide on how to evaluate you.

721
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:36,215
-I never said you didn't.
-What's going on?

722
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:42,180
Did I ever ask you
to give me a good score?

723
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:47,018
You handed me your thesis paper
and said you'd give me a good score.

724
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:48,978
Listen to yourself.

725
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:53,024
Eun-ho. You could've refused.

726
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,152
What?

727
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:01,866
How? You were the one evaluating me.

728
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:05,203
Why did Cho Min-jae get an A,
while I got a C?

729
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:09,707
I wasn't bad at my job. I gave it my all.

730
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:11,000
So…

731
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:14,921
So why must I be disqualified?

732
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:18,216
Why?

733
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:19,342
Eun-ho.

734
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:06,806
Ever feel like you're running
on a treadmill?

735
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:09,684
What makes you so special?
Everybody lives like that.

736
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:12,311
Do you know how much I suffered?

737
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:16,023
What makes you happiest?
Start by finding out what that is.

738
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,151
Can't you show me once?

739
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:19,569
Go home for today.

740
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:22,363
-Come when I call you.
-Don't practice alone.

741
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:25,450
Do you think how you view
ballet is any different from him?

742
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:27,201
I'm probably just being silly.

743
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:29,412
It was tough starting ballet.

744
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:31,622
That's enough!

745
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:36,461
