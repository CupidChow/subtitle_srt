1
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,302
That'll be 24,000 won.

2
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,888
What? Do you seriously expect me to pay?

3
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,223
I paid for the steak,

4
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,310
-so you should pay for this.
-As if.

5
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,811
Pay up before you eat.

6
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,066
Are you out of your mind?

7
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,494
"You don't deserve a good life, do you?"

8
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,623
You must've cursed me
because I'm not doing too well.

9
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,293
My dad was discharged,
but I don't know where he is.

10
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,088
I don't know what I should do
or if I even have a future.

11
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,966
So pay up.

12
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,893
You must've gone completely insane,

13
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,394
haven't you?

14
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:45,522
Then I'll report you.

15
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,899
You bastard.

16
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,778
You're dead meat tonight.

17
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,030
Chae-rok!

18
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:06,376
My goodness. What's going on here?

19
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:10,046
Let go of him. Chae-rok, are you okay?

20
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,631
Who says you can butt in?

21
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,466
I'm…

22
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,678
I'm… Chae-rok's manager.

23
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,763
-His manager?
-Yes.

24
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,685
What manager?

25
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,899
Oh, I did hear
that you do ballet or something,

26
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,819
but I didn't know you have
this old geezer follow you around.

27
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,989
Wow, impressive, really.

28
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,448
You two make a perfect team.

29
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,701
Let me ask you something.

30
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:43,538
Are you aware that this bastard's father
went to prison for assault?

31
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,918
Shouldn't his manager know that much?

32
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,464
His father beat me up and ruined my life!

33
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,595
It's not like Chae-rok hit you.

34
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:05,184
He didn't do anything wrong.
So why are you doing this to him?

35
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:06,644
Am I wrong?

36
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,857
You see what I mean?

37
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,026
-Let's go, Mr. Sim.
-Okay.

38
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,320
Where are you going?

39
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,739
You told me to pay up.

40
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:21,075
Do some ballet on the billiard table,
and I'll pay for the food.

41
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,036
-What?
-You can't?

42
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,538
-So why did you act up?
-Calm down.

43
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,415
-I'll treat you the way I want,
-Hey.

44
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,917
-and you'll do as I say.
-Calm down.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,502
-I'll treat you the way I want,
-What?

46
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:34,213
and you'll do as I say.
Get on the table and dance!

47
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,465
-That's enough.
-Let go!

48
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,009
Calm down, both of you.

49
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,178
-You son of a…
-I'll dance.

50
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,764
I'll dance.

51
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,936
-I'll dance.
-What?

52
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,605
On one condition.

53
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:53,691
Play a round of billiards with me.

54
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,818
If you win, I'll dance on the table.

55
00:03:55,902 --> 00:04:00,114
If I win, you'll apologize to Chae-rok.

56
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:01,991
Deal?

57
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,791
Are you senile?

58
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:18,925
TRADITIONAL CHINESE RESTAURANT

59
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,637
What's taking them so long?

60
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,432
EPISODE 3

61
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,244
Damn it.

62
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,101
Is he a professional?

63
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,832
Oh, no.

64
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,085
What is it?

65
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,253
I forgot my phone.

66
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,546
Go ahead, Chae-rok.

67
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,984
Gosh, you're ruining my appetite.

68
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:42,902
What?

69
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,613
Chae-rok isn't that kind of person.

70
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,032
What are you talking about?

71
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:52,954
He's not someone who can be forced
to dance on the billiard table for money.

72
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,166
Even an old geezer like me can see that.

73
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,752
-So--
-Seriously! So what do you want?

74
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,963
Leave Chae-rok alone.

75
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,466
Don't laugh.

76
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,388
Chae-rok is going to soar like an eagle.

77
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:45,798
My dear. It started raining.

78
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:50,178
But thanks to that, you waited for me.

79
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,972
Hold on.

80
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,766
I was expecting you to say,
"I didn't wait for you!"

81
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,770
-Put this on.
-Okay.

82
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,608
Is this the only one? What about you?

83
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:07,111
Stop talking and put it on,
or you'll catch a cold.

84
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:11,741
All right. But let me drive.

85
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,576
Don't be ridiculous.

86
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,871
-Fine. Let's go.
-Let's go.

87
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,557
That bastard won't be able to soar.

88
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,061
I'm going to break his wings.

89
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,818
When did you learn how to play billiards?

90
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,320
What did you say?

91
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:52,031
I said, when did you learn
how to play billiards?

92
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:56,661
Back in the day,
there wasn't much to do after work.

93
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:59,413
So me and my colleagues
would sometimes go play billiards.

94
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,541
"Sometimes"? And you're that good at it?

95
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:09,048
Anyway, are you going to tell Mr. Ki
that I filled in as a deliveryman today?

96
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,008
I already did.

97
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,260
What?

98
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,553
Gosh!

99
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:27,942
This takes me back.

100
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,028
What is it again?

101
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:35,199
I mean, I didn't expect much from Mr. Sim.

102
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:38,077
I just want Chae-rok
to get his act together.

103
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,539
But if he doesn't change,
I'm sending him back to school.

104
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:42,832
Just so you know.

105
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,588
When you told me you were going to teach
Chae-rok, I laughed it off.

106
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,049
Remember what you said to me
when I asked you to teach Bom?

107
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,511
You said you'd rather quit ballet
than teach.

108
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,056
But I understood
the moment I saw Chae-rok.

109
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:03,144
He could do the kind of ballet
that you always wanted to do.

110
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:08,816
I thought you had given up all hope
when you got injured and retired.

111
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,777
But I was wrong.

112
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,454
It doesn't have to be me, does it?

113
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:29,462
In addition to working at a steakhouse,
you deliver Chinese food, too?

114
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,466
I was just filling in for a day.

115
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,014
I won't do it again.

116
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,558
So you've done it before?

117
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,352
You've been working two jobs?

118
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,687
I mean…

119
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,189
Are you out of your mind?

120
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,399
And you're telling me you're in a slump?

121
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,695
Do you think you can become
a ballet dancer by dancing half-heartedly?

122
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,990
Is there any ballet company
that would welcome you now?

123
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:02,411
So many dancers are pushed
out of the spotlight overnight.

124
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,789
And you've never even been
in the spotlight yet!

125
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,501
Don't you know your priorities?

126
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,295
Chae-rok, just say you're sorry.

127
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,632
Mr. Ki, calm down and--

128
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,259
Bom, stay out of this.
Mind your own business.

129
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:21,430
Mr. Ki, I'm sure Chae-rok understands
what you're trying to say.

130
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,224
I said, stay out of this, you two!

131
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,394
Do you have anything to say?

132
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:30,856
What do you want?
Do you want to do this or not?

133
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,901
-Mr. Ki, I think--
-Will you shut up?

134
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,654
Oh…

135
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,492
Mr. Sim, my apologies.

136
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:46,330
This is the first time I've had someone
older than me at the studio.

137
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,042
I made a terrible mistake. I'm sorry.

138
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,920
Don't worry. I understand.

139
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:57,967
Anyway, why don't you stop
scolding Chae-rok now?

140
00:11:58,592 --> 00:11:59,760
Okay.

141
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,515
Follow me.

142
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:10,938
Traitor.

143
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,580
Why do you think
I made you teach that old man?

144
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,170
Because I really want him to do ballet?

145
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:36,922
I couldn't care less.

146
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,842
I'm just using him to change you.

147
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,305
But if you keep this up, I don't need him.

148
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:46,932
I'm only wasting his time.

149
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,561
So what do you want to do?

150
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,647
I'll work harder.

151
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,070
Starting this evening, practice alone.

152
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,757
You're going to practice alone?

153
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,885
It's all my fault.

154
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,263
Are you sure you don't need
a more proper meal?

155
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,224
I can't jump when I'm full.

156
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:29,767
I see.

157
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,687
You "can't jump when you're full."

158
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:37,316
Then let me know
if you get hungry while practicing.

159
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,568
I'll get you a lunchbox.

160
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,028
Just go home.

161
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:44,198
-Still, I'm your manager. I should stay--
-Forget it.

162
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:48,410
Go home and stretch some more.
I'll check tomorrow.

163
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,580
"Can't jump when full."

164
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,668
Chae-rok, wait for me. Hey!

165
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:59,296
Wait for me! Hey, Chae-rok!

166
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,551
Chae-rok.

167
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,720
Gosh, you're burning up.
Have you been practicing?

168
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,515
Do you think I sleep all day like you?

169
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:14,395
Hey, I woke up at 6 a.m.
and played football before coming here.

170
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,647
But I got a red card.

171
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,316
Again? You crazy idiot.

172
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,570
What kind of goalie gets a red card
in every game?

173
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,155
I could've sworn
the referee wasn't looking.

174
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:28,158
He's a human VAR or something.

175
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,745
Anyway, Ho-beom, that jerk's been quiet.

176
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,122
I was sure he'd come back.

177
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,416
You're right.

178
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,585
"You're right"?

179
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,421
Doesn't this concern you?

180
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,884
Also, don't let that jerk
walk all over you.

181
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,760
Keep your shoulders back. Be confident.

182
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,972
My gosh.

183
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,100
It's not like Chae-rok hit you.

184
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:57,146
He didn't do anything wrong.
So why are you doing this to him?

185
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,898
Leave Chae-rok alone.

186
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:02,443
Chae-rok is going to soar like an eagle.

187
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,439
I don't have a reservation?

188
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,276
I definitely made a reservation
three days ago.

189
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,487
It was a woman who took my reservation.

190
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,782
I even checked
if the dishes were available.

191
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,702
My goodness. This is absurd.

192
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,663
Can you check again?

193
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,123
I'm sorry, sir. Let me go check…

194
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,000
Excuse me. I…

195
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,087
Is something wrong, Chae-rok?

196
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,838
-I--
-I made a mistake.

197
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,632
I must have missed it.

198
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,636
I'm sorry, sir.
I'll get you a table right away.

199
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,846
-I told you.
-Please come this way.

200
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,057
Let's go.

201
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,519
Damn.

202
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:55,973
What are you doing?

203
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,311
I'm washing my socks.

204
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:05,399
You could have used the washing machine.
What's gotten into you?

205
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,828
Go home and stretch some more.
I'll check tomorrow.

206
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,254
-Goodness.
-Gosh.

207
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,255
What's with you?

208
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,549
-My goodness.
-Seriously.

209
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,846
Is something wrong with your foot?

210
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,520
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

211
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,854
Thank you very much.

212
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,235
Excuse me.

213
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,242
Why did you do that?

214
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,619
I mean, earlier.

215
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,663
I'm the one who made a mistake.
Why did you…

216
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:43,831
I'm just a part-timer.

217
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,335
It's no big deal if I get
in a little trouble with the manager.

218
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,462
But you're different.

219
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:55,134
Well, if this is about the other day,
I was--

220
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,512
I was out of line that day.

221
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,057
I apologize.

222
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,812
If someone said to me to give up ballet

223
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:10,357
and find something else to do,
I'd get mad.

224
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,154
I can't quit ballet no matter what.

225
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,118
Thanks for what you did earlier.

226
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,036
See you tomorrow.

227
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,420
Ballet?

228
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,258
So he does ballet.

229
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:44,766
Try again.

230
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:50,981
Again.

231
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,571
Open up your legs!

232
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,115
Focus.

233
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,075
Try again.

234
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:38,380
MR. SIM

235
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,850
Are you still sleeping?
This is your wake-up call.

236
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:51,852
Hello?

237
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:55,355
Chae-rok. Is something wrong?

238
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,650
I don't know. I don't feel well.

239
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,278
You must have caught a cold.

240
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,947
Are you okay?
Have you taken any medicine yet?

241
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,074
Hang up so I can go back to sleep.

242
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,786
Practice alone today.

243
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,166
I'll check your stretches tomorrow.

244
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,044
That's not important right now.

245
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,963
Hello? Chae-rok?

246
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,263
-Put this on.
-Okay.

247
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,767
Is this the only one? What about you?

248
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,853
Stop talking and put it on,
or you'll catch a cold.

249
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,126
What is it so early in the morning?

250
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:03,965
Chae-rok wouldn't like it.

251
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,135
He can't just do what he likes.

252
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,678
Anyway, I need your help.

253
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,890
What's in it for me?

254
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:16,561
I'll give your toaster back.

255
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,189
It's all yours.

256
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:23,902
Buy me an 8K TV.

257
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,403
Forget it.

258
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,364
Fine, I'll cut you some slack. How about…

259
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:30,492
a 900L side-by-side fridge
with an ice dispenser?

260
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,286
Are you getting married?
Are you making a gift list or what?

261
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,914
It's Mr. Sim. What could it be?

262
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:38,959
Hello, Mr. Sim.

263
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:40,836
Sorry?

264
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,740
Goodness, you look haggard.

265
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:13,994
What are you doing here?
How did you find my place?

266
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,829
What else? I was worried about you.

267
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:19,040
You live alone
and have no one to look after you.

268
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,294
My, you're burning up.

269
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:25,463
-Take some medicine first.
-I'm fine. Just leave.

270
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,632
-You're not fine.
-Come on!

271
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,967
Chae-rok!

272
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,221
Why did you ignore my texts?

273
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,810
-Oh, hello.
-Hi.

274
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:01,750
Hey, it's him right?
The man I saw in front of the restaurant.

275
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,629
So he's your manager? I like that.

276
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:08,465
Hey, you don't even know him.

277
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,467
He looks like a nice person.

278
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,304
-Chae-rok.
-Oh…

279
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,431
Do you have any pots?

280
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:18,141
What do you need pots for?

281
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:21,728
I'll make you some porridge.
You should eat before taking medicine.

282
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,855
It doesn't matter.

283
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,609
I'll order some porridge.

284
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,903
Porridge should be made with care.

285
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:33,365
You don't have to order anything,
but can you lend me a hand?

286
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:16,283
Make sure you finish all of it, okay?

287
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,495
That's going to be impossible.

288
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,043
Gosh, this porridge…

289
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,017
Couldn't he have come together?
How frustrating.

290
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,190
Everyone, I am not giving up here.

291
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:53,653
Your support is forever engraved
in my heart.

292
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,531
I will repay all of you
by winning the next election.

293
00:26:56,614 --> 00:27:01,119
Our next campaign won't end
with tears of sadness but tears of joy.

294
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:04,289
I will persevere and come back stronger!

295
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:11,296
-Byun Yeong-il!
-Byun Yeong-il!

296
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:15,425
-Thank you so much.
-Byun Yeong-il!

297
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:18,928
-Byun Yeong-il!
-Thank you.

298
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:22,307
-Byun Yeong-il!
-Byun Yeong-il!

299
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:25,727
-Byun Yeong-il!
-Byun Yeong-il!

300
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:29,522
BYUN YEONG-IL
HARD-WORKING FOR THE PEOPLE!

301
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,857
Where's Father?

302
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:34,736
No idea. He went out early this morning
and isn't picking up his phone.

303
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,781
I have no idea what he's up to these days.

304
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,911
I saw that you sent me more money.

305
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,792
Pay Seong-san back with that money
so that he'll leave you alone.

306
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,338
Mother, would you like some makgeolli?

307
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:55,757
Goodness, you're an embarrassment.

308
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,926
Right, you good-for-nothing politician?

309
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,594
What are you talking about, honey?

310
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,893
Honey, how about I apply for college?

311
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,646
What?

312
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,731
A guy in my hiking group

313
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:15,652
thinks that I keep losing elections
because I didn't go to college.

314
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:18,738
The more I think about it,
the more sense it makes.

315
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,949
People in this country
care about those things.

316
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,911
I still have to figure out
how to pay the tuition,

317
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,705
but do you think your brother could help?

318
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,290
Mom.

319
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,000
Is it okay if I get a divorce?

320
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,377
What?

321
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,645
Mom, take this.

322
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,106
-I have money.
-I know.

323
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,275
-Mother, get home safely.
-Okay.

324
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,235
Please drive carefully.

325
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:58,987
Take care, Mom.

326
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,456
Honey, I'll find a way to pay the tuition.

327
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,375
-Will you be quiet?
-Honey.

328
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,879
OH JOONG-SIK ORTHOPEDIC CLINIC

329
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,756
It's from the orthopedic clinic?

330
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,257
Oh, I can explain.

331
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,094
OH JOONG-HUI
TRADITIONAL KOREAN MEDICINE CLINIC

332
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,766
Traditional cold medicine
from an orthopedic clinic?

333
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,601
Cold medicine?

334
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,020
Well, I'm an orthopedist.

335
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,148
But you're still Chae-rok's doctor.

336
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:38,818
-Could you help?
-No, I'm an orthopedist.

337
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,987
Yes, I know. You're an orthopedist.

338
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,323
With no other clinics or pharmacies open,

339
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:46,743
Chae-rok is very sick,
but you're an orthopedist.

340
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:48,578
Gosh, why are you an orthopedist?

341
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:53,583
Oh, I know. Let me see. How about this?

342
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:57,420
I stole this from the third floor
so I could take it when I catch a cold.

343
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:12,477
I finished the porridge
and took the medicine, so leave now.

344
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,686
I need more sleep.

345
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,730
I'll leave once you fall asleep.

346
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,524
Don't be ridiculous.

347
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:22,028
Se-jong, you should leave, too.

348
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:25,114
-What about work?
-I called the manager.

349
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,158
Okay, thanks.

350
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,160
Go in and sleep some more.

351
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,371
Bye then.

352
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:44,050
SON

353
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,735
HOW ARE YOU?

354
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:48,072
HWANG YE-WON
NOVEMBER 1, 1974 - JANUARY 20, 2016

355
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:10,053
What? Why is he still here?

356
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,599
You're up already. You could sleep more.

357
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:23,524
What is this?

358
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:26,486
You'll recover more quickly
if your environment is clean.

359
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:29,697
Oh, I used one of your garbage bags.

360
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,825
I also did some laundry.
Fold the clothes when they're dry.

361
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,286
I mopped the living room, too.

362
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,747
-The fridge--
-I get it. Just leave.

363
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,625
Oh, and I made some beef porridge.

364
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,294
I said, leave. I'll see you at the studio.

365
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,587
Also…

366
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,715
I made some plum tea. Give it a try.

367
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,801
According to Living to 100,

368
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:51,886
plum tea is great when you have a cold.

369
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,348
-That TV show again? Okay, Just leave.
-All right.

370
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,225
One more thing.

371
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,060
Heat up the porridge before eating.

372
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,690
Hey, I'm leaving.

373
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,817
Yes, please do.

374
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,891
PLUM SYRUP

375
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,352
EAT CARROTS AND CUCUMBERS

376
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,396
LEFTOVER ABALONE PORRIDGE

377
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,523
DON'T FORGET TO EAT FRUITS

378
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,861
KEEP IT UP!

379
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:55,575
KEEP IT UP, MY SON!

380
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,621
Why are you doing this to me?

381
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,445
Everyone, back to the camp!

382
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,280
-Yes!
-Yes!

383
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,115
Let's go! Hurry up!

384
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,293
Be careful!

385
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,296
-Coach Shin.
-Yes?

386
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,800
I have to visit Seoul this afternoon.
Is that okay?

387
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:55,927
Why? Did something happen?

388
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:59,639
No, nothing happened.
I just have something to do.

389
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,266
Sure, go ahead.

390
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,478
-Okay. Thanks.
-No problem.

391
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,408
The peony and the pine?

392
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,327
That means joy and news will arrive.

393
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,247
Is Seong-gwan going back to the hospital?

394
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,166
Did you hear anything from Seong-gwan?

395
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,252
Well, not really.

396
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,171
It can't be anything else.

397
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,883
Why didn't you pick up your phone
all day yesterday?

398
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,845
Yeong-il's campaign ended.
Why couldn't you come with me

399
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:41,055
and say some encouraging words to him?

400
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:44,976
I didn't want to embarrass him.
He would've felt pressured.

401
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:47,019
I doubt he would ever.

402
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:51,149
He might seem happy-go-lucky,
but he's a thoughtful man.

403
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:52,817
Thoughtful, my foot.

404
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,658
Where are you going now?

405
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,579
You know Han-cheol, right?
The one who delivers hamburgers.

406
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:05,913
He wants to see me.

407
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,875
He's been saying he'd buy me makgeolli.
I guess today is the day.

408
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,793
-Okay.
-See you.

409
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:20,178
I couldn't use Han-cheol
as an excuse every day.

410
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,847
I wonder if Chae-rok is
feeling any better.

411
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,517
I'll have to practice alone today.

412
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,784
Chae-rok.

413
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:48,873
Hi.

414
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:51,918
What are you doing here? You need rest.

415
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,544
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

416
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,296
Are you sure?

417
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:59,133
The plum tea did help a lot.

418
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,843
Right?

419
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,934
Keep your shoulders down.

420
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,396
Turn out your legs.

421
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,161
Mr. Sim.

422
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,080
Yes?

423
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:34,168
You do know it's too late for you
to become a dancer, right?

424
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,254
Yes.

425
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,884
So why do you want to do ballet?

426
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:48,182
Did you mean it when you said
you wanted to be on stage?

427
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,601
Why?

428
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,569
I want to soar

429
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:04,282
at least once in my lifetime.

430
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,547
The Sevilla Competition?

431
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:24,176
Yes, it has the longest history
and produced numerous stars.

432
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,470
I know that,

433
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,015
but it's not like I'm going to apply
for college again.

434
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:32,184
I want you to perform
at the Palais Garnier next year.

435
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,186
What?

436
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,106
I know you don't like competitions,

437
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:42,611
but just show them the kind of ballet
you pursue. That's enough.

438
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,405
Let's start there.

439
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,199
Forget it.
All they care about is technique.

440
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,993
I'm not interested. It's stupid.

441
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:52,788
"Stupid"? Who's the stupid one here?

442
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,165
Ms. Eun.

443
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,500
You even failed
to get into the National Ballet.

444
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,210
How can you be so relaxed?

445
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,796
Did you two plan this together?

446
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,215
What's going on?

447
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,217
Why are your dreams so small?

448
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:08,095
You never know how far you can go
until you try.

449
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,222
Do you lack confidence?

450
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,976
-Is this all you've got?
-No.

451
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,898
What have you been teaching him
for the past four years?

452
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:20,941
Me?

453
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,071
Why is this my fault?
You're his teacher, too.

454
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:26,739
I taught him for only one year.

455
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,617
Your job is to bring out his potential.

456
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:33,162
Did you take in a stray dog?
This is negligence.

457
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:34,538
A "stray dog"?

458
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:37,124
"Negligence"? I'm neglecting him?

459
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,336
Can you deny it? Then what is he doing
at this shabby studio?

460
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:43,339
-What's shabby about it?
-Why hasn't he debuted yet?

461
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:46,884
It's all your fault.
You're responsible for it.

462
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,886
You arrogant narcissist.

463
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:52,306
-What?
-Do you know why I asked you to teach Bom?

464
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,393
What? Why did you?

465
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:58,312
-Mr. Ki, please--
-You were just screwing me over.

466
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,022
-Calm down--
-Stay out of this.

467
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:03,150
You have no sense of responsibility.
You're not a teacher.

468
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,569
Did you think teaching would be easy?
Is this a joke to you?

469
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,739
-What did you say?
-His future is on the line.

470
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:14,161
How can you call yourself a teacher?
You don't deserve to.

471
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,163
-You're not qualified!
-I don't think so!

472
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,873
Think about it!

473
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:22,086
-Listen.
-Teaching is not as easy as you think.

474
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:24,422
Who gives you the right to lecture me?

475
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:27,133
Forget it. Just quit. Enough is enough!

476
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,135
-Hey.
-Shouldn't we try to stop them?

477
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,806
Let them be.

478
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:34,890
Okay.

479
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,312
Shoulders down.

480
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,399
Engage your abs.

481
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,402
Do you think he bought it?

482
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,611
Absolutely.

483
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,534
So that's Mr. Sim?

484
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:58,497
Hey, what did you mean earlier?
About why you asked me to teach Bom.

485
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,750
Was there any special reason?

486
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,963
No, it was just to screw you over.

487
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:07,840
I knew it.

488
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:09,842
You're evil.

489
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:13,471
Cut it out.
Now, go buy me that fridge you promised.

490
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,435
Gosh, it's dusty.

491
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,440
What are these?

492
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,695
They're certainly not mine.

493
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:31,614
What are these?

494
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,618
My dear, these panties
would barely cover anything.

495
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,166
What are you doing?

496
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,460
I'm washing my socks.

497
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:52,676
Mr. Sim, starting today,
we'll go into more detail.

498
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,345
Hold the bar.

499
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:00,768
Not like that. With your thumb on top,

500
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,812
rest your hand lightly on the bar.
Try again.

501
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:08,692
Turn out your legs.
Keep your heels together.

502
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,194
Tighten your abs.

503
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:13,739
En bas.

504
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,493
Tighten your back.

505
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,703
Follow your hand with your eyes.

506
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:23,082
Raise your arm. Eyes straight ahead.

507
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,210
Eyes straight ahead.

508
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,421
Put your arm down.

509
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:32,925
There you go.

510
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,260
Try it on your own.

511
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:40,057
Eyes straight ahead. And then…

512
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,269
Put your arm down.

513
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,734
-Why are you smiling?
-Nothing.

514
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:52,945
Shoulders down.

515
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:57,491
Raise your arm. Keep your shoulders down.

516
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,238
Care to explain?

517
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,950
Oh, that's…

518
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,493
Explain.

519
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,167
You're doing what?

520
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,002
Are you…

521
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,004
going senile?

522
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:53,547
What?

523
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,008
Have you lost your mind?

524
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:59,219
Are you seriously telling me
you're doing ballet?

525
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,472
-Honey.
-How old are you?

526
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:04,975
Don't you remember celebrating
your 70th birthday with your children?

527
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,436
I wanted to give it a try
before it's too late.

528
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,521
Does that make sense to you?

529
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:13,817
Can't you just go hiking
and go to the movies with me and such?

530
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:17,571
Why make a fool of yourself
in this ridiculous outfit?

531
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,449
Grow old gracefully.

532
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,701
What on earth has gotten into you?

533
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,662
Hae-nam, hear me out first.

534
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:27,831
I should have known better.

535
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:31,752
What joy and news was I expecting?

536
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:35,005
I don't want to hear any more.
End of discussion. I've made myself clear.

537
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,840
Don't you say another word.

538
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,469
Why are you so mad?

539
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,304
I just want to try it out, that's all.

540
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:46,934
Honey.

541
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:58,779
Hae-nam, please. Don't do that.

542
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,825
This is unacceptable.

543
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:05,202
Think about what Seong-san will say.

544
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:08,831
Don't cause our children any trouble.

545
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:11,375
Just watch some TV at home,

546
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:14,753
take walks, and grow old gracefully.

547
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:54,668
Excuse me.

548
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,465
Can I help you?

549
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,594
-Yes.
-Who is it for?

550
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:05,220
A girlfriend?

551
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:09,224
-Or…
-It's my mom's birthday.

552
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:10,767
I see.

553
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:13,729
In that case, I recommend
flowers that are not too colorful.

554
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:15,481
How about these?

555
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:05,781
Slow down.

556
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,089
Have you been doing well?

557
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:28,637
Are you even interested?

558
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,106
If you were concerned about me,

559
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:43,402
you wouldn't have left for Daecheon
after just one call.

560
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,070
Don't you think?

561
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:54,496
Chae-rok.

562
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:57,624
Have I been doing well?

563
00:47:58,709 --> 00:47:59,710
No.

564
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:04,131
Just look at my face. What do you think?

565
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:09,177
Even a total stranger can tell
that I'm not well just looking at me.

566
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:12,806
Why can't you?

567
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:17,936
You're my family, so why can't you?

568
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,101
Eun-ho, do you have a minute?

569
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:00,354
I don't want you to feel pressured.

570
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,315
I just thought I should at least ask.

571
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:06,652
You majored in English literature,
after all.

572
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:08,779
Well, yes.

573
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:12,949
If you're too busy, never mind.

574
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,285
Give it to me.

575
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:18,705
Are you sure? Can you do it?

576
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,583
-Yes.
-Thank you so much.

577
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,460
When should I be finished with it?

578
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,003
The sooner, the better.

579
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,297
I understand.

580
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:39,059
Hey, I have some translations to do.

581
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:44,773
Wait, what?

582
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,274
What are you doing here, Uncle?

583
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:52,406
I'm the one who introduced you
to this place.

584
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,199
And she's my friend.

585
00:49:57,077 --> 00:50:00,288
That's right. I keep forgetting.

586
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,999
My dad told me
not to get too close to you.

587
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,251
We're not close.

588
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:07,671
I'm afraid we might.

589
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:17,013
Are you still studying English?

590
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,765
It's the branch manager's thesis.

591
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:22,936
Report her.

592
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,814
After I get the job.

593
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:29,109
I can't fail.
I'll pass with the highest score.

594
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:36,324
Like father, like daughter.

595
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,119
You got the job?

596
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,579
I did.

597
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:50,756
So?

598
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,925
I'm starting next week.

599
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:57,929
All right.
If you're so determined, go ahead.

600
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:00,474
Fine, I give you my permission.

601
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:01,933
But remember one thing.

602
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:06,146
You must continue to fulfill your duty
as my wife and Eun-ho's mom.

603
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,231
That's the condition.

604
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:11,026
You're funny, Seong-san.

605
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:12,652
Why would I need your permission?

606
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,029
What?

607
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:17,199
I'm trying to meet you halfway.
Can't you compromise a little?

608
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:19,493
Did you compromise 20 years ago?

609
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:24,498
When you can't even understand
your own husband,

610
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:27,459
how are you going to counsel
the employees?

611
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:30,253
Pretend you don't know me at work.

612
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,216
Ae-ran.

613
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:36,134
Hey! Wait…

614
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:41,056
This is ridiculous.

615
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:48,271
SIM SEONG *** TRANSFERRED
5,000,000 WON TO YOUR ACCOUNT

616
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,441
Is this brat serious?

617
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,110
SEONG-SUK

618
00:51:56,112 --> 00:52:00,200
The phone is turned off. Leave a message…

619
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:04,120
MOM

620
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:09,102
Mr. Sim.

621
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,396
Chae-rok.

622
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:13,148
Why are you here at this hour?

623
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:16,192
That's right.
You're going to practice alone, right?

624
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:19,029
Yes. What about you?

625
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:23,408
I had nowhere else to go.

626
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,748
Want to go up to the rooftop?

627
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:39,966
Nice view.

628
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,097
So you had a fight with your wife?

629
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:50,435
Yes. I didn't expect her to get so upset.

630
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:57,817
Mr. Sim, what are you going to do
if she doesn't change her mind?

631
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:01,696
Then I'll have to keep it
a secret from her.

632
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:07,285
Chae-rok, I've realized something
after all these years.

633
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:10,497
You only live once, not twice.

634
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:15,251
When I was nine,
my father didn't allow me to dance.

635
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:17,671
Now, my wife is trying to stop me.

636
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:20,215
To be honest, that doesn't scare me.

637
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,387
What really scares me is

638
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:30,350
that someday, I might not be able
to do what I want

639
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:34,562
or don't even remember
what I want to do anymore.

640
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:45,448
That's why this moment is precious to me.

641
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,661
I'm not going to hesitate.

642
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:52,288
I'm going to give it my all.

643
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:15,770
Why did you want to see me
so early in the morning?

644
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,692
I'll enter the competition.

645
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:22,944
You mean Sevilla?

646
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:24,904
Yes.

647
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:27,490
You want me to get
into a foreign ballet company, right?

648
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:29,701
Winning a prize would raise my chance.

649
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:35,832
That's exactly right. Once you get
more experience in the wider world--

650
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:39,127
I also want to perform
at the Palais Garnier like you did.

651
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:46,176
Also, about Mr. Sim…

652
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:51,806
You might not be interested
in him learning ballet,

653
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:53,892
but I am.

654
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,315
Just so you know.

655
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:04,527
I'm off.

656
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:23,755
Mr. Sim, why are you in your sweat suit?
Where are your ballet clothes?

657
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:25,590
Well…

658
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,969
My wife cut them to pieces with scissors,

659
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:32,806
and I haven't gotten around
to buying a new set.

660
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,477
So she doesn't know you're here?

661
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:39,187
No.

662
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,858
Just take the bull by the horns.

663
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:46,861
"Take the bull by the horns"?

664
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:50,198
Give me your phone.

665
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:58,414
Go over there and hold the bar.

666
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,500
Remember the position
you learned yesterday?

667
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,919
Your right arm en haut,
and your legs in passé.

668
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:31,072
Tighten your abs. Shoulders down.

669
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:43,710
There you go.

670
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,005
Does it look good?

671
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:51,968
You should share it here. Do it.

672
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:55,221
What do you mean? The picture? Here?

673
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:56,723
Yes.

674
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,642
Are you ashamed of doing ballet?

675
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,311
No, that's not it.

676
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:03,062
Then just do it.

677
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:06,524
Wouldn't it make my family worry?

678
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:08,693
Just worry about yourself.

679
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:13,573
-Wouldn't they get shocked?
-Ballet is meant to be shocking--

680
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:18,369
Who were you when you told me
you wanted to do ballet?

681
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:21,664
What are you so scared of?
Aren't you going to give it your all?

682
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:34,302
Okay.

683
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:37,472
I'll take the bull by the horns.

684
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:44,896
FAMILY CHAT ROOM

685
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:10,588
FAMILY CHAT ROOM

686
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:27,981
Father?

687
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:30,567
That's so cool.

688
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,278
-Are you coming in later?
-Honey.

689
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:36,155
I see. I'll call you back.

690
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,365
What is it?

691
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,119
What is this?

692
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:19,991
My wife won't speak to me.

693
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:21,993
Honey. Where are you going?

694
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:25,204
They're all like that at first.
Be confident.

695
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:27,123
You can do it.

696
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:29,584
Wait. Are you quitting?

697
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:33,796
I've decided to put all my energy
into something like you do.

698
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:37,050
You're entering the competition?
You're truly incredible.

699
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:40,136
He wants to do ballet at his age?
How ludicrous is that?

700
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:42,513
Why are you doing this?

701
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:44,766
I'll stop, honey.

702
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:49,854
