1
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:49,632
-Is it you, Chae-rok?
-Ms. Choi?

2
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:53,678
This is urgent, and none of my kids
are picking up.

3
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,263
That's why I called you.

4
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:58,475
Is something wrong?
Why are you calling me with his phone?

5
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,935
He disappeared.

6
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:02,771
What?

7
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,885
-Ms. Choi.
-Chae-rok.

8
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:35,929
Mr. Sim went missing?

9
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,598
You probably just missed each other.
What happened?

10
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,809
He went to get candy and hasn't come back.

11
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,394
And his phone is with me.
What should I do?

12
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,604
Will he be all right?

13
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,148
-I'll look for him.
-I'll come with you.

14
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:50,819
No. Mr. Sim might come back here,
so stay here.

15
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:54,239
You're right. I'll stay here.

16
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,716
Ma'am, we'll keep looking for him, but
he wasn't caught on any of the cameras.

17
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,719
Goodness. What do I do?

18
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,600
Please be advised.

19
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:26,354
The aquarium will be closing soon.

20
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:29,816
We hope all visitors return home safely.

21
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:32,986
Where's my phone?

22
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,157
Oh, I left it with Hae-nam.

23
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,535
She must be waiting.

24
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,338
Where on earth did he go?

25
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,052
Sir, what are you doing back here?

26
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,138
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,181
I got lost.

28
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,601
I see. You can follow me.

29
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:05,685
Okay.

30
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,401
Thank you very much.

31
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,112
Mr. Sim!

32
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,910
Where have you been?

33
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,662
Chae-rok, why are you here?

34
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,539
You had me worried.
I looked everywhere for you.

35
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,917
You looked for me? Why?

36
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,127
Ms. Choi called me and said
you disappeared.

37
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,129
She did?

38
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,299
Yes.

39
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,475
Chae-rok, I'm…

40
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,560
You found him?

41
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,480
Thank you for your help.

42
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,524
No, I'll come to you.

43
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:38,069
My heart is racing.
I can't stand here and wait.

44
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,195
Okay.

45
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,448
You came all the way here for me?

46
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,243
How is your ankle? Does it hurt?

47
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:48,871
I practiced before coming here. I'm fine.

48
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,835
Anyway, what were you doing
at the aquarium?

49
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,754
It's our wedding anniversary today.

50
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,632
Gosh, Ms. Choi must be really angry.

51
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,011
-Goodness.
-"Angry"?

52
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,679
I'm furious.

53
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,140
I'm surprised that I'm still breathing.

54
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,058
What if Chae-rok didn't find you?

55
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:13,479
-The thing is--
-I mean, what were you thinking?

56
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,690
Why didn't you come back right away?

57
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:18,609
If you got lost,
couldn't you ask someone for help?

58
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:22,113
How did you even work
as a mailman for 40 years?

59
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,408
My, you didn't even get any candy.

60
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,328
A kid seemed lost,
so I was following her--

61
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,954
Why are you so nosy?

62
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,415
Just worry about yourself.

63
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,585
I even had to call Chae-rok.

64
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,795
It's really fine.

65
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,716
It's not fine. You must be busy
practicing for the competition.

66
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,134
Sorry, Hae-nam.

67
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,600
Are you coming or not?
Aren't you going home?

68
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,976
Okay.

69
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,818
EPISODE 7

70
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,244
Take a cab. Thanks for coming.

71
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:15,500
-You don't have to.
-It's a token of my gratitude.

72
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,294
I appreciate it.

73
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,345
-See you.
-Bye. Thanks again.

74
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,382
Chae-rok doesn't seem well.

75
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,716
I hope everything's fine.

76
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,679
It's because he worried about you.

77
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,850
Is that it?

78
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,505
-Then give up on this competition.
-What?

79
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,426
No. Why should I do that?

80
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,470
-I can do well.
-I make that decision.

81
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,263
What right do you have?

82
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,933
That's exactly why I quit ballet.

83
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,852
I was stubborn and arrogant just like you.

84
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,498
Here's a text from a listener.

85
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,918
"After a fierce competition,
I finally landed myself a job.

86
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:25,129
Will I be able to prove myself?
Please root for me."

87
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,590
Of course, you can do well.

88
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,468
All our listeners and I
will be rooting for you.

89
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,722
Hold on. Why are you dressed up?

90
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,390
Do you have a job interview?

91
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,061
I already had one.

92
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,980
And I got a job.

93
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,524
You got a job?

94
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,734
Where?

95
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,946
Did you already find what you like?

96
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:54,325
Not really. So-yeong hooked me up
with it, and I thought I should try it.

97
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:58,746
I'll have to try it to find out
if I like it and if it suits me.

98
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:02,083
Fine, so which company is it?

99
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,796
What? She's just a temp?
She's freelancing?

100
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,924
She wants to give it a try.

101
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,134
How can you be so relaxed?

102
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,512
-Are you really her mom?
-What?

103
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,807
She needs a career
with a vision and good prospects.

104
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,309
If she wastes her time
and misses the hiring season,

105
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,686
will you take responsibility?

106
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,188
It matters where you start.

107
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,234
Mother called yesterday.

108
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,819
I couldn't take it, though.

109
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,947
I'm not finished.

110
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,075
Jeez.

111
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,411
She called me, too, actually.

112
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,288
What could it be?

113
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:43,040
How should I know?

114
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,962
I was just asking. Gosh.

115
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,173
-Good morning.
-Oh, good morning, Mr. Yoon.

116
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,593
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

117
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,345
Let's have lunch together.

118
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,764
-Sure, that sounds good.
-All right.

119
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,644
Why did Mother call, anyway?

120
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,485
What is it?

121
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:15,489
Mom, you called me yesterday.
Is everything okay?

122
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,992
My, it took you long enough.

123
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,244
You see, your father…

124
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,832
-Never mind.
-What about Father?

125
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,125
I have to go.

126
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:30,504
What was that?

127
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,382
What's the point of having children?

128
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,885
They only call
when it's convenient for them.

129
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:39,013
Anyway, has Deok-chul already left
for the studio?

130
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,098
I wonder if he ate.

131
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,052
"Every morning, I have tea time
while listening to your voice.

132
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,845
I look forward to it tomorrow too."

133
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,770
"I hope my wishes will come true in 2021."

134
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:28,813
Hello.

135
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,649
-"…I hope you'll read my story today."
-You're early.

136
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,527
I did. It's your lucky day.

137
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,028
Congratulations.

138
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,532
"I feel like I'm getting old
without achieving much.

139
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:43,160
I'm a 20-year-old
who is number 3 on a college wait list.

140
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,663
I really want to get in.
I hope they accept me."

141
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,457
-Take a seat and wait.
-I'm sure you will get in.

142
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,710
-Okay.
-"Who's the host? I love his voice."

143
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,213
Thank you very much.

144
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:58,634
It's been getting warmer, but temperatures
dropped below zero again this morning.

145
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,638
But thanks to sunny and clear skies,

146
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,474
I could start the day feeling happy.

147
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:09,186
There's a song that goes, "Winter is
a cold yet heartwarming season."

148
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,397
Let's start our day off with a song

149
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,858
-Standby.
-that will warm up the freezing morning.

150
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,694
Welcome to Hello, Nine O'clock.
I'm Lee Jun-il.

151
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,238
Today's first song is "Intern"
by Rooftop Moonlight.

152
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,034
The show starts early,
but it's not a news program,

153
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,786
so we're usually not that busy.

154
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,707
Your basic duties include
checking texts from our listeners,

155
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,418
selecting stories, sending out gifts,

156
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,003
managing the bulletin boards,

157
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:37,006
contacting guests,
printing out scripts, and so on.

158
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,675
As the newest writer,
you'll take care of all the chores.

159
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,845
Do everything needed
for the show to run smoothly.

160
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,346
I see.

161
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,516
It's not difficult,
but there's a lot to do.

162
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,186
Basically it's everything except writing.

163
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,062
You also have to order food

164
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,815
as well as get water for the host.

165
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,943
I have to get water for him?

166
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,195
Who else?

167
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,740
He should, of course, get water
for himself…

168
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,744
Well, I understand.

169
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,163
A radio show's success
depends on its host.

170
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,040
Do everything you can to help him.

171
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,792
We go on the air at 9 a.m.,
so be here by 8 a.m.

172
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,836
Don't be late.

173
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,463
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

174
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,994
I should warm up completely
before Chae-rok comes.

175
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,914
I feel so stiff
after taking just one day off.

176
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:36,166
I gave you a week's worth of medications.

177
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,377
Just prescribe me some more.

178
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,176
What could it be? The MRI shows nothing.

179
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,346
Then why am I in pain?

180
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,019
How bad is your pain
on a scale of one to ten?

181
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,400
Please prescribe more.

182
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,115
When I took my Hippocratic Oath,

183
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,950
I added an additional clause.

184
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,119
I'm not interested.

185
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,580
"No peeing in the pants for warmth."

186
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,207
It may keep you warm for a short moment,

187
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,461
but what would happen
once the pee freezes?

188
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,880
You'll become even colder.

189
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,965
Your legs might even get frostbitten.

190
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:28,052
Worst case, you'll get an electric saw go…

191
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,014
Do you see what I mean?

192
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,725
Go now.

193
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,270
Ms. Kim, I'll take a 30-minute break.

194
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,813
Gosh.

195
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,203
Why won't you listen to me?

196
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,714
-What's the matter with you?
-Chae-rok.

197
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,050
Mr. Ki, you're here, too.

198
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,635
You're early.

199
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,845
It's because I couldn't practice
yesterday.

200
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:15,641
What were you two talking about?
Is something wrong?

201
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,434
No, there isn't.

202
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,521
-Let's go, Mr. Sim.
-Chae-rok.

203
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,817
Chae-rok. I'm done stretching.

204
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,575
Why are you staring at me?

205
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,036
It's just… Since yesterday,

206
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,872
you don't seem so well.
I'm worried something happened.

207
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,290
Nothing happened.

208
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:45,170
Worry about yourself.
You got chewed out by your wife, right?

209
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,505
Just a little.

210
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,802
Thumb on top.

211
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,179
Rest your hand lightly.

212
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,265
Legs in fifth.

213
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,851
Passé and then forward.

214
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,395
En avant.

215
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,231
Développé and then…

216
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,859
straighten your leg. À la seconde.

217
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,612
Point your toes. More.

218
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,949
Raise your leg higher.
Tighten your inner thigh.

219
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,326
Point your toes.

220
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,789
Point your toes even more.

221
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,375
Tighten your back muscles.

222
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,461
Lower your leg slowly.

223
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,714
Back to the original position.

224
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,550
Lower your arms.

225
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,012
What?

226
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,555
A coach?

227
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:37,556
Yes.

228
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:41,351
You could teach, choreograph,
and supervise rehearsals.

229
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,520
Heung-sik practically begged me
to convince you.

230
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,689
Why should I do that?

231
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,901
A colleague started a ballet company.
Can't you help out a little?

232
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,861
Why me?

233
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,530
Chae-rok is already giving me
enough headaches.

234
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,699
Hang up.

235
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,785
Hello?

236
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,415
Look to the side.

237
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:06,919
Follow me.

238
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:11,048
Why? We still have five minutes to go.

239
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,884
-Continue.
-Mr. Sim, today's lesson is over.

240
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,260
Get home safely.

241
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,263
-What is it? Let go of me!
-Wait, Mr. Ki…

242
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,981
-This isn't normal, you know.
-Hey.

243
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,904
It looks cool, though.

244
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,910
You didn't bring me here to show me this.

245
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,455
If this is about yesterday--

246
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,998
Do you know why I accepted you?

247
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,375
Sorry?

248
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,418
You were a total stranger.

249
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:52,297
You'd been a football player
and never tried ballet before.

250
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,758
Why do you think I accepted you?

251
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,471
-Well…
-You've never been here before, right?

252
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,516
Because I never brought you here.

253
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:06,687
I'm not interested in other people.

254
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,815
Much less teaching them ballet.

255
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,695
Some people overestimate their talent

256
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:18,448
while others practice for ten hours a day
when they have no talent.

257
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,908
They all get on my nerves.

258
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,037
So why…

259
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:28,876
did I accept you into my private studio?
Ever thought about that?

260
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,920
Are you regretting it?

261
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,468
You think I hung that picture there
because it looks cool?

262
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,640
It's just a reminder to myself.

263
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,731
That was the performance
that dragged me off the stage for good.

264
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:53,358
PALAIS GARNIER, 2016

265
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,505
Seung-joo.

266
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,258
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

267
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:22,971
Seung-joo.

268
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,351
My goodness. Are you okay?

269
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,480
When can I perform again?

270
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,564
In six months?

271
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,733
In a year?

272
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,694
Mr. Ki.

273
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,114
-You can't dance anymore.
-What?

274
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:45,953
You'll be able to walk
and perform daily activities.

275
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,706
But I'm afraid you can't dance again.

276
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,001
That's when I met you.

277
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,170
At the lowest point of my life.

278
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,589
And I thought

279
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,593
you could show the world
the kind of dance that I wanted to show.

280
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,723
It was over for me,

281
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:51,101
but I thought you could dance
on my behalf.

282
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,022
That's why I accepted you.

283
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,898
-Mr. Ki.
-So I insist

284
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,277
on seeing you on stage someday.

285
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,032
Don't make the same mistake I did.

286
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:42,152
Mr. Sim, you've made a lot of progress.

287
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,780
I made quite a few mistakes.

288
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,573
Don't worry, Mr. Sim.

289
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,450
Even Bom makes that many mistakes.

290
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,870
Especially at your age,
it's super impressive.

291
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,706
To be honest,
I didn't expect much from you.

292
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,000
-I thought you'd quit immediately--
-An-na.

293
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:00,378
It's okay. Everyone thought so.

294
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,838
I didn't, Mr. Sim.

295
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:05,175
So would you like to try the part
where you made a mistake again?

296
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,052
What?

297
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,846
Chae-rok is away,
so I'll be your teacher today.

298
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:13,308
My, what an honor.

299
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,573
Hae-nam, I'll be home late tonight.

300
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:32,202
-Again?
-Hae-nam, how are you?

301
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,580
You look so drawn.

302
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,749
I can see how troubled you've been.

303
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,209
What are you talking about?

304
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:41,044
I'm talking about your husband.

305
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,295
What about him?

306
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,382
I heard he's been frequenting the studio
at the intersection because

307
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:48,135
-he's always shimmying around.
-What?

308
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:51,429
My husband saw him on his way
to a clinic in the same building.

309
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:55,142
"Shimmying around"? Watch your mouth.

310
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,769
Listen. Do you have any idea what art is?

311
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,230
What my husband does is art.

312
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,858
I'm baffled by your ignorance.

313
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:06,736
I wish I bought some salt to throw at you.

314
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,946
Get out of my way!

315
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:11,241
-Gosh, this is heavy.
-Hae-nam, you're out of line.

316
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:14,327
What did I say?
Also, didn't you say I look drawn?

317
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,747
Guess what? I'm on a diet.

318
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,337
These people and their gossip.

319
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,339
Goodness. What a horrible woman.

320
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:30,343
Mom, what are you grumbling about?

321
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,845
What brings you here?

322
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,388
I just stopped by to chat.

323
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:36,600
Anyway, who got on your nerves now?

324
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:39,561
The neighbors are saying
your dad is "shimmying around."

325
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:40,979
I can't believe them.

326
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,480
"Shimmying around"?

327
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,066
But he is.

328
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:50,363
So Dad is continuing with ballet?
He must really enjoy it.

329
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,491
There will be no citron marmalade
for you this year.

330
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,494
Mom, I was joking.

331
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,164
Isn't Yeong-il here?

332
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:00,790
Mother.

333
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,375
Speak of the devil.

334
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,297
I brought some marinated crabs
and green tea cake.

335
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,383
These days, you can get
shelled marinated crabs.

336
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,928
You have weak teeth, so it's perfect.

337
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:16,389
Oh, my. These have already been shelled?

338
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:17,682
MARINATED CRAB MEAT

339
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,269
What's with the get-up?

340
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,396
Is it someone's birthday?

341
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,483
I got in, Mother.

342
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:27,567
I'm going to college!

343
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,821
He wanted your blessings.

344
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,323
Isn't it great news?

345
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:38,745
Wait. "Lee Chae-rok"?

346
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,122
Who's Lee Chae-rok?

347
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,679
OUR BELOVED GISELLE, AN YU-YEONG
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PERFORMANCES

348
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:58,765
So she's retiring.

349
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,519
What are you doing here?

350
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,605
Ms. Eun.

351
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:08,024
What brings you here?

352
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,610
I came to see her.

353
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,491
Here.

354
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:24,958
Ms. Eun.

355
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,629
What does it feel like
when you can't dance anymore?

356
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,300
I can't really imagine it.

357
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,887
I feel like I'm talking to Seung-joo.

358
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,307
How did you feel when you retired?

359
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:42,684
Me?

360
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:47,022
I felt exhilarated.
I ate a whole pizza myself that night.

361
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,943
Since you didn't have to diet anymore?

362
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,988
Exactly. I was so happy I almost cried.

363
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,907
That night,

364
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:01,911
I also left my inferiority complex,
envy, jealousy, and helplessness

365
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,246
behind for good.

366
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:07,125
I'd been feeling those emotions
for too long next to Seung-joo.

367
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,754
I was never a genius like Seung-joo.

368
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,881
I only got to where I was
through hard work.

369
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,342
It wasn't until I got to France

370
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,385
that I realized
I couldn't climb any higher.

371
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,556
Isn't that even more admirable?

372
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,685
You earned everything you had.

373
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,355
Do you think Seung-joo slacked off?

374
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,232
Hard work alone is not enough.

375
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,574
Will that be the case for me, too?

376
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:47,123
I'm not sure if I'm talented.

377
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,753
That's why I can't give up
on the competition easily.

378
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,172
I know I'm already late.

379
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,258
Who knows how many years it'll be
before I debut?

380
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,596
You know dancers retire early.

381
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:08,812
Do you know what Seung-joo said
when he first saw you dance?

382
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:11,064
He's completely awful.

383
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:13,942
All he does is imitate
what he's seen somewhere.

384
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,778
I bet he has no understanding of Basil.

385
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,655
But after watching him for a while,

386
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:23,326
I realized that he wasn't just imitating
but following his emotions.

387
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:27,288
That's interpretation.
His own interpretation.

388
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,542
You instinctively knew how to interpret

389
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:34,838
and expressed it as best as you could
with your body.

390
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,215
And that's talent.

391
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,300
That's what Seung-joo said.

392
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,220
He really said that?

393
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,223
So keep your shoulders back and chin up.

394
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,892
You can be confident.

395
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:04,826
HWANG YE-WON

396
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:05,827
Mom.

397
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,122
What should I do?

398
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,236
You still can't remember the sequence?

399
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,490
Hey, Chae-rok.

400
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,992
Your positions are all wrong, too.

401
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:48,203
You have to practice
until it becomes muscle memory.

402
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:52,540
Okay. Anyway,
what brings you here at this hour?

403
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,876
Practicing for the competition?

404
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,717
I had no idea.

405
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:08,890
Me, neither.

406
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,144
I really wanted to compete.

407
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,981
The teachers tell me
there will be a next time,

408
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,818
but who can guarantee that?

409
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,321
You never know what may happen.

410
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,158
Also, I already told my father

411
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:31,412
that I was entering the competition.

412
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,750
Chae-rok.

413
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:41,506
Like you said,
I would like to soar for once.

414
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,412
He fractured his left femur.

415
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:16,583
We've inserted three pins,
and the surgery went well.

416
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,334
But there may be long-term effects.

417
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:23,006
He may end up limping
or experiencing chronic pain.

418
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:26,426
He may not be able to ride
a motorbike again.

419
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,510
What?

420
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:31,472
He's a mailman.
What is he supposed to do now?

421
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,807
He'll go through rehab.

422
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,311
But there's no guarantee.

423
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:30,490
It took me a whole year
to get back on my bike.

424
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,117
But eventually I got back on.

425
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,413
I never gave up.

426
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,917
I walked and walked again.

427
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,507
There will be a next time, Chae-rok.

428
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:16,911
What is it?

429
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,207
When is the next competition?

430
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,167
What?

431
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,503
I'll go through rehab
and slowly prepare for it.

432
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:29,382
I'm going to win the competition.

433
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:33,886
Also, I'm different from you.

434
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:38,099
Sitting in the audience isn't for me.
I'll be on stage for a long time.

435
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:08,671
SIM SEONG-GWAN

436
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:10,965
INCORRECT PASSWORD

437
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,870
Hello, Father. What is it?

438
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:45,416
-The password?
-Yes, I forgot it again.

439
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,961
-It's 0113.
-That's right. Your birthday.

440
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:51,798
Wait. That's today.

441
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,300
Is that right?

442
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:57,553
So that's why your mom wanted
to go grocery shopping this afternoon.

443
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:58,638
Are you coming over for dinner?

444
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,143
I will.

445
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,647
Okay.

446
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,326
That looks difficult.

447
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,286
No chance of finding it?

448
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,746
It seems so.

449
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,541
It's not going to be easy.

450
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,461
I see. Thank you.

451
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:38,719
REALTY

452
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,268
What's up?

453
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:48,354
I've been in surgery for 14 hours.
I'm exhausted.

454
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,857
Get me some cake. Get the sweetest kind.

455
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,151
Thanks for remembering my birthday.

456
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,319
Your birthday? Right…

457
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,655
I guess you'll be having
more seaweed soup.

458
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,323
I'm in Chuncheon now.

459
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,367
What are you doing there?

460
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:02,785
Doctor.

461
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:04,912
Hey, I'll talk to you later.

462
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,548
I'm here to find my first patient.

463
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,135
But I'm too late.

464
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,025
What's wrong? Did you two fight?

465
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,904
That rude woman had the audacity
to say you're shimmying around.

466
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,448
"Shimmying around"?

467
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,326
Don't be bothered by it.
I already told her off.

468
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,912
Anyway, Seong-suk came by yesterday.

469
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,456
I saved some of the green tea cake
she brought.

470
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,999
Share it with Chae-rok.

471
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:51,459
Thanks.

472
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,253
We're going grocery shopping
in the afternoon.

473
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:57,381
-And don't forget to pick up the picture.
-I know. See you.

474
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,478
Deok-chul.

475
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,688
Hey, Han-cheol.

476
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,690
I heard you're learning ballet these days.

477
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,526
-What?
-Everyone in the neighborhood knows.

478
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:20,446
Do you even wear tights and everything?

479
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,406
Well…

480
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,784
You're one silly old man.

481
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,620
-I just…
-I'm late.

482
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:28,955
I'll be off.

483
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:34,752
"Silly"?

484
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:10,913
Chae-rok…

485
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:16,085
shines so bright even when he practices.

486
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,713
Mr. Sim, you're here.

487
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,464
Hello.

488
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:43,738
I guess ballet is for people
who are young and healthy like him.

489
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:48,326
Not for someone old and ugly like me.

490
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,412
Maybe…

491
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:57,335
It really is silly
someone like me to do ballet.

492
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,521
We don't need the bar today.

493
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,689
What?

494
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,317
I moved on to the next stage,

495
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,903
so you should, too.

496
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,614
Let's begin center-work.

497
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,742
-Really?
-Of course.

498
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:34,413
My dear.

499
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,749
Try again. Shoulders down.

500
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,000
En bas.

501
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:40,294
En avant.

502
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:43,464
Passé and keep your balance.

503
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:47,802
Spread your arms and développé.

504
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,807
I can't do it well, Chae-rok.

505
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:56,185
Did you think you'd succeed
on your first try?

506
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:58,604
I'm low on energy today.

507
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,439
Sorry, Chae-rok.

508
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,275
Everyone's like that
when they first begin.

509
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,113
It's not easy to control and support
your body without the bar.

510
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,614
-Try again.
-Okay.

511
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:12,243
Shoulders down. En bas.

512
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,578
En avant.

513
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,539
Passé.

514
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,541
Développé.

515
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:19,917
Straighten your leg.

516
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,628
Tighten your back muscles.
Squeeze your abs.

517
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,007
Let's try again.

518
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,803
Shoulders down. En bas.

519
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:34,849
En avant. Passé.

520
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,394
-Hi, So-ri.
-Point your toes.

521
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:41,856
Your offer the other day…
Is it still valid?

522
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,567
Goodness. My dear.

523
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,447
Here.

524
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,579
You're being a little strange today.

525
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:57,705
What?

526
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:01,333
-Is there something wrong?
-No, nothing's wrong.

527
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:05,671
We have somewhere to be.

528
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:09,175
I'm not done yet.

529
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:10,426
I'm talking to Mr. Sim.

530
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:12,761
Can you come with me?

531
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:15,931
-What? Me?
-Yes.

532
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,810
Well, if it's not somewhere
far away, sure.

533
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,855
Let me go change first.

534
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,191
You can go as you are.

535
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,568
Let me just put on my jacket, then.

536
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:32,114
Where are you going?

537
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,951
KIM HEUNG-SIK BALLET COMPANY

538
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,330
We're here, Mr. Sim.

539
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,540
Kim Heung-sik Ballet Company.

540
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,918
A ballet company?

541
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,378
Can I be here?

542
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,089
Of course. There's no need to be nervous.

543
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,593
This is my first visit, too.

544
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,845
So-ri wants me to be a coach here.

545
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,141
A coach? You? No way.

546
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,560
-I'll have a look first.
-I don't believe it.

547
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,396
-Let's go in.
-Sure.

548
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,498
They're here.

549
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,584
Thank you so much.

550
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:26,961
For what?

551
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,212
Don't tell me you--

552
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:30,172
Chae-rok, you look great today.

553
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:34,218
-Mr. Sim, welcome.
-Hello.

554
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:36,136
I only asked if it was still valid.

555
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,221
Same difference.

556
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:47,606
She had to retire due to an injury,
but she used to be in the City Ballet.

557
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,816
I see.

558
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:53,153
Mr. Sim, did you see how he just landed?

559
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:58,158
To land quietly,
you should land on your toes.

560
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:00,911
I understand.

561
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,216
Your manager notebook
has turned into a ballet notebook.

562
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:18,178
It's a manager notebook in the front
ballet notebook in the back.

563
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:34,778
I'm grocery shopping and buying myself
a cake on my birthday. Great.

564
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,739
It's because your dad wouldn't pick up.

565
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:39,033
Why is he practicing so long?

566
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,368
Have you ever seen him dance?

567
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:45,456
No. I'm not that interested.

568
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:47,750
I am.

569
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,877
I'm more interested in you.

570
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,963
When will you stop going around
in those sandals?

571
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,633
-Do you realize how old you are?
-I'm 39.

572
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,926
Goodness. It was a rhetorical question.

573
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:00,012
When will you grow up?

574
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:02,931
Try calling your dad again.

575
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,435
I think we've got enough.
Are you preparing a feast?

576
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:08,729
We're a big family.

577
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,189
Call him, will you?

578
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,406
I know who she is.

579
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:23,744
I've seen her videos.
Her Black Swan solo was stunning.

580
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,538
It really was.

581
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:29,625
She became wheelchair-bound
after an accident about ten years ago.

582
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:34,797
I know this may sound inappropriate,

583
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,132
but how can she possibly dance?

584
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:39,802
You'll see.

585
00:45:58,589 --> 00:45:59,673
What do you think?

586
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,342
It's beautiful.

587
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,180
Since I started learning ballet,

588
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,391
I've always been envious of Chae-rok.

589
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:14,563
I wished I was as young as Chae-rok.

590
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,859
Then I would've been able to jump higher.

591
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,404
If only I had started ten years earlier.

592
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,656
I worried

593
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:28,327
I'd look horrendous in my ballet clothes.

594
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:33,457
I dreaded to think how ridiculous
I'd look floundering in them.

595
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:37,794
And I told myself there was nothing
I could do about that.

596
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,506
But seeing her dance

597
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:43,383
makes me feel ashamed.

598
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:49,223
To be honest, I'm still a bit skeptical.

599
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:53,852
But just because your movements
are weak and slow

600
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,938
doesn't mean it's not ballet.

601
00:46:57,689 --> 00:46:59,358
Of course, you have your limits,

602
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:01,527
but just like Chae-rok did,

603
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:05,072
you could dance in your own way.

604
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:07,533
In my own way?

605
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:09,243
Yes.

606
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:17,668
Thank you so much for bringing me here.

607
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:21,964
All right. Let's take a little break
before moving on to the second act.

608
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,173
-Okay.
-Okay.

609
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:27,678
Wait. There's one more performer left.

610
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:29,805
Chae-rok, do you want to perform, too?

611
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:34,184
No. I mean this gentleman here.
Mr. Sim Deok-chul.

612
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:38,480
-Chae-rok.
-You can do it.

613
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,233
Just show them what you learned today.

614
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:44,861
Even if you make a mistake,
don't stop. Just keep going.

615
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:47,364
Chae-rok, I can't…

616
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:48,365
Give it a shot.

617
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:52,578
-Will that be okay?
-Of course. That'd be great.

618
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,707
You want to perform on stage
someday, don't you?

619
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,625
Consider this practice.

620
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,420
Don't try to do it well.

621
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:03,797
Just dance out of your love for ballet.

622
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:07,593
Out of my love for ballet?

623

Mr. Sim, you should bow.

2 MISSED CALLS
SEONG-GWAN, WIFE

630
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:43,266
Goodness, I'm in trouble.

631
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,644
Mr. Sim, are you leaving?

632
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:47,395
Yes, I'm late.

633
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:51,233
I was supposed to go grocery shopping
with my wife. My goodness.

634
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,443
I wanted to have dinner with you.

635
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:56,404
I'll take a rain check.
See you tomorrow, Chae-rok.

636
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:59,699
-Mr. Sim.
-What?

637
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,077
You…

638
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:04,621
were amazing today.

OCTOBER 5, DRANK ICED AMERICANO
HAD DIARRHEA ABOUT 3 TIMES

644
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:11,938
Gosh, this is a human rights violation.

645
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,442
How much did he write?

MY NAME IS SIM DEOK-CHUL.
I HAVE ALZHEIMER'S.

650
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:49,768
-Welcome, Mr. Sim.
-Hello.

651
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:51,603
One second, please.

652
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:54,814
Here you go. It looks great.

653
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:02,948
-The other picture…
-Sure, one second.

654
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:16,127
Today, I got lost for the first time.

655
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,881
This has never happened before.

656
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:23,343
I should take notes more thoroughly.

657
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,888
I should double-check
and triple-check everything.

658
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:32,477
I shouldn't forget that I have Alzheimer's
even for a moment.

659
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:38,692
But I want to continue with ballet.

660
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:44,114
I want to perform on stage.

661
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:51,997
MY NAME IS SIM DEOK-CHUL.
I HAVE ALZHEIMER'S.

662
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,679
Are you saying I have…

663
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:09,723
Yes, you have Alzheimer's.

664
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:12,934
A neurodegenerative disease
and the most common cause of dementia.

665
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,102
Dementia…

666
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,606
What am I supposed to do now?

667
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,525
First, tell your family.

668
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:24,529
At this early stage,
you only forget things occasionally

669
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:27,198
and your condition progresses slowly.

670
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,409
But it may suddenly take a turn
for the worse.

671
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:35,206
If you can't tell your family right away,
it may help to start taking notes.

672
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,542
From what you ate to whom you met,

673
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,627
write down every little thing

674
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:42,255
and turn them into habits.

675
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:46,634
Even if your symptoms worsen,
your habits will remain.

676
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,887
Like you'll never forget
how to use a spoon.

677
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:52,390
But if you start having trouble
remembering the things you wrote down,

678
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,559
please do come back for a check-up.

679
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:56,644
Give up driving as well.

680
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:30,720
JOONGANG THEATER

681
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:35,016
SENDER: SIM DEOK-CHUL

682
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:13,406
It's such a beautiful day.

683
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:17,452
So sunny and clear.

684
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:23,583
So why…

685
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:27,587
Why on earth…

686
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,387
Mom. Dad.

687
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:40,892
What do I do now?

688
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:11,089
MY NAME IS SIM DEOK-CHUL.
I HAVE ALZHEIMER'S.

689
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:56,175
Did something happen to Grandpa?

690
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:57,802
It's to your right.

691
00:59:58,636 --> 01:00:00,013
You kept staring at him.

692
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:03,600
I feel great since Chae-rok's so nice.

693
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:08,646
Your memory is slowly fading,
and it'll happen more frequently.

694
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,648
-No.
-Yang Ho-beom!

695
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,527
Mr. Sim. Are you okay?

696
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:16,821
I'm not such a weak person.

697
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:21,117
I really love ballet.
I want to do it well.

698
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:25,872
