1
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:56,139
You have to remember it.

2
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,266
Pull yourself together, Deok-chul.

3
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:01,186
Mr. Sim, are you in there?

4
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,605
It's Chae-rok. Open the door!

5
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,398
Mr. Sim!

6
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:09,277
You have to remember it.
Pull yourself together, Deok-chul.

7
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:17,160
You must remember.

8
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:20,080
Pull yourself together, Deok-chul.

9
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:23,833
You have to remember it.
Pull yourself together, Deok-chul.

10
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,252
-Mr. Sim.
-Pull yourself together, Deok-chul.

11
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,670
Mr. Sim. Are you okay?

12
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,222
Chae-rok.

13
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,063
Chae-rok.

14
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,488
Do you recognize me?

15
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,158
So…

16
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,161
You knew.

17
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,720
I see. You've been pushing him too hard.

18
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,934
-Rest up, sir.
-Thank you.

19
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,316
Look, for the time being, please don't…

20
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,527
Don't worry. I won't tell him.

21
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:38,992
Mr. Sim.

22
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,371
Seong-gwan knows.

23
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,665
What?

24
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,750
I told him.

25
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,590
He'll feign ignorance, though.

26
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,593
He wants you to continue doing ballet.

27
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,597
Let's go. I'll drop you off.

28
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,083
What are you doing? Snap out of it!

29
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,770
Have you been well?

30
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,065
I'm sure you didn't visit me
after four years just to ask that.

31
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,401
-Ho-beom.
-I know you came because of Chae-rok, so--

32
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,527
It is…

33
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,114
all my fault.

34
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,077
You're really unbelievable.

35
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:09,749
Do you finally feel sorry
now that your son got injured?

36
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,127
Had I known sooner,

37
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,505
I would've broken his leg ages ago.

38
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,507
Right?

39
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,426
You're not genuinely sorry, are you?

40
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:26,724
Don't you know why
I put up with your beating?

41
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,352
-The list is out.
-Really?

42
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,229
-Isn't that him?
-I also made it.

43
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,773
-Ho-beom isn't on the list. He isn't.
-What?

44
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,233
What? Seriously?

45
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,402
-Why isn't he?
-How would I know?

46
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:43,658
Coach, why aren't I on the list?

47
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,999
Don't you know a blown out knee
will put an end to your career? No.

48
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,960
Will you take responsibility
if I don't turn pro?

49
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,461
What?

50
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,508
Coach, I spent

51
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,429
my father's insurance on this.

52
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,016
My mom insisted that I quit.

53
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,684
But I told her

54
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,438
that I'd receive a salary
once I became a professional.

55
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,315
That's how I managed to come this far.

56
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:21,070
So please include me in the lineup.

57
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,868
Ho-beom, go to college first.

58
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,495
Then you can become a professional.

59
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,748
Why would you risk everything
with that knee?

60
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,708
How will I pay for my tuition?

61
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,545
Well-off bastards like Chae-rok
have second chances,

62
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,213
but not me!

63
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,886
If it wasn't for your injury,

64
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,722
you would've been on the list.

65
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:48,973
No!

66
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,309
I was fine.

67
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,769
You're wrong.

68
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,354
You weren't fine.

69
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,524
I called the hospital you had gone to.

70
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,153
I've seen many athletes
ruining their career

71
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,655
because they didn't care
and overworked their bodies.

72
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,575
Once we won,

73
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:11,079
I believed you could join any team.

74
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,330
That's why

75
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,042
I switched you out near the end
of the second half.

76
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,585
Goodness.

77
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,797
Your kindness is so tear-jerking.

78
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,300
But what now?

79
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,846
Thanks to you,
I had to give up on football.

80
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:31,849
Okay?

81
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,311
One, two, three!

82
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,022
One, two, three!

83
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,616
Had you not beaten the students…

84
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,245
Had the football club not disbanded…

85
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,412
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,876
I'm sorry, Ho-beom.

87
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,382
I wanted to…

88
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:07,927
raise the team's performance at all costs.

89
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,973
I was being greedy.

90
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,436
I'm the only one to blame. For everything.

91
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,565
Ho-beom.

92
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:25,027
I don't know how you'll take this.

93
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,534
But it's still not too late.

94
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,955
You can start all over again.

95
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,792
Are you serious right now?

96
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,628
-Stop talking bull--
-You…

97
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,048
had talent.

98
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,806
Why would you say that now?

99
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,352
Why would you? Why?

100
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,439
I'm sorry.

101
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,402
I'm sorry.

102
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,323
Damn it…

103
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,025
Come on in. It's okay.

104
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,110
-Hello.
-Chae-rok, you're here too.

105
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,237
-Hi, honey.
-Hi.

106
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,407
You forbade me from tagging along today.
Why are you back so soon?

107
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,451
You see…

108
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,119
The meeting was called off,

109
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,955
so I came here to eat.

110
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:00,665
Is that all right with you?

111
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,669
All of today's dishes are made
with mackerel. Is that okay?

112
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,880
It's not just today.
We had mackerel yesterday too.

113
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,174
I told you not to nitpick, you brat.

114
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,432
Isn't the citron tea good?

115
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,311
I've put some aside for you,
so take it home.

116
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,525
Ms. Choi, are you okay?

117
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,863
I'm suddenly feeling woozy.

118
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,954
I'm fine now.

119
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,498
Are you sure?
Shouldn't you go to a hospital?

120
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,167
Don't worry.
This happens from time to time.

121
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,504
Okay.

122
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,633
I'll take the tea next time.

123
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,343
Would you like that?

124
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,763
Thanks, Chae-rok,

125
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,434
for taking good care of my husband

126
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,769
and dropping him off.

127
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,981
I'm grateful for everything you've done.

128
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,500
What are you doing? Snap out of it!

129
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,386
Thanks, Chae-rok.

130
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,974
Hold on. You're dressed too lightly.

131
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,269
Here, take this.

132
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,106
See you tomorrow.

133
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:55,696
Take it back.

134
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,990
It's cold today.
Give it back to me tomorrow.

135
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,494
I'm afraid I won't be able to.

136
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,914
What do you mean?

137
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:08,918
Do you know

138
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,005
you didn't recognize me twice already?

139
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,095
But I'm fine now.

140
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,347
No, you're not.

141
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,184
You were out of it in the bathroom stall,

142
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,186
and you almost got hit by a car.

143
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,272
So how are you fine?

144
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,442
What if something happens to you?

145
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:37,071
What if you get into an accident
and get severely injured?

146
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,991
Your son said to take care of you,
and Ms. Choi doesn't even know.

147
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,077
I was really terrified.

148
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,288
I'm sorry.

149
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,040
But…

150
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,709
I'm fine now.

151
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,422
-I'm taking medicine and--
-What if it happens again?

152
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,589
What?

153
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,426
What if you get lost, and I'm not there
to help you?

154
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,469
Then what will you do?

155
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:02,555
I'll…

156
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,767
I'll make sure that doesn't happen.

157
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,520
You should quit.

158
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:10,688
What?

159
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,401
You should quit ballet.

160
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,528
Chae-rok.

161
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,239
I can do it.

162
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,449
No, you can't!

163
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,618
So please give up already!

164
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,871
Chae-rok.

165
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,501
Chae… Chae-rok!

166
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,810
I can do it.

167
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,481
No, you can't! So please give up already!

168
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,149
Chae-rok.

169
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,406
Hey.

170
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,576
Isn't it time for class?

171
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,372
Where is Mr. Sim?

172
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,166
Aren't you having class?

173
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,502
He's going to rest for the time being.

174
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:58,879
Why?

175
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:04,093
He even skipped the meeting.
Is he feeling ill?

176
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,304
What about the audition?

177
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,598
Is that still on?

178
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,229
Come in for a minute.

179
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,737
I don't know if you know already,

180
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,615
but the floor of the Bolshoi Theatre
is at a 15° angle.

181
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,618
You'll struggle to balance yourself
on your first day.

182
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:34,915
It's of the utmost importance
that you get used to the stage.

183
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,667
I got it.

184
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,837
I should go practice.

185
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,022
Is something going on?

186
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,235
Shouldn't we go now?

187
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,613
What? Well…

188
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,366
The studio's ceiling is leaking.

189
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,494
What? Out of the blue?

190
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,916
But it looked completely fine
just yesterday.

191
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,669
No, you just didn't notice.
It was already leaking.

192
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,757
When I went today, it was even worse.

193
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,176
Today?

194
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,096
You went there this morning?

195
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,097
What?

196
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,683
No, Chae-rok told me.

197
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,396
Anyway, we'll have to wait
until they fix it.

198
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,152
Then I guess we'll take a break today.

199
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:48,781
"A break"?
I need to prepare for my audition.

200
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,741
Let's go to my favorite place.

201
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,285
-Get up.
-What?

202
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:00,417
This is your favorite place?

203
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,544
-Let's jog.
-What?

204
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,173
What? Father!

205
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:48,799
Seong-gwan, aren't you still too young
to be that exhausted?

206
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,010
Father.

207
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,222
I'll be turning 40 soon.

208
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:58,058
Hey, we're doing that next.

209
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,394
What?

210
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,604
What?

211
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,857
-Seong-gwan.
-Yes?

212
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,985
Whoever finishes 30 reps first wins.
The loser buys lunch.

213
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,654
That's nothing. I'm down.

214
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:14,033
Ready, set, go.

215
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:18,370
One, two, three, four, five, six,

216
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,415
seven, eight, nine, ten,

217
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,000
eleven, twelve…

218
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,635
Why are you buying this?

219
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,722
You're jobless. You shouldn't waste money.

220
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,359
You're done already?

221
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,571
Will you have enough energy to practice?

222
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,157
Chae-rok said you can't jump

223
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,784
on a full stomach.

224
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,957
Where is he practicing?

225
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,336
What? Probably at the School of Dance.

226
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,796
You should go there too.

227
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,923
I'm not a student there.

228
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,760
-It'll look nice.
-No. Never.

229
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:17,679
I can wait a few days.
I don't want to bother him.

230
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,224
We'll practice separately.

231
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,520
All right, then.

232
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,570
Finish the entire bowl.

233
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:50,170
EUN-HO: IS MY GRANDPA DOING WELL?
PLEASE TEACH HIM WELL, SIR!

234
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,641
Let's begin our Sunday recording.

235
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,370
Our ratings came out.

236
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,455
I see.

237
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:27,624
Was it that low?

238
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,754
Reorganization is around the corner.

239
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,340
Our show could even get canceled.

240
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,509
-"Canceled"?
-Hey.

241
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,886
That's enough.

242
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:52,608
What was he up to yesterday?
He didn't answer my calls.

243
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,111
Is something going on?

244
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,282
Ho-beom,

245
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,659
it's still not too late.

246
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,246
You had talent.

247
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,709
Ho-beom.

248
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,047
Come on. It's your turn.

249
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,763
This isn't fun anymore.

250
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,645
Ho-beom. Hey!

251
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,065
KIM HEUNG-SIK BALLET COMPANY

252
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:33,982
What's the theme?

253
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,318
It will be a gala like last year.

254
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,986
There will be three parts to it.

255
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,365
Honorary members, the main troupe,
and a special stage.

256
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:44,910
I asked Bom and Sang-su to perform
Talisman Pas de Deux as honorary members.

257
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,871
The main troupe will perform Who Is Next?

258
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:51,500
And we're going to hold an audition
for the special stage.

259
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,835
-An audition?
-Yes.

260
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:58,423
Last year, Ms. Kim Hyeon-a performed
in her wheelchair.

261
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,634
We'll see who makes it this year.

262
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,679
Can I recommend someone?

263
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:04,972
Who?

264
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,143
I'll tell you later. I'll be going now.

265
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,355
Seung-joo!

266
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,275
Who does he have in mind?

267
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:20,529
Don't worry.
There's someone he wants to pick.

268
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,365
I've packed some for Chae-rok as well,

269
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,325
-so eat with him.
-Okay.

270
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,577
I haven't seen him lately.

271
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,204
He's just busy.

272
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,582
-Where's mine?
-You need to go somewhere with me.

273
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,044
-Would that be okay with you?
-Of course.

274
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,296
What about my opinion?

275
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,840
-Thanks for the lunchbox.
-No problem. Goodbye.

276
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:43,427
Dad, you're going to the park again,
right? Can you go alone?

277
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,178
I'm going back to the studio.

278
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,180
They're done fixing.

279
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,266
-What?
-See you later.

280
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,358
Gosh.

281
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:03,113
Do you know you've been looking haggard
these days?

282
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,198
I'm completely fine.

283
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,201
Mom isn't picking up.

284
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,162
I haven't been home lately either.

285
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:14,082
I wonder if they're using
their gym memberships.

286
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,211
Is Eun-ho going to keep that job?

287
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,257
Can I just eat in peace?

288
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,634
Don't you feel exhausted?

289
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:27,220
I'm just worried about them. That's all.

290
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,889
Was I ever wrong?

291
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,769
People like you
need consultation the most.

292
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:37,647
Why? I'm totally fine.

293
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:46,740
-Hello.
-Hello.

294
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,493
Do you know why people
don't receive consultation?

295
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,536
-Why?
-Because they're worried

296
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,955
they may look weird
in other people's eyes.

297
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,125
-That's your personal opinion.
-I told you I'm fine--

298
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,337
Excuse me. Can you come with me, sir?

299
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,507
-What is it?
-What should we do? We're in huge trouble.

300
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,175
What's wrong?

301
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,533
The head office never mentioned
the principal could be lost.

302
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:33,036
The principal loss rate
is over 90 percent.

303
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:35,956
Excuse me.

304
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,632
Yes. Hello?

305
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,510
Sorry?

306
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:53,056
Ma'am, we're currently looking into it
right now.

307
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,058
There must've been a mistake.

308
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,435
Okay. We'll look into it
and call you back.

309
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,854
This has never happened before.

310
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:01,898
Okay. Don't you worry about it.
We'll call you back.

311
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:18,623
Honey.

312
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:22,043
Are they coming to sign the contract
at 3 p.m.?

313
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,170
Yes.

314
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:29,176
Your mother gave them to us.
You should have some.

315
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,343
What's gotten into you?

316
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,683
You didn't cause any trouble, did you?

317
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:39,186
Why would you say that
when I'm just being nice?

318
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:44,399
Anyway, thank you, Mr. Byun.

319
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,235
You're welcome, Ms. Sim.

320
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,757
Honey.

321
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,305
I've given up.

322
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,446
If it's not possible,

323
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,158
then so be it.

324
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,583
Goodness.

325
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:54,970
Honey,

326
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,681
do you remember

327
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:03,144
how we vowed to love each other

328
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,604
until death do us part?

329
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,987
I was smiling from ear to ear,

330
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,322
so people thought I wasn't all there.

331
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,199
That's why

332
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,327
your mother told you to stop smiling.

333
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,334
So what if we don't have kids?

334
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:30,088
I'm happy as long as I have you.

335
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,219
It's okay.

336
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,143
Wait. Where are we going?

337
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:47,522
Mom, are you sick?

338
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:49,024
Why are we at a clinic?

339
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:52,110
Then why else would I come here?
We're going to be late.

340
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:56,906
Your blood pressure's in the normal range.
Everything seems to be good.

341
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,116
Are you eating well?

342
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:01,494
Yes. I force myself to eat
even if I don't have an appetite.

343
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:02,871
That's good.

344
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,291
I won't prescribe you anything
for the dizziness.

345
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:09,627
Continue eating well
and take some supplements too.

346
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:13,423
Take a 30-minute walk every day
under the sun.

347
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:16,926
This isn't something uncommon
at your age, so don't worry.

348
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,429
Does that mean I'm okay?

349
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,389
Yes.

350
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,058
Do you also think so?

351
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,602
Yes, Mom. You're healthy.

352
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:27,729
That's good, then.

353
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,648
I can't afford to get sick.

354
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:45,914
Seong-gwan,

355
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,666
do you want some tteokbokki?

356
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,502
Sure.

357
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:01,638
-Mom.
-What?

358
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,308
Should I continue living with you

359
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,436
even after shooting my documentary?

360
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,273
What's gotten into you?

361
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,442
Just because.

362
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:20,073
When will I ever be able to spend
this much time with you and Dad?

363
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,745
Live your life.

364
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,164
I can't be bothered.

365
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:35,922
-Seong-gwan.
-Yes?

366
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,051
Don't try so hard.

367
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,642
Mom.

368
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:53,815
I can take care of your dad.

369
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,778
Mom.

370
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,867
You knew?

371
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,418
He's unwell.

372
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:15,587
What is it?

373
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,131
Spit it out.

374
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,091
He has…

375
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,469
Alzheimer's.

376
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:24,763
What?

377
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,640
He has Alzheimer's.

378
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,100
"Alzheimer's"?

379
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,269
My father?

380
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:33,897
He stood out on the street
for more than 30 minutes today.

381
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,568
-When I got there, he didn't recognize me.
-What?

382
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:39,903
That can't be.

383
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:00,298
It must've been so painful

384
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,843
carrying the burden alone.

385
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,310
He's not going to change right away,
so don't cry.

386
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,026
Don't tell your siblings, though.

387
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:27,075
Let's just watch your dad as he fights it.

388
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,248
I'm going to wait

389
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,168
until he tells me himself.

390
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,834
What is that geezer doing here?

391
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:30,513
YANG HO-BEOM: THAT OLD MAN IS ALL ALONE
AT THE PARK. WHAT SHOULD I DO?

392
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,351
LEE CHAE-ROK: DOES HE LOOK ILL?

393
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,902
YANG HO-BEOM: NO, HE'S JUST SITTING THERE

394
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,659
LEE CHAE-ROK: THEN NEVER MIND

395
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:55,371
Look at this bastard.
He asked me to let him know.

396
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,459
Did you have lunch?

397
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,967
It's nice to eat together.

398
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,718
Have you started exercising again?

399
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,473
Well… Not really.

400
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,725
Good thinking.

401
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,269
I didn't say yes.

402
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,814
I knew you'd mend your ways.

403
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:08,194
You had seemed like a loser
back at the billiard hall.

404
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,570
But you look amazing today.

405
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:13,574
Whatever. Don't be ridiculous.
There's nothing amazing about me.

406
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:18,371
I only ran for a bit,
but I was already out of breath.

407
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:19,956
After four years of rest,

408
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,750
my body has become stiff and weak.

409
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:27,296
-On top of that, I'm already 23 years old.
-And I'm 70.

410
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,800
We're different.

411
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,177
I'm just saying you still have time.

412
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,847
If it was too late,
you wouldn't even be in this dilemma.

413
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:39,225
Had I started ballet at your age,
it would've been great.

414
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:40,935
I would've looked grand.

415
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,898
Remember what I told you?

416
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,444
You can soar as well.

417
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:53,865
Here you go.

418
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:58,286
Eat more and cheer up. Here.

419
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:02,165
I'll give you some more. Here.

420
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,093
Is Mr. Sim not coming?

421
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,555
Don't you know the audition
is around the corner?

422
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,515
Didn't you say you were confident?

423
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,575
Mr. Ki, what a surprise.

424
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,202
Are you feeling better?

425
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,829
You haven't been showing up for some time.

426
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,373
I asked Chae-rok about you,
but he didn't say much.

427
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,875
I see.

428
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,795
You should start training again.

429
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,964
-Well, you see--
-I'll see you tomorrow.

430
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,966
Mr. Ki. Wait…

431
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,357
Where's everyone?

432
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,319
Gosh, I'm a bit hungry.

433
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,114
Where did my shoes go?

434
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:19,051
What is this smell? What is it?

435
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:24,098
What is that? Oh, dear.

436
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,811
Gosh, that's hot!

437
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,688
What is it? Mom, what's wrong?

438
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,482
-It's hot! Don't touch it!
-Oh, god!

439
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,153
Are you okay?

440
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,448
You burned your hand!

441
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,618
I didn't even grab it for that long.

442
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,528
What's wrong? Did you get hurt?

443
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,490
She got burned while moving a pot.

444
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,116
Hey, honey.

445
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,119
Gosh, you should've been more careful.

446
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:30,623
You must've forgotten about the pot
while cooking.

447
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:32,208
Father.

448
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,518
I'm sorry, Hae-nam.

449
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:55,481
Don't mind it.
I've burned so many pots too.

450
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:57,692
This will heal up quickly anyway.

451
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,987
It must hurt so much. I'm truly sorry.

452
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:05,074
If you're that sorry,
just buy me a good-quality pot.

453
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:06,367
Okay, I will.

454
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,046
I'm sorry, Seong-gwan.

455
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,800
It's okay.

456
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,776
Hello, sir.
Are you still at the head office?

457
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,739
No, I'm still in the office.

458
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,824
What did they say?

459
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:50,995
I see.

460
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:56,917
Once you're done, please call me back.
Thank you.

461
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,608
Hey, Seong-gwan.

462
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,819
Hey, can we meet up and talk right now?

463
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,114
Right now? Is this urgent?

464
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,240
Yes.

465
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,701
I'm getting a call.

466
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,329
Let's talk again later, okay? Bye.

467
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,630
Hey, Mr. Yoon. How did it go?
Did you look into it?

468
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,132
What?

469
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,266
SIM DEOK-CHUL

470
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,823
I told Mr. Sim to come back
starting tomorrow.

471
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:09,740
What?

472
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,243
I don't know what this is about,
but this is enough.

473
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:14,578
-But--
-Just listen to me.

474
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,846
Is that old man preparing well
for the audition?

475
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,433
How did you know it was him?

476
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:39,770
I pretty much know everything about you.

477
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,189
I knew the moment you said it'd be fun.

478
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:49,738
When Chae-rok first brought it up,
I thought it was absurd.

479
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:52,450
But then, I became curious.

480
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,578
I wonder if he could perform
on stage at his age

481
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,746
and how it would look.

482
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:01,542
Maya Plisetskaya performed
when she was 70.

483
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,004
It was truly beautiful.

484
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:08,048
You know, while watching her perform,

485
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,426
I could see all the hard work
she had done.

486
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:15,097
I couldn't fathom how much effort
she had put into it.

487
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:19,393
I also wanted to do ballet for that long.

488
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:24,190
Why did you quit again?

489
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,443
Do you really not know?

490
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:30,988
What was it again?

491
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:55,054
Mr. Sim. Are you okay?

492
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,768
What are you doing? Snap out of it!

493
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,145
Gosh, that's hot!

494
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,693
What if something happens to you?

495
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,613
What if you get into an accident
and get severely injured?

496
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:14,990
I'm fine now.

497
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,116
You should quit.

498
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,159
What?

499
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,788
You should quit ballet.

500
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:22,748
Chae-rok.

501
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,626
I can do it.

502
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:26,835
No, you can't!

503
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,005
So please give up already!

504
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,093
Chae-rok.

505
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,346
I'm terrified as well.

506
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,527
You can find the information here.

507
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,992
Can I be admitted at any time?

508
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:43,912
Yes, if there's available space. If not…

509
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,926
Gyo-seok, are you happy up there?

510
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,763
Are you steering the Forward?

511
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,895
Gyo-seok.

512
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,940
I'm a bit ill.

513
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:58,737
I thought I was still doing fine.

514
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,366
I thought I could manage.

515
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:18,674
I haven't seen Mr. Sim for some time now.

516
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,387
Did he really give up?

517
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,222
What do you mean?

518
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:27,349
Recently,

519
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:32,312
he came here limping and was worried.

520
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:36,316
So I suggested that he quit ballet

521
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,112
since doing so would spare him
such worries.

522
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,906
Was I being too blunt?

523
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:47,911
No, it was right of you. Goodbye, then.

524
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:57,796
They've sent you an official invitation.

525
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,759
The schedule for the contest is out,
so check.

526
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,012
INTERNATIONAL MOSCOW VALERY CONTEST

527
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,722
Let's do well this time around.

528
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:09,683
Where's Mr. Sim?

529
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,193
When are you going?

530
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:21,487
Next month.

531
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,875
I'm taking the admission test next week.

532
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:37,628
You're not going back to school?

533
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:42,049
I can enroll, take time off,
or drop out of school,

534
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,675
but I'll never go back.

535
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:48,305
I may be taking a test to get
into a Third Division,

536
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:51,391
but with this passion of mine,
I will go to Barcelona

537
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,476
someday.

538
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:55,312
There's no doubt I'll get in.

539
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:58,106
Will you be winning this time?

540
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:02,611
I'm not sure. Maybe if I don't get
into another incident.

541
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:07,324
You don't need to worry about Ho-beom.

542
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,576
What do you mean?

543
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:14,498
If you don't know what I'm saying,
just let it go.

544
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,084
What do you mean? Explain.

545
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:22,256
I'm just saying be like me
and give it your all.

546
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,467
By the way, where's Mr. Sim?

547
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,812
You can't just give up
simply because you were told to.

548
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,320
The sky is so blue.

549
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,075
You're right.

550
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:55,581
What?

551
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,750
What is this?

552
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:06,508
Oh, dear.

553
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:37,914
Hello, Ms. Choi.

554
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:39,666
Chae-rok.

555
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:45,255
Are you with my husband right now?

556
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:48,216
-Mr. Sim?
-Yes.

557
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,928
He's not picking up.

558
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:56,016
He should be home by now after practice.

559
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,477
Did your class end late today?

560
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:02,481
Still, he'd at least text me
and say that he'd be late.

561
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:06,943
Wait. Has he been telling you
that he's been practicing all this time?

562
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,321
What do you mean?

563
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:12,074
Did something happen?

564
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:14,701
Well…

565
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:16,870
You see…

566
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:20,540
Seong-gwan.

567
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:21,750
What is it?

568
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:24,628
Where's your dad?

569
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:26,963
He hasn't been going to class lately.

570
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:29,424
What do you mean?

571
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,051
I just spoke with Chae-rok.

572
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:34,346
-He said there was no repair work.
-What?

573
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:36,765
He's not picking up my calls.

574
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:39,184
There's nothing going on, is there?

575
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,271
He even took a portrait of himself
for his funeral.

576
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,606
For his funeral?

577
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,025
I'll look around the neighborhood.

578
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:53,240
Mom, I'll check the park
where he often visits.

579
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:12,801
WIFE

580
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:21,685
POWER OFF

581
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,073
CANNOT FIND
SIM DEOK-CHUL’S CURRENT LOCATION

582
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:14,780
Father!

583
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:22,704
Mr. Yoon, don't do this to me.

584
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,956
What difference will it make?

585
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,917
You're only hurting yourself.

586
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:30,295
Just calm down and go home for now.

587
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:31,963
Sober up, and we'll talk tomorrow.

588
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:34,174
Just go home already.

589
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:36,885
Okay.

590
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:02,118
Seong-gwan, I forgot to call you back.

591
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:04,037
Seong-san.

592
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:06,122
It's about Father.

593
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:08,834
What is it?

594
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:11,419
I can't reach him.

595
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:14,256
You can't reach him? What do you mean?

596
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,550
I'm sorry.

597
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,677
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

598
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:21,137
What the hell are you talking about?

599
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:23,390
Father is…

600
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:26,268
He's a bit sick.

601
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:28,728
Seong-gwan, be more specific!

602
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:31,481
How exactly is he ill?

603
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:33,400
He's…

604
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:37,028
Our father…

605
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,245
has Alzheimer's.

606
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,168
What?

607
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,002
SIM DEOK-CHUL'S CURRENT LOCATION FOUND

608
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,805
-Hello?
-I think I know where he is.

609
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,933
What? Where is he?

610
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,277
Father!

611
00:54:00,236 --> 00:54:01,446
Father!

612
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:04,866
Father!

613
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:08,536
Father!

614
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:11,790
Father!

615
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:19,089
Father.

616
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:33,979
Father?

617
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:52,205
Father.

618
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:56,918
What?

619
00:54:58,211 --> 00:54:59,671
How did you…

620
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,717
What are you doing here?

621
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:06,428
You haven't been picking up.

622
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,180
Do you know how worried Mom is?

623
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,100
Let's go home.

624
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,021
Get up. Let's go.

625
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:19,983
Seong-san.

626
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:30,326
Father.

627
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,705
Why you?

628
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,667
Why?

629
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:45,884
Father.

630
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:50,430
Father…

631
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:58,021
Father.

632
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,733
No matter how much you age,

633
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,406
you'll always be my big pillar.

634
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:14,496
You must never forget that. Ever.

635
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:35,225
Seong-san, did you find him?

636
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,486
Okay.

637
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:50,740
I'll call Mom. Okay.

638
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:54,536
Thanks.

639
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:58,206
I'm relieved.

640
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:01,167
Thank you for letting me know.

641
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:03,920
Bye.

642
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:26,317
How did you know where I was?

643
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:28,528
I didn't tell anyone.

644
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:32,657
That boy, Chae-rok, told me.

645
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:37,245
He had installed a location tracking app
on your phone.

646
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:38,663
I see.

647
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:03,021
It's snowing.

648
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:15,575
-Seong-san, I'm getting off.
-What? Father.

649
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:02,849
Mr. Sim.

650
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:04,976
Chae-rok.

651
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,146
I'm terrified as well.

652
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:13,276
But still, I practiced every single day.

653
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,905
Even though my memory may be failing,

654
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:20,408
I wanted my body to remember
like you once said.

655
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:22,410
I didn't skip a day.

656
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:25,788
Just do it.

657
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:27,832
What?

658
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:33,171
You should just keep doing ballet.

659
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:22,512
Every single day is precious.

660
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:25,098
Because I don't have much time left.

661
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:28,935
You've worked hard with Chae-rok
for the past year.

662
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:31,521
I'd like for you to show that on stage.

663
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,524
I've come this far thanks to you.

664
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:36,943
Don't go anywhere.

665
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:39,362
Achieve what you want by all means.

666
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:42,031
I'm really sorry.

667
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:46,035
Soon, it'll get even worse.

668
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,121
Even if you don't remember me,

669
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:49,956
I'll remember you.

670
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:55,044
