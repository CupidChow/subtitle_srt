1
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,009
Mr. Sim, I passed.

2
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,260
What?

3
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:55,096
-I'm moving on to the next round!
-Really?

4
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,599
Congratulations, Chae-rok!

5
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,439
I heard you made it to the next round.

6
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,609
Isn't it unfair?

7
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:13,406
Hey. It can't be this unfair, can it?

8
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,868
You're the reason my life got ruined,

9
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:19,829
so you shouldn't be happy, should you?

10
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:26,628
Hey, remember when you asked me
what I was good at?

11
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,465
Are you sure you weren't talented enough
to be scouted?

12
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,425
Shut the hell up.

13
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,804
While I attended the School of Dance
and Se-jong went to college,

14
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,390
you were still stuck in that field
from four years ago.

15
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,060
Do you still not get it?

16
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,104
I said, shut the hell up!

17
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:47,440
Is this the only thing you're good at?

18
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,735
Ask me again. Come on.

19
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,696
-This is enough.
-What?

20
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,950
I said, this is enough!

21
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:01,371
Why do we need to fight?
We have no reason to!

22
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,624
Yang Ho-beom.

23
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:09,087
It wasn't easy for me to get into ballet.

24
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,215
You can start anew again.

25
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,342
You loved football.

26
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,012
Shut the hell up!

27
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,415
Chae-rok…

28
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:36,466
Damn it.

29
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,803
Chae-rok!

30
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,440
Chae-rok.

31
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,364
Chae-rok, are you okay?

32
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:03,117
Oh, gosh. Where does it hurt? Where?

33
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,411
Is it your knee? Your ankle?

34
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,288
Where are you hurting so badly?

35
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,792
Oh, no. What should we do?

36
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:15,213
Mr. Sim, help me get up.

37
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:18,049
No. Stay here.

38
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,051
I'll call the doctor, okay?

39
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,976
EPISODE 6

40
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,019
Thankfully, his knees are fine.

41
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,983
His ankle is the problem.

42
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:38,528
I see stress fractures
and his ligament is stretched.

43
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,530
I see. What does this mean?

44
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,698
He needs a cast.

45
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,201
But the competition
is just around the corner.

46
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,411
When will he take it off?

47
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,328
Chae-rok!

48
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,209
I called him.

49
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,045
What is this?

50
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,382
Who the hell hurt your leg like this?

51
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,760
Who was it? Sue them this instant.

52
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,138
Would knowing their name
make a difference? Forget it.

53
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,974
What do you mean?
You have to perform a month from now!

54
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,393
-I'll be fine!
-Are you a doctor or something?

55
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,936
I'm the doctor here.

56
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:18,359
Let me share my opinion with you.

57
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,155
It's true. He'll be fine.

58
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,949
All athletes have stress fractures.

59
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:28,077
He fell down the stairs but didn't get
a single crack in his bones.

60
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,665
Let's put him in a cast for a week
and see how it goes.

61
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,898
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,319
Why would you apologize?

63
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,654
I think it's my fault.

64
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,157
I should've gotten hurt instead.

65
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,495
I'm a lousy manager.

66
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,998
It was just an accident.
It wasn't your fault.

67
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,917
No, I am to blame.

68
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:20,713
-Chae-rok isn't that kind of person.
-What are you talking about?

69
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:25,510
He's not someone who can be forced
to dance on the billiard table for money.

70
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,096
Seriously! So what do you want?

71
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,431
Leave Chae-rok alone.

72
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,351
Don't laugh.

73
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:38,231
Chae-rok is going to soar like an eagle.

74
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,692
I shouldn't have provoked that kid.

75
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,200
Chae-rok.

76
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,831
Are you okay?

77
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:58,751
Let's go.

78
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,413
Right, water.

79
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,961
Don't do anything and just rest up
for now.

80
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,720
Call me if anything happens.

81
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:54,098
Better yet, should I just sleep here?

82
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,143
-You can't go to the toilet alone.
-I want to be alone.

83
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,270
-But still…
-Mr. Sim.

84
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,192
I'll come here first thing in the morning.

85
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,194
Good night.

86
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,130
Where do you live? I'll drop you off.

87
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,007
That's okay.

88
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,009
It's getting late.

89
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,763
I need to stop by somewhere.
Goodbye, then.

90
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,361
MEDICINE
OH JOONG-SIK ORTHOPEDIC CLINIC

91
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,232
RESULT ANNOUNCEMENT

92
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,631
Poor him.

93
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,010
I guess he won't soar after all.

94
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,014
I know how you feel.

95
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,643
I felt the same way.

96
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,022
-I'll look for him so don't you worry.
-One time,

97
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,024
my family suffered because of my mistake.

98
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,569
I did everything I could.

99
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,447
I had to make ends meet.

100
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,826
-But our situation
-I haven't been asking for more

101
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,204
-just got worse.
-considering your situation.

102
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,289
-Thank you.
-I was struggling too much.

103
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,875
Wasn't this your promotion party,
not a housewarming?

104
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,504
-Both I and my life
-I'm just frustrated.

105
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:14,090
-looked so small.
-That's enough.

106
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,718
-When will he be able to pay off his debt?
-They were worried about me.

107
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,845
-Don't you worry about me!
-But

108
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,473
-Don't you worry!
-I hated it so much.

109
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,308
-What did you say?
-That's enough.

110
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,604
I couldn't take it.

111
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,774
It was none of their fault,

112
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:35,361
but I was so twisted inside

113
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,779
that I took it the wrong way.

114
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,826
I had lacked so much deep down.

115
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,663
What are you rambling about?

116
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,834
Chae-rok won't soar, you said?

117
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,921
Sure, that's a possibility.

118
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,800
But the same goes for you.

119
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,219
His misfortune will only bring upon yours.

120
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,224
I see. So you're here to threaten me.

121
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,768
So what? Will you sue me?

122
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,979
No, I won't.

123
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,898
Be my guest! I'm not afraid of you!
Just do it!

124
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,194
Damn it.

125
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,738
What a load of bullshit.

126
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,783
Ho-beom.

127
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,456
You can soar as well.

128
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,171
So stop this before it's too late.

129
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:02,406
I was only worried about you getting hurt.
This is unbelievable.

130
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,993
Does this mean he won't be able
to compete either?

131
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,078
We'll have to see.

132
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,541
I should've gotten hurt--

133
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:17,004
Goodness, don't say such a thing.
Neither of you should get hurt.

134
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,547
That's true, but…

135
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,134
Beef bone broth is the best
for your bones,

136
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,386
so fill it up to the brim.

137
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,596
Okay.

138
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,651
Make sure you chew well
so you won't get indigestion.

139
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:41,403
-Did you sleep well?
-Yes.

140
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,783
I bought a pair of crutches,
so it'll be easier for you to walk.

141
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,584
I'm not expecting anyone.

142
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,213
She found the right house. It's my wife.

143
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,215
-Your wife?
-Yes.

144
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:06,804
The mart downstairs sells good products.

145
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,014
They have fresh fruits.

146
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,684
You always pick the best ones.

147
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,853
You're right. I have a keen eye
for picking the best products,

148
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,648
-but not the best man.
-What?

149
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,025
Gosh.

150
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,696
You didn't have to come here. Thank you.

151
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,782
If you're grateful,
then recover as soon as possible.

152
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,577
Consider this your chance to take a break.

153
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:34,373
I bet you don't understand me.
I must sound like I'm rambling.

154
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,542
-You don't get me, do you?
-No.

155
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,713
He sure is very honest.

156
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:45,175
Pretend you didn't hear me.
Just forget it.

157
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,719
This too shall pass.

158
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,138
Okay.

159
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,474
Chae-rok, how is your ankle?

160
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,977
Are you hurting anywhere else?
How are you feeling?

161
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,313
Stop bombarding him with questions.

162
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,857
Let's go. Let's not bother him.

163
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,400
He needs some rest.

164
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,819
How can I leave him here by himself?

165
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,487
I need to take care of him.

166
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,365
I'm okay. You can leave.

167
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,784
Old people like us won't be of help.

168
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:14,288
Goodness, let's go. Don't be a nuisance.

169
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,540
-Will you really be okay?
-Yes.

170
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:20,252
Hey, before we go, write it down.

171
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,253
Write what down?

172
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,047
The name of that bastard
who did this to you.

173
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,966
I'll go slap his head.

174
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,259
Forget it.

175
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,303
Let's go.

176
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,057
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

177
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,188
Why now?

178
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,149
I know.

179
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,486
Should I introduce him
to a rehabilitation physician?

180
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,528
Yes.

181
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,741
This will be a rocky road.

182
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,535
The injuries aren't severe,

183
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,204
but why did it have to happen now?

184
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,916
To be frank,
he can enter another competition.

185
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:04,838
But recently, Chae-rok has been dancing
for his own sake.

186
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,008
He finally managed to set a goal
for himself.

187
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,970
I'm just disappointed about that.

188
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,348
What if he gets demotivated again?

189
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,142
What if he goes through another slump?

190
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,646
I hope that doesn't happen.

191
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:24,900
This is unlike you.

192
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:29,154
You weren't like this
when you got injured.

193
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,615
You've become a true mentor.

194
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,952
This is all you can offer.

195
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,662
He'll overcome it.

196
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,289
If not,

197
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,042
that'll be his end.

198
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,461
I know, but--

199
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,630
If you do, then don't give him that look.

200
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,174
If you look anxious,

201
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:52,011
he'll feel twice as anxious as you.

202
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,971
He won't be able to make a single turn.

203
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:58,976
First, let's wait
until he removes the cast.

204
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:02,479
Make a decision instead of worrying
or trying to comfort him.

205
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,815
Don't do anything else.
That's all you need to do.

206
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,567
And stop drinking.

207
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,283
HANGANG BANK

208
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,413
"Don't hesitate."

209
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,332
I'll put it up here.

210
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,633
Hello.

211
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,101
DON'T HESITATE
IN-HOUSE COUNSELING

212
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,868
Putting up posters
won't bring anyone to your office.

213
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,414
And consultations won't be of any help.

214
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,208
Everyone's busy ignoring their problems.

215
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,504
Then what about you?

216
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,507
Why do you always sit
on your father's old sofa?

217
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,133
What?

218
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,385
It's the same thing.

219
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,389
Sometimes, just having someone
listen solves problems.

220
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,356
By the way, you haven't been
visiting your parents lately.

221
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,984
Are you still that upset?

222
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,198
You're so petty.

223
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,659
Me?

224
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,586
It's true.

225
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,053
Hi, Mother. How are you?

226
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:02,349
I've made some beef bone broth
and thought about bringing you some.

227
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,393
You're quite busy, right?

228
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,520
I'll send Seong-san over.

229
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:07,896
Will you?

230
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,775
Your son tends to sulk for a long time

231
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:12,776
and holds grudges.

232
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,529
Hey, I never raised him to be like that.

233
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,616
My mother never raised me this way,

234
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,743
yet I tend to be cold and cranky.

235
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,037
You can never control your kids.

236
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,541
You know better than I do.

237
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,460
How's Father?

238
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:37,694
Ho-beom, that bastard.
Why didn't you do anything about it?

239
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:39,988
This is…

240
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,824
This is the same
as Messi breaking his legs.

241
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,828
Why is he blaming you
for ruining his own life?

242
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,834
Are you not even mad, you idiot?
Are you a saint?

243
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,213
I am furious,
but my ankle just hurts more.

244
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,340
Unbelievable.

245
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,845
I really wanted to do well
this time around.

246
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,849
I've never been this desperate
for anything.

247
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,812
I've finally learned

248
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,065
that loving and being desperate
only brings pain.

249
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,819
Messi didn't score any goals.

250
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,615
-What?
-I put up with that awful part-time job,

251
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:27,202
bought a ticket,
and flew all the way to Barcelona.

252
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,080
But he didn't score a single goal.

253
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,791
Even Messi can't score a goal every time.

254
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:33,750
Exactly.

255
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,504
So why would you despair
over something like this?

256
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,174
Snap out of it. You're nothing.

257
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:42,634
Okay?

258
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:46,346
Hey. Let me snap your Achilles heel
one more time.

259
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,599
Bueno. That's it.

260
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,521
I brought a gift.

261
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,316
You didn't have to.

262
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,942
It's not for you.

263
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,410
What is it?

264
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,005
Mr. Sim, did you clean the studio again?

265
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,134
A clean studio is always nice,

266
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,304
but you shouldn't do it anymore.
It makes me uncomfortable.

267
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,765
I only do it because I enjoy it.

268
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,141
Goodbye, then.

269
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,936
Aren't you going to practice?

270
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,940
No. How could I when Chae-rok is injured?

271
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,151
Mr. Sim.

272
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,031
-Would you like me to teach you instead?
-What?

273
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,451
-Until he recovers--
-Says who?

274
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,204
Chae-rok.

275
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,538
What? Why are you here?

276
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,708
I'm his teacher.

277
00:22:57,292 --> 00:23:00,170
And Mr. Sim, what kind of reply was that?

278
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,047
Were you ready to switch teachers?

279
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:06,259
What a traitor. You better brace yourself
for today's class.

280
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,804
"Class"? No, you shouldn't.

281
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,389
You should go back home.
Our class isn't important.

282
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,975
-You need to rest up--
-I'll only gain weight,

283
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,061
and it'll hinder my jumps.

284
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,896
That's not what's important.

285
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:20,857
Do you not want me to perform
in the competition?

286
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,984
What? Of course, I do.

287
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,112
Then just continue with our class.

288
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,197
This is for me, not you.

289
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:31,701
I need to keep my body active
to fully recover before the competition.

290
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:37,916
Please bring me a chair.

291
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:40,877
Me?

292
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,046
Are you talking to me?

293
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,340
No, let me.

294
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:47,134
You should bring the mat.

295
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:49,553
Hurry up. Bring it.

296
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:52,889
Come on.

297
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,353
Sir, please sit here.

298
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,155
-One iced Americano.
-Hey.

299
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,075
I'm thirsty.

300
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,708
How could you miss that?

301
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,006
You asshole!

302
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,467
What was that?

303
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:32,304
You're a loser
who pities yourself the most!

304
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,056
Have you gone insane?

305
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,391
What did you just say?

306
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,768
Hey, grab him.

307
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,020
Damn it.

308
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,569
Seul-a, I heard you got into Samil.

309
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,197
Samil? No way!

310
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,743
It's my treat at Cheongdam!

311
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,504
What is it this time?

312
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,261
I feel impatient.

313
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:16,765
I told them I'd look for something
that I enjoyed doing.

314
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,560
But after hearing that my friends
got into big companies,

315
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,521
I wonder if I should hurry
and do something.

316
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,315
Fight it.

317
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,611
That's exactly why I'm doing this.

318
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,113
I don't want to repeat the same mistake.

319
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:37,953
I want to find something meaningful to do
even if it takes some time.

320
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,830
But I don't know where to begin.

321
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,170
I'm no longer a student.

322
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,422
I can't be jobless forever.

323
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,135
Hey, can I work here?

324
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:58,848
Unbelievable.
Hey, don't drag me down with you, okay?

325
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,769
I'll be off.

326
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:07,899
I'll ask around and let you know.

327
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,527
Got it.

328
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,098
Hello, Grandpa.

329
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,892
-Mr. Sim.
-Yes?

330
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:47,439
Here.

331
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,196
Real men wear pink.

332
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,033
They're from Se-jong.
He enjoyed the porridge.

333
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,201
My favorite color is orange.

334
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,371
Mr. Sim. You do know you're silly
at times, right?

335
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,041
-Then I'll wear it.
-No, it's mine.

336
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,543
I should thank him.

337
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:10,337
See you tomorrow, Mr. Sim.

338
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,548
Wait for me, Chae-rok. Hey!

339
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:23,767
It's okay. Don't call a cab.
We're fine. You can go.

340
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,186
Why not?

341
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,147
-She should be here by now.
-Who?

342
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,149
Oh, there she is.

343
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,038
Why are you…

344
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:48,249
I asked her to drive you around
for the time being.

345
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,418
Why would you do that?

346
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,670
Get in. I'm not allowed to park here.

347
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,839
-Go on, now.
-I could've just taken a cab.

348
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,758
Get in.

349
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,938
Eun-ho, thanks.

350
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,773
Please take him home safely.

351
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,608
I'm not a kid.

352
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:15,819
-What?
-Put on your seatbelt.

353
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,154
I'll be clocking out early today.

354
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,781
Aren't you coming with us?

355
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,659
I should walk if I want to strengthen
my leg muscles. Bye.

356
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,912
-Bye.
-Mr. Sim.

357
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,176
You didn't have to drive me home.

358
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,430
Thanks.

359
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:46,599
At least you're thankful.

360
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,352
How did you get hurt?

361
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,146
What?

362
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,649
It just happened.

363
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:00,780
I heard you had planned
to enter a competition.

364
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,783
I still can.

365
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,036
I'm glad.

366
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,541
Did you find out?

367
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,627
When you're the happiest?

368
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,381
It was actually easier said than done.

369
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,510
To be honest, I'm not sure.

370
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:26,139
But I do know one thing.

371
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:31,311
On my way home today,
I just happened to look up.

372
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:34,814
The sky was bright and blue.

373
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,734
Just looking at it made me happy.

374
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,779
Just standing and watching.

375
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:44,866
How should I put it?

376
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:49,871
It just felt like time was floating
across the sky.

377
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,041
It felt really nice.

378
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,002
That's when I thought

379
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:59,464
that happiness could be felt
in the little details.

380
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,176
You don't always have
to achieve something grand.

381
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,013
You'll find it soon.

382
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:09,974
Really?

383
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,101
Yes.

384
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,286
Chae-rok!

385
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:35,834
-Hello.
-Hello.

386
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,090
What is it? And what's with that mask?
Are you a celebrity?

387
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,468
-Since when were you two…
-What do you mean?

388
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,471
I had no idea. I really didn't.

389
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,015
Had I known at the restaurant…

390
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,892
Forget it.

391
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,186
You should go. I'll go home with him.

392
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,814
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

393
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,863
-"See you tomorrow"?
-Just go.

394
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,197
-Gosh.
-My ankle hurts.

395
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,825
You should've told me sooner.

396
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,535
I said my ankle hurts.

397
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,371
-Forget your ankle--
-Shut up. Just help me.

398
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:16,207
You've been quite active
for someone who's hurt.

399
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,792
This is unbelievable.

400
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:29,888
Here.

401
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,389
I'm fine.

402
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:35,393
-Come on. That's going to leave a scar.
-Gosh.

403
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,440
Why did you pick a fight with him?

404
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,861
Your fighting spirit matters more
than your strength.

405
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,699
-And I landed an extra punch.
-What?

406
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,245
You crazy bastard.

407
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:02,587
Why are you here?

408
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,589
I said I'm not going there.

409
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,342
We're not talking about my parents here.

410
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,053
We're talking about yours.
It's their house.

411
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,096
I never said it wasn't.

412
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,015
Why did she make beef broth soup at home?

413
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:17,226
Isn't it obvious? She wanted to feed you.

414
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,561
I can go to a restaurant.

415
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,897
She always complains of back pain, so why?

416
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,733
Just go and bring some.

417
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:27,779
Once she passes away,
you won't be able to have any.

418
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,949
Don't you know why I've been storing

419
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:34,035
my mom's pumpkin porridge for three years?

420
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,623
Gosh.

421
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,338
Hey.

422
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,347
She just won't yield.

423
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,890
Why did she take that after me?

424
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,937
Did it hurt?

425
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:46,649
Yes.

426
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,531
I'm glad.

427
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:58,536
-If you ever say that to him again--
-I'm sorry.

428
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:06,294
Your wedding anniversary is just around
the corner. You guys should dine out.

429
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:10,131
The gym memberships I had purchased
last time are inside as well.

430
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:13,134
It's okay. Your dad always prepares
something for our anniversary.

431
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:18,556
If he remembers one thing,
it's our wedding anniversary.

432
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,808
Take some beef bone broth.

433
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,508
Father.

434
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,511
What? Hey, Seong-san.

435
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,557
-Do you need a ride?
-It's okay. I'm almost home anyway.

436
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:07,271
Your mom will sleep soundly tonight.

437
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,941
Thanks, Seong-san.

438
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,235
What about you?

439
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,737
Me? Well…

440
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:22,078
-Goodbye.
-Seong-san, drive safely.

441
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:47,830
Mr. Sim.

442
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,125
Ta-da.

443
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,127
Check this out. Get on.

444
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,004
You didn't need to…

445
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,633
Mr. Sim, did you…

446
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:05,181
You want a wheelchair this time?

447
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:09,977
Yes. Imagine Chae-rok going up the stairs.

448
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:13,689
As Chae-rok's doctor
and the team's physician,

449
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,566
I'm sure you already know.

450
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,944
-But if I must explain myself--
-You see,

451
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,529
I didn't think he'd need…

452
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,744
Never mind. You can take one.

453
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:29,872
-Take them all.
-Thank you, sir.

454
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:37,296
Let's go. Eun-ho is waiting.

455
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,174
Slow down.

456
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,027
Eun-ho, this is it.

457
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,866
-What are you doing? Go get ready.
-Okay.

458
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,702
-Let me get changed.
-Okay.

459
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:14,500
-Can you give me my crutches?
-Here.

460
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,883
-Come in.
-Okay.

461
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,938
So this is what
a ballet studio looks like.

462
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,567
It's pretty.

463
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:43,738
It is. It's the prettiest
when the sunlight is shining through.

464
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,211
Do I look odd?

465
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,631
No. You look amazing.

466
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,111
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

467
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:34,789
How is it?

468
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:38,626
It's fine.

469
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,836
Thank you.

470
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,923
-Let's take an x-ray.
-Okay.

471
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,680
I guess being young helps.
You've recovered quickly.

472
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,308
He's really fine.

473
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,976
If he wears an ankle brace

474
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,437
and gets physical therapy
until the competition,

475
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,855
he'll be all right.

476
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,859
See? I told you I was strong.

477
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,611
I was injury-free
as a football player too.

478
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:06,821
Still, be careful.

479
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:10,032
-You could sprain it again.
-Okay.

480
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,827
I'm happy for you.
You've gone through so much.

481
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,495
Thank you.

482
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,165
-Can I go now?
-Take better care of yourself.

483
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,794
I'll start practicing from now on.

484
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:24,130
Can you please take it slow?

485
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,881
Goodbye, then.

486
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,261
LEE CHAE-ROK: I REMOVED MY CAST.
THANK YOU.

487
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:31,762
IF YOU'RE GRATEFUL, TREAT ME

488
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,056
SO-YEONG

489
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:37,768
Hey, So-yeong.

490
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:43,566
A part-time job? Were you serious?

491
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:03,169
Chae-rok. What is it? Does it hurt?

492
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,046
I'm okay.

493
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:27,610
There's so much to prepare for
before the competition.

494
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,820
I thought you could borrow your outfit.

495
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,406
It requires a lot of money.

496
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,825
Still, it's a good opportunity.

497
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:38,496
You have to work so hard
because your manager is so lousy.

498
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,623
I'm sure you'll do well.

499
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,588
-You too.
-What?

500
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,174
You're also a dancer.

501
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:52,676
-You're an amateur dancer.
-I am?

502
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,971
That's why you should also
take care of yourself.

503
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,973
Rest up tomorrow since it's the weekend.

504
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,642
I'm fine.

505
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,020
Okay.

506
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,246
What is it?

507
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,665
Why are you here at this hour?

508
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,335
Are you here to pry?

509
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:30,839
I'm not you.
I'm here to check on Chae-rok.

510
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,550
I heard he went to rehab yesterday.

511
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,177
You are here to pry.

512
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:52,903
He seems to be doing fine.
His landings are stable too.

513
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,367
What is it?

514
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,369
He took painkillers.

515
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:14,550
How many pills did you take?

516
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,470
Not that many.

517
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,348
They all take some when they're injured.

518
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,559
They even get shots before contests
or performances.

519
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:24,893
Are you serious?

520
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:27,187
You just began your career.

521
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,939
Are you going to end it
after one competition?

522
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:31,108
Don't exaggerate. This is a minor injury.

523
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,818
Just go home today.

524
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:34,945
-No.
-Go.

525
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,667
He's just like you.

526
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:00,929
You'll rehearse with that back of yours?

527
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:02,890
Are you really going to perform?

528
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:05,851
Do you want to end your career?
Come to your senses!

529
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:07,519
I'm really fine.

530
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,440
Who else will play Basilio?

531
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:13,817
They've already cast another.

532
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:16,028
What?

533
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,950
Seung-joo!

534
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:29,375
Seung-joo.

535
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,837
-Seung-joo.
-I am Basilio.

536
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,382
I will perform on stage.

537
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,717
If you don't want me to,

538
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,470
then just fire me.

539
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:46,975
That's why I'm here.

540
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,061
My arrogance…

541
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,064
got the best of me.

542
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:12,501
Hankuk University of Arts,
School of Dance.

543
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:20,467
-The spinach grown from these parts…
-Spinach.

544
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,344
…have a sweet taste.

545
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:28,100
Compared to last year, the popular crop
has grown by forty percent.

546
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,979
Honey, I'll be leaving now.

547
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:33,856
Where are you going?

548
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:36,942
Isn't today your day off?

549
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:39,945
It is, but I want to check on Chae-rok.

550
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:43,449
He'll be dancing all day,
so I should be of help.

551
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:45,284
I might come home late today.

552
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:46,910
Don't you know what day it is?

553
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:49,163
What?

554
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:51,373
Gosh, you really forgot.

555
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:54,126
That was one thing
I could still brag about,

556
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:56,170
but you even took that from me.

557
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:59,840
-Do you really not know?
-Is today a special day?

558
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:01,925
It's our wedding anniversary.

559
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,304
-That's today?
-Yes, it is.

560
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:07,931
Today's the day I totally fell
for your love letter

561
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,975
and turned myself
into a terrible daughter.

562
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:13,520
Darn it. Hurry up and get changed.

563
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:21,862
I've always remembered it.

564
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:37,085
What? I heard you were injured.
Are you okay now?

565
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,712
What's wrong? Disappointed?

566
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,257
Don't build castles in the air.
The Grand Prix is mine.

567
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,026
Why are you staring at me?

568
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,571
Hae-nam, should we take a photo?

569
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,908
We're too wrinkly for that now.

570
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,327
We never took one just with each other.

571
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,038
We should cherish your beauty
for a long time.

572
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:17,334
Look at you trying to make up for today.

573
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:18,418
All right.

574
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:22,172
Is there a place
you'd like to go afterward?

575
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:25,968
Yes, there is.

576
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,701
Hey, Sang-su.

577
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:54,538
Ms. Eun, are you sure
Chae-rok has fully recovered?

578
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:56,415
I think he's overstraining himself.

579
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:57,332
What?

580
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:03,714
Get up.

581
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,258
Chae-rok is practicing at school.

582
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:08,885
What?

583
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,640
Put your hands here.

584
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:17,561
I'll take the photo now. Please smile.

585
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,814
One, two, three.

586
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:24,735
Yes. Looks good.

587
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,954
Look at that big fish.

588
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:38,999
Gosh, there are many strange-looking fish.

589
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:44,755
Were there aquariums
back when we got married?

590
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:48,425
No, there weren't. We only had zoos.

591
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:49,801
Right?

592
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:54,097
-Honey, come here.
-What? Why?

593
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,767
Let's take a photo with them.

594
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,560
-Come here.
-Okay.

595
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:09,613
-Honey.
-Yes?

596
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:10,906
Try this on.

597
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:21,416
MOM

598
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,256
Gosh.

599
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,763
What do you think?

600
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,599
I think it fits me.

601
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:41,311
-Gosh, it's perfect.
-Really? Is it nice?

602
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:45,524
I should be getting a divorce,
not picking out clothes for you.

603
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:47,150
Oh, please.

604
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,070
-Honey.
-Yes?

605
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,614
-I'm nervous.
-Why?

606
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:54,741
At least you went to college.

607
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:57,077
I'm nervous since this is my first time.

608
00:49:58,203 --> 00:50:00,872
-I'll pass, right?
-How did you even give your speech?

609
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,791
Just think of them as voters.

610
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:05,168
Those judges are all electors.

611
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,589
"Electors"? You're right.

612
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:13,218
Honey, I feel confident now. Really.

613
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:14,678
Goodness.

614
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:19,433
She's so halfhearted.

615
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,476
Seong-gwan would be worse.

616
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,860
I didn't get any sleep last night,
so I'm so tired.

617
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:31,695
Why did you want
your first patient's chart?

618
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:33,697
Did you get sued or something?

619
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,742
I want to visit them.

620
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,704
For what? The patient is dead.

621
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:43,915
I'm sure somebody remembers the patient.

622
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:46,209
But why? Why would you visit them?

623
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:50,839
For your documentary?

624
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:55,010
Right. I'll never forget
my first patient either.

625
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,557
At least yours survived.

626
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:02,476
Bye.

627
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:06,271
Hey, be safe. Okay?

628
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:09,357
See? I told you.

629
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:11,777
They must be busy,
so stop sending them photos.

630
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,820
It only takes 30 seconds to reply.

631
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,947
This won't do. I'll send it to Seong-san.

632
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,575
You and your undying love for him…

633
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,287
This way, please.

634
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,299
-Thank you.
-No problem.

635
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:42,557
What is this?

636
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:44,726
Hello, Mr. Idea.

637
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:47,521
What?

638
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:50,232
What do you think? Isn't it grand?

639
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:54,694
Don't you think they'd want to come here
to sit on this couch?

640
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:56,404
Sure.

641
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:00,909
Thank you for the inspiration, Mr. Sim.

642
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:04,663
By the way, who paid for it?

643
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:07,249
I donated it.

644
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,337
DONATED BY KIM AE-RAN

645
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,895
-Let me see your phone.
-What?

646
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:38,071
I'll send this one to Eun-ho.

647
00:52:38,154 --> 00:52:42,409
Hae-nam, that's enough. Come on.

648
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,702
Stop.

649
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:46,913
A junior radio scriptwriter?

650
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:49,791
Why? Do you not want to?

651
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,795
Countless others would die for this job.

652
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:59,718
That's not why.
I just never considered it before.

653
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:05,974
You've never listened to our show,
have you?

654
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,852
Forget it, then.

655
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:11,354
We just wasted our time.

656
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:14,357
Wait a minute.

657
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:31,666
I'm hungry again
even after having pork cutlet.

658
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:34,169
-Do you want me to buy something?
-Yes.

659
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:38,590
What do you want? Bread? Candy?

660
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,342
A drink and some candy.

661
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:42,177
-Okay, I'll be right back.
-Okay.

662
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:12,958
Once you've been on stage, you'll never
want to sit in the audience again.

663
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:17,629
Do you want to sit here?

664
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,466
No.

665
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:24,761
Then give up on this competition.

666
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:26,221
What?

667
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,685
No. Why should I do that?

668
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:34,938
I didn't break my ankle or tear
my muscles, so why all of a sudden?

669
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:37,399
-I can do well.
-I make that decision.

670
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,401
What right do you have?

671
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,029
I'm the one who'll be performing, not you!

672
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:45,281
You know how hard I worked for this.

673
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,409
How could you tell me to give up
so easily?

674
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:49,202
I'm going to compete.

675
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:58,837
That's exactly why I quit ballet.

676
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:02,924
I was stubborn and arrogant just like you.

677
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:12,142
If things go wrong,
this could be the end of your career.

678
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:16,855
And I refuse to allow that.

679
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:39,794
Mommy.

680
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:42,213
Mommy.

681
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:45,300
Mommy.

682
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:47,385
Mommy.

683
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:52,766
Mommy.

684
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:58,188
-Mommy.
-We are looking for a lost girl.

685
00:55:58,271 --> 00:56:01,399
If you find a seven-year-old girl
in pigtails and a red coat…

686
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:06,738
-Mommy…
-Hey, kid.

687
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:09,240
Mommy…

688
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:10,492
Hey, kid.

689
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:15,705
If you locate the child,
please report to the information desk.

690
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:57,288
What's taking him so long?

691
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,166
Maybe I should've tagged along.

692
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:23,022
Excuse me.

693
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,316
Wait.

694
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:32,240
Please be advised.
The aquarium will be closing at 8 p.m.

695
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,328
He even left his phone with me.

696
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:46,296
Honey.

697
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:48,590
Goodness.

698
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:50,842
Honey.

699
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:56,139
Honey.

700
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:00,768
Honey.

701
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:03,438
Gosh.

702
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:05,815
What should I do?

703
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:11,738
SEONG-SAN

704
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:17,785
The person you have dialed is
not available.

705
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:20,288
Your call will be forwarded to voicemail…

706
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:23,041
SEONG-SUK

707
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:06,209
-Mr. Sim, let me call you--
-Is it you, Chae-rok?

708
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:08,545
Ms. Choi?

709
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:12,590
This is urgent, and none of my kids
are picking up.

710
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:13,925
That's why I called you.

711
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:17,387
Is something wrong?
Why are you calling me with his phone?

712
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,640
He disappeared.

713
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:22,475
What?

714
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:45,183
Mr. Sim went missing?

715
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:47,685
I've always been envious of Chae-rok.

716
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:50,605
If only I had started ten years earlier.

717
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:54,025
I thought you could show the world the
kind of dance that I wanted to show.

718
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:55,777
How bad is your pain?

719
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:58,154
I would like to soar for once.

720
01:00:58,237 --> 01:01:02,158
-I heard he's always shimmying around.
-What my husband does is art.

721
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:04,619
You have to practice
until it becomes muscle memory.

722
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:05,536
En avant.

723
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:10,166
I want to perform on stage.

724
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:14,962
