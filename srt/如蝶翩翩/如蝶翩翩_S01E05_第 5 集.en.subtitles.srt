1
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:51,593
Did I ever ask you
to give me a good score?

2
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,556
You handed me your thesis paper
and said you'd give me a good score.

3
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,391
Listen to yourself.

4
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,395
Eun-ho. You could've refused.

5
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,231
What?

6
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:11,237
How? You were the one evaluating me.

7
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,449
Why did Cho Min-jae get an A
while I got a C?

8
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:19,079
I wasn't bad at my job. I gave it my all.

9
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,246
So…

10
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,292
So why must I be disqualified?

11
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:27,545
Why?

12
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:28,713
Eun-ho.

13
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:49,984
I'll go talk to her.

14
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:11,756
How pathetic.

15
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,510
Kids these days
blame everything on others.

16
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:19,097
That's exactly why she didn't get the job.

17
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,350
Is this what having a job

18
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,061
at a big company does to you?

19
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,396
Sorry?

20
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,189
These young people are trying hard
to secure a job.

21
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,276
Do you think you have the right
to take advantage of them

22
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:34,154
and complain about "kids these days"?

23
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,574
Sir, who are you to--

24
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,075
Don't call me sir.

25
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,121
Why should you? Just because I'm older?

26
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:48,293
You see, I've got nothing to say
to young people these days.

27
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,003
I feel sorry for them.

28
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:55,216
We've told them to work hard,
but hard work doesn't always pay off.

29
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,262
Not as long as someone like you
holds on to what you've got.

30
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,433
If you can't root for them,
at least don't trample on them.

31
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,102
Shame on you!

32
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,331
EPISODE 5

33
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,031
Ever feel like you're running
on a treadmill?

34
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,369
You run as fast as you can

35
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,081
until you are out of breath,

36
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,543
but you can't move an inch forward.

37
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,463
It's only the background that has changed.

38
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:02,635
In middle school,
my senior year of high school…

39
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,430
And now as a graduate intern…

40
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,476
Each time, I've felt the exact same way.

41
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,271
It creeps me out.

42
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,070
I guess you're different.

43
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,450
What makes you think I'm different?

44
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,291
I played football for 13 years
when I had no talent for it.

45
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:36,085
Back then,
I also felt like I was on a treadmill.

46
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:42,133
After every game, I'd run away,
get caught, and get beaten up.

47
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,302
I'd sneak out and run away

48
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,512
over and over again.

49
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,894
Then how did you…

50
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,313
How did I find what I love?

51
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,404
I just did what I really wanted to do.

52
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,868
I used to live my life
the way my father told me to.

53
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,704
I ran 100 laps around the field
if I was told to,

54
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,290
did 1,000 kick-ups if I was told to,

55
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,125
and played in a game if I was told to.

56
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,712
But I realized the moment I saw ballet.

57
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,966
"I don't want to live like this anymore.

58
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,928
I want to soar
at least once in my lifetime.

59
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,100
What does it feel like to be on stage?

60
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,185
Should I give it a try?

61
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,981
Yes, I'll try it."

62
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,485
For the first time in my life,

63
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,863
I faced my problem head-on.

64
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,242
Because I wanted to be happy.

65
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,539
What makes you happiest?

66
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,332
What?

67
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,835
Well…

68
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,170
Let me see…

69
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,343
Start by finding out what that is.

70
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,680
That's not something I can tell you.

71
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,225
You're the only one who knows

72
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,228
what makes you happiest.

73
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,119
-Hello?
-She just left.

74
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,956
I don't know. I think she's going home.

75
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,083
I'm glad that you found her.

76
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,210
Thanks, Chae-rok.

77
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,505
Not at all.
I'm not sure if I was any help.

78
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,967
Anyway, where are you? Are you home?

79
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,094
I'm on my way home now.

80
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,513
-You're going home now?
-See you tomorrow, Chae-rok.

81
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,653
Why isn't this brat picking up?

82
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,532
-Will you stop?
-What did I do?

83
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,576
She failed to be in the top ten percent.

84
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,871
I couldn't believe it
when I heard it from my friend.

85
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,004
Eun-ho.

86
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,383
Hey! Come here this instant!

87
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,353
How in the world…

88
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:50,321
It's a list of companies hiring this fall.
Apply to all of them.

89
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,699
Make sure you find a job within the year.

90
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,537
Why aren't you answering?
Are you listening--

91
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,996
Eun-ho!

92
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:04,585
I can't do this.

93
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:07,505
No.

94
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,299
-I don't want to.
-What?

95
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,676
I don't want to do this.

96
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,470
You don't want to?
You're in no position to say that.

97
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,514
You've only just begun.

98
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,183
-Is there even an end?
-What?

99
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:23,729
When I entered middle school,
high school, and college,

100
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,816
you told me it was only the beginning.

101
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,402
"You've only just begun. Get a grip."

102
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,946
That's what you told me.
But why does it never end?

103
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,614
You really don't understand?

104
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,950
This is for you to climb
as high as you can.

105
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,369
Don't you know what happens
if you fall behind?

106
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:41,956
How could you
not even pass your internship?

107
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,083
-Is this all you've got?
-Yes.

108
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,670
This is all I've got.
You didn't know that?

109
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,005
What did you just say?

110
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,131
Eun-ho.

111
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:56,220
What do you even know about me?

112
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,139
Dad.

113
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,268
Do you know why I hate gimbap?

114
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,439
Do you, Mom?

115
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,735
See?

116
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,112
You know nothing.

117
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,951
After we moved to Gangnam when I was five,

118
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,455
I went to all kinds of cram schools.
You know that much, right?

119
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,166
What you don't know is,

120
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:28,127
I was so busy
that I didn't even have time to eat.

121
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,882
I had to stuff myself with gimbap
in Mom's car day in, day out.

122
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,677
That's why I don't eat it anymore.
It makes me sick.

123
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:41,390
Do you have any idea
how suffocated I felt?

124
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:45,603
Do you know how much I suffered?

125
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,690
What makes you so special?

126
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,400
Everybody lives like that.

127
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:56,489
Can't you ask me if I'm okay for once?

128
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,868
I've worked hard.

129
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,872
Because I didn't want to lose
and wanted to climb as high as you did,

130
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,750
I made such a fool of myself.
Do you know that?

131
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,338
But I still failed.

132
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,716
This is the end for me.

133
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,051
The "end"?

134
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,012
That's complete nonsense.

135
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,475
So? What's your plan now?

136
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,229
What makes you happiest, Dad?

137
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,773
What?

138
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,319
Someone asked me that question today,
but I couldn't answer it.

139
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,406
I'm going to find it out.

140
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:46,080
Eun-ho! Come back here right now! Eun-ho!

141
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,289
Eun-ho!

142
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,708
Eun-ho!

143
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:09,520
EUN-HO, I'VE PARKED YOUR CAR OUTSIDE.
THE KEYS ARE IN THE MAILBOX.

144
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,786
This is calcium,

145
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,164
Omega-three,

146
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,792
and multivitamins.

147
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,295
I need to take all of these?

148
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:37,715
Remember what the kids said?
I'm the one who has to look after you.

149
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,468
At your age, just walking
makes your joints ache.

150
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,762
All this stretching and jumping every day…

151
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,347
Something's got to give.

152
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,600
I'm still going strong.

153
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,518
Look, I'm made of steel.

154
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,645
Even steel rusts with age.

155
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,688
Do as I say.

156
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,356
It's really unnecessary.

157
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,108
Come on.

158
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,027
I mean, I appreciate it.

159
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,529
Are you leaving without eating?

160
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:04,450
I'm Chae-rok's manager. I should
get there early and get ready.

161
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,119
He's busy practicing for the competition.

162
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,746
I'll get going.

163
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,415
Are you sure you don't need to eat?

164
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,875
When things settle down,

165
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,878
bring your ballet teacher here.
I want to cook for him.

166
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,338
Okay, I will.

167
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,452
CERTIFICATE OF EXCELLENCE
CERTIFICATE OF APPOINTMENT

168
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,714
IT'S CHAE-ROK.
WHATEVER YOU DO, I ROOT FOR YOU!

169
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,262
What on earth makes me happy?

170
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,192
Wait, where are the car keys?

171
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,208
Grandpa.

172
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,085
Eun-ho.

173
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,087
You caught me.

174
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,719
I'm sorry there's nothing else
I can do for you.

175
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,765
I'm okay, Grandpa.

176
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,311
This will pass, Eun-ho.

177
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,815
It's something my life has taught me.

178
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,193
All kinds of things have happened,
but I barely remember anything.

179
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,404
They're all in the past.

180
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:09,742
Of course, it's best if you never fall.

181
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,286
It'd be great
to have an easy ride in life.

182
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,954
But you see,

183
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,874
it's okay to fall.

184
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,376
It's no big deal
scraping your knee a little.

185
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,340
It's not your fault.

186
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,092
You know that, right?

187
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,765
I'm glad that you hung in there,
and I'm glad that you yelled at her.

188
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,183
You made me proud yesterday.

189
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,316
I'll get going now. See you.

190
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:11,971
What are you doing?

191
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,973
I know you can't finish it on your own.

192
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:15,975
Eat up and get lost.

193
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,603
It was a bad idea
to have them practice together.

194
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,065
Stop being so petty. It's just a sandwich.

195
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,242
From the top again.

196
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,083
Remember, right hand.

197
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,720
Feet up! Stop!

198
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,391
Try again.

199
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,575
Stop. Stop!

200
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,540
Didn't you hear me?

201
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,461
Why do you keep stopping me?

202
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,880
Keep your movements clean.

203
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,799
Don't just try to get to the end.

204
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,927
Chae-rok, you still have plenty of time.

205
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,056
The video submission deadline
is next week, so take your time.

206
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,099
Don't sprain your ankles.

207
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,268
Mind your own business.

208
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,668
Hi, Chae-rok.

209
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,254
I'm on my way.

210
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,131
What?

211
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:15,260
I'll schedule a make-up lesson. I'm sorry.

212
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:19,431
No problem. Your competition
is more important than our lessons.

213
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,016
Of course.

214
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,895
Make sure you eat well. Bye.

215
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,860
Time is running out.

216
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,906
Fine, I'll just practice on my own.

217
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,800
Hey, let's call it a day.

218
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,553
You look exhausted.

219
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,014
Let me try once more.

220
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,938
Gosh, he's stubborn.

221
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,273
He's just like you.

222
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,775
He's such a perfectionist.

223
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,070
It's not like this is the final round.

224
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:19,074
You're right.
Still, he's way better than Sang-su.

225
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,368
Look at him.

226
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,090
Oh, dear. My goodness.

227
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,634
-Hello.
-What are you doing there, Doctor?

228
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:05,097
The thing is,
Chae-rok didn't show up today.

229
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,724
I'm his doctor and as a part of the team,
so I thought…

230
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,227
I'm sorry, Doctor.

231
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,813
I'm the one who asked you to do this,
so I'll--

232
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:16,149
No. Forget about Chae-rok.

233
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,611
Your hips seem out of alignment.

234
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,407
What?

235
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:35,002
It can become a serious problem
if you don't get treatment.

236
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:38,422
Also, if you keep jumping like that,
your joints will suffer.

237
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:41,425
That must be why I've been feeling stiff.

238
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,720
The thing is, I feel impatient.

239
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,972
Time is running out,
but my body can't keep up.

240
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,767
Even if I hold on to the bar,

241
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,602
my legs still fail me.

242
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,522
You think I'm a silly old man, right?

243
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,524
Please don't say anything to Chae-rok.

244
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,194
Don't worry.

245
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,238
I can keep a secret.

246
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,197
Hey, couldn't you call earlier?

247
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,074
I was about to go home.

248
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,327
-What is it?
-What else?

249
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,538
You're right. But too bad.

250
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,749
Business hours are over.

251
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:58,752
I mean, the clinic is closed for the day.

252
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:00,295
The lights are still on.

253
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,255
I'm turning them off now.

254
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:05,175
-Stop joking.
-I'm not.

255
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:07,094
I'm leaving. I'm going…

256
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,347
I'm sorry, Mr. Sim.

257
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,743
I should go and practice.

258
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,918
Chae-rok.

259
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,755
What happened?
Did you hurt yourself? Is it serious?

260
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,051
I heard that you practiced on your own.

261
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,179
You're not entering a competition.
Take it easy.

262
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,557
Well, I didn't do much.

263
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,685
Is your knee bothering you again?

264
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,395
What a pain.

265
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,690
Do you need anything?
Is there anything I can do?

266
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:02,858
Forget it.

267
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:06,027
Should I wait here
and call you a taxi later?

268
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,989
I'm fine. Go home and rest.

269
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:10,615
Okay.

270
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,702
I'll be practicing for the competition
here tomorrow.

271
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,787
Come early and watch me practice.

272
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,206
You can learn by watching, too.

273
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,791
Really?

274
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,084
Yes.

275
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,745
I'm practicing. Keep it short.

276
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,080
How's it going?

277
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,583
Are you with Sang-su, that jerk?

278
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:02,667
What is it?

279
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,377
I just wanted to say hi.

280
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,296
I'm enlisting.

281
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,756
What?

282
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:12,093
I'm not as good as you and Sang-su,
so I have no chance of winning.

283
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,471
I think I'll just get it over with.

284
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:18,850
I'll decide whether I should continue
to dance after my military service.

285
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,394
Once we're over 30,
we all have to retire anyway.

286
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,730
So get it together.

287
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:26,441
This must be your last chance.

288
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,404
Honey, I'm leaving.

289
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,658
Gosh, you smell like pain-relief patches.
Take it easy.

290
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:38,620
Ballet requires a lot of practice.

291
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,081
Also, I get to watch
something amazing today.

292
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:47,837
What's wrong?

293
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,214
Where's my phone?

294
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,218
I was just holding it in my hand.
Where did it go?

295
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,595
-It's not in your pocket?
-No.

296
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:58,765
Give me just a second.

297
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,610
There it is.

298
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:14,155
And you call me forgetful? Here you go.

299
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,992
How did it end up there?

300
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:41,141
I see.

301
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,351
Okay. Bye.

302
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,769
Hi, Mom.

303
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:46,438
Goodness.

304
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,315
Where's Yeong-il?

305
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,150
He's showing houses.

306
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:54,487
Hey, quit drinking coffee.
It's bad for you.

307
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,323
Drink this instead.

308
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,325
You made sikhye?

309
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:01,161
You didn't have to bring these
all the way here.

310
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:02,996
My goodness.

311
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:06,207
But this won't stop me
from drinking coffee.

312
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,752
I guess you're still young.
Can I get some water?

313
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:10,211
Sure.

314
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,922
Why didn't you ask Dad for a ride?

315
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,633
He doesn't have a car anymore.
He gave it to Eun-ho.

316
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:18,470
That piece of junk? Why?

317
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,973
I let him do ballet
or whatever it's called.

318
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,100
And he gave his car away,

319
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,686
saying he'd walk for exercise
instead of drive.

320
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:30,815
Yesterday, he practiced at the studio
almost until midnight.

321
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,609
He could've gotten her a new car--

322
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,069
Did you really let him do it?

323
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,612
Didn't Seong-san tell you?

324
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,906
No, he never tells me anything.

325
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,408
-Anyway, Mom--
-Don't say anything more.

326
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,868
It's already been decided.

327
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,788
Can't I even say anything?

328
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:45,997
What does Seong-san say?

329
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:50,251
I don't know. He must be upset.
He hasn't called in days.

330
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:58,051
That's why management is hard.

331
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:59,844
It's only getting harder.

332
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,389
-Gosh.
-You have no idea.

333
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:09,062
By the way, when does
our fall recruitment process start?

334
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,481
You came to the head office
to talk about that?

335
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,817
It starts next month.

336
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,194
It should have begun earlier,

337
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,113
but it got delayed
due to some adjustments.

338
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,031
Why do you ask?

339
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,659
Just because.

340
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,329
Didn't you say your daughter
got into Hyogyeong?

341
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,123
She did.

342
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,417
Anyway, I can't give you
any more information.

343
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:34,295
I might not look it,
but I'm a man of integrity.

344
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:38,591
Did I say anything? My gosh.

345
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,349
So-yeong, I'm here.

346
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,656
So you didn't get in.

347
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:05,994
My dad told you?

348
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,080
No. It's written all over your face.

349
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,083
Can't you try to comfort me?

350
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,716
Uncle.

351
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,927
I have a question.

352
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:25,346
What is it?

353
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,015
Do you ever regret it?

354
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,269
You left a job that everyone envies.

355
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:43,865
Do you know why I still wear the same
Crocs that I wore in the operating room?

356
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:51,456
It's to remind me of the moment
blood gushed over me.

357
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,168
In case I ever feel the urge to go back.

358
00:29:55,752 --> 00:30:00,423
I keep replaying
the worst moments in my head.

359
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:04,177
Then it becomes clear why I left there.

360
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:08,223
You keep staggering forward that way.

361
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:13,520
But you have to move forward on your own.

362
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,231
How?

363
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,236
A director named Ken Loach once said,

364
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:26,407
"Our lives depend on how well we fight."

365
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:31,329
Do you think I had any plans
when I quit the hospital?

366
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,206
No, none whatsoever.

367
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:37,585
I just spent time
wandering around aimlessly.

368
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,880
Then I thought about my patients.

369
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:45,552
The patients that I lost…
No. The people that I lost…

370
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:51,808
I suddenly became curious
about their stories.

371
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:55,144
So I'm going to make a documentary.

372
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,482
I want to find out what they were like

373
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,277
before they came to the hospital.

374
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,737
So?

375
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,783
Are you happy now?

376
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,955
Yes.

377
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,291
Fight well.

378
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,127
I'm off.

379
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:13,806
You're up.

380
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,660
Hey.

381
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,892
This is good.

382
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,107
Why isn't Chae-rok eating?

383
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,528
Would he even feel like eating?

384
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:58,119
Chae-rok, can you have a look
at something?

385
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:01,080
-What?
-Watch carefully.

386
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,256
What is that?

387
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:16,804
I tried to copy Bom and Sang-su.
Did I do it right?

388
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,639
It's harder than it looks.

389
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,725
But I'm sure you can do it easily.

390
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,852
Can you show me once?

391
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,855
Just go home
and practice your basic moves.

392
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:28,024
What is it called, anyway?
When will I learn--

393
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,067
Enough!

394
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,528
How can you be so dense?

395
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:35,531
Is that important?
I'm struggling with my jumps.

396
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,366
Why do you have to do this to me?

397
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,952
-Aren't you my manager?
-I…

398
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,830
You're supposed to help me,
not disturb me!

399
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,582
I…

400
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,211
Go home for today.

401
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,171
Come when I call you.

402
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,924
Chae-rok.

403
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:00,848
Mr. Sim.

404
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,769
Can we talk for a minute?

405
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,063
Sure.

406
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:21,244
If this is about Chae-rok, don't worry.

407
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,454
As you know, he quit
all his part-time jobs.

408
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:26,707
No. It's about you, not Chae-rok.

409
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,794
What? Me?

410
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,546
Yes.

411
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,341
You seem a little impatient.

412
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,596
Do you want to learn ballet quickly?

413
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,725
Do you want to be able to do
difficult moves easily like Chae-rok?

414
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,895
I'd love to,

415
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,189
but I'm struggling.

416
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:55,194
Do you want to learn ballet
half-heartedly?

417
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,531
Sorry?

418
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:01,576
In that case, why don't you find
another ballet class?

419
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:06,038
Why are you saying this, all of a sudden?

420
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,082
Like I said in the beginning,

421
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:11,002
this is just my private studio
used for practice.

422
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,255
But I still accepted you.

423
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:18,050
To be honest with you,
it was because of Chae-rok.

424
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:22,722
I wanted you to help him
get back on track.

425
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,975
Of course, it was partly
because of what you told me.

426
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:30,479
That you want to give it a shot
even if you lose to reality.

427
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:33,441
Your words touched me deeply.

428
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:37,028
But do you think…

429
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,740
the basic practice you're doing now

430
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,201
is meaningless?

431
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:48,873
That's not--

432
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:52,251
I started ballet at 7,
and I've been dancing for 30 years now.

433
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:56,255
It's not that I could perform
Swan Lake, Don Quixote,

434
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,674
and Le Corsaire overnight.

435
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,886
Without practicing

436
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:05,097
the basic moves every single day,
I wouldn't have been able to.

437
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:08,643
The very moves that you're practicing now.

438
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,103
Right.

439
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:16,234
So quit if you want to learn
ballet half-heartedly.

440
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,985
You're only wasting Chae-rok's time.

441
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:21,447
With the competition coming up,
he's on edge as it is.

442
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,867
I'm starting to regret my decision.

443
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:28,412
That's not what I…

444
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,919
Mr. Ki, I'm sorry.

445
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,214
I guess…

446
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,092
I made a mistake.

447
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,096
I'm really sorry.

448
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,284
At my age, I'm still so foolish.

449
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,829
What are you mumbling there?

450
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,248
Nothing.

451
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,959
As if.

452
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,546
Seong-san sits out here every time
something is bothering him, too.

453
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,965
I feel like a fool.

454
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,885
I got all impatient
when my body can't keep up.

455
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:28,723
And I got carried away
and caused others trouble.

456
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,142
It's always like that in the beginning.

457
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,518
Take your time.

458
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,687
You have all the time in the world.

459
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:47,658
I think I understand Mr. Sim.

460
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,120
It's not that I don't understand him.

461
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:54,623
It's just that without a solid base,
he'll eventually crumble.

462
00:38:56,751 --> 00:39:00,046
You remember
the Hanon piano exercises, right?

463
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,213
Of course.

464
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,050
I found them terribly boring.

465
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,218
They weren't as beautiful as sonatas.

466
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:08,471
All you do is hit the keys repeatedly.

467
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:13,768
So before every lesson,
I hid my Hanon book.

468
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,020
That's how much I hated it.

469
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,191
It wasn't until years later
that I realized

470
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,985
your fingers get tired easily

471
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:26,614
if they aren't equally strong
when you play a difficult piece.

472
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,033
I shouldn't have skipped
my Hanon exercises.

473
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:30,576
I just…

474
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,663
want Mr. Sim to learn the basics properly.

475
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,750
Just like Chae-rok did.

476
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:41,170
You're usually obnoxious,
but you do sound normal sometimes.

477
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:44,757
I'm not "normal."

478
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,467
I'm awesome.

479
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,144
SON

480
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:07,613
SON

481
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,750
FATHER

482
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:50,197
The person you have dialed is unavailable.
Please leave a message…

483
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,926
Go home for today.

484
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,429
Come when I call you.

485
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:59,975
What are you doing here?

486
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,647
Well…

487
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:07,566
Please come in.

488
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,194
Later.

489
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:33,551
That's not going to make you
turn three times instead of two.

490
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:35,970
Don't take it out on the locker.

491
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,555
I will turn three times, okay?

492
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:41,183
Fine, please do.

493
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:44,395
Do you have a lesson today?
Mr. Sim is sitting on the stairs.

494
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:45,437
What?

495
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,356
I told him to come in, but he refused.

496
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,858
I can't believe him.

497
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,743
Mr. Sim.

498
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,788
Chae-rok.

499
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,790
Why are you doing this?

500
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:08,919
You said I shouldn't come.

501
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,129
But you did.

502
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:13,507
Still, I didn't set foot in the studio,
I swear.

503
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,093
I was going to practice a little out here
and go home.

504
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:17,511
Why would you do that?

505
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,639
-What do you mean?
-Are you a dancer?

506
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,976
Who cares if you take a few days off?

507
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,186
You're different from me.

508
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,398
-Why can't you just have a little fun--
-Chae-rok.

509
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,069
I'm not doing this
just to have a little fun.

510
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:40,075
I'd never be able to enter
a competition like you.

511
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:43,454
I'd never even dare to imagine it.

512
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:47,750
But I don't want to dance half-heartedly.

513
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:50,919
I'm not doing this as a hobby.

514
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,923
I have my own goals.

515
00:43:56,634 --> 00:44:00,262
I apologize for pestering you.
I was feeling impatient.

516
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:02,556
But listen.

517
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:07,019
You can scold me all you want
if I can't do my moves right.

518
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:12,399
But don't underestimate
how I feel about ballet.

519
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,530
I'm sorry if I've been a nuisance.

520
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:21,617
I'll go home now.

521
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,168
Look at you.

522
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:37,383
Practicing for the competition doesn't
give you the right to behave this way.

523
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:41,387
So you can't dance well.
But don't take it out on others.

524
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,890
You and Mr. Sim
might be in different situations,

525
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:49,019
but can you say that how he feels
about ballet is any different from you?

526
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,481
Can you be sure ballet means
more to you than to him?

527
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,902
Go and apologize.

528
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:26,140
SIM DEOK-CHUL
CHOI HAE-NAM

529
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,562
I'll have to call you back…

530
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:36,108
What?

531
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:46,285
-Here you go, Grandpa.
-Why didn't you let me buy it? Thanks.

532
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:50,497
I might be unemployed,
but I can afford this much.

533
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,374
I appreciate it.

534
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:58,380
It's sweet and tasty.

535
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:05,304
I wanted some fresh air,
so I was taking a drive,

536
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:07,264
and I ran into my grandpa.

537
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:11,101
It's not the weekend,
so he should be at the ballet studio.

538
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,519
I thought it was strange.

539
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,356
How is your ballet lesson going?

540
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:18,901
Well…

541
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,153
it's very fun.

542
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:24,531
Show me sometime.

543
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:26,074
Sure.

544
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:29,286
Since you brought it up,
how about I show you now?

545
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,163
What?

546
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,465
This is a preparatory position.

547
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,566
Don't tell anyone I'm your teacher.

548
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,527
Chae-rok.

549
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,487
Keep your shoulders down, remember?

550
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:08,158
Fine, I nagged you a little.
How could you run to her and tell on me?

551
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:10,994
No, I just ran into her.

552
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:13,038
How did you know I was here?

553
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,374
I called him.

554
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:16,875
You did?

555
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,879
Since when did you get so close?

556
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,799
Didn't you say we should get along?

557
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:25,592
I did, but…

558
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:29,555
Eun-ho, making friends is fine,
but be careful with guys.

559
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:30,973
It's not like that.

560
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:33,684
I know that, Grandpa.

561
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,936
Anyway, let's go back.

562
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,856
You've done your preparatory position,
so let's move on.

563
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:47,322
Gosh. I'm sorry, Mr. Sim.

564
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,116
So come with me.

565
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,534
Chae-rok.

566
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:54,079
Eun-ho, we're off.

567
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:56,039
-Take care.
-Bye.

568
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,334
Let's go.

569
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:02,045
-Chae-rok.
-What?

570
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,672
Is your practice going well?

571
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:08,135
I'm not sure.

572
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,351
Damn it.

573
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,944
-I'll get going.
-See you.

574
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,159
You work so hard.

575
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:01,081
You'll make it.

576
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:02,392
Just trust yourself
and keep going, Chae-rok.

577
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,676
Do I really have to go in?

578
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:20,679
Once the qualifiers are announced today,
you'll be leaving.

579
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:22,389
Replenish your energy before that.

580
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:26,643
Your body aches because you eat
hamburgers and such all the time.

581
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:29,729
I'd rather be alone today.

582
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:36,570
-Oh, hello. I'm…
-Hello, Mr. Lee.

583
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,197
You can call me Chae-rok.

584
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:41,575
My, aren't you a sweetie?

585
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:44,160
-Are you sure?
-Of course.

586
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:47,789
-Let's go in.
-Okay.

587
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:49,541
Do you want a drumstick?

588
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:51,960
No. I can do it.

589
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,795
-Okay.
-Thank you.

590
00:52:58,216 --> 00:52:59,259
How does it taste?

591
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:01,511
Good.

592
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:08,018
That's enough.

593
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:18,403
You'll be shocked
when you see Chae-rok dance.

594
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:19,821
He's incredible.

595
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,240
Is he that good?

596
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:25,952
Well…

597
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:34,419
Something like that?

598
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:37,255
See?

599
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,759
What about my husband? Is he any good?

600
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:42,427
I hope he's not a nuisance.

601
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,679
He's doing better than I expected.

602
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:47,223
Thanks, Chae-rok.

603
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:51,686
All he talks about these days
is you and ballet.

604
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:56,107
I've never seen him so excited in my life.

605
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:59,069
I don't even have to wake him up
in the morning.

606
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:01,363
Come over whenever you crave
home-cooked food.

607
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:04,115
There isn't much I can do,
but I can at least cook for you.

608
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:06,618
Okay. Thank you.

609
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:11,581
Get some shut-eye.

610
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:13,333
Sorry?

611
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,461
It's in the middle of the day.

612
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,923
This used to be our youngest's room.

613
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:22,425
I made a bed just in case.

614
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,095
I see.

615
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:27,555
I don't think I can sleep.

616
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:30,225
Don't worry about the competition
and sleep.

617
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:32,102
I'm not worrying.

618
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:11,891
Did I fail?

619
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:27,490
MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN TRY BALLET

620
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:29,242
40-YEAR-OLD BALLERINA
STILL GOING STRONG

621
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:31,745
20TH CENTURY'S GREATEST BALLERINA
MAYA PLISETSKAYA DIES AT 89

622
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,702
Dinner's ready, Chae-rok.

623
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:16,081
What? Are we eating again?

624
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:17,791
I made bulgogi.

625
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:27,425
Try some with lettuce.

626
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,135
Let's eat.

627
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:34,307
Thank you.

628
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,656
What a jerk.

629
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,951
I have a feeling he'll die today.

630
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:55,161
No way. He's not dying yet.

631
00:56:58,123 --> 00:56:59,249
He really died.

632
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:05,505
It's late. Do you want to sleep over?

633
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:10,093
No. I'll get going now.

634
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:22,188
-Goodbye.
-See you.

635
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,149
You're his manager. See him out.

636
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,608
No, it's fine.

637
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:42,250
Thank you for today, Mr. Sim.

638
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,377
Not at all.

639
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:50,675
It reminded me
of when I lived with my parents.

640
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:54,929
Then call your father.

641
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:00,852
Call him when you think of him.
Run to him when you miss him.

642
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:05,607
He's your father. You're his son.

643
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:11,905
He must have been over the moon
when you were born.

644
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:15,241
He must have smiled bigger than anyone.

645
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,621
I don't know
why you don't live with your father

646
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:22,999
or what you two have been through,
but whatever happened,

647
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:27,170
just call him, Chae-rok.

648
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:37,138
It's cold. You should go back in.

649
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:39,682
-All right. Get home safely.
-Okay.

650
00:58:58,826 --> 00:58:59,661
Mr. Sim.

651
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:04,499
-I passed.
-What?

652
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:06,459
I'm moving on to the next round!

653
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:07,585
Really?

654
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,755
I knew you'd make it.

655
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:12,131
Congratulations, Chae-rok!

656
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:15,385
-Go in.
-Okay.

657
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:36,072
Then call your father.

658
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:40,535
Call him when you think of him.
Run to him when you miss him.

659
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:45,290
He's your father. You're his son.

660
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:55,174
Have you watched Son Heung-min's games?
He's incredible.

661
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,467
I…

662
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:00,972
SON

663
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:06,227
Yes?

664
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:08,021
It's me.

665
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:12,567
I'm entering a competition.

666
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:17,530
It was announced today
that I passed the first round.

667
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:25,204
I thought I should tell you.

668
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:28,958
Bye.

669
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:30,835
Can I…

670
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:33,713
watch it on TV?

671
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:38,718
No. But you can watch it online.

672
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:42,013
Okay. I see.

673
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:47,018
Who was that? Chae-rok?

674
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:48,770
Yes.

675
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:51,356
He's entering a competition.

676
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:54,317
Gosh, you should be proud of him.

677
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,903
He's doing so well on his own.

678
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:01,824
Yes. I'm proud of him.

679
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,023
Goodness.

680
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:36,526
Chae-rok forgot his jacket.

681
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:45,261
Who the hell hurt your leg like this?

682
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:47,597
I really wanted to do well
this time around.

683
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:49,682
I guess he won't soar after all.

684
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:52,643
-You didn't need to…
-Ta-da.

685
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:55,104
It's pretty.

686
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:58,191
It's the prettiest
when the sunlight is shining through.

687
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:00,318
Don't you know what day it is?

688
01:03:00,401 --> 01:03:02,570
I've always remembered it.

689
01:03:02,653 --> 01:03:04,530
Are you going to end it
after one competition?

690
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,033
This could be the end of your career.

691
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:11,037
I'm going to win the competition.

692
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:16,042
