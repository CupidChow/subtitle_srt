00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:53,303
EPISODE 9

2
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:56,848
What was that earlier?

3
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,310
Do you remember what happened?

4
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:03,438
Of course, I do.

5
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,233
You acted like you didn't recognize me.

6
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,737
Why would I not recognize you?

7
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,281
That makes no sense.

8
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:16,785
I just had something on my mind.

9
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,830
I mean, I…

10
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,833
Yes, I zoned out for a moment. That's all.

11
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,758
Never zone out during practice.

12
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:32,801
You'll hurt yourself.

13
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:38,348
-Let's go home now.
-Okay.

14
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,101
See you, then.

15
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,232
I want to come over for dinner.

16
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,067
What?

17
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:53,154
Then we should ask Hae-nam
to make something good.

18
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,740
Hello, Ms. Choi. It's Chae-rok.

19
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,867
I'm craving spicy stir-fried pork.

20
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,390
Hey, Seong-gwan.

21
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,726
-Hello.
-Hi.

22
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,147
-What brings you here?
-I came to get some stuff.

23
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,357
-Are you going somewhere?
-Yes.

24
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,901
All right. Let's go in.

25
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,238
-Come on in.
-Okay.

26
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,744
Honey, is that you?

27
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,830
Seong-gwan, what brings you here?

28
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,290
I had to get some stuff.

29
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,168
That's good. Have dinner with us.

30
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:49,627
Sit.

31
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,597
Why are Seong-gwan and Chae-rok outside?

32
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,181
They have something to discuss.

33
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,226
Can't they talk inside?

34
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,543
Are you going somewhere?

35
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,836
Yes.

36
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,547
To shoot a documentary.

37
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,678
Will it take long?

38
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:42,722
Yes.

39
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,266
I'm going pretty far away.

40
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:46,976
Why?

41
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,651
What's the matter?

42
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,490
There's a problem

43
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,327
with Mr. Sim.

44
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,540
A problem?

45
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,048
He's unwell.

46
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,968
Did he hurt himself while doing ballet?

47
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,095
That's not it.

48
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,348
What is it, then?

49
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,184
Spit it out.

50
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,563
He has…

51
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,568
Alzheimer's.

52
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,031
What?

53
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,370
He has Alzheimer's.

54
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,179
"Alzheimer's"?

55
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,017
My father?

56
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,524
He stood out on the street
for more than 30 minutes today.

57
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:21,279
When I got there, he didn't recognize me.

58
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,906
I'm sure you're mistaken.

59
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,076
This is already the second time.

60
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,788
That I know of.

61
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,374
How did you find out?

62
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,461
I read his notebook.

63
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,217
I couldn't decide

64
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,553
whether I should tell his family.

65
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,724
Also, Mr. Sim doesn't know that I know.

66
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,310
I'll keep pretending I don't know.

67
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,646
I'll wait until he tells me.

68
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,695
He wants to continue with ballet.

69
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,450
And I want to make sure he can.

70
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,257
Hey, Ho-beom. Quick!

71
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:27,261
No. Give it back.

72
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,305
-Give that back.
-Does it work?

73
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:30,890
Give it back.

74
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,060
Damn it. We screwed up.

75
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,103
Why aren't you playing?

76
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,438
Let's start a new room.

77
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,583
Hey, you never call me.

78
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,670
Where are you?

79
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,422
What is it, all of a sudden?

80
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,341
What? Did something happen?

81
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,009
Nothing happened.

82
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,721
Just tell me. What is it?

83
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,391
Seong-san.

84
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,562
Later,

85
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,815
who will regret more,

86
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,025
you or me?

87
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,864
No. You've always been there,
so I'll probably regret it more.

88
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,492
What the hell are you talking about?
Explain so I can understand.

89
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,828
If…

90
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,497
by any chance,

91
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:41,961
you get sick
or something bad happens to you,

92
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,965
would you tell Eun-ho?

93
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,509
Never.

94
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,719
Why not?

95
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:54,390
No parents want their children
to think they're weak or struggling.

96
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,102
Talk to you later, Seong-san.

97
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,689
Hey, Seong-gwan.

98
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,943
What is with this brat?

99
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:34,472
What's wrong, Seong-gwan?
Why are you staring at me?

100
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:40,770
It'd better not be another stupid idea.

101
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,188
Father.

102
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,775
You passed.

103
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,945
What? What did I pass?

104
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,615
You're the main character
of my documentary starting today.

105
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,659
I bet you're pretty photogenic.

106
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,410
What is this all about?

107
00:08:56,494 --> 00:09:00,581
"The story of a man named Sim Deok-chul
who took up ballet at 70."

108
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:01,582
Isn't that cool?

109
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,585
All you have to do
is casually talk about yourself.

110
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,712
From why you love ballet

111
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,465
to what it is like to learn ballet.

112
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,676
You want me to talk about myself?

113
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,803
Are you sure you're not going back
to the hospital?

114
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,138
What do you think, Father?

115
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,267
Seong-gwan. It does sound exciting, but…

116
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,394
Chae-rok approved the idea, too.

117
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,437
He did?

118
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:30,695
I don't really care about you
talking about yourself or whatever.

119
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:35,283
But I thought it might help you
learn ballet. That's why.

120
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,952
You've been zoning out a lot lately.

121
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,413
Are you already going through a slump?

122
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,207
Use this opportunity to motivate yourself.

123
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,127
You really think
it's going to help me learn?

124
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:47,753
Yes.

125
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,423
Then I say yes.

126
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,759
How much are you going to pay him,
by the way?

127
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,971
Am I getting paid?

128
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,436
Why does he eat here all the time, again?

129
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,146
Why do you?

130
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,441
You never listen to me.

131
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,735
How can you still eat my food?

132
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,863
I'll do the dishes today, Hae-nam.

133
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,406
Who else?

134
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:29,837
Seong-gwan.

135
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,806
You're not taking the bus?

136
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,830
I'm done with the dishes.

137
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,291
Come here, Deok-chul.

138
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,547
Why do I have to do this, all of a sudden?

139
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,050
Aren't you the main character?

140
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,677
You'll be in a documentary.

141
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,971
Does that mean you're okay with it?

142
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,516
Don't be ridiculous.

143
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,770
Goodness. Like father, like son, really.

144
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,564
And now Chae-rok, that brat, too.

145
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,943
What could I do against the three of you?

146
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,236
I don't know anymore.

147
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,280
Do whatever you want, all of you.

148
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,616
-Hae-nam.
-Don't talk.

149
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,660
It's getting all crumpled.

150
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:54,588
INTERNET CAFE

151
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,518
Ho-beom.

152
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,482
What is it?

153
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,280
Sorry about earlier.

154
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,574
I got the wrong idea.

155
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:22,908
So?

156
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,750
Mr. Sim is a little unwell.

157
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,212
If you happen to see him like that again,

158
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,381
please do call me.

159
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,218
I beg you, Ho-beom.

160
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,367
Goodness. You startled me.

161
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,079
Why are you here so early?

162
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,540
I'm here to see my main character,
Mr. Sim Deok-chul.

163
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,503
For the time being,
I'll stay next to him around the clock.

164
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,005
Do you mean
you'll be eating and sleeping here?

165
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,679
My, you're pretty flexible, Father.

166
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,224
Hey, Seong-gwan.

167
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,433
What are you doing here?

168
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,602
This must be going to be his masterpiece.

169
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,729
He's going to be leeching off us.

170
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,482
-Really?
-I'll do my best, Father.

171
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,483
Me, too.

172
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,486
Go wash up. Breakfast is ready soon.

173
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,695
Okay.

174
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,297
"Alzheimer's"?

175
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,217
How did you find out?

176
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,303
I read his notebook.

177
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:12,893
NAME: SIM DEOK-CHUL
ADDRESS: 11, SILLIM-RO 3GA-GIL, GWANAK-GU

178
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,108
MY NAME IS SIM DEOK-CHUL.
I HAVE ALZHEIMER'S.

179
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:32,538
TODAY, I GOT LOST FOR THE FIRST TIME.
THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.

180
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:35,791
BALLET IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE FUN

181
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,006
IS THIS MY LIMIT? NO!
I WILL TRY UNTIL I CAN.

182
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,524
Does…

183
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,903
he really have Alzheimer's?

184
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,530
Yes.

185
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,834
Exactly how bad is his condition
right now?

186
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,799
At this stage, the progress is slow.

187
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:29,094
But you said he zoned out on the street.

188
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,763
The problem is,

189
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,183
his symptoms may not develop gradually.

190
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,561
They may step up several notches
all of a sudden.

191
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,105
Or even a dozen notches at once.

192
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,900
That's why I advised him
to tell his family.

193
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,819
My father…

194
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,198
is learning ballet.

195
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,200
Yes, I heard that.

196
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,663
Is it okay for him to continue?

197
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,460
Did you say you're a doctor?

198
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,254
I'm sure you know the answer.

199
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,525
What are you doing?

200
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,236
Get some shut-eye.

201
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,446
You came home after midnight.

202
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,617
Working at the same company as you
might not be all bad, after all.

203
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,453
Is it so hard to say thank you?

204
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,153
Hi, Mom.

205
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,448
Do you know if everything's okay
with Seong-gwan?

206
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,575
Why do you ask?

207
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:18,912
Yesterday, he called me out of the blue
and talked nonsense.

208
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,540
He's going to shoot a documentary
about your father.

209
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,209
-What?
-That's what's going on.

210
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,711
Talk to you later.

211
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,548
What's wrong? What happened?

212
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,259
Seong-gwan, that little brat…

213
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,055
Forget it.
What's the point of telling you?

214
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:41,310
Tell me so I know
whether I should be worried or not.

215
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,312
My goodness.

216
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,359
By the way, is everything okay at work?

217
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,362
You're coming home later and later.

218
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,491
Everything's fine.

219
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,243
Everything's perfectly normal.

220
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,918
Welcome to Hello, Nine O'clock Part Two.

221
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,337
Here's a message that just arrived.

222
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,255
"Hello, sir.

223
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,883
I listen to your show every day.

224
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,802
I'm a fan living in Gwanak-gu.

225
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,304
And I have a granddaughter.

226
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:21,934
She just finished college
and is working hard to get ahead in life.

227
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:25,771
I feel so sorry watching her struggle.

228
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,316
The world is not easy
for young people these days.

229
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:33,320
I'm sending this message to cheer her up.

230
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:39,118
Eun-ho, did you know that
I had your conception dream?

231
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,830
The brightest star
in the pitch-black night sky

232
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,207
fell into our yard in my dream,

233
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,084
and you were born.

234
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:51,004
Eun-ho, you're my star.
The brightest star.

235
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,091
Eun-ho, you can do this."

236
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:58,846
That was a message from Mr. Sim Deok-chul.

237
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:02,307
Our newest writer's name
also happens to be Sim Eun-ho.

238
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,601
What a coincidence.
Anyway, thank you so much.

239
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:08,438
Here's a song
for Mr. Sim and his granddaughter.

240
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:12,568
-Standby.
-"Two Hands to You" by Sweden Laundry.

241
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:22,536
Will I be able to forget

242
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:27,916
About the future I dreamed

243
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,334
Eun-ho.

244
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:34,423
of everyday long ago…

245
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,550
It's not your fault.

246
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,512
I'm glad that you hung in there,
and I'm glad that you yelled at her.

247
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,222
You made me proud yesterday.

248
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:47,561
Will it be forgotten like the promise

249
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:54,484
We made to each other locking our fingers?

250
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:01,992
I keep losing

251
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,578
The things I loved…

252
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,663
I can't decide if I should tell Eun-ho.

253
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:11,501
I wonder if I could ever get used to it…

254
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:16,173
SEONG-GWAN: CHAE-ROK, I'LL START
SHOOTING TODAY. SEE YOU AT THE STUDIO.

255
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:21,511
I am still who I used to be

256
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:27,851
But the way others see me has changed…

257
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,311
Father, should we get going?

258
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,315
Why are you smiling?

259
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,568
What? It's nothing.

260
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:38,987
Let's go.

261
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,792
I love going to the studio with you.

262
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,253
-Me, too. Let's go.
-Okay.

263
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,602
I'll shine like a star someday, right?

264
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,229
Thank you, Grandpa.

265
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,447
My goodness.

266
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,366
I forgot my dance belt.

267
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,742
You forgot it?

268
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,578
Use mine.

269
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,414
I have an extra one.

270
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,798
What's with the fingers?

271
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,760
What are you doing?

272
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:46,596
What's this smell?

273
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,765
It's been washed.

274
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,311
Thanks.

275
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,863
Shoulders down. Elbows up.

276
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,115
Devant.

277
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,617
Slowly brush your foot.

278
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,371
Raise your leg. Relevé lent.

279
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,373
Point your toes.

280
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,835
Passé and keep your knee up.

281
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,795
Arabesque.

282
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,505
Keep your knee up.

283
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,382
Slowly into fifth.

284
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,221
Turn your head.

285
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,183
Look far away.

286
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,021
Now, try it without the bar.

287
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:45,906
Get started.

288
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,202
Shoulders down. Elbows up.

289
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,204
Keep your shoulders down.

290
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,955
Tighten your abs.

291
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,750
Slowly. Devant.

292
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:57,959
Brush your foot.

293
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,961
Relevé lent.

294
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,630
Slowly. Point your toes.

295
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:06,343
Passé. Keep your knee up.

296
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:10,138
Ballet is becoming more and more fun.

297
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,308
Sorry. Let me try again.

298
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:15,435
Do it slowly.

299
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,980
Every new move that I accomplish

300
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,982
gives me a sense of achievement.

301
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:25,946
I'll work hard
so that I can accomplish more moves.

302
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,894
Welcome. What are you looking for today?

303
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,771
I need to get some fish.

304
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:03,316
-Is the mackerel fresh today?
-It sure is.

305
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,527
-How much do you need?
-All of this.

306
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,821
It's more than ten of them.

307
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,156
I know.

308
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,408
-You don't have to cut them.
-Okay.

309
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:14,703
What do you need so much mackerel for?

310
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:19,708
Then again, mackerel
is good for the elderly, right?

311
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,668
You sure know your fish.

312
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,421
Okay.

313
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:25,672
Delivery.

314
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,216
-Thank you.
-Who…

315
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,469
Wait, it's from Mother.

316
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:33,722
What is it?

317
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,807
It's pomegranates.

318
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:42,022
-Wow.
-My goodness. She didn't have to.

319
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,738
-Mom?
-Did you get it?

320
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,531
We don't need these.

321
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,700
Honey, be nice.

322
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:56,620
They're good for women.
Have them every day.

323
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,538
Fine, I will.

324
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,498
But don't send anything again.

325
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:06,087
Honey, pomegranates are supposed to be
very good for the skin.

326
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:07,964
Can I have some?

327
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,342
Gosh, I can't believe you.

328
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,428
Put them away.

329
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:14,596
They look so tasty.

330
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,147
Where's Seong-gwan?

331
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,608
He has somewhere to be.

332
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:31,112
Oh, I'll wash the dance belt
and return it to you.

333
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:35,492
Of course. Wash it thoroughly.

334
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,202
Okay.

335
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,915
Did you call your father?

336
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,501
No.

337
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:46,544
Why don't you go visit him once?

338
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,214
Don't tell me what to do.

339
00:25:56,888 --> 00:26:00,100
Starting today, you'll practice
in the afternoon, too.

340
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,686
What? In the afternoon, too?

341
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,939
I don't think it's enough
to extend our lessons by 30 minutes.

342
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:09,025
I've been going easy on you
because you don't have much stamina,

343
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,361
but it's time to up your game.

344
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:14,698
Practice until you can dance instinctively
as soon as the music plays.

345
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,783
Muscles never forget.

346
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:18,994
Okay.

347
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,413
But can we start tomorrow instead?

348
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,914
Why not today?

349
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,708
I have something to do.

350
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,876
All right.

351
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:31,798
As an apology, I'll pay for the food.

352
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,820
LOCATION TRACKER

353
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,378
-If you're finished, let's go.
-Okay.

354
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:15,842
Mr. Sim.

355
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:17,844
-What?
-Your phone.

356
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:20,472
Oh, dear. My goodness.

357
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:21,431
Thanks.

358
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,069
See you tomorrow, Chae-rok.

359
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:54,422
We're supposed to start soon.
What if he doesn't show up?

360
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,424
He will.

361
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,760
Seung-joo never shows up
even one minute early.

362
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:03,098
The dancers are so excited.
I really hope he shows up.

363
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,432
Here he comes.

364
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,939
You all saw him the other day, right?

365
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,899
Starting today, he'll be your coach--

366
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,609
Hey, I'm sure everyone knows who I am.

367
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,446
We've got just a month
and a half to practice,

368
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:22,700
and we don't have enough dancers
to perform the entire program.

369
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,411
I suggest we do a gala like last year.

370
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,913
First, I need to find out your levels,

371
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,623
so let's do a basic class today.

372
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:29,958
Let's get started.

373
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,584
-Yes.
-Yes.

374
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,796
Two piano keys to you.

375
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:40,802
DIAGNOSIS
SIM DEOK-CHUL

376
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,930
THE PATIENT HAS ALZHEIMER'S.
REQUIRES CONTINUOUS TREATMENT.

377
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:50,145
I asked my sister
to pay extra attention to him.

378
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,438
Don't worry too much.

379
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:55,984
Thanks.

380
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,823
Like you said,

381
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:05,118
I got doused all the way to my underwear.

382
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,162
It really brought me to my senses.

383
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,699
-Good afternoon.
-Hello.

384
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,284
-How are you?
-Good, thanks.

385
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,665
Hey, Seong-gwan.

386
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:53,917
Father.

387
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,388
It's been bothering me.

388
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:11,684
You go around in sandals
even in the winter.

389
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:16,940
I figured there must be a reason.

390
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,274
But…

391
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,236
I still felt bad.

392
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,117
It was warm.

393
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,078
The blood.

394
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,380
His heart had stopped.

395
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,801
I had even declared him dead myself.

396
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,685
But his blood that dripped
onto my feet was still warm.

397
00:30:56,896 --> 00:31:00,775
It's not true, is it, Doctor?
Please tell me it's not.

398
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:04,153
It can't be. No, Doctor.

399
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:10,952
When I realized
there was nothing I could do,

400
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,413
I became disillusioned.

401
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:20,461
I was wearing these
in that very operating room.

402
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,755
I couldn't take them off.

403
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,091
I was afraid I'd want to go back there

404
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:27,260
if I took them off.

405
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:32,891
I was afraid that I'd wrongly believe
there's something I could do once again.

406
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,397
Father.

407
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:43,568
I'll wear these when I'm ready.

408
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,485
SIM DEOK-CHUL'S CURRENT LOCATION FOUND

409
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,201
I heard you're working hard on your rehab.

410
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,287
Are you warmed up?

411
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,414
Let's get started.

412
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:40,500
Okay.

413
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:44,879
Here's some mackerel. Here, too.

414
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,425
Mom. Is all of this…

415
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,177
It's all mackerel, Seong-gwan.

416
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,930
Let's not complain and enjoy our meal.

417
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:56,975
You hear that? Don't be picky
if you want to get married.

418
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,020
How does that make sense?

419
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,481
Stop nitpicking.

420
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:05,233
Listen, Seong-gwan.

421
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,902
Your mom is always right.

422
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,821
That's the only rule in this house.

423
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:11,656
Right, Hae-nam?

424
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:14,450
-Just eat your mackerel.
-Okay.

425
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:22,208
Dad is late again?

426
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:25,461
Isn't he the one who insisted
on having family dinner once a week?

427
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,964
He's busy these days.

428
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:31,718
I'm not sure if he even had dinner.

429
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:34,971
What about you?

430
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,681
How's work? Not too difficult?

431
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,725
Well…

432
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,186
It's kind of fun.

433
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:46,399
It's fun? What do you mean?

434
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:52,447
I hurry to the station,
go through the security gate

435
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,449
and up to the radio studio every morning.

436
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:57,910
Then I arrive
in a completely different world.

437
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:02,623
The studio is filled with people
I've never met before.

438
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,916
When our show airs,

439
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,878
we get messages from total strangers
telling us their stories.

440
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,797
They tell us who they are,

441
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:13,634
and some people send messages
to cheer others up.

442
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,929
And there's someone who roots for me.

443
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:22,393
Anyway, I find that pretty touching.
It's fun.

444
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,020
I want to do better.

445
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,941
I should stop making mistakes soon,
but that's not easy.

446
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,360
Then don't.

447
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,032
Mom.

448
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:39,619
Do you realize
you sound just like Dad sometimes?

449
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,503
Are you leaving?

450
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:49,545
Yes.

451
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,800
You've changed a little.

452
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:55,802
What do you mean?

453
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,847
You're practicing as usual
even after giving up on the competition.

454
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,016
I've always been like this.

455
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:04,977
No, you've changed.

456
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,231
Did something happen?

457
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,024
I'll be off.

458
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:20,493
Some kids grow from failure.
It makes them desperate.

459
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,081
Nonsense. You can only grow from success.

460
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:28,626
Failures don't make you grow.
They only make you small.

461
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,548
Could it be because of Mr. Sim?

462
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:34,924
Then that's great.

463
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,384
Isn't that what you wanted?

464
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,428
It is, but…

465
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,557
How was your first day as a coach?

466
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:46,185
You've never taught anyone
other than Chae-rok.

467
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:49,147
I called Heung-sik to ask
if you yelled and quit,

468
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:52,066
but he told me nothing like that happened.

469
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,904
All the dancers there have their stories,
so it wasn't boring.

470
00:35:58,698 --> 00:35:59,574
So you had fun.

471
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,492
Not really.

472
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:05,454
I know you did.

473
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,358
I forgot my dance belt.

474
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:35,693
You forgot it?

475
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:42,325
You do know it's too late for you
to become a dancer, right?

476
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:47,288
Did you mean it when you said
you wanted to be on stage?

477
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,498
Why?

478
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,084
I want to soar

479
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,546
at least once in my lifetime.

480
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:59,091
What really scares me is

481
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:04,013
that someday, I might not be able
to do what I want

482
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:08,726
or don't even remember
what I want to do anymore.

483
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,061
Mr. Sim. Are you okay?

484
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:15,816
That's why this moment is precious to me.

485
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,528
I'm not going to hesitate.

486
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,572
I'm going to give it my all.

487
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,595
Raise your arms higher.

488
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:57,400
Don't just imitate. Dance properly.

489
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,151
Try again.

490
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,577
Why are you looking at the camera?

491
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:12,331
-I just…
-Focus on your moves.

492
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:15,459
Pretend Seong-gwan isn't here
and there's no camera.

493
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,129
Pretend I'm not here
and you're just by yourself.

494
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,465
I even took all the jumps
out of the sequence.

495
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,134
Can't you do better than this?

496
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,722
I'm sorry. Let me try once again.

497
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,520
Arms up, remember?

498
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,533
Chae-rok.

499
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,247
I was just going to shoot
without saying anything,

500
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,083
but I'm afraid

501
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,045
you're pushing him too hard.

502
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,130
You see,

503
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:05,843
just because Mr. Sim is unwell
doesn't mean I'll go easy on him

504
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,889
or teach him half-heartedly.

505
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,267
Why doesn't he quit?

506
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,605
Why does he hide his condition
and continue with ballet?

507
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:21,067
If you think about it,
there's only one answer.

508
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,987
He wants to give it his all.

509
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,283
I'm going down first.

510
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,579
Chae-rok.

511
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,374
Let's go have lunch.

512
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:19,917
Seong-gwan, are you coming with us?

513
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,340
Sure.

514
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,968
Father, let's go.

515
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:31,345
I don't have much of an appetite.

516
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,556
You still need to eat.

517
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:37,059
I'll eat later. You two go ahead.

518
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:39,562
-Father.
-Then get some rest.

519
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:42,815
-I'll get you a lunchbox.
-That'd be great.

520
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,275
I want an eel lunchbox.

521
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,068
Hello.

522
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:03,210
-Hello.
-Mr. Sim. Did you have lunch?

523
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,754
Are you not feeling well?

524
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,257
After practicing all morning,

525
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,218
my knees are aching. It's quite painful.

526
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:15,389
-It's okay. Lie down slowly.
-Okay.

527
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,392
-Take off your shoes.
-Okay.

528
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:19,894
Oh, my.

529
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,520
Let me have a look.

530
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:26,942
My body can't keep up
after a certain point.

531
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,028
I'm worried

532
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,531
if I'm straining myself.

533
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,494
I feel bad since Chae-rok is working
so hard as my teacher.

534
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:40,080
I'm not sure if this is right anymore.

535
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,960
-Am I just being stubborn?
-Mr. Sim.

536
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,256
Then how about

537
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,927
you give up here?

538
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:54,845
What?

539
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:59,517
If you give up, you won't have to worry
about these things anymore.

540
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,271
Please wait here for a moment.

541
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,629
Gosh, the place looks super cool.

542
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:29,880
How have you been?

543
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,258
-Come on in.
-Thanks.

544
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,804
You renovated a church into a studio?

545
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,056
I didn't know that was even possible.

546
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:42,142
Gosh, I feel betrayed.

547
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,687
I didn't believe it
when you started teaching Chae-rok.

548
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,525
Especially after all my failed efforts
to convince you to teach me.

549
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:53,404
Come to think of it,
everything seems so easy for Chae-rok.

550
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:55,281
He has you as his teacher

551
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:57,199
and got into the School of Dance
in a year.

552
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,245
It wasn't easy.

553
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,582
-What?
-It wasn't easy for him.

554
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,626
Was it easy for you?

555
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:12,715
Come on. You're scaring me. We haven't
even seen each other in a while.

556
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:16,635
How's the preparation for the show going?

557
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,846
It's going pretty well.
I should do a good job.

558
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:22,182
How's Chae-rok, anyway?

559
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,309
He's doing well.

560
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:28,606
I was so sure
he'd easily get into the National Ballet.

561
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,067
How long are you going to have him
under your wing?

562
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:47,416
Hey, what are you two doing here?

563
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:49,835
-It's been a while, Mr. Sim.
-Yes.

564
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:52,171
Mr. Sim, haven't you heard?

565
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:53,380
What?

566
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,924
That's Hwang Hui from our school.

567
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,510
Hwang Hui?

568
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:01,055
Chae-rok, you know him well, don't you?

569
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,477
-Hello, Mr. Sim.
-Hello.

570
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:08,437
Goodness.

571
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,272
Hello, I'm a huge fan of yours.

572
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,608
Didn't you say you were my fan?

573
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:15,736
I'm a fan of all ballet dancers
in the world.

574
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:18,697
Thank you.

575
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,616
Who…

576
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,452
He's learning ballet from Chae-rok.

577
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:25,079
You're learning ballet?

578
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,206
I'm just a beginner.

579
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:28,749
I'm busy learning the basics.

580
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,752
It's not an easy hobby.

581
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:32,795
You're brave.

582
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,339
Chae-rok, I'm impressed.

583
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:39,927
I did hear that ballet is becoming popular
as a hobby throughout the country.

584
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:43,764
Just have fun.

585
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,641
What?

586
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:48,519
Of course.

587
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,981
Good luck with the competition.

588
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:54,483
Thanks.

589
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:56,902
-I'll get going.
-Okay.

590
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:59,488
-I'll call you.
-Bye.

591
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:02,366
Goodbye. I look forward to your show.

592
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:11,542
Wait.

593
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,754
What is it, Chae-rok?

594
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,008
It's not a hobby.

595
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:22,177
What?

596
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:24,179
He's not doing ballet as a hobby.

597
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:27,057
It's only been six months,

598
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,726
but he's working really hard.

599
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,688
He even attended a performance meeting.

600
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,776
I know it's not easy.

601
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,405
At his age, he certainly has his limits.

602
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:44,908
But you know,

603
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,579
from the moment
you first put on your ballet shoes,

604
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,831
ballet isn't easy for anyone.

605
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:55,085
It wasn't easy for you or me, either.

606
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:01,633
I know he won't get higher
than a certain level.

607
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:07,222
But he's putting

608
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:11,310
the rest of his life on the line.

609
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,902
I understand. I'll root for him.

610
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,257
Did he hurt your feelings?

611
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,719
What? No, not at all.

612
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:55,938
Just what is ballet to you?

613
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,496
It's not a hobby for you.

614
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,499
You're not doing it for fun.

615
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,295
Why didn't you say anything?

616
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,513
Because at least I know it's not true.

617
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,726
I don't care what others say.

618
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:38,814
And I won't give up.

619
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:44,903
I'm not such a weak person.

620
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:49,324
I really love ballet.

621
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,745
I want to do it really well.

622
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:07,301
What?

623
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,303
You want to put Mr. Sim on stage?

624
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,723
You're being ridiculous.

625
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,601
He can do it.

626
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:18,020
He did well at the performance meeting.

627
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:19,813
That's different.

628
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:22,065
Why are you so eager now?

629
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:26,320
Hey, Mr. Sim isn't good enough yet.

630
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,904
And there's no show for him.

631
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,866
-What about Kim Heung-sik Ballet Company?
-Hey.

632
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:33,368
They're doing a gala anyway.

633
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,579
Let Mr. Sim be a guest dancer.

634
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:38,290
It's not some school talent show.

635
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:39,875
They don't just put anyone up on stage!

636
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:42,794
-He'll audition.
-What are you talking about?

637
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:44,338
Didn't you see Hwang Hui?

638
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:47,799
You should try to catch up with him
instead of worrying about Mr. Sim.

639
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:49,885
-This is complete nonsense.
-Mr. Ki!

640
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:59,770
Please give Mr. Sim a chance.

641
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,149
I beg you.

642
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,452
Then he needs to pass the audition.

643
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:19,331
You know it's not easy.

644
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,125
Are you up for it?

645
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,211
Yes.

646
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:26,546
What?

647
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,215
An audition?

648
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,009
Me? Really?

649
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,052
Yes.

650
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,888
If you pass, you get to perform on stage.

651
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:37,474
Chae-rok, thank you.

652
00:49:38,975 --> 00:49:41,103
It's in a month. Let's plan a schedule…

653
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,772
No. Let's come up with a repertoire first.

654
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:44,898
Let's do Swan Lake.

655
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:47,776
-You want to play the prince?
-No, the swan.

656
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,153
Pick something you're good at,
not something you like.

657
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,406
Then I'll do it well.

658
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:59,204
Then let's decide this evening
after having a look at some options.

659
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:01,289
I'm still picking Swan Lake.

660
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,458
You're unbelievably stubborn.

661
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,419
Thank you so much, Chae-rok.

662
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:09,214
For me, it's Swan Lake, no matter what.

663
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,717
-Just go back to your practice.
-Okay.

664
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,802
Thanks, Chae-rok.

665
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:21,476
One bus ticket to Seoul, please.

666
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,937
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

667
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:44,833
What do you think?

668
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,753
Does anything stand out to you?

669
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,004
Yes.

670
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:50,130
Swan Lake.

671
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:51,298
Still?

672
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,260
Let's take a short break.

673
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:57,387
Do you want anything from the café?

674
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:59,097
A vanilla latte.

675
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:00,891
It's my treat today.

676
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:03,226
-Forget it.
-Father, I want an Americano.

677
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:06,646
An Americano for you, too, right?

678
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,868
Thanks, Chae-rok.

679
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:32,506
Why isn't this punk picking up?

680
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,688
Hello, Mr. Lee.

681
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:54,486
Hi, Se-jong.

682
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:55,946
It's been a while.

683
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,614
Are you here to see Chae-rok?

684
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:01,535
Yes. You, too?

685
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:02,911
Yes.

686
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,289
I wanted to have some pizza
with him or something.

687
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,291
But I'll come back later.

688
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:11,628
All right. See you again.

689
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,383
Mr. Lee.

690
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:20,470
Did you hear that Chae-rok got injured?

691
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,808
That's why I'm here.

692
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,309
Then do you also know…

693
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,564
that Ho-beom did it?

694
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:42,492
All right. Lattes for you two.

695
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:46,121
And an Americano for me.

696
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:59,050
Father.

697
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:00,927
Yes?

698
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:05,181
Pass the audition by all means.

699
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:07,642
Thanks.

700
00:53:16,192 --> 00:53:17,903
I could have practiced some more.

701
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:20,864
Take it easy.
The audition is just a month away.

702
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:23,158
You don't want to get injured or anything.

703
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:26,119
You saw me give up the competition
because of my injury.

704
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:27,787
Right. I understand.

705
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:31,374
See you, Seong-gwan.

706
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:34,502
Mr. Sim, don't practice at home.
Just rest up.

707
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,504
We have a performance meeting tomorrow.

708
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:38,757
Okay. Don't worry.

709
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,342
Thank you, Chae-rok.

710
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:42,802
See you.

711
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:08,495
Father.

712
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:15,043
Hey. You haven't changed the password.

713
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,422
It's hot. Here you go.

714
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:26,096
How's your injury?

715
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:30,517
I'm going through rehab.

716
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:35,939
I see.

717
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,576
Have we ever…

718
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:54,833
been to a bathhouse together?

719
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:56,376
A bathhouse?

720
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:02,173
-No?
-We have. When you were four.

721
00:55:03,299 --> 00:55:04,467
Just wanted to know.

722
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:09,222
Let's do it again sometime.

723
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,941
Sure. Let's do that.

724
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:44,799
AUDITION

725
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:57,562
It's bad luck to sigh, Seong-gwan.

726
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:00,899
Okay.

727
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,034
Father.

728
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:12,202
Yes?

729
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,038
You know,

730
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:20,168
I thought you were someone
who always loses.

731
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:22,962
You always lose to Mom,

732
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:25,715
and you always lost at work, too.

733
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,302
I thought that was why

734
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:33,014
our family struggled.

735
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,435
But these days,

736
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:40,939
you're like a different person.

737
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:44,859
You've become a person
who is determined to win.

738
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:49,239
You won't back off an inch
until you succeed.

739
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:53,034
Like someone who won't give up to the end.

740
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:59,290
That's at least what you look like
through my camera lens.

741
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,127
How should I put it…

742
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:04,212
It was…

743
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:07,882
very touching, Father.

744
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:10,927
Is that right?

745
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,179
Yes.

746
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:19,060
Make sure you win. Okay, Father?

747
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:21,688
Okay. I promise.

748
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:32,991
Are you leaving?

749
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:36,828
Yes.

750
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:40,498
It's late.

751
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:42,667
Please, spend the night.

752
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:31,174
My bus is here.

753
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,969
Okay. Go ahead.

754
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,347
Thanks for dinner last night.

755
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:40,308
Get home safely.

756
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:43,895
Okay. Thanks. Take care.

757
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:10,046
DACHEONG BILLIARDS CLUB

758
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:34,195
I told him about the performance meeting.

759
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:39,158
Let's go.

760
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:41,703
Mr. Sim isn't here yet.

761
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:43,496
He's already here.

762
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,456
I think he went to the bathroom.

763
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,417
Go get him. Meet me downstairs.

764
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:05,310
I have to remember it.

765
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:07,437
Pull yourself together, Deok-chul.

766
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,315
Mr. Sim, are you in there?

767
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:12,775
It's Chae-rok. Open the door!

768
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,485
Mr. Sim!

769
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:18,406
You have to remember it.
Pull yourself together, Deok-chul.

770
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:34,464
Mr. Sim. Are you okay?

771
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:24,889
You should quit ballet.

772
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:27,809
-I can do it.
-No, you can't!

773
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:28,976
It's for his own good.

774
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,061
Where is Mr. Sim?

775
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:32,188
He's going to rest for the time being.

776
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:34,774
They've sent you an official invitation.

777
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:37,652
Can I be admitted at any time?

778
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:40,071
He hasn't been going to class lately.

779
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:41,739
What the hell are you talking about?

780
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:43,324
He's a bit sick.

781
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:44,617
What if something happens to you?

782
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,327
I was really terrified.

783
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:47,578
Chae-rok.

784
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:50,123
I'm terrified as well.

785
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:56,587
