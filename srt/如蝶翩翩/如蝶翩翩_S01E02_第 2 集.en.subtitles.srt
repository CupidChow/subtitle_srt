1
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,510
What am I doing?

2
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:56,181
Say hi. He'll be teaching you ballet
starting today.

3
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,099
He's Lee Chae-rok, a ballet dancer.

4
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,726
Despite his looks,

5
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,687
he got into the School of Dance
a year after starting ballet.

6
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,397
Hey, say hello.

7
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:08,276
This is Mr. Sim Deok-chul,
and he'll learn ballet from you.

8
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,653
No. Why would I do that?
Have you gone insane?

9
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,323
I'm in your hands, Mr. Lee.

10
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,201
-You won't learn anything from me!
-And one more thing.

11
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,871
He'll be your manager starting today.

12
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,665
-Check how much he's practiced,
-Yes, sir.

13
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,335
what he eats before the audition,
if he's injured,

14
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,921
-and his condition.
-Yes, sir.

15
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,506
But most of all,

16
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,883
make sure he doesn't do anything foolish.

17
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,135
-Yes, sir.
-And call me if he does.

18
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,638
-Yes, sir.
-Mr. Ki!

19
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,890
I'll do my best. Thank you, sir.

20
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,893
I'll do my best.

21
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,398
EPISODE 2

22
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,444
I don't want to.

23
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,447
Why would I teach that old man?
Are you seriously crazy?

24
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,534
-You don't want to?
-Isn't it obvious?

25
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:01,162
-Then go back to the School of Dance.
-What?

26
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:05,250
What? This is my private studio,

27
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:08,378
and I've been teaching you for free
for the past four years.

28
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,839
But I can't do that anymore.

29
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,134
You're the one who refused to get paid.

30
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:17,804
I was willing to pay, but you said
it wasn't right to make your pupil pay.

31
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:21,933
And what? You want me to go back
to school just because of that old man?

32
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:25,728
Does that make sense?
You know why I took a break from school.

33
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,522
Then you can leave.

34
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:28,565
Mr. Ki…

35
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,734
I have so much work to do.
This is a waste of time.

36
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,111
I can take care of myself.

37
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,823
Exactly how?

38
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,326
Don't fool yourself.

39
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,787
You're no big shot.

40
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,082
Are you serious about this?

41
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,210
Fine, I'll do it.

42
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,880
But I have one condition.

43
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:59,220
Balancing on a sus-sous.

44
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,932
Okay?

45
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,644
If you manage to master this in a week,

46
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,688
I'll teach you ballet.

47
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,189
You need to do it for a minute.

48
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,400
Hey, that's too difficult.

49
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,152
He's pretty old.

50
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,779
I'll only be motivated to teach him
once I see potential.

51
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:18,573
Don't you think so?

52
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,076
Yes. I'll give it a try.

53
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,245
That's absurd, sir.

54
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,165
It isn't as easy as it seems.

55
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,375
Come up with something reasonable.

56
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,586
He said he'll do it.

57
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,845
Don't worry. I can do it.

58
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,223
Are you sure?

59
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,809
Why can't I do it?

60
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,478
Is it too slippery?

61
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,359
Goodness.

62
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,213
Goodness.

63
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:05,388
Why am I already out of breath?
I'm in trouble.

64
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:10,852
I thought we were friends, so why am I
always the one calling to meet up?

65
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,528
How are you even doing these days?

66
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,488
I'd like to ask you the same question.

67
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,908
I've been doing well. I've been great.

68
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,036
I even slept for two hours last night.

69
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:32,081
I'm even having a tasty sandwich
for a late lunch.

70
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,042
Gosh, I'm really happy these days.

71
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,756
Fine, you do that.
Be as happy as you want.

72
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:44,677
By the way, didn't you say
you were filming something?

73
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,221
A documentary.

74
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,558
It's looking good.

75
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,034
Is he sleeping?

76
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:16,167
Right, a documentary. What's it about?

77
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,545
You wouldn't get it.

78
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,006
MOM

79
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,389
Why isn't he picking up
when he has nothing better to do?

80
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:38,523
Thank you so much. We will continue
to be with you through thick and thin.

81
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,442
I am the wife of Byun Yeong-il,
Candidate Number Seven.

82
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,277
Hold on.

83
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,612
7, UNAFFILIATED, BYUN YEONG-IL

84
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:47,198
MOM

85
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,785
Mom, what is it? Is it urgent?

86
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,745
Take some seaweed soup.

87
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,706
Okay. I'll call you back later.

88
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,377
Goodness.

89
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,380
I forgot to tell her
that I wired the money.

90
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:08,219
I SENT THE MONEY
GOOD LUCK

91
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:11,389
Okay. There we go.

92
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,725
Seong-san.

93
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,060
SEONG-SAN

94
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:27,196
What's the point of having three kids
when none of them are there for you?

95
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,574
What will I do with all this seaweed soup?

96
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,242
Would you pick up if my life was at stake?

97
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:34,078
You're not the only ones who are busy.
I'm busy too.

98
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,998
Honey, your food's ready.

99
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,421
I said, your food's ready.

100
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,610
At least the mirror didn't break.

101
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:08,112
Good going.

102
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:12,658
Why would you smash your face
into the mirror?

103
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,202
Well…

104
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,037
Go meet with Seong-gwan.

105
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,039
What? Why?

106
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:21,375
"Why?" How could you say that
when he quit his job as a doctor

107
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,337
and has been doing nothing
for years on end?

108
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,381
Every time I think of him,
I just want to die.

109
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,760
Ask him about his future plans

110
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:34,180
and if he's open to the idea
of going back to the hospital.

111
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:38,184
-He quit because he didn't like it.
-Still, how could he?

112
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,978
I'm sick of being a mom to our kids
who don't even pick up,

113
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,063
so should I quit too?

114
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,690
I'm even more sick of being your wife,
so should I quit that too?

115
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,652
Never mind. I'll meet with him.
I'll do that.

116
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:51,739
Say something foolish to him,
and I'll never cook for you ever again.

117
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,534
I doubt he'll go back to the hospital.

118
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,869
-What?
-I'll meet with him.

119
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,835
Did I tell you that a friend of mine
from college works at your headquarters?

120
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,129
No. It's news to me.

121
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:12,343
He said that excellent employees
get the chance to go abroad.

122
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,762
After five years at that company,
get an MBA abroad.

123
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,057
I'm not even a full-time employee yet.

124
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,768
Are you not confident?

125
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,439
That's not it. I'm just saying
we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves.

126
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,233
I just started working as an intern.

127
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:32,947
When I first started working,
I already knew how far up I'd go.

128
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,241
I don't expect the same from you.

129
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:38,703
But you should at least be ambitious.

130
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:39,829
Be alert.

131
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,124
I am already on alert enough.

132
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:46,544
Eun-ho, how could you…

133
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,255
Hi, Mom.

134
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,592
Where have you been?

135
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,428
We agreed to having a family dinner
at least once a week.

136
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:01,934
I had a job interview.

137
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,938
What?

138
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:47,456
KEEP IT UP!

139
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,670
YOU CAN DO IT, MY SON!

140
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,841
SON, FOOD'S IN THE FRIDGE
I LOVE YOU

141
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,971
KEEP IT UP!

142
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,602
YOU CAN DO IT!
I LOVE YOU, MY SON

143
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,451
Mu-yeong!

144
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,007
It's a bit shabby.

145
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,844
I'm in no position to be picky.

146
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,806
They'll call you a guidance counselor,
but you're pretty much a housefather.

147
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,476
The football team was formed
only a year ago,

148
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,186
so there's still a lot to be done.

149
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,270
Come this way.

150
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,650
This is your room.

151
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,236
Thanks.

152
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:01,989
Is Chae-rok doing well?

153
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,326
Did you call him?

154
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,077
Yes.

155
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,582
You should unpack and rest up.

156
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,089
Here. My wife prepared this.

157
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:24,845
Rest up.

158
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,812
Sir, are you okay?

159
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,064
Yes, I am. I'm fine.

160
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:53,183
Goodness. Oh, dear.

161
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:35,559
Goodness.

162
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,981
Gosh.

163
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,203
Goodness.

164
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:59,917
Is my ab strength the problem,
not my legs?

165
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,303
One.

166
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:34,618
One.

167
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,462
What's gotten into him this morning?

168
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,091
Could it be because of Gyo-seok?

169
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,388
Make sure you see Seong-gwan today.

170
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,306
Okay!

171
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,865
I should've started ten years ago.

172
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,535
Gosh, this darn, old body. Goodness.

173
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,103
Lee Chae-rok.

174
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,150
You only drink iced Americano.

175
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,320
You're becoming more and more
like Seung-joo.

176
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,989
That's an insult.

177
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,158
That's what he said too.

178
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,246
Why are you here?

179
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,958
You left this place because it was boring.
Why did you come back?

180
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,710
Do you also think…

181
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,880
that I won't make it?

182
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,265
He's driving me mad.

183
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,518
He suddenly appointed an old man
as my manager

184
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,144
and told me to go back to school.

185
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,438
I have no idea
what's going through his head.

186
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,148
He keeps pressuring me.

187
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,693
Why can't he trust me?
I've been doing well so far.

188
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,489
How can you prove that?

189
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,451
You haven't improved at all.

190
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,996
That's because…

191
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,707
Seung-joo was a principal dancer
at your age.

192
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,461
Do you think he was born that way? No.

193
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:53,590
Everyone dubbed him "the Ballet Prodigy"
and "the Ballet Genius,"

194
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,968
yet he practiced for 16 hours
every single day.

195
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,555
He practiced at school
and even on his own.

196
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,266
After doing that, he finally came to know

197
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,726
what kind of ballet he wanted to pursue.

198
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,229
What about you?

199
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,385
What brings you all the way here?

200
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,386
What?

201
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,513
No reason.

202
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,976
Have you been well, Seong-gwan?

203
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,811
Did Mom send you?

204
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,189
Is it that obvious?

205
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,609
Give me your phone.

206
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,369
-Smile.
-Okay.

207
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,583
Get home safely.

208
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,587
You should at least pick up her calls.

209
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,674
I can't stand her talking
about the hospital anymore.

210
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,010
Then keep telling her.

211
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,097
Tell her you're happy right now.

212
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,350
Then she'll give up sooner or later.

213
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,650
I'll get going then.

214
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,504
He left ages ago.
Why haven't I heard from him yet?

215
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,714
Goodness.

216
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,561
Goodness!

217
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:15,607
Oh, dear. You should've told me
you were here.

218
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,859
I just wanted to sit down for a while.

219
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,864
What is it this time?

220
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,450
It's nothing.

221
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,871
I had lunch nearby,
so I decided to stop by.

222
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,666
This was always my seat.

223
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,334
I was scared for no reason.

224
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,337
Exactly. You have nothing to worry about.

225
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,632
Eun-ho got into that large company,

226
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,385
Ae-ran finally finished her studies,

227
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,263
and you always handle yourself.

228
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,974
Seong-suk and Seong-gwan are the problem.

229
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:51,935
Here it is.

230
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,313
What is it?

231
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:58,900
Your dad ran an errand for me today.

232
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,986
Make sure you take some seaweed soup.

233
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,282
Don't bother to pack it.

234
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,367
Mom.

235
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:24,384
The number you have called
cannot be reached.

236
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,803
You will be redirected to voicemail
after the tone.

237
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,638
She's already at the interview.

238
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,808
Why did it have to be my workplace
of all places?

239
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,188
Does Ae-ran want to work?

240
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,732
-Hello, Father.
-Hey.

241
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,528
Yes, she does.

242
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,614
I have no idea what has gotten into her.

243
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,283
And it's my workplace.

244
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,660
It was hers too.

245
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,413
That was 20 years ago.

246
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:56,875
Maybe she's been wanting to go back
for the past two decades.

247
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,922
I wonder how old Eun-ho was back then.

248
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,926
Your mom had cooked
some beef leg bone broth for Ae-ran.

249
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,388
She had wanted to leave it
at the front door,

250
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,225
but that was when she heard Eun-ho crying.

251
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,603
She went inside just to check.

252
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,981
Eun-ho was crying hysterically,

253
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,234
but Ae-ran wasn't there.

254
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,364
She hurriedly picked Eun-ho up.

255
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,827
Then she saw Ae-ran crying on the balcony.

256
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,126
She's finally free.

257
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:42,546
Don't try to haul everything yourself.

258
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,133
Don't try to control her. Let her be.

259
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,927
Just do your part.

260
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,856
-Father, have you been working out?
-What?

261
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:04,734
No, I haven't. Not at all.

262
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,236
All I do is breathe.

263
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:21,418
Seong-suk needs to take
some seaweed soup as well.

264
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:02,417
Goodness. What's wrong with you?

265
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,420
He's pretty old.

266
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:31,631
I'll only be motivated to teach him
once I see potential.

267
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,302
Am I being too greedy

268
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,847
for my old age?

269
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,435
Tomorrow's the day.

270
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,413
Whenever you're ready.

271
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,498
Okay.

272
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:20,680
START

273
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,545
Hey, Sim Deok-chul.

274
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,341
How could a mailman get the address wrong?

275
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,176
I'm sorry.

276
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:02,347
I'll give you one week to memorize
all the addresses and their locations.

277
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,643
For this entire neighborhood?

278
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,710
He's been snooping around here
for a few days.

279
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,712
-He's creeping me out.
-Show me your ID.

280
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,923
He's crazy.

281
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,151
Sir, you did it.

282
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:29,619
Are you okay?

283
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,163
Yes.

284
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:37,669
You did well.

285
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:40,255
Thank you.

286
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,219
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

287
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,452
KI SEUNG-JOO

288
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:34,142
-Why do you keep calling? What is it?
-Hey.

289
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,352
The elderly man did it.

290
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,270
What?

291
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:42,150
He maintained balancé for a whole minute.

292
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:45,069
Can you believe it? Gosh.

293
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,113
Hello?

294
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,490
Hello?

295
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,452
Did she hang up on me? Gosh.

296
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,769
Were you an athlete when you were young?

297
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,562
No.

298
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:23,232
I could never do it at home.
Today was my first time succeeding.

299
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,443
I still can't believe I did it.

300
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:31,532
Anyway, thank you so much
for agreeing to teach me, sir.

301
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,537
Don't call me sir.
Don't address me that way.

302
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,707
You should drop the honorifics.

303
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,293
How could I when you're my teacher?

304
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,382
Then what should I call you? Mr. Lee?

305
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,467
No, just call me Chae-rok.

306
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,679
Okay. Chae-rok.

307
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:59,102
I really don't understand
why you want to learn ballet at your age.

308
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:04,190
-I'll see you at 9 a.m. tomorrow.
-Well…

309
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,903
I know it won't come true.

310
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:13,366
But I would like to perform on stage
at least once.

311
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,578
For Swan Lake.

312
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,339
Sure. Okay.

313
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,508
I'm in your care.

314
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,302
Sir. I mean, Chae-rok.

315
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:38,474
Where do you buy those? Ballet clothes.

316
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,926
Excuse me. How old is your grandson?

317
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,179
Sorry? Well…

318
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,181
It's not for my grandson.

319
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:22,226
Then your granddaughter? Then…

320
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,519
Well…

321
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:27,857
It's for me. Could you recommend some?

322
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:31,652
Sorry? It's for you?

323
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,904
Are you in there?

324
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,533
I said, are you in there?

325
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,202
Yes. I have an upset stomach.

326
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,788
Goodness. I'm seriously constipated.

327
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:34,715
No.

328
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,395
-Gosh. What were you doing in there?
-Goodness.

329
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,439
Is your stomach upset?
Do you want some plum tea?

330
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,150
No, it's okay.

331
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,610
Let me empty the trash.

332
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:45,953
I BOUGHT SOME CLOTHES THANKS TO YOU.
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

333
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,087
I BOUGHT SOME CLOTHES THANKS TO YOU.
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

334
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:56,714
What?

335
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,925
How does he know my number?

336
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:00,885
What? What is it?

337
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:03,971
I won't try too hard.
I'll make him give up on his own.

338
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,014
It'll be one month at most.

339
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,933
What are you talking about?

340
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,602
Never mind.

341
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,939
Hey,
is that obnoxious customer coming today?

342
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,484
He only comes on Fridays.

343
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,652
Really?

344
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:20,821
What would you know?
You always came last in class.

345
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:26,535
You little… Hey, you talk too much
for someone who's short.

346
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:29,914
Do you want a beating from this short guy?

347
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,791
Darn it.

348
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,383
Hold on.

349
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,555
Right. Chae-rok.

350
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,434
-Yes.
-Make sure there are enough napkins.

351
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,561
-Yes, sir.
-Sir, have some coffee.

352
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,939
-You drink iced coffee, right?
-Yes, thanks.

353
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,150
Thank you.

354
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,993
I brought some Kaoliang liquor,
your favorite.

355
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,539
Gyo-seok.

356
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:17,461
I'll be learning ballet starting tomorrow.

357
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:21,632
DECEASED, LEE GYO-SEOK

358
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,352
-What are you doing?
-What?

359
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,734
Do you want to break your bones?

360
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,695
-Go grab a mat.
-Okay.

361
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,833
We're going to stretch first.
Straighten your back.

362
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:49,929
Does it hurt?

363
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,889
No. Not one bit.

364
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:59,063
Does it really not hurt?

365
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:00,940
I'm fine.

366
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,025
Really?

367
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:12,493
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm okay.

368
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,801
Inhale and exhale.

369
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:37,893
Come back up.

370
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,354
Inhale.

371
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,152
Exhale.

372
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:54,869
Does it hurt?

373
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,954
No, I'm fine.

374
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,424
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

375
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:10,509
Is he teaching or training?

376
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,679
Mr. Sim is going to be sore all over.

377
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:19,393
Are you okay?

378
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:24,398
Let's call it a day.

379
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,692
Goodness.

380
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:29,862
Gosh.

381
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,451
Do you think you can manage?

382
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:36,410
What?

383
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,954
We can shorten our time if you wish.

384
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:42,458
No, I'm fine. I'm only like this
because it was my first day.

385
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:45,294
Okay. You can go home then.
I'm going to go eat.

386
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:47,004
"Eat"? We should eat together.

387
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:48,631
Why?

388
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,966
I'm your manager now.

389
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:01,101
-Did you enjoy your meal?
-Yes.

390
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,245
What is that?

391
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:22,581
It's my notebook.
You don't like carrots, do you?

392
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,669
Did you really write that down?

393
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:29,088
This is what a manager does.

394
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:33,926
I watched this one episode
of Living to 100, and they said

395
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,886
carrots are full of vitamin A
and carotene--

396
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,181
-I don't care. Let me see that.
-No. Wait.

397
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,142
Goodness.

398
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,521
ARRIVED AT 8:30 A.M.
BAD CONDITION, CRANKY

399
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,314
DRANK 1000ML OF WATER
SKIPPED BREAKFAST

400
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,108
PORK CUTLET FOR LUNCH
PICKED OUT THE CARROTS

401
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,694
I wasn't cranky.

402
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,612
You got mad during our class.

403
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,364
Because you weren't doing well.

404
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,825
Of course. I'm still a beginner.

405
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,285
I was good from the start.

406
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,161
No wonder.

407
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:06,333
I knew it. You're truly incredible.

408
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:09,753
What is this? Are you teasing me?

409
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,255
No, I really mean it.

410
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:16,844
I was deeply moved when I saw you dancing.

411
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,768
No one carries notebooks these days.
They all use their phones.

412
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,979
-Are you done eating?
-Yes.

413
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:28,897
Hey.

414
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,274
Wait.

415
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:04,725
-Excuse me.
-I'm his manager, sir.

416
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:06,727
Mr. Sim.

417
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,520
How bad is it?

418
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:12,316
Would taping be enough?
Or should he cut down on practice?

419
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,444
It'd be best for him to take a rest,

420
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,613
but he hates being told so.

421
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:19,823
Receiving massages and physical therapy

422
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,868
and lifting light weights
are his only options.

423
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:26,664
Why would you tell him that?

424
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:28,165
He's your manager.

425
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:32,378
On top of his knees,
I think his back is weak as well.

426
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:35,506
Goodness. You're right. That's exactly it.

427
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:37,800
Hey. Turn around.

428
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,301
Here.

429
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:42,680
I see a slightly slipped disc
between L3 and L4.

430
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:46,809
He's been jumping and lifting
all the time. Something's got to give.

431
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,560
Your back is the core of your body.

432
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:51,730
Then what should we do?

433
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:56,693
Well…

434
00:44:57,236 --> 00:45:00,072
this may sound odd
as I practice Western medicine,

435
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:04,326
but a traditional medical clinic
just recently opened downstairs.

436
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,078
Maybe he should get acupuncture.

437
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:08,122
I went there yesterday as well.

438
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,916
-I don't like needles.
-Acupuncture?

439
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:15,254
You're a wonderful doctor.
You're incredible.

440
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:18,298
Gosh, not at all. It's actually my sibling
who runs the place.

441
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,843
You and your sibling have
such a great relationship.

442
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:23,637
-I'll make sure he gets it.
-Okay.

443
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,389
I said I don't like needles.

444
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:27,391
Moxibustion and cupping work too.

445
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:29,643
-I see.
-You should go home.

446
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:32,396
No. I have my duties as your manager.

447
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,314
-Is there anything else you need?
-No.

448
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,232
Nothing?

449
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,744
Chae-rok.

450
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:53,876
See? You do need my help.

451
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,561
WENT TO THE TOILET
AFTER DRINKING ICED AMERICANO

452
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:14,771
HAD DIARRHEA ABOUT 3 TIMES

453
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:17,149
SEEMS TO HAVE AN UPSET STOMACH
HAS TROUBLE WITH CAFFEINE

454
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:42,090
Where do you live?

455
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:44,134
Do you live with your parents?

456
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,636
Why do you ask?

457
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,846
Because I'm your manager.

458
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:50,682
I live alone. Happy?

459
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,643
What about your parents?

460
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,650
My dad lives somewhere else,

461
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:01,318
and my mom passed away.

462
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:08,450
I see. Both of my parents passed away!

463
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:12,287
I'll see you tomorrow, Chae-rok!

464
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,767
Where does it hurt? Tell me.

465
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:37,646
I'm not hurting anywhere.

466
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,481
Goodness.

467
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,525
-Goodness.
-Gosh.

468
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,370
Honey.

469
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,290
Could you go buy some soy sauce for me?

470
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,666
Sure.

471
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:37,497
Gosh, I'll be dead by then.

472
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:15,952
Hello?

473
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:20,082
Chae-rok. Are you still asleep?
This is your wake-up call.

474
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,926
I never asked you to give me
a wake-up call.

475
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,472
I saw how celebrity managers
would do the same on TV.

476
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:38,100
Isn't it nice and refreshing
waking up early?

477
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:39,601
Not at all.

478
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:44,439
Let's start with number one.

479
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:47,359
You should turn out your legs.

480
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:49,528
-More.
-Okay.

481
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:51,196
More.

482
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:53,073
Feet flat on the ground.

483
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,409
Tighten your inner thighs.

484
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:58,286
Tighten your buttocks.

485
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:00,706
Stomach in.

486
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:04,376
Straighten your back
and put your shoulders down.

487
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:07,462
Make your neck look longer. More.

488
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,923
En bas.

489
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:13,552
Stomach in.

490
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:16,513
Leave some space in your armpits,
just enough to fit an egg.

491
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,392
Leave some space.

492
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,018
Spread out your fingers.

493
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,479
Lightly place your hand.

494
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,275
En avant.

495
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,152
Try an à la seconde.

496
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:36,158
Position your arms as if a water drop
could flow down naturally.

497
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:37,701
Raise your elbows.

498
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,164
Now, en haut.

499
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,334
Balancé.

500
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,014
Chae-rok.

501
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,892
Can I drink some water?

502
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:03,602
Go ahead.

503
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:04,686
Okay.

504
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,272
-Be quick.
-Okay.

505
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:06,373
I'll do it.

506
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:14,422
-Is it here?
-What? No.

507
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,508
A bit to the right.

508
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:20,428
-Here?
-No.

509
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:23,557
A bit lower.

510
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:26,852
Here?

511
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:31,857
No. I think you got it right
the first time.

512
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:34,192
Stop messing with me.

513
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:35,110
What?

514
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:38,029
Hey, wait. Hey.

515
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:50,834
-Chae-rok, have some plum tea.
-No, thanks. Bye.

516
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:52,669
Take this with you!

517
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:05,056
Chae-rok, get in.

518
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,601
Gosh, where did you get that car?

519
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,227
Does it even drive properly?

520
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:12,147
Bungbung has been accident-free
for the past 30 years.

521
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:13,732
"Bungbung"?

522
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:18,737
No, thanks. I have to go to work,
so you can leave.

523
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:21,156
"Work"? Does Mr. Ki know about this?

524
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,200
Why? So you can tattle on me?

525
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:26,995
-He already knows.
-I see.

526
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:44,596
Chae-rok.

527
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:51,519
Here's some plum tea.

528
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:54,189
No, thanks.

529
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,455
Bye, Chae-rok.

530
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:13,917
Chae-rok.

531
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:17,712
Who's that grandpa?

532
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:21,257
-And what's that?
-Don't ask.

533
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:23,843
Jeez.

534
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,515
My gosh, it's Friday.

535
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:37,899
Hello.

536
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:46,658
I had it last week,
so why can't I order it today?

537
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:51,162
Sir, let me explain again.
That was a seasonal--

538
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:55,125
Whatever! I don't care. I want this dish.

539
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,670
Sir, how about you pick another dish--

540
00:54:58,753 --> 00:54:59,629
Hey.

541
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:00,964
Don't you know me?

542
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:03,883
Don't you know I come here every week?

543
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:07,303
Are you an employee or a part-timer?

544
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:11,558
Do I need to file a complaint
to the headquarters and get you fired?

545
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:12,892
Do I?

546
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:18,064
I don't want to hear it anymore.
Just bring me this dish.

547
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,691
Sir…

548
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:21,067
Just bring it!

549
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:29,534
I'm sorry. I'll get you new napkins.

550
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:38,251
Sir, please leave the restaurant.

551
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:41,171
And who are you?

552
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:43,715
Me? I'm a part-timer here.

553
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:48,386
Leave before I sue you
for obstruction of business and assault.

554
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:49,929
How dare you talk--

555
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,556
You started it!

556
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:54,309
We have you on video
throwing the napkins at her.

557
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:56,311
Should I post it online?

558
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,105
File a complaint if you think it's unfair.

559
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:00,607
Get up.

560
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,151
Get up this instant!

561
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,248
Hey…

562
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,050
That's not what happened.

563
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:30,220
You kicked out one of our customers?

564
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:35,517
Well done.

565
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:38,937
Did you report him?

566
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:42,482
-No, ma'am.
-You didn't?

567
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:47,570
Then I'll do it.

568
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:52,033
That'll be all.

569
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:54,994
Let's give her a round of applause.

570
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,497
-Hoorah!
-Hoorah!

571
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:01,668
I feel the same way.

572
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:05,630
It seems Fridays will be a lot better
from now on.

573
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,272
Hey.

574
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,315
Thank you for what you did.

575
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:36,619
I'm sorry.

576
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:45,962
You really try so hard.

577
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:50,383
Wait.

578
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,470
What did you say?

579
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:59,267
Do you want to be a full employee
that badly?

580
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,689
You apologized to that obnoxious customer,
didn't you?

581
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:06,608
For what?

582
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:09,986
Don't you know you're making things
difficult for everyone?

583
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:12,447
If you act like a pushover,

584
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:15,867
he'll think it's okay to treat
the other workers the same way.

585
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:18,828
Another worker will get napkins thrown
on their face.

586
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:22,290
Have some self-respect.

587
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:26,794
Hey!

588
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:29,464
What did you say?

589
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:34,928
What's wrong? Are you taken aback
that I dropped the honorifics?

590
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:38,056
What do you know?

591
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:41,351
You can quit because you're a part-timer,
but not me.

592
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,646
I must succeed as an intern
no matter what.

593
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,858
Do you know how much effort I put in
to get this far?

594
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:52,362
You have no idea
how people like me feel, do you?

595
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:54,322
If that's the case,

596
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:58,326
then just shut up.

597
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,460
Was it wrong of me to say that?

598
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:10,338
Why try so hard
when she could do something else?

599
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:13,591
Gosh, you sociopath.

600
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:18,429
If someone said to you,
"Why do you do ballet?

601
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:20,890
Why try so hard? Just give up already,"

602
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:22,767
would you feel happy?

603
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,645
I only do it because it's fun.

604
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:30,149
I would never stoop that low.

605
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,568
That's exactly it.

606
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:36,322
Perhaps, she's desperate enough
to go through such a thing.

607
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:39,951
Not many people work
because they enjoy it.

608
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,946
You know what?
The only thing in this world

609
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,573
that I have full control over

610
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:21,409
is this wine.

611
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:24,412
What's wrong? What happened this time?

612
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,124
"Self-respect"?

613
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:33,713
What an asshole.

614
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:36,007
I'm leaving now!

615
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:42,365
CLASSIC BALLET

616
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:38,087
MR. SIM

617
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:51,809
-Chae-rok, this is your wake-up call.
-I'm up.

618
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:57,940
He's calling me even on Saturdays.

619
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,616
MANRIJANGSEONG OWNER

620
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:10,119
Hello, sir. What's this about?

621
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:12,663
The delivery man didn't show up again.

622
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:16,209
Can you help out today?
I'll pay you handsomely.

623
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:20,963
Thanks a lot. It's Saturday,
so the orders have been piling up.

624
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:22,381
Where should I go first?

625
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:25,635
There's a new billiard hall
at the five-way intersection. Go there.

626
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:27,720
-I'll get going.
-All right.

627
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,097
-We'd like some more pickled radish.
-Sure.

628
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:36,020
-Delivery.
-Over here.

629
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:42,735
-Over here, please.
-Okay.

630
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,745
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

631
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,206
Chae-rok.

632
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:00,628
I didn't know you did delivery too.

633
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:04,257
You're going to be filthy rich.

634
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:11,639
You seem to be living just fine.
Don't you agree?

635
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:15,935
Hey!

636
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:21,440
Give me your business card.

637
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:26,070
-I'll order some food.
-I don't have any.

638
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:32,910
DACHEONG BILLIARD CLUB

639
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:41,335
-I'm back.
-Hey. Good work.

640
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:43,296
Enjoy.

641
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:47,842
Chae-rok, why are you here?

642
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:50,094
Why are you…

643
01:04:50,177 --> 01:04:52,138
I came to have some jajangmyeon.

644
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,307
Do you work here too?

645
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:56,225
Does Mr. Ki know?

646
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:00,479
Hear me out first.

647
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:01,898
I'm only filling in for today.

648
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:05,693
He asked me for help, and I felt bad.
He had no one for deliveries.

649
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:09,322
Cut me some slack today.

650
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:12,533
Sir, I don't know how you two
know each other,

651
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:13,951
but I was in a pinch.

652
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:16,746
Look. What if he had gotten
into an accident?

653
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:19,206
Would you have taken responsibility?

654
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,585
He has a helmet, and he's also insured.

655
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:24,545
He's going to become a huge star.

656
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:27,632
We can't risk a ballerino getting hurt.

657
01:05:28,215 --> 01:05:29,926
-Ballet?
-Mr. Sim, please!

658
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:32,219
He won't go on deliveries anymore.

659
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:33,387
Sorry?

660
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:37,433
Then what will we do?

661
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:39,685
I'll deliver the food.

662
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:41,729
You?

663
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:48,653
Do you even know how to ride it?

664
01:05:49,153 --> 01:05:50,905
You could get hurt.

665
01:05:50,988 --> 01:05:52,573
Don't you worry.

666
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:02,708
Gosh.

667
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:04,752
Who in the world is he?

668
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:08,673
Enjoy.

669
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:17,556
-I'm back.
-Okay.

670
01:06:29,026 --> 01:06:30,152
Tell me the truth.

671
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:32,738
Were you an athlete?

672
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:34,907
I was a civil servant.

673
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:36,826
A mailman.

674
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:38,619
A postman.

675
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:50,297
Hello? Yes. All right.

676
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:52,842
This will be the last order.

677
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:54,427
What's the address?

678
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:56,303
It's the billiard hall nearby.

679
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:57,972
Okay. I got it.

680
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,184
I'll go.

681
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:05,563
What? No, I'll go.

682
01:07:05,646 --> 01:07:07,773
It's nearby, and it's the last one.

683
01:07:08,899 --> 01:07:09,900
I'll go.

684
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:13,029
By the way,
I think one of your friends ordered.

685
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:15,281
He asked if you were still working.

686
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:26,500
Chae-rok. Over here.

687
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:39,680
I didn't have your business card,

688
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:42,600
so I got the name from these chopsticks.
You petty bastard.

689
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:51,734
That'll be 24,000 won.

690
01:07:51,817 --> 01:07:54,320
What? Do you seriously expect me to pay?

691
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:56,655
I paid for the steak,

692
01:07:57,782 --> 01:07:59,742
-so you should pay for this.
-As if.

693
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:01,243
Pay up before you eat.

694
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,789
We accept cards too.

695
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:07,917
Are you out of your mind?

696
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:19,386
"You don't deserve a good life, do you?"

697
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:23,474
You must've cursed me
because I'm not doing well.

698
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:27,144
My dad was discharged,
but I don't know where he is.

699
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:30,940
I don't know what I should do
or if I even have a future.

700
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:34,235
So pay up.

701
01:08:40,866 --> 01:08:45,246
You must've gone completely insane,
haven't you?

702
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:47,373
Then I'll report you.

703
01:08:48,332 --> 01:08:49,750
You bastard.

704
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:53,045
You're dead meat tonight.

705
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:55,923
Chae-rok!

706
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:40,509
You do know it's too late for you
to become a dancer, right?

707
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,345
I'm not going to hesitate.

708
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:45,264
I'm going to give it my all.

709
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:48,225
I have no idea what he's up to these days.

710
01:09:48,809 --> 01:09:49,852
-Gosh.
-What are you doing?

711
01:09:49,935 --> 01:09:51,562
What?

712
01:09:51,645 --> 01:09:54,440
-Have you been doing well?
-What do you think?

713
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:57,234
Chae-rok is going to soar like an eagle.

714
01:09:57,318 --> 01:10:00,654
That bastard won't be able to soar.
I'm going to break his wings.

715
01:10:01,238 --> 01:10:03,115
Why do you want to do ballet?

716
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,576
I want to soar
at least once in my lifetime.

717
01:10:05,659 --> 01:10:10,664
