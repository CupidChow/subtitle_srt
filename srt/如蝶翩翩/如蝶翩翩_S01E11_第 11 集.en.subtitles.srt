EPISODE 11

2
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,139
Mom, go inside.

3
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,403
Father.

4
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:34,677
Hae-nam.

5
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,140
Come on inside, honey.

6
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,130
Drink while it's hot.

7
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,925
I'm sorry, Hae-nam.

8
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,262
I'm…

9
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,307
I'm sorry.

10
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,101
That day…

11
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,854
What?

12
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,523
Do you remember that day?

13
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,316
Goodness.

14
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,321
-Get back to work.
-Deok-chul, thank you for everything.

15
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,782
-Take care of yourself.
-We'll visit you soon.

16
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,326
-Thank you all.
-Thank you for everything.

17
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,911
-Goodbye.
-See you again.

18
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,580
-Take care.
-Bye.

19
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:47,000
-Spend some time with your wife.
-I will.

20
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,550
WE BELIEVE IN YOU!

21
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,348
Hae-nam.

22
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:08,605
-Honey, you're amazing.
-What? Me?

23
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,858
Yes. You worked hard for 40 years
without ever complaining

24
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,027
until the day you retire.

25
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,237
You really hung in there.

26
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,656
Thank you, Deok-chul.

27
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,451
I couldn't have done it without you.

28
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,746
Half the credit is yours.
Thank you, Hae-nam.

29
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,166
-Let's get going now.
-Okay. Let's go.

30
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,420
When you told me
I should take half the credit

31
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,757
for your 40 years of hard work,

32
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,134
I felt really proud.

33
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,845
So by the same token,

34
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,181
after all the years
that we've been together,

35
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,975
half of your dream of doing ballet

36
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,978
should be mine, right?

37
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,607
Stay strong.

38
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,651
Don't go anywhere.

39
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,319
Stay by my side

40
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,863
and achieve what you want by all means.

41
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,284
Hae-nam.

42
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,037
Promise me, Deok-chul.

43
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:11,125
Okay. I promise.

44
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,677
Mom knows, too?

45
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,178
Yes.

46
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,056
Don't worry.

47
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,058
She's okay.

48
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:32,063
No. It's not that she's okay.

49
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,108
She thinks she should stay strong.

50
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:40,363
She said she can
take care of Father on her own.

51
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,952
Why don't we have him checked up
at another hospital--

52
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,078
Seong-san.

53
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,548
Anyway, let's go to my place.

54
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,759
I'll call Seong-suk over.

55
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,268
I can't believe it.

56
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,730
-I want to go see Father.
-Honey, calm down.

57
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:58,357
-Get out of my way.
-Seong-suk.

58
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,985
I understand how you feel,

59
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,821
but let's act as usual.

60
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,866
It won't help Father if we cause a fuss.

61
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:10,036
Think about why Father didn't tell us.

62
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,915
It's best if we just go about as usual,
Seong-suk.

63
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,420
What's going to happen to Father?

64
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,972
For now, he just gets forgetful sometimes

65
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,850
and loses his memories for short moments.

66
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,645
But if things get worse,

67
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,231
I'll look after him here.

68
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,524
Seong-san.

69
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,193
But both you and Ae-ran work.

70
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:46,197
How can you possibly look after him?

71
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,366
We'll find a way.

72
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,078
These days, you can get
home care services.

73
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,455
We could hire a caregiver, too.

74
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,374
I appreciate your offer,

75
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,001
but that's not going to be easy.

76
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,878
In many cases I've seen,

77
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:05,383
they end up putting their parents
in nursing homes in the end.

78
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,055
Are you suggesting
we put Father in a nursing home?

79
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,598
That's not what I mean!

80
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,020
Seong-san.

81
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,481
What I'm saying is,

82
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,569
we should look for realistic options.

83
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,033
I know you want to look after him
yourself,

84
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,913
but it'll be just too much for you.

85
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,751
Yeong-il and I will…

86
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,211
We'll do it.

87
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,634
We can always step out of our office
if something happens,

88
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,178
but you can't.

89
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,305
We live a lot closer to Father as well.

90
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,390
Why would you do that?

91
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,601
-I'll do it.
-Seong-san.

92
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,187
I'm his child, too.

93
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,608
You, Seong-suk,

94
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,361
and Seong-gwan aren't his only children.

95
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:16,370
This isn't going anywhere.
Let's ask what Mom thinks first.

96
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,247
Aren't we asking what Grandpa thinks?

97
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,835
Think about it.

98
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:26,297
Why do we get to decide
where Grandpa should live?

99
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:30,343
Does being sick mean he doesn't get a say?
No, it doesn't.

100
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,221
Shouldn't Grandpa
be the first person to ask?

101
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,033
EUN-HO

102
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:43,833
Hey.

103
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,210
Hey.

104
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,129
It's me.

105
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,258
Why…

106
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,177
didn't you…

107
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,682
Can we meet?

108
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,106
Is this what you wanted to tell me

109
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,734
the other day?

110
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,156
I tried to tell you many times, but…

111
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:16,991
I'm sorry.

112
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,576
Don't be.

113
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,246
You don't have to apologize.

114
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,166
I'm the one who should say sorry.

115
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,503
I had no idea and kept asking you
to take good care of him.

116
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,551
You must have been struggling.

117
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:39,180
Both you and my grandpa.

118
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,275
Even while being unwell,

119
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,780
he gave me Bungbung as a present

120
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,158
and sent a message to my radio show.

121
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,584
How could he be so concerned about me
even in this situation?

122
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,632
I just…

123
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,928
Thank you, Chae-rok.

124
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,520
I'm not sure if you should thank me.

125
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:32,316
All I do is stand by Mr. Sim's side.

126
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:38,239
Just like he stands by me.

127
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,356
You didn't sleep at all?

128
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,158
I have to go to work.

129
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,164
Yes. Let's get ready, honey.

130
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:35,713
Yesterday, I had seaweed soup
for breakfast

131
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,632
and wore a navy suit.

132
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,260
Hae-nam made me some tea.

133
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,761
What tea was it?

134
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,767
I don't remember.

135
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,436
It's 70 points for today.

136
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,854
Goodness.

137
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:56,817
Ho-beom.

138
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,992
Three, four…

139
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:10,080
Don't you need to go through a tryout
to join a football team again?

140
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:13,459
What are you talking about?
I'm not fit enough yet.

141
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:14,960
I won't be ready for a while.

142
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,296
Don't wait until you're ready.

143
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,423
Do you mean I should just dive right in?

144
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,175
Speaking from experience,

145
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,720
you're never going to be perfectly ready.

146
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,057
Start now and get better over time.

147
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,769
You know, strike while the iron is hot.

148
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,272
Dive right in
even if you don't feel ready.

149
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,483
I'll get going now.

150
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,632
-Good morning.
-Hi. Let's get ready.

151
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,259
-Can you get me the script?
-Okay.

152
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:21,151
Sir, is it okay if I send a message
to our show?

153
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,237
What?

154
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:28,117
Do you all remember the old gentleman
who sent a message

155
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,327
to cheer for his granddaughter recently?

156
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,664
Today, we got a message
from his very granddaughter.

157
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:37,167
"My grandpa does ballet.

158
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:41,463
To be honest,
I wasn't interested at first.

159
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,841
I thought it was strange

160
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:48,846
to take up something new at 70,
not to mention ballet.

161
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,515
The whole family was against the idea

162
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,934
and I thought he'd give up in no time.

163
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,061
But he proved us all wrong.

164
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,565
My grandpa is still doing ballet
to this day.

165
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,942
When you want something
with all your heart,

166
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,861
you shine brighter than anyone.

167
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,779
My grandpa taught me that.

168
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,949
Grandpa."

169
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:10,784
Eun-ho.

170
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:14,371
"I'd love to see you dance on stage.

171
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,540
I'll be waiting.

172
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,960
Keep it up until then, Grandpa."

173
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:24,298
That was the message from Ms. Sim Eun-ho.

174
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,761
I can't find any words to add.

175
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,096
Let's listen to a song
that Ms. Sim requested.

176
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,473
Music, standby.

177
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,939
When is the audition, by the way?

178
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:22,940
Tomorrow.

179
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,442
So soon?

180
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,278
I even packed you lunch.

181
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,863
You'd better pass.

182
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,699
I'll do my best.

183
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,951
-Father, let's go.
-Okay.

184
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,953
-Mom, see you later.
-Okay.

185
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,414
Why didn't you come with me
to my morning exercise?

186
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,165
Well, I slept in.

187
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,544
-A young man like you…
-Father, I'm 40.

188
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,463
Seong-gwan, isn't the world so wonderful?

189
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:47,881
All of a sudden?

190
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,227
Here. You left these in your locker.

191
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,814
I thought I lost them. Here they were.

192
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,190
Thanks.

193
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,193
Mr. Sim.

194
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,446
Yes?

195
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,868
Promise me one thing.

196
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,830
Starting today,

197
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,333
text me every 20 minutes on your way home.

198
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,085
I'm okay.

199
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,296
All right. I'll do that.

200
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,674
I'll promise something, too.

201
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,304
Even if you don't remember me,

202
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,765
I'll remember you.

203
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,311
I'll recognize you.

204
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,232
I won't let go of your hand.

205
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,404
As long as you are with me

206
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,656
and recognize me,

207
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,912
I'll teach you ballet anytime.

208
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,249
Thank you, Chae-rok.

209
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,629
-You can do this, right?
-Of course.

210
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,260
It's been a while, Mr. Sim.

211
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,847
The audition's tomorrow. Are you ready?

212
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,057
Of course.

213
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:31,944
Gosh.
How could you let things get this bad?

214
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,654
Pardon?

215
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,614
If you'd explained properly,

216
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,617
there wouldn't have been
so many people who signed up.

217
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:42,204
You didn't even inform them
of the risk of losing money.

218
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,332
This is a case of financial misselling.

219
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,708
Sir,

220
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,545
I only followed the instructions
from headquarters.

221
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,630
Also, you pressured us to sell more.

222
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,841
You ranked us based on our sales

223
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,343
and warned us it'd influence
our performance reviews.

224
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,053
You can't put all the blame on me.

225
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,680
Let's wrap things up here.

226
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,390
What do you mean?

227
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,039
Mr. Sim.

228
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,714
I can see that you've been practicing
every day.

229
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:34,840
Right?

230
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,134
I didn't lie, Chae-rok.

231
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,219
I can testify to that.

232
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,683
Let's get going now.

233
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,020
Already? I should practice some more.

234
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,856
We're not going home.
Let's go check out the venue.

235
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,941
The venue?

236
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,027
KIM HEUNG-SIK BALLET COMPANY

237
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,328
This feels completely different
from the studio.

238
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,040
-This is where the audition will be.
-I know.

239
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,000
Since you've only been here once,

240
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,586
finish your practice here
and get used to the space.

241
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:16,215
I rented the place for you
so you can relax tomorrow.

242
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,635
Should we get started right away?

243
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,055
The judges will be sitting over here.

244
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,681
You will be dancing…

245
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,518
here.

246
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,271
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

247
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:40,906
Look far away. Open your chest.

248
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,450
There you go.

249
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,831
Shoulders down. Tighten your abs.

250
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,918
A little inward.

251
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:07,266
You're becoming a proper ballerino.

252
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,267
What?

253
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,185
Your feet are starting to change shape,

254
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,437
and you're no longer bothered
by small bruises.

255
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,814
Is that right?

256
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,817
It's just… When my feet hurt,

257
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,403
I think of it as a sign
that I worked hard.

258
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,073
That's how many ballet dancers feel,
including me.

259
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,617
After a long day of practice,

260
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,578
if my shoes are worn out or falling apart,

261
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,872
I feel relieved.

262
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:35,544
It's usually hard to see
how much progress I'm making.

263
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,130
But when I see my feet

264
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,506
and my worn-out shoes,

265
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,925
I can see it.

266
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,137
It reminds me of the time I spent.

267
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,308
That's why you should practice
every single day.

268
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,894
Every single day is precious.

269
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,356
Because I don't have much time left.

270
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,277
That's nonsense.

271
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,113
-Seong-gwan is waiting. Let's go.
-Okay.

272
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,959
I'M HOME, CHAE-ROK

273
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,424
-Are you coming, Father?
-Yes, I'm coming.

274
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,519
GET SOME REST

275
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,088
I CAN FEEL MY CONDITION PROGRESSING

276
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,715
I NEED TO STAY ALERT

277
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:11,264
I'LL MAKE SURE TO PASS TOMORROW'S AUDITION

278
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,576
What did I do yesterday?

279
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,204
I practiced for the audition all day.

280
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:38,166
I also went to check out
the audition venue.

281
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,085
What did I have for dinner?

282
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,254
Braised short ribs.

283
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,923
And I went to bed around 10 p.m.

284
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,675
It's a 90 for today's score.

285
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:02,566
HANGANG BANK SELLS MISMANAGED FUNDS

286
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,611
SAFE FUNDS AT ESTIMATED 90% LOSS

287
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:09,698
What… is this?

DEPUTY BRANCH MANAGER PROMOTED THE SALES

290
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,294
You were in charge of the sales?

291
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,672
That's not true.

292
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:30,427
Dad. This article…

293
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:37,517
Eun-ho, I'm fine.

294
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:38,768
Go to work.

295
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,573
SEONG-SAN

296
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,288
The call cannot be connected.

297
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:01,708
You will be forwarded to voicemail.

KIM HEUNG-SIK BALLET COMPANY

299
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,765
Father, how are you today?

300
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:22,479
-Father?
-What?

301
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:25,440
-Is something wrong?
-No, nothing's wrong.

302
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:30,111
Seong-gwan,
I have to step out for a while.

303
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:33,949
What? Where are you going?

304
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,533
I won't be long.

305
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:41,373
I'm okay today. Don't worry.

306
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,134
I LOST ALL MY LIFE SAVINGS!

307
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,136
NULLIFY THE CONTRACT AND COMPENSATE!

308
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,765
HANGANG SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY!

309

DISHONEST FUNDS DESTROY LIVES

310
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,320
Seong-gwan, where's Mr. Sim?

311
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,906
He stepped out.

312
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,075
I'll try calling him.

313
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,620
He left his phone.

314
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,878
-Welcome.
-Hello.

315
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,054
-Thank you.
-Bye.

316
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,681
-Have a nice day.
-You too.

319
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:48,273
-Excuse me.
-How can I help you?

320
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:52,277
I'm here to see Sim Seong-san,
the deputy branch manager here.

321
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,361
Is he in?

322
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,739
He's away at the moment.

323
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,658
I'm his father,

324
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:01,077
and I really need to see him.

325
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,079
Could you find a way?

326
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:09,711
Father!

327
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:14,966
Seong-san.

328
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,802
Father, what brings you here?

329
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:19,846
I came to give you this.

330
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:38,531
You're late every day.

331
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,116
You zone out all the time.

332
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,743
Why did you even quit baseball?

333
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,373
You little brat.

334
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:49,751
You have no dream or future.

335
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,796
Just what's on your mind?

336
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,595
Hello, Mr. Sim.

337
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,688
My boy, Seong-san, isn't like that.

338
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:15,360
He was top of his class
before he started baseball.

339
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,113
Regardless,

340
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:21,950
he doesn't deserve to hear that from you.

341
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,494
He's only 16.

342
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,997
He can do and become anything he wants.

343
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,295
Father.

344
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,427
Do you really think
I can do and become anything I want?

345
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:45,098
Of course. You sure can do and become
anything you want.

346
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,564
What the teacher said is right.

347
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:56,151
I have no dream or future.

348
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,069
I have nothing at all.

349
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,904
-So--
-Seong-san.

350
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,658
You have me, your father.

351
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:09,289
You're the pitcher, and I'm the fielder.

352
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,877
You've allowed a few hits
and even a home run.

353
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,464
But it's totally fine.

354
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,719
I'm running around at the back,
catching every ball for you.

355
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:28,266
I'm not going anywhere
as long as you're on the mound.

356
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,560
So Seong-san,

357
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,687
let's just not give up.

358
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,107
Okay?

359
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,411
Do you remember what I said?

360
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:52,415
Even now, I'm still your fielder.

361
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,668
You can throw the ball
however you want, Seong-san.

362
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,380
I'll get going now.

363
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,243
-Nice to see you. It's been so long.
-Nice to see you, too.

364
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,829
-It's an honor.
-Thanks.

365
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,625
It starts in ten minutes. Where's Mr. Sim?

366
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:39,087
Well…

367
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,177
Can we postpone the audition
just 30 minutes?

368
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,639
-What's wrong?
-Mr. Sim isn't here yet.

369
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,268
We're going to start on time.

370
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,396
If he doesn't show up, he fails.

371
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,882
Even now, I'm still your fielder.

372
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:33,761
You can throw the ball
however you want, Seong-san.

373
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,577
I looked everywhere for you.

374
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,579
You had me worried.

375
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,958
What's this?

376
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,837
Father came and gave it to me.

377
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,714
Father did?

378
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:13,051
I wanted a new glove so badly.

379
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,887
But I couldn't even ask him back then.

380
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,389
I told myself,

381
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,933
"I'll wait until I'm in high school."

382
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,852
But you know,

383
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:28,566
I quit baseball
right before entering high school.

384
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,737
It was costing more and more.

385
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,448
I wanted to shut my eyes
to everything else

386
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:38,367
and ask my parents to keep supporting me.

387
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,369
But I couldn't.

388
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:45,208
I hated seeing Seong-suk and Seong-gwan
in hand-me-downs all the time.

389
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:49,003
I couldn't stand Mom
working as a housekeeper.

390
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,758
I was sick of seeing Father covered
in dust from the construction site.

391
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,598
I actually wanted to continue
playing baseball.

392
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:04,018
I was even pretty good.

393
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:07,939
But…

394
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,358
I couldn't do it.

395
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,319
I just couldn't.

396
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:17,824
Honey.

397
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,290
I finally got one today.

398
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,251
A new glove.

399
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,505
You can do what you want now.

400
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,384
I hate seeing you like this.
It's not like you.

401
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:40,012
You pretend you're okay when you're not.

402
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,430
It makes me feel sorry.

403
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,519
You don't have to do this anymore.

404
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,646
I've got your back.

405
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,990
I'm sorry.

406
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:02,326
You don't have to say sorry.

407
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,498
You've worked hard, Seong-san.

408
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,044
You hung in there.

409
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,679
You all did an amazing job.

410
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,182
We really enjoyed it.

411
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,560
After much discussion,
the judges have decided

412
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,729
to choose the dancer

413
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:33,399
who suits our gala best.

414
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:37,445
Mr. Sim Deok-chul, congratulations.

415
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,996
Thank you. Thank you very much.

416
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:50,708
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

417
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,881
-Great job.
-Congratulations.

418
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,007
Thank you.

419
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,051
-Congratulations, Mr. Sim.
-Thanks.

420
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:03,763
You were amazing, Father.
If only my camera could capture it all.

421
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:06,224
Thanks, Seong-gwan.
This is just the beginning.

422
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:09,143
Mr. Sim, let's go practice now.

423
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,228
Okay, let's go.

424
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,438
Now? Again?

425
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,454
DEOK-CHUL: HAE-NAM, I PASSED!

426
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:30,790
Way to go, Deok-chul.

427
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,466
I'm going to buy a really nice pot.

428
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,099
Mr. Sim has come a long way
since the performance meeting.

429
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:51,727
To be honest,
I didn't expect much from him.

430
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,063
Now I understand
why you wanted to choose him.

431
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,856
I never said that.

432
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,775
So-ri told me.

433
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:02,321
She scares me sometimes.
She knows me too well.

434
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:06,993
Come in.

435
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:18,004
Sir, I'm quitting.

436
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:20,923
Where's this coming from?

437
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,801
You told me to quit yesterday.

438
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,596
Whether I was aware or not,

439
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,891
it doesn't change the fact
that I sold mismanaged funds.

440
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:34,520
I'm partly responsible for the situation.

441
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,731
But sir,

442
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:41,819
don't think you can sort things out
just by firing me.

443
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,196
Let me tell you.

444
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,449
-Whether to the audit team
-Hey.

445
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,743
-or to the investigators,
-Sim Seong-san!

446
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,953
I'll tell the whole truth as it is.

447
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:53,581
Goodbye.

448
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:58,002
Hey! Stop right there!

449
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,921
Sim Seong-san!

450
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,011
Mr. Sim.

451
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,598
You didn't have to follow me out.

452
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,975
Don't get on his bad side. Go back inside.

453
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:14,685
I mean…

454
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:18,356
I'm okay. Go on inside.

455
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,901
Come on. Go ahead.

456
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,530
I'll call you.

457
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:46,217
We have a new dancer
joining our annual performance.

458
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:50,805
Please welcome Mr. Sim Deok-chul,
who passed the audition.

459
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,223
Please introduce yourself.

460
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,894
I have a long way to go,
but I'll work hard.

461
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:07,071
He'll be participating in the classes
and practices starting today.

462
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:11,409
There will be a practice show
before the real show. Be prepared.

463
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,786
Warm up for 30 minutes before we start.

464
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:14,995
-Okay.
-Okay.

465
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,372
-Please get ready.
-Okay.

466
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:18,916
Let's warm up.

467
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,713
Mr. Sim, will you be all right without me?

468
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,549
I'll do my best.

469
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:30,428
No filming is allowed,
so Seong-gwan can't be here, either.

470
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,138
Don't worry, Chae-rok.

471
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,266
Call me if anything happens.

472
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:38,936
-Maybe I should tell Mr. Ki--
-No, you don't have to.

473
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,021
I'll try my best.

474
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:44,650
Okay.

475
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,740
Yang Ho-beom?

476
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:39,121
Yang Ho-beom was there?

477
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:41,290
Can you believe that?

478
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:44,877
I wonder what the coach told him.

479
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,422
"Coach"? Who do you mean? My father?

480
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,219
I mean, you didn't hear that.

481
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,595
Hey.

482
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,097
Maybe I should tell you.

483
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:00,392
Mr. Lee went to see Ho-beom.

484
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,854
I told him
it was that jerk who hurt your leg.

485
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,981
-Why did you--
-Why else?

486
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,900
I knew you didn't tell him.

487
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:12,029
He's responsible, after all.

488
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,866
Mr. Lee did apologize to me, though.

489
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:19,245
I used to hate him,

490
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:23,165
but it did make me feel better
when he apologized to me.

491
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:30,589
-Se-jong.
-Forget it. Don't say anything more.

492
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,925
You're treating me.

493
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:10,796
Hello.

494
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,677
Are you here to see Mr. Sim?

495
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,637
He's practicing at the ballet company.

496
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,350
I came to thank you.

497
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,980
We found him thanks to you.

498
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,024
Don't mention it.

499
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,069
Also…

500
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,661
I'll watch over him.

501
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:46,790
Yes.

502
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:48,959
Thank you.

503
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,798
How are you doing, Mr. Sim?

504
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:56,800
Well…

505
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,305
With so many other dancers around
here at the ballet company,

506
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,891
I'm a bit nervous, to be honest.

507
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:06,727
You'll get used to it soon.

508
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,938
By the way, are there any pieces
you'd like to do?

509
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:16,487
I'd like to do Swan Lake.

510
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,740
It's my favorite.

511
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,242
Would you like to do a solo?

512
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:27,998
I'm afraid I'm not good enough
to dance with someone else

513
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:30,084
on stage.

514
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:34,088
Let's give it some more thought.

515
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,131
Sure. Thank you.

516
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,598
He wants to do a solo?

517
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,018
Yes. Do you think he can pull it off?

518
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,896
I think he can, considering
how well he did at the audition.

519
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,564
But something feels…

520
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:56,527
I know. I've only seen him
dance with Chae-rok, so…

521
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:01,532
There you go.

522
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,452
Exactly.

523
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:15,629
Watching Chae-rok and Mr. Sim,
I learned something new.

524
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:20,217
How two people can have each other's back.

525
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,053
I was never able to do that.

526
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,889
I always put myself first.

527
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,851
When I got injured and had to retire,

528
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,563
I was concerned about no one but myself.

529
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,774
Not even you.

530
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,904
I thought it had nothing to do with you
so you'd be fine.

531
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,240
But I was wrong.

532
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,701
It was hard for you as well.

533
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:50,080
Now I know

534
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:53,542
that I couldn't have done any of it alone.

535
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:57,921
So I'd like to thank you

536
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,591
for sticking with me.

537
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:04,887
You've come a long way.

538
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:08,474
I have.

539
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,276
What is this about?

540
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,153
What is it you want to tell us?

541
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:26,492
-Why don't you do a duet with Mr. Sim?
-What?

542
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,746
Mr. Ki, what are you talking about?

543
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:34,541
I think it'd be better
if you do a duet with Chae-rok

544
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,669
than a solo performance.

545
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,547
Luckily, Chae-rok's competition
is after the show.

546
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:44,426
-Sounds good to me.
-I'm against it.

547
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,387
It'll distract Chae-rok
from his competition.

548
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,307
I'm grateful that he's been teaching me
all this time.

549
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:53,393
I don't want to put
any more burden on him.

550
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,103
-I can do it alone.
-No, Mr. Sim--

551
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,523
It's not that I don't think
you can pull off a solo.

552
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,234
As a coach,

553
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:03,153
I thought about what kind of dance
would suit you best

554
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:06,573
and who would be able to help you
dance in your own way.

555
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,451
And I've come to this conclusion.

556
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:13,413
You've worked hard with Chae-rok
for the past year.

557
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:16,708
I'd like for you to show that on stage.

558
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:21,713
That's the ballet you've been doing.

559
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:27,553
Let's do it, Mr. Sim.

560
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:31,181
You don't have to do this for me.

561
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,184
-I'm doing this for myself.
-Still…

562
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,353
Just dance with me.

563
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:41,525
All right.

564
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,486
Let's do it.

565
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,412
And then you move past him.

566
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:16,602
Mr. Sim, you'll do the same thing
but on the other side.

567
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:18,478
And then…

568
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,106
One, two, Arabesque.

569
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:26,069
LUNAR NEW YEAR'S DAY

570
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:46,298
And take his hand.

571
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:35,055
-Hello?
-Hello, sir.

572
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,723
I'm calling from the nursing home.

573
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,100
Yes, hello.

574
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:40,060
Have you made up your mind yet?

575
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:42,896
Would you like to be admitted?

576
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:44,981
No.

577
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:47,150
I don't think it's time yet.

578
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:50,070
There's something I must do first.

579
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,581
BALLET GALA, NAVILLERA

580
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,793
This looks amazing.

581
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,339
-Take mine, too.
-What?

582
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,091
Invite your whole family.

583
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,847
Keep it, Chae-rok.

584
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,641
I don't need it.

585
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,309
You sure do.

586
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:38,660
You should've passed the ball.

587
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,852
What brings you all the way here?

588
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:19,159
I'm doing a show.

589
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,704
What about the competition?

590
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,498
It's after the show.

591
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:25,957
I see.

592
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:31,087
BALLET GALA, NAVILLERA

593
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:33,089
You can come if you want.

594
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,343
But don't bother if you're busy.

595
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:44,518
Please do come.

596
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:50,857
All right.

597
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,320
-I'll get going.
-Already?

598
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:56,988
Hold on a second.

599
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:06,498
I heard it costs a lot
preparing for competitions.

600
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:11,044
If only your mom was here to help you.

601
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:16,842
She would've been very happy.

602
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,979
I'm sorry, Chae-rok,

603
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:30,564
for not being there for you

604
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:33,358
all these years.

605
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:38,029
-I--
-Be there for me from now on.

606
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:46,288
Okay. I will.

607
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,542
I promise.

608
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:57,924
I appreciate it.

609
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:08,393
These are invitations.

610
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:11,104
-What's this?
-Oh, my.

611
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:13,648
"Navillera." Like a butterfly?

612
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,110
BALLET GALA, NAVILLERA

613
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:24,618
Excuse me.

614
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:29,080
BALLET GALA, NAVILLERA

615
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:33,835
Honey.

616

BALLET GALA, NAVILLERA

617
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:45,013
Don't worry. He'll do well.

618
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,186
BALLET GALA, NAVILLERA

619
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,782
BALLET GALA, NAVILLERA

620
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,703
So, he didn't give up.

621
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,873
Left arm up. Shoulders down.

622
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,708
Turn your body a little.

623
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,251
Raise your left arm higher.

624
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:18,129
Eyes straight ahead.

625
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:20,966
Let's take a break.

626
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,020
The show's tomorrow, Mr. Sim.

627
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,357
I've come this far thanks to you.

628
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:40,777
I've come this far thanks to you as well.

629
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:43,571
I didn't do anything.

630
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:51,538
Chae-rok.

631
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,167
I've struggled the whole time,

632
00:54:57,252 --> 00:55:00,588
and I will tomorrow as well.

633
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:04,926
I'll still do my best,

634
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:08,888
but no one can deny that I fall short.

635
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,476
Mr. Sim.

636
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,439
Just focus on what you've been
practicing with me.

637
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:19,607
Then, you can do it.

638
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:22,777
Okay.

639
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:48,011
CHAE-ROK: CAN WE MEET?

640
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:49,596
What's this?

641
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:52,474
Take it.

642
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:57,020
It's from my father.

643
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:00,482
I heard you did a tryout.

644
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,819
It's none of your business.

645
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,159
I hope you do well.

646
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:15,955
See you around, Ho-beom.

00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,580
Stop the car for a second.

651
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:12,048
Sir, where do you live?

652
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:15,385
Where do I live?

653
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:18,054
Yes. Do you remember your address?

654
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:21,975
What's going on?

655
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:26,938
What are these officers doing here?

656
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:28,648
Hello, ma'am.

657
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,402
Goodness. Deok-chul.

658
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:36,489
What are you doing here?
Why are the officers here?

659
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:39,534
I can't find my way home.

660
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:43,538
This is where I live.

661
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:48,376
Sir, are you okay now?

662
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:53,214
Do you recognize me?

663
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:56,634
Of course, I do. You're Hae-nam.

664
00:59:57,802 --> 01:00:01,180
You must've been surprised.
It's cold. Please take him inside.

665
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:03,391
Thank you, officers. Let's go inside.

666
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:05,768
-Good night.
-Bye.

667
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:17,905
I couldn't bring myself to tell you.

668
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:21,117
I know I should have.

669
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:24,996
But I didn't know how to break it to you.

670
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:29,709
I'm…

671
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:32,795
a little unwell, Hae-nam.

672
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:39,636
Soon…

673
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:43,765
it'll get even worse.

674
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:51,814
I'm sorry.

675
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:55,360
I'm sorry, Hae-nam.

676
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:03,409
It's okay.

677
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:30,269
PERFORMANCE

678
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,739
Is he still asleep?

679
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,866
Deok-chul, wake up.

680
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:46,077
It's your show today.

681
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,001
Deok-chul.

682
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:55,420
Yes?

683
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:01,968
Goodness. Wake up.

684
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:07,932
Who are you?

685
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:13,855
Who are you?

686
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:58,107
Honey, do you remember
what you used to do?

687
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:00,818
I used to do ballet here.

688
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:04,405
But I don't know how I did it.

689
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:05,656
My heart breaks for him too.

690
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:08,576
But how will he perform
when he can't even remember?

691
01:03:08,659 --> 01:03:10,578
I ruined everything.

692
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:14,540
I've put a spell on these,
so don't worry about a thing.

693
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,417
Mr. Sim.

694
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:18,336
Lee Chae-rok. My ballet instructor.

695
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:21,380
You can do it, Mr. Sim.

696
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:26,385
