1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I was having sprain just now.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I was...

22
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,200
Get out.

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,560
Let him go!

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,280
Let him go!

25
00:00:59,360 --> 00:00:59,480
Zhaixiu.

26
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,440
Let him go!

27
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,120
Let him go.

28
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,200
Let Mr. Zhaixiu go!

29
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,400
Zhaixiu!

30
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,620
Go get the Josua Take his� the chair!

31
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,160
Shot him!

32
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:06,860
Get the chair!

33
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,760
Get the chair!

34
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,460
Get out!

35
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,000
WWEI!

36
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,000
Zhaixiu!

37
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,200
Get him out!

38
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,340
Get out.

39
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,540
Get him from here right here.

40
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,800
Let Cor軍 go!

41
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,760
Zhaixiu.

42
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,760
Don't go over there.

43
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,760
You can talk to me if you have something.

44
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,760
What nonsense are you talking about?

45
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,760
You fat man.

46
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,760
Sagao.

47
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,760
Sagao.

48
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,760
It's okay.

49
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
It's great.

50
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,760
Sagao.

51
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,760
Okay, okay.

52
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,760
Don't worry.

53
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,760
My old man

54
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,760
is not that easy to die.

55
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,760
It's great, Sagao.

56
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,760
It's okay, Sagao.

57
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,760
It's great.

58
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,760
It's great.

59
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,760
What are you looking for?

60
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,760
Sagao.

61
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,760
What are you looking for?

62
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,760
A fat man.

63
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,760
No.

64
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,760
Have you seen my old man?

65
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,760
Sagao.

66
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,760
Are you feeling better now?

67
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,760
He's closing his eyes again.

68
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,760
He has to die.

69
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,760
He's dead again.

70
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,760
Look, look, look.

71
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,760
Look.

72
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,760
Sagao.

73
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,760
Listen to me.

74
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,760
Go out and rest.

75
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,760
This place

76
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,760
is so bad.

77
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,760
I'm afraid you can't bear it.

78
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,760
What did he say?

79
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,760
Wu Xian.

80
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,760
Yes.

81
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,760
Sagao.

82
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,760
Why are you here?

83
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,760
It's normal.

84
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,760
Don't talk.

85
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,760
Don't talk.

86
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,760
Go out.

87
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,760
Where did the others go?

88
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,760
Go.

89
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,760
I'll leave him to you.

90
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,760
Go.

91
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,760
Go.

92
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,760
I'll leave him to you.

93
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,760
I'll leave first.

94
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,760
Let's wait for Uncle San.

95
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,760
You've left us a signal.

96
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,760
He should leave first.

97
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,760
Safe.

98
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,760
Follow me.

99
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,760
Sagao.

100
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,760
Be careful.

101
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,760
Sagao.

102
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,760
Sagao.

103
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,760
Sagao.

104
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,760
It's not like

105
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,760
this is a secret tunnel for the craftsmen.

106
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,760
Why is it so hard to find?

107
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,760
Can we still walk through it?

108
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,760
This tunnel must have

109
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,760
been used by the natural

110
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,760
fire mountain lava.

111
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,760
This kind of fire mountain lava

112
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,760
is very common in the

113
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,760
lower part of the fire mountain.

114
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,760
It's four-fold.

115
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,760
It can reach

116
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,760
thousands of kilometers.

117
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,760
It's like a spider web.

118
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,760
It's hidden underground.

119
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,760
I think this is the way

120
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,760
to get out of here.

121
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,760
I think it's a good idea.

122
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,760
I think it's a good idea.

123
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,760
I think it's a good idea.

124
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,760
I think it's a good idea.

125
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,760
I think it's a good idea.

126
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,760
I think it's a good idea.

127
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,760
I think it's a good idea.

128
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,760
I think it's a good idea.

129
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,760
I think this tunnel

130
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,760
must be able to get through

131
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,760
the Three Holy Mountains all the way.

132
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,760
Only those craftsmen

133
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,760
can get through the Three Holy Mountains

134
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,760
all the way here.

135
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,760
Then the more you go down,

136
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,760
the more narrow it is.

137
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,760
I think you're

138
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,760
strong enough.

139
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
This kind of underground structure

140
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,760
is usually in a number of branches.

141
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,760
It can reach

142
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,760
greater gaps

143
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,760
if it's not far ahead.

144
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,760
This is called the underground corridor

145
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,760
in the lower part of the earth.

146
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,760
This kind of underground corridor

147
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,760
is very large.

148
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,760
Some of it can even

149
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,760
create its own ecosystem system.

150
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,760
So I think

151
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,760
it will definitely

152
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,760
reach greater gaps

153
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
if it's not far ahead.

154
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,760
Because this kind of underground structure

155
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,760
is usually

156
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,760
from the inside.

157
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,760
Then if it's

158
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,760
getting narrower and narrower,

159
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,760
I'll be stuck inside

160
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,760
and die.

161
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,760
The people inside

162
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,760
haven't returned yet.

163
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,760
What are you afraid of?

164
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,760
Let's go.

165
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,760
You're right.

166
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,760
Fatty, are you okay?

167
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,760
Fatty, be careful.

168
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,760
I told you

169
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,760
to go back to the mountain.

170
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,760
It's our fault.

171
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,760
We're in trouble again.

172
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,760
Okay, okay.

173
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,760
Your feet are too big.

174
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,760
Just a half is enough.

175
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,760
Water?

176
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,760
Hot spring?

177
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,760
Hot spring?

178
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,760
Hot spring?

179
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,760
Hot spring?

180
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,760
Hot spring?

181
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,760
Hot spring?

182
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,760
Hot spring?

183
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,760
Hot spring?

184
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,760
Hot spring?

185
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,760
Hot spring?

186
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,760
Hot spring?

187
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,760
Hot spring?

188
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,760
There should be

189
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,760
underground waterfalls around here.

190
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,760
Get up.

191
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,760
Relax.

192
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,760
Let's go.

193
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,760
No.

194
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,760
Oh, my.

195
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,760
We're in the bed.

196
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,760
I'm so hungry.

197
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,760
The animals on the mountain

198
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,760
are usually concentrated

199
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,760
in the hot spring.

200
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,760
So, if you don't want to see the hot spring,

201
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,760
you can go down to the study room.

202
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,760
Some hot springs

203
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,760
are even yellow.

204
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
But the temperature is still low.

205
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,760
They're all in the middle of the night.

206
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,760
They're not very strong.

207
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,760
They won't wake up.

208
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,760
Let's hurry and go.

209
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,760
It'll be fine after a while.

210
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,760
Yes, yes, yes.

211
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,760
Wait.

212
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,760
What's the strong

213
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,760
and strong spirit?

214
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,760
Don't talk.

215
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,760
The classrooms.

216
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,760
Maybe they're there.

217
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,760
Are you serious?

218
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,760
Therill, therill

219
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,760
Power off.

220
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,760
The ln кан children

221
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,760
are here.

222
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,760
We need to erode.

223
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,760
Got it.

224
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,760
These branches

225
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,760
are in the right places.

226
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,760
To heck with them.

227
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,760
Oh, we need one.

228
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,980
Chuan Zi.

229
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,020
Chuan Zi!

230
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,460
You have to gather the maximize to make a head ofast in my National Dragon Lake!

231
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,560
Ma Yan.

232
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,440
Father.

233
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,940
Thank you.

234
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,740
Thank you for the recognition, Father.

235
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,680
Teams coming before slower than usual.

236
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,720
Here's my stuff.

237
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,620
How did you find him?

238
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,740
Our new union.

239
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,220
Help!

240
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:41,880
Boss,

241
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,440
Boss cut me off for the hamps high.

242
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,640
But I won't kill myself!

243
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,440
Hang in there...

244
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,400
Hold on!

245
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,820
Get your gun.

246
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,320
Get out.

247
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,420
Move toward me!

248
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,320
Listen...

249
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,780
You didn't see till the night before...

250
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,700
O.F.

251
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,260
Fatty.

252
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,260
Okay.

253
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,260
Don't be so scared.

254
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,260
There's a little boy here.

255
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,260
He's fine even if he's changed.

256
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,260
And just like him,

257
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,260
if he wants to go out,

258
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,260
he won't be able to take it.

259
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,260
You know that?

260
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,260
Little boy,

261
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,260
is there anyone else who's more likely to come in than us?

262
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,260
The three of them.

263
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,260
And An Ning.

264
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,260
The two of them.

265
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,260
The speed is really fast.

266
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,260
The problem is,

267
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,260
are they following us in?

268
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,260
What's going on?

269
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,260
I knew that Lang Feng was secretly sending news.

270
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,260
But I didn't tell him.

271
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,260
So I didn't tell him.

272
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,260
Then...

273
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,260
Then I knew that

274
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,260
he told all the news

275
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,260
about our location to Jiansan.

276
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,260
He killed Lang Feng?

277
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,260
The three of them.

278
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,260
Hey,

279
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,260
what do you mean?

280
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,260
Did I actually do that?

281
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,260
You really don't know your uncle.

282
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,260
Do you know why he called you the three of them?

283
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,260
You think he's

284
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,260
because he's the son of the dog master.

285
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,260
He's a man of the word.

286
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,260
Back then,

287
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,260
Zhang Da He,

288
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,260
the second-largest snow crab,

289
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,260
and the top three of them were so dangerous.

290
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,260
But after they passed away,

291
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,260
what kind of fate did they have?

292
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,260
Except for your uncle,

293
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,260
there's no one else.

294
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,260
Even if they were out of the world,

295
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,260
why?

296
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,260
It's because of his means.

297
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,260
But you think that

298
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,260
when you came out,

299
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,260
everyone was so angry with you.

300
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,260
Why did you want to do that?

301
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,260
Because I'm a high-ranking man.

302
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,260
I know how to speak.

303
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,260
I can't wait.

304
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,260
I think my uncle

305
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,260
is getting worse and worse

306
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,260
than my former uncle.

307
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,260
What are you talking about?

308
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,260
Your uncle is not like your uncle.

309
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,260
He can be your second-largest snow crab.

310
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,260
You have a big one.

311
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,260
This eight is bigger than my memory.

312
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,260
You little b****,

313
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,260
you know how to lie.

314
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,260
Go to sleep.

315
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,260
Go to sleep.

316
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,260
Master Hua,

317
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,260
this is the document

318
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,260
they just sent to the base.

319
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,260
And now there's a group of documents.

320
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,260
The biggest one is on the way.

321
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,260
It's a line of the Huo family.

322
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,260
Looks like this time,

323
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,260
we're going to get a tiger.

324
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,260
It's all true.

325
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,260
Thank you.

326
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,260
Master Hua,

327
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,260
they've been controlled.

328
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,260
You send someone to find it.

329
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,260
You must find their hiding place.

330
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,260
I can't let it be.

331
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,260
Xiu Xiu,

332
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,260
I'll take care of Brother Yi Rongcheng later.

333
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,260
Don't come out.

334
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,260
Don't let the buyer see you.

335
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,260
Then don't move

336
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,260
anything that happened.

337
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,260
I'll come out when they leave.

338
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,260
I know.

339
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,260
Xiu Xiu,

340
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,260
I didn't bring you here.

341
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,260
I didn't bring you here.

342
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,260
It's because you're a man.

343
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,260
You were too much.

344
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,260
Besides,

345
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,260
it's so dangerous.

346
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,260
How could I let you go?

347
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,260
Xiao Huan,

348
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,260
I shouldn't have been so patient

349
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,260
to let you take me with you.

350
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,260
Don't be so hasty.

351
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,260
I know you're here because of Grandma Huo.

352
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,260
And

353
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,260
even if you don't tell me,

354
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,260
I'll take you with me.

355
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,260
Master Hua,

356
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,260
time is up.

357
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,260
How about this?

358
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,260
After this thing is over,

359
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,260
I'll take you to Sanmen City.

360
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,260
Let's go.

361
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,260
Master Hua.

362
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,260
The customer is here.

363
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,260
They're here.

364
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,260
Master Hua.

365
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,260
The customer is here.

366
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,260
They're here.

367
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,260
They're here.

368
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,260
Master Hua.

369
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,260
Your Yi Rong technique

370
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,260
is getting more and more familiar.

371
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,260
Master Hua.

372
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,260
Master Hua.

373
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,260
Master Hua.

374
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,260
Master Hua.

375
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,260
Hey.

376
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,260
Where are you going?

377
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,260
To meet my friend.

378
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,260
Hurry back when you're back.

379
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,260
We have to pass the swimming pool

380
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,260
before the day is over.

381
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,260
I see.

382
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,260
Sanye,

383
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,260
the street is too secret.

384
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,260
If you didn't follow your signals,

385
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,260
you wouldn't be able

386
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,260
to find Xiao Jian's head.

387
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,260
We're on the same team.

388
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,260
You...

389
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,260
What?

390
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,260
No, this...

391
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,260
This is the wooden house toilet.

392
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,260
They're all mentioned here.

393
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,260
Hurry.

394
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,260
What?

395
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,260
Why are you here?

396
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,260
What are you doing here?

397
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,260
It's a two-story building

398
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,460
Why are you here?

399
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,660
How do you know that San Chu is here?

400
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,380
I don't know.

401
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,980
Why is he...

402
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,260
Enough. Stop it.

403
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,100
Go back first.

404
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,500
We can talk.

405
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,140
Why are you still running?

406
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,820
Well...

407
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,140
It's good that you're here.

408
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,260
You asked him to bring me here?

409
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,460
He even graduated from your school?

410
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,020
You two are very good at it.

411
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,100
He graduated from your school?

412
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,420
Is it his second?

413
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,500
I know it's his second.

414
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:53,060
San Chu is suspicious of some people and things.

415
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,900
I asked Fatty to ask him.

416
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,820
San Chu, you're serious.

417
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,220
Why are you here?

418
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,420
Fatty and I are on the street.

419
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,340
We can't go there, right?

420
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,460
Well, San Chu,

421
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,660
we've made it clear here.

422
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,180
How dare you!

423
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,060
What's this?

424
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,180
You're a guest.

425
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,140
Go back now.

426
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,340
Don't let anyone suspect you.

427
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,780
San Chu,

428
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,220
why did you take all of us down?

429
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,300
Because of some things,

430
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,780
you're a strong man.

431
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,060
You know what I mean?

432
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,420
What's in the Clouds and Sky Palace?

433
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,660
The Jiu Long Taishi Temple in Wan Nu.

434
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,740
What's the relationship between Wan Nu and Wang Zang Hai?

435
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,700
Good friends.

436
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,700
You...

437
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,380
Don't be so serious.

438
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,020
It's the emperor who asked you to go to the water room.

439
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,860
You can't change the tomb yourself.

440
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,100
It's not a big deal.

441
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,100
You...

442
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,820
Did the snake and the snake go to Wang Zang Hai?

443
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,820
You have to go to Wang Zang Hai.

444
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,300
Wang Zang Hai left so many clues in the graves of all the places.

445
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,700
What exactly does he want to say?

446
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,820
You're so stupid.

447
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,940
How would I know?

448
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,260
You won't tell me.

449
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,020
It's low.

450
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,860
My nephew,

451
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,660
you must not be so timid in the future.

452
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,060
In this kind of environment,

453
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,740
low-down means suicide.

454
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,380
You have fat and small arms.

455
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,780
By the way,

456
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,580
I'm relieved that you have a blanket to protect you.

457
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:39,420
What's the point of you keeping the blanket in our hands?

458
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,060
Uncle San has so many orders for you.

459
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,780
Go back.

460
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,260
Let's go to the Clouds and Sky Palace.

461
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,940
You're not my uncle!

462
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,780
What's wrong with you?

463
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,460
I don't have time to see you.

464
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,460
Go back.

465
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,860
Clouds and Sky Palace.

466
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:05,020
My uncle's father has long been sick.

467
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,540
Don't say that he can't even touch it.

468
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,060
He can't even look at it.

469
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,780
What's wrong with you?

470
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,260
You brat.

471
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,420
Put down your gun.

472
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,020
Tell me where the gun is.

473
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,060
Don't care.

474
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,060
Tell me what's wrong with my uncle.

475
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,260
Just give me a life.

476
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,380
You'll suspect me.

477
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,580
All right.

478
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,180
You're my uncle.

479
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,060
You have so many scars on your body.

480
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,060
I'll tell you.

481
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,060
I'll tell you.

482
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,060
No.

483
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,060
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

484
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,060
Who are you?

485
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,060
Who are you?

486
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,060
You're lying to me.

487
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,060
Who are you?

488
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,060
All right.

489
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,060
You said I'm not your uncle.

490
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:10,060
Then tell me who I am.

491
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,060
Who are you?

492
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:22,060
You are Xie Lian Huan.

493
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:33,060
In fact, you were not dead in the bottom of the sea.

494
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,060
The body of the archaeological team was not you.

495
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,060
It was the people who attacked you.

496
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,060
The eight-night attack you had on your head

497
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,060
was the one who attacked him, right?

498
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,060
No.

499
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,060
When you came up from the bottom of the sea,

500
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,060
you found that the archaeological team was all missing.

501
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,060
Everyone thought you were dead.

502
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,060
You just hid your identity and investigated it secretly.

503
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,060
You wanted to revenge, right?

504
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,060
No.

505
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,060
You and my uncle are so alike.

506
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,060
And you know him so well.

507
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,060
So you later used my uncle's identity

508
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,060
to investigate the death of the body of the man.

509
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,060
But no one found you.

510
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,060
You used uncle's body, right?

511
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,060
No.

512
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,060
No.

513
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,060
In fact,

514
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,060
when I came to the mountain,

515
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,060
you contacted Fatty.

516
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,060
When we were about to leave the train station,

517
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:18,060
Fatty was always fighting with an old lady.

518
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,060
She was trying to drag me out of the train station

519
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,060
to get the police to track us down.

520
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:25,060
Because you told the police what I was doing, right?

521
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,060
Kid,

522
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,060
in this world,

523
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,060
only one person can't hurt you.

524
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,060
That is me, your uncle.

525
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,060
Uncle.

526
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,060
Think about it carefully.

527
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,060
From a young age,

528
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,060
who is the most sincere,

529
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,060
who loves you the most?

530
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,060
It's me, your uncle.

531
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,060
Until today,

532
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,060
I will teach you

533
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,060
the skills you have.

534
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,060
I will teach you the skills you have.

535
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,060
You are now grown up,

536
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,060
and you are afraid of the dark.

537
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,060
You suspect your uncle.

538
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,060
I am brokenhearted.

539
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,060
Stop.

540
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,060
Come back.

541
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,060
I will shoot you if you leave.

542
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:36,060
I will shoot you if you leave.

543
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,060
I will shoot you if you leave.

544
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,060
You are done shooting?

545
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,060
I have been waiting for you for a long time.

546
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,060
I am telling you,

547
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,060
your uncle is really nice to you.

548
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,060
Even if he doesn't tell you the truth,

549
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,060
he will protect you,

550
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,060
you know that or not.

551
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,060
I...

552
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,060
He didn't let me do something that sorry you.

553
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,060
He just let me...

554
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,060
He just let me earn some money.

555
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,060
Earn some money?

556
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,060
Yes, he knows that

557
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,060
I haven't opened a business in a long time.

558
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,060
What are you two doing?

559
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,060
Is there a communication device?

560
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,060
We...

561
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,060
Look at this.

562
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,060
Look at this.

563
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,060
Look at this communication device.

564
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,060
This communication device...

565
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:02,060
I can't see that you are still a double-edged sword.

566
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,060
What?

567
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,060
Look at this.

568
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,060
What's wrong?

569
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,060
This is a foot.

570
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,060
This is nothing.

571
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,060
This is a...

572
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,060
a steel-made souvenir.

573
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,060
Right?

574
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,060
I bought it online.

575
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,060
You are not like this.

576
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,060
I know you are a Dong Bing fan.

577
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,060
Don't try to kill me

578
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,060
with a steel-made sword.

579
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,060
Just take this.

580
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,060
I will kill you now.

581
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,060
Do you believe me?

582
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,060
This is nothing.

583
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:30,060
I will use this communication device with Uncle San.

584
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,060
Look,

585
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,060
it's bright when you turn it on.

586
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,060
It's just a gold coin.

587
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,060
Just a gold coin?

588
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,060
Give it to me.

589
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,060
Give it to me.

590
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,060
Hey.

591
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,060
Hey.

592
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,060
Sir,

593
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,060
we were able to send uncle from Macau.

594
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,060
Someone saw Hu Xiu Xiu as a part.

595
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:21,060
The granddaughter of the Hu family?

596
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,060
We found that Hu Xiu Xiu left Beijing

597
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,060
to Chang Sha for Xie Yuchun

598
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,060
and spent lots of few days together.

599
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:30,060
I suspect they have something to do in Macau.

600
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,060
Xie Yuchun, Hu Xiu Xiu.

601
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:38,060
I suppose the Hu family has already got information.

602
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:41,060
We will have to test their sincerity.

603
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,060
I know.

604
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,060
You can go now.

605
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,060
Do you want to go to Mr. Qiu?

606
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,060
No need.

607
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,060
This is urgent.

608
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,060
We don't need to hurry.

609
00:30:56,060 --> 00:31:00,060
Tell them to withdraw from Macau.

610
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,060
They don't need to find Xie Zeying.

611
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,060
You didn't tell me the truth.

612
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,060
Sir,

613
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,060
you suddenly make me feel better.

614
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,060
I will go back to Mr. Zhang and see.

615
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,060
This is a certain reason.

616
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,060
I know who you are in contact with.

617
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,060
I don't have any interest in this.

618
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,060
But,

619
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,060
if you want to hurt Wu Xie,

620
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,060
you should know me as a person.

621
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,060
Pampers.

622
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,060
You were more than I used to be.

623
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,060
Look at your feet.

624
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,060
Mr. Zhang,

625
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,060
hurry up.

626
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,060
I will wait for you outside.

627
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,060
Okay.

628
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,060
You are so fast.

629
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,060
I have told you everything.

630
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,060
Si Ha has left.

631
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,060
You don't know what to do.

632
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,060
I will go back to the office.

633
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,060
I will go back to the office.

634
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,060
I will go back to the office.

635
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,060
I will go back to the office.

636
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,060
I will go back to the office.

637
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,060
I will go back to the office.

638
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,060
I will go back to the office.

639
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,060
I will go back to the office.

640
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,060
I will go back to the office.

641
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,060
I will go back to the office.

642
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,060
I will go back to the office.

643
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,060
I will go back to the office.

644
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,060
I will go back to the office.

645
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,060
I will go back to the office.

646
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,060
I will go back to the office.

647
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,060
Si Ha.

648
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,060
Si Ha.

649
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,060
Look.

650
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,060
Mr. Zhang.

651
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,060
Look.

652
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,060
So beautiful.

653
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,060
Fire Mountain.

654
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,060
This is Fire Mountain.

655
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,060
Look.

656
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,060
Look there.

657
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,060
Wait.

658
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,060
The people are so busy.

659
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,060
So, the Cloud Sky Palace is at the Fire Mountain.

660
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:04,060
This is the place where

661
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:07,060
the Emperor of the Qing Dynasty lives.

662
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,060
So cool.

663
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,060
Hurry up.

664
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,060
Keep all the useless things.

665
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,060
Prepare the rope and make it easy to hurt.

666
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,060
Fire Mountain.

667
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,060
Fire Mountain.

668
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,060
Fire Mountain.

669
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,060
Fire Mountain.

670
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,060
Fire Mountain.

671
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,060
Fire Mountain.

672
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,060
Fire Mountain.

673
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,060
What's that smell?

674
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,060
It stinks.

675
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,060
It's the smell of the fire.

676
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,060
It's the dead body.

677
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,060
The bird doesn't fly over.

678
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,060
Hurry up.

679
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,060
Or the dead body will die.

680
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,060
The dead body.

681
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,060
It's the smell of the cold-blooded gas

682
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:22,060
that will be sent out after the fire.

683
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,060
It's not working.

684
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,060
Let's go.

685
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,060
One, two, three.

686
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,060
Follow the god.

687
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,060
Let's go to the forest.

688
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,060
Wait.

689
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,060
Wait.

690
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,060
Wait.

691
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,060
The dead body is being carried to the forest.

692
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,060
No.

693
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,060
Let's go back first.

694
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,060
It's easier to do it in a higher temperature.

695
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,060
We have to go back to rest.

696
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,060
Let's go.

697
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,060
Go back.

698
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,060
Go.

699
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,060
Go.

700
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,060
There's another path.

701
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:27,060
We can't look at the cloud and sky.

702
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,060
If we don't go down, we can't go up.

703
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,060
Look at the view of the Fire Mountain.

704
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,060
If there's another way,

705
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,060
we can only go down from the mountain.

706
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,060
This is the best way.

707
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,060
We have to go down.

708
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,060
We can't go down.

709
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,060
Let's go.

710
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,060
We have to go down.

711
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,060
We have to go down.

712
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,060
We have to go down.

713
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,060
There's a Fire Mountain in the middle of the mountain.

714
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,060
The heavy structure around it

715
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,060
doesn't allow us to go down.

716
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:58,060
The god of cloud and sky

717
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,060
must be at the Fire Mountain.

718
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,060
There's no other way.

719
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:04,060
We can't go down.

720
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:08,060
Then we can't go down tonight.

721
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:11,060
Yahe, you're still in the mood.

722
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,060
You don't know what to do with the order.

723
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,060
Wait.

724
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,060
Are we going or not?

725
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,060
What are you doing?

726
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,060
Come out.

727
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,060
Come out.

728
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:19,060
Is it because of the poison that we have a champion?

729
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,060
You saw it too, right?

730
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,060
Come back.

731
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,060
It's very hot and humid here.

732
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,060
The poison in the cold is falling down.

733
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,060
The water in the air is freezing.

734
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,060
We can't go down.

735
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,060
We can go down now.

736
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,060
Why?

737
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,060
Why can we go down only at night?

738
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,060
Is it because of the trap set by the god of cloud?

739
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,060
No.

740
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:10,060
I think we have to go down.

741
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:12,060
I think it's just a way.

742
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,060
Why don't we go to the sky?

743
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,060
Okay, let's not talk about it.

744
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,060
Get ready. We're going now.

745
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,060
Let's go.

746
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,060
Get down.

747
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,060
Let's go.

748
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:18,060
Let's go.

749
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,060
Let's go.

750
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:19,060
Let's go.

751
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:48,060
Let's go.
