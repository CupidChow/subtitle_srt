1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,040
oh

3
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:09,040
An Ning! An Ning!

4
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:14,040
Wu Xie?

5
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,040
An Ning?

6
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,040
An Ning?

7
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,040
An Ning?

8
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,040
Why are you here?

9
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,040
Are you okay?

10
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,040
I'm fine.

11
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,040
It's not safe here. Let's go.

12
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,040
No!

13
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,040
It's not safe here. Let's go.

14
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,040
The window is quite solid.

15
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,040
I just don't know how long it can last.

16
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,040
There's no signal here.

17
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,040
I'm fine.

18
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,040
Grandpa Si, why don't we go back to sleep?

19
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,040
No rush.

20
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,040
Who would have thought that

21
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,040
the work I took on this time

22
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,040
would be so difficult.

23
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,040
If I had known this,

24
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,040
I wouldn't have come here

25
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,040
no matter what benefits he gave me.

26
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,040
You don't have to comfort me.

27
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,040
I don't know when I can leave this place.

28
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,040
Can you stop complaining?

29
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,040
Grandpa Si is also here waiting for us.

30
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:37,040
You don't have to comfort me either.

31
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,040
There's something strange in the forest.

32
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,040
Something that's been lost.

33
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,040
Many people have disappeared.

34
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
Where?

35
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,040
Didn't An Ning go out to look for you?

36
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,040
Didn't she come back with you?

37
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,040
I don't know.

38
00:04:49,040 --> 00:05:06,500
She must have been taken away by the

39
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,040
What?

40
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,040
What happened?

41
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
I'm old.

42
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,040
I'm not going to work anymore.

43
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,040
I should go back to my room.

44
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,040
I'll pray.

45
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,040
She doesn't seem to like bright things.

46
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,040
If my people come to me,

47
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,040
they can also be found in time.

48
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,040
You shouldn't have come.

49
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,040
I didn't come to save you.

50
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,040
I said you shouldn't have come to Changbai Mountain.

51
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,040
What do you mean?

52
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,040
This journey has just begun.

53
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,040
This is what happened.

54
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,040
Can you imagine what happens next?

55
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,040
The Cloud Sky Palace is not an ordinary place.

56
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,040
If it's not dangerous,

57
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,040
I don't think it's exciting enough.

58
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,040
I'm not going to be able to go back.

59
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,040
If it's not dangerous,

60
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,040
I don't think it's exciting enough.

61
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,040
Besides,

62
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,040
you're here too.

63
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,040
Do you have a little low blood sugar?

64
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,040
Have a chocolate supplement.

65
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,040
I'm sorry.

66
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,040
We might have to stay here until dawn.

67
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,040
You should rest.

68
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,040
I'll be the guard today.

69
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,040
I don't understand.

70
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,040
Wu Sanxing wanted to kill you.

71
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,040
Why are you still taking risks for him?

72
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,040
This has nothing to do with you, right?

73
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,040
You have your beliefs.

74
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,040
I have mine.

75
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,040
My third uncle was not like this before he cooperated with you.

76
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,040
I just wanted to see

77
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,040
what exactly made my third uncle like this now.

78
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,040
It's not too late to risk your life for the answer.

79
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,040
Someone told me

80
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,040
that it's not good to be too stubborn.

81
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,040
I'm sorry.

82
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,040
Wu Xie, it's me.

83
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,040
Xiao Ge.

84
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,040
Xiao Ge, are you all right?

85
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,040
How did you find us?

86
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,040
What happened outside?

87
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,040
There's a sudden gust of wind outside.

88
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,440
I found something, but I think I hurt it.

89
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,440
You hurt that thing?

90
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,840
How are you? Are you okay?

91
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,140
I was just about to go find you. Didn't I tell you not to go out?

92
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,440
Yes.

93
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,440
No, did you go save him?

94
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,640
No, are you okay?

95
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,440
I'm asking you, are you okay?

96
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,440
I'm okay.

97
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,640
Everyone has worked hard for the whole day. Go back and rest.

98
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,340
I'm okay.

99
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,340
It's good that you're okay.

100
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,840
Third Uncle, be careful.

101
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,440
You're so ungrateful.

102
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,440
I'm okay.

103
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,640
I'm okay.

104
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,640
Shun Zi, let's go too.

105
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,840
Get up. Go back and rest.

106
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,040
I'm worshiping the Goddess of Snow Mountain.

107
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,840
Everyone has broken the rules today.

108
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,040
I don't know how hard the road ahead will be.

109
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,840
It's been a long day. Go back and rest.

110
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,840
Okay.

111
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,640
Go back and rest.

112
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,040
Sir, Jason's company insisted to enter the mountain.

113
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,440
Now they're trapped. Both our teams have casualties.

114
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,240
We don't know what kind of mechanism or monster is present.

115
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,440
No phone signal either.

116
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,440
And everybody is panicked.

117
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,840
But Wu Xie is unharmed.

118
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,040
He's fine.

119
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,240
Your top priority is to protect Wu Xie.

120
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,840
Don't worry about other people.

121
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,040
I've got enough on my plate.

122
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,040
Wu Xie

123
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,640
My nephew,

124
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,840
how could this be fake?

125
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,040
This is real.

126
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,840
You must see it with your heart.

127
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,240
Third Uncle,

128
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,040
what's fake is fake.

129
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,440
It's not real.

130
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,840
You must see it with your heart.

131
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,240
With your heart.

132
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,640
You brat, it's me.

133
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,440
It's your Third Uncle. Come here.

134
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,240
Come down. I'm here.

135
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,440
Come here.

136
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,840
Min Zhen.

137
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,440
What?

138
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,640
Uncle is dead. It's terrible.

139
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,440
It's terrible.

140
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,440
Stop arguing. Go and see it yourself.

141
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,040
Jason's men died a lot. And it's very strange.

142
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,040
Why don't you go and see it yourself?

143
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,040
What are you joking about?

144
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,640
They're all panicked. They don't want to live.

145
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,040
Now there are so many people who are panicked.

146
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,240
They've come from the camp.

147
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,640
Who dares to go out?

148
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,040
Okay. We're going to see it anyway.

149
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,440
At least we should know what happened.

150
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,040
You two stay. I'll go.

151
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,240
Little Brother.

152
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,840
Let's go.

153
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,240
Let's go.

154
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,840
Why hasn't Little Brother come back yet?

155
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,240
What should we do? We can't see anything.

156
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,640
We can only go in and find him.

157
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,040
Third Uncle, I'm thinking of making more preparations.

158
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,040
We'll put them on one by one. Then we won't be afraid to lose them.

159
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,640
Okay. You'll be the first one to go and see the way.

160
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,840
Okay. You can go in. I'll tie you up with a rope.

161
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,440
How about I do it?

162
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,240
No.

163
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,440
Yes. It's tied up.

164
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,440
Did you call Wu Xie?

165
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,040
No.

166
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,840
Go.

167
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,840
Where is he?

168
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,040
Where is he?

169
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,240
Ye Cheng.

170
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,840
Ye Cheng.

171
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,840
Ye Cheng.

172
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,240
What's going on?

173
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,440
I attacked him and when I found him, he was already dead.

174
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,840
What's going on?

175
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,440
I don't believe it. I don't believe it.

176
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,240
I'm going to go.

177
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,440
Do you think Little Brother is a ghost?

178
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,440
He'll be our companion on our way.

179
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,040
If I have the time to worry about this, I'd rather worry about the monster that's harming people.

180
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,440
How many monsters have we encountered?

181
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,240
The most terrifying is the human heart.

182
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,440
It wasn't me. It wasn't me!

183
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,440
It wasn't me. It wasn't me!

184
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,840
It wasn't me.

185
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,640
No wonder it smells like meat.

186
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,040
But these people are dead. They don't have the luck to eat.

187
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,440
Ye Cheng

188
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,440
Ye Cheng, you should go back to your room.

189
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,440
Ye Cheng

190
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,440
Jason, I don't mean anything else.

191
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,440
I just want to remind you

192
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,040
to pay more attention to Mark.

193
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:55,040
Mark

194
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,240
What? You're even suspecting a mental patient?

195
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,040
That's not what I meant.

196
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,240
I just think he's avoiding Uncle Dashan's death.

197
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,040
But Uncle Dashan's death isn't his responsibility.

198
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,040
And the accident you had just now also provoked him.

199
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,840
He kept calling, it wasn't me, it wasn't me. Did you hear that?

200
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,640
Mark!

201
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:25,040
Mark

202
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,440
1563!

203
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,240
Yes!

204
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,840
1563 is here to report! Please give me instructions!

205
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,240
1563, I'm ordering you to tell me if you're related to Teng Dashan's death.

206
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,840
Report! The last time I saw Teng Dashan was when I went to the kitchen to look for food.

207
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,240
Teng Dashan kicked me out.

208
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,440
Later I heard the kitchen making a noise.

209
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,040
I thought Teng Dashan wouldn't allow me to enter the kitchen again, so I didn't go back to the room.

210
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,840
You don't know who the murderer is either?

211
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,240
I don't know.

212
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,440
But when I saw the food in the kitchen last night,

213
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,440
I knew that I killed him.

214
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,640
I didn't save him.

215
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,240
I didn't save him.

216
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,440
You saw it?

217
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,240
Let's go.

218
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,040
10 years later

219
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,440
Lin Zhen.

220
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,840
What are you doing here?

221
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,840
I buried Dashan under this tree.

222
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,040
Let him stay with his little tomb.

223
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,840
Why don't you go and take a look?

224
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,440
My disciple is buried under your hand.

225
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,240
What do you think?

226
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,040
You'll understand when you're my age.

227
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,040
But I don't think you'll live.

228
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,040
If it weren't for Fatty being hungry, you wouldn't have had this.

229
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,840
Come and eat.

230
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,240
Who saw Uncle Hai?

231
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,440
When I was buying Dashan's books, Uncle Hai said he was tired and went upstairs to rest.

232
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,840
He's not here. I looked for him.

233
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,840
10 years later

234
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,440
Maybe he's the murderer.

235
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,440
That's impossible. He's an old man. He's not that good.

236
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,840
You have something to say.

237
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,040
We've been together for a while. You know that, right?

238
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,640
That's so evil.

239
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,240
Stop arguing.

240
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,440
This is the punishment for the Goddess of Snow Mountain.

241
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,840
We have to take it.

242
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,840
10 years later

243
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,640
What are you thinking about?

244
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,840
Grandma, is that picture real?

245
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,240
It doesn't matter if it's real or not.

246
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:05,840
What's important is if the person who saw this picture is willing to take it as real.

247
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,240
I heard from Brother Wu Xie that the thing about the tomb of Hai

248
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,440
also had the image of Qiu De Kao.

249
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,440
If Qiu De Kao already got that picture,

250
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,840
it's been so many years, why didn't he reveal it?

251
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,840
Could it be that he kept taking that picture to threaten Auntie Wu San to do something to him?

252
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,640
That's possible.

253
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,240
Grandma, I want to go find Qiu De Kao.

254
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,640
What are you doing?

255
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,240
He knows so many secrets. Does he know where Auntie is?

256
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,040
This thing has been hidden for so many years.

257
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,640
He won't reveal your aunt's secret easily.

258
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,640
Unless he wants to work with us,

259
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,640
then there's still a chance.

260
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,240
Then I want to go to Changsha.

261
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,240
Are you doing this because of the picture?

262
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:58,040
No need. I've already asked someone to send it to Xie Zai.

263
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,240
What? You didn't even figure it out.

264
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,840
Why did you give the picture to Xiao Hua? What if he and Wu San...

265
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,240
So what?

266
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,440
Madam, thank you, Young Master.

267
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,240
Hello?

268
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,040
About the information, it's fine.

269
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,440
It's fine, but there's one thing.

270
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,440
You can't let Xiu Xiu go to Changbai Mountain.

271
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,840
Okay, that's it.

272
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,040
Okay.

273
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,440
I've already sent the location to you.

274
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,240
You know my conditions. But I still want to remind you.

275
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,440
Leave as soon as possible.

276
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,640
Wu San Xing has already left for a few days.

277
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,640
If you don't leave now,

278
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,440
then there's nothing left.

279
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,440
Can you take it from him?

280
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,440
It's not over yet.

281
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,240
Jia Sha.

282
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,440
Master Hua.

283
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,640
Get me the equipment as soon as possible.

284
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,440
We're going to go to Changbai Mountain at any time.

285
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,840
Fatty, if we continue to be locked up,

286
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,940
someone will be able to stop the

287
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,840
pre-emptive storm.

288
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,040
How do you know they're not pretending?

289
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,840
Only if they pretend like others,

290
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,840
they won't be suspected and put in danger.

291
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,840
Don't think like that. They're not necessarily bad people.

292
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,840
Then how did Uncle Da Shan die?

293
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,240
Let's go.

294
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,440
He's got the position of the Heavenly Palace.

295
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,040
What?

296
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,040
But this isn't a place that he can go to.

297
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,240
I don't think he can go far.

298
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,040
What? You want me to help you pack up?

299
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,840
Coming, Grandpa Sa.

300
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,040
Gu Qi, Grandpa Sa means that we're about to leave.

301
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,240
You guys pack up and we'll meet at the gate.

302
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,440
Go.

303
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,640
Qian Tian, Ah Ning is really a soul-saving person.

304
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,840
She likes you.

305
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,440
If you're bored, you can look at the map yourself.

306
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,440
Don't follow Grandpa Sa.

307
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,440
He's fine.

308
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,440
How did you know?

309
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,280
This side.

310
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:44,720
this

311
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,720
this

312
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,720
I'm so cold.

313
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,720
How is it?

314
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,720
I saw it.

315
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,720
It's a spring device.

316
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,720
It's been used for a long time.

317
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,720
And it seems to have been touched.

318
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,720
Do you think it belongs to us?

319
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,720
It's not too late to say.

320
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,720
Let's take a look.

321
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,720
Fatty, look.

322
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,720
What's wrong?

323
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,720
Over there.

324
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,720
What?

325
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,720
Let's take a look.

326
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,720
Hey, guys.

327
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,720
Guys.

328
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,720
Do you know what's the most annoying thing about going on the waterway?

329
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,720
What's annoying?

330
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,720
It's not listening to the guide and leaving the team.

331
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,720
No, that side...

332
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,720
There's a fox.

333
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,720
There's a fox.

334
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,720
Wu Xie, Chen Piaf started to suspect.

335
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,720
What does he suspect?

336
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,720
I don't know.

337
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,720
But he won't do it easily.

338
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,720
I can't follow you now.

339
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,720
Be careful.

340
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,720
Let's go.

341
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,720
No, An Ning.

342
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,720
What's wrong?

343
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,720
Let's go.

344
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,720
Tianzhen.

345
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,720
Where did An Ning go?

346
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,720
What did she do?

347
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,720
How do I know?

348
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,720
She didn't report to me about what she did.

349
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,720
What about Pan Zi?

350
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,720
She's been gone for a few days.

351
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,720
Did something happen to her?

352
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,720
She's always calm.

353
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,720
Don't worry.

354
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,720
Listen.

355
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,720
Si Da Gong is suspicious of everyone.

356
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,720
Don't mention it in front of him.

357
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,720
Don't worry.

358
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,720
But it's a tight time.

359
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,720
Pan Zi can't figure out all these things.

360
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,720
It's impossible.

361
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,720
She can't do so many things alone.

362
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,720
Don't think about it.

363
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,720
Have a good rest.

364
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,720
Shun Zi.

365
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,720
Can you let us have a fire here?

366
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,720
Fatty is hungry.

367
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,720
Brother Fang, hold on.

368
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,720
We must go through this forest today.

369
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,720
Why?

370
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,720
Because this forest is strange.

371
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,720
What's wrong?

372
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,720
Yes, Shun Zi.

373
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,720
Tell us what's going on.

374
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,720
This forest is in our fishing trap.

375
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,720
You mean someone has fished here?

376
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,720
I heard from my father.

377
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,720
I don't know when someone was fishing here.

378
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,720
It's been a few days since the last time.

379
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,720
Later, I went hunting in the mountains.

380
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,720
I saw a lot of dead people in the forest.

381
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,720
Some of them were hunting for the dead.

382
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,720
I didn't expect to be found the next day.

383
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,720
They were dead in the forest.

384
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,720
Is it that dangerous?
