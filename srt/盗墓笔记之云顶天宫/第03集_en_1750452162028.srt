1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

15
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,740
This is Dusk Finished

16
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:57,480
Episode

17
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,980
Must at least see that for yourself,

18
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:21,480
he wants to saveруж

19
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,480
I can't believe this

20
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,480
Why do you come to me

21
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:25,980
quality

22
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,980
Although I'm your father

23
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,780
I have to go to the dead.

24
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,380
You little bastard.

25
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,180
You can't say that.

26
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,780
Let go of the hand.

27
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,180
Do you know what this time is?

28
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,380
It's the place where Chen Pi-A-Si came from.

29
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,980
Young people, keep your eyes open.

30
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,580
That's a good thing.

31
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,580
I've told you everything.

32
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,980
I'll let that boy call you uncle.

33
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,180
You're talking nonsense.

34
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,780
I'm telling you, I don't have anything to hide from you.

35
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,580
I heard that you've been looking for Xie's family.

36
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,580
What are you doing?

37
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,580
It's just some news.

38
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,380
I heard that Xie's father

39
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,780
offended Chen Pi-A-Si.

40
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,680
These young people

41
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,980
are still young.

42
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,980
Chen Pi-A-Si

43
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,180
is a man who has been in the world.

44
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,380
He's the one who offended me.

45
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,180
Chen Pi-A-Si is gone.

46
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,780
But is Chen Pi-A-Si's son-in-law still here?

47
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,780
Get him. He's almost gone.

48
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,780
His son-in-law is a piece of shit.

49
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,780
San, you know what?

50
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,380
You've been in this Tao for so long.

51
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,180
But in this lifetime,

52
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,380
you're just living a face.

53
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,780
You know what?

54
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,980
Chen Pi-A-Si can't do anything about his face.

55
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,180
If he gets in the way,

56
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,180
if he gets in the way,

57
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,580
how can he get in the way?

58
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,180
Besides,

59
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,380
Chen Pi-A-Si and Xie Yuchen

60
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,180
are all from the old wine-growing family.

61
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,580
Sometimes, they're just two-leaf-red disciples.

62
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,780
But it's not good.

63
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,180
Chen Pi-A-Si

64
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,780
can really give Xie Yuchen a face.

65
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,980
I'm afraid that

66
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,980
the two-leaf-green family

67
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,180
can't afford to eat together.

68
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,580
If it's because of this,

69
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,980
what can he do to Xie Yuchen?

70
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,780
He can't even close the door.

71
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,380
Besides,

72
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,980
Chen Pi-A-Si doesn't know about it.

73
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,380
Don't make me do this.

74
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,380
You don't know about this at all.

75
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,380
What is this?

76
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,180
You can't hide anything from me?

77
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,180
Yes.

78
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,980
I heard that

79
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,980
something really happened to Xie family.

80
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,980
Xie Lian Huan's corpse was found.

81
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,780
How is that possible?

82
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,780
I just heard about it.

83
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,780
I don't know if it's true or not.

84
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,780
It's said that Xie Yuchen

85
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,780
is going to give him a funeral gift

86
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,780
and send this snake-mei-tong-yu out.

87
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,780
But it seems that

88
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,780
it's true.

89
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,780
I found out that you are really interesting.

90
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,780
You said that you didn't even put your own nephew's body in your heart.

91
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:15,780
How could you put this old Xie family's body in your heart?

92
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,780
I don't care about Xie family.

93
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,780
I only care about snake-mei-tong-yu.

94
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,780
This old Jis is living a hard life in the land.

95
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,780
Let's save him from the dead.

96
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,780
For them, it's a merit.

97
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,780
I don't know if I can save him.

98
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,780
I don't know if I can save him.

99
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,780
I don't know if I can save him.

100
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,780
I don't know if I can save him.

101
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,780
So, you said

102
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,780
you want them to give Kun Na Xu as a exchange.

103
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,780
I don't know if I can save him.

104
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,780
I don't know if I can save him.

105
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,780
I don't know if I can save him.

106
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,780
I don't know if I can save him.

107
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,780
I don't know if I can save him.

108
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,780
I don't know if I can save him.

109
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,780
I don't know if I can save him.

110
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,780
I don't know if I can save him.

111
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,780
I don't know if I can save him.

112
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,780
So many years.

113
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,780
Why haven't you changed?

114
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,780
Old Zhang, get up.

115
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,780
Old Jis.

116
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,780
Why haven't you changed?

117
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,780
Old Zhang, this is our friend.

118
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,780
Not your old Jis.

119
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,780
Did you have any misunderstanding?

120
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,780
I won't admit my mistake.

121
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,780
So many years.

122
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:26,780
Why haven't you changed?

123
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,780
Impossible.

124
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,780
Sit. Sit.

125
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,780
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:43,780
Your friend is too like our old leader.

127
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,780
I've been trapped in the underground palace for more than 40 years.

128
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,780
I've been missing the sun.

129
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,780
Everyone is crazy.

130
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,780
I don't know your identity.

131
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,780
I don't know what you're going to do next.

132
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,780
So I just have to stop you.

133
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,780
I don't want you to keep going.

134
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:09,780
You can't go to any place.

135
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,780
From the beginning,

136
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:17,780
you're an unparalleled enemy.

137
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:30,780
Our fortress is here.

138
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:35,780
The ancestral fortress is on the top of the mountain.

139
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:39,780
The fortress is to protect the mountain.

140
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,780
If the mountain is angry,

141
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,780
it will move the mountain.

142
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:51,780
The hardships in it will be put to the ground.

143
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,780
So we have to remember the mountain every year.

144
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:03,780
To pray for the mountain to protect us.

145
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,780
Go.

146
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,780
Go.

147
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,780
In the legend,

148
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:32,780
that tower was full of monsters.

149
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:39,780
The hardships in it will be put to the ground.

150
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,780
Be careful.

151
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,780
This person's appearance

152
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,780
brought a series of evil spirits.

153
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:56,780
I suspect that he is the monster

154
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,780
that is locked up in the tower.

155
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,780
Who are you?

156
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,780
I'm a teacher in Wuhan University.

157
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,780
I brought some students to the ancient tower in Guangxi

158
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,780
to collect some data.

159
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,780
But I didn't expect that there were many strange things.

160
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,780
Then I met the enemy.

161
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,780
I beg you to save my students.

162
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,780
Save my students.

163
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,780
Are you sure your students fell off the tower?

164
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,780
Yes.

165
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,780
Go.

166
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,780
Go.

167
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,780
The tower is closed.

168
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,780
The enemy is coming.

169
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,780
The enemy is coming.

170
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,780
The enemy is coming.

171
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,780
The enemy is coming.

172
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,780
The enemy is coming.

173
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,780
The enemy is coming.

174
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,780
The enemy is coming.

175
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,780
The enemy is coming.

176
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,780
The enemy is coming.

177
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,780
The enemy is coming.

178
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,780
The enemy is coming.

179
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,780
The enemy is coming.

180
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,780
The enemy is coming.

181
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,780
The enemy is coming.

182
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,780
The enemy is coming.

183
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,780
The enemy is coming.

184
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,780
The enemy is coming.

185
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,780
The enemy is coming.

186
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,780
The enemy is coming.

187
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,780
The enemy is coming.

188
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,780
The enemy is coming.

189
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,780
The enemy is coming.

190
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,780
The enemy is coming.

191
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,780
The enemy is coming.

192
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,780
The enemy is coming.

193
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,780
The enemy is coming.

194
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,780
The enemy is coming.

195
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,780
I'm going to take you.

196
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:12,020
Okay now.

197
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:12,300
Duico.

198
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:15,900
All of you.

199
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,060
How dare you!

200
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,060
I can't explain.

201
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,100
Take this.

202
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:34,620
Excellent.

203
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,580
Good job.

204
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,460
You are in the garbage?

205
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,000
Twist it a little bit.

206
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,860
Do we have a copy of Pia Ja?

207
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,920
We need a copy of Sevfik Korn.

208
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,760
What?

209
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,600
Sorry, sir.

210
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,160
Chen Pia Temple's eyes

211
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,720
are just blinded by this.

212
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,040
My grandfather told me about it.

213
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,320
That year,

214
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,800
the chief took them to search the forest.

215
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,880
Suddenly, they heard a explosion.

216
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,440
The chief knew something bad happened.

217
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,520
So he called the chief

218
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,040
to the tower.

219
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,800
Who are you?

220
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,560
What are you doing?

221
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,040
I...

222
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,600
I don't know who touched the gate.

223
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,400
The underground palace

224
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,040
is going down again.

225
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,600
I'm afraid they're in danger.

226
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,760
I'll go down and take a look.

227
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,760
You're lying.

228
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,640
The rules of our tribe

229
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,600
are to kill people

230
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,000
when they make a mistake.

231
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,880
Our chief personally

232
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,160
is like a former oil.

233
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,880
His eyes are gone.

234
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,160
Brother Kua,

235
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,800
can you tell me

236
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,000
what kind of

237
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,240
secret he is?

238
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,120
Let the secret

239
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,760
be buried with the underground palace.

240
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,360
Don't cause yourself

241
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,240
to be killed by the greed of the dead.

242
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,280
Everyone,

243
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,960
the chief's health is not fully recovered.

244
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,400
Let him rest.

245
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,080
Rest, rest.

246
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,560
Cook and set up time.

247
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,800
Take care, Yuzhuang.

248
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,560
Baths and nail

249
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,640
should not croak anymore.

250
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,080
Spread them around to take the treasured

251
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,920
and make nichts fully recovered.

252
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,800
I want to see you.

253
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,360
Shall we go?

254
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,240
Coach.

255
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,240
Xie Lian Huan got one.

256
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,240
This one is the most likely one we have got.

257
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,240
But after Xie Yu Shen's recovery,

258
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,240
he agreed to Xie Jia very soon.

259
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,240
He is also a great character.

260
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,240
It's not easy this time.

261
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,240
Be careful.

262
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,240
Do you think we are all playing with our family business?

263
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,240
We are just a few rich people.

264
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,240
Xie Yu Shen's recovery

265
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,240
Xie Jia's recovery

266
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,240
Xie Jia's recovery

267
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,240
Xie Jia's recovery

268
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,240
Xie Jia's recovery

269
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,240
Xie Jia's recovery

270
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,240
Xie Jia's recovery

271
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,240
Master Hua, why did you do this?

272
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,240
I've been investigating for so many years.

273
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,240
If someone didn't do it on purpose,

274
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,240
I wouldn't have found anything.

275
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,240
Although I don't know who that person is,

276
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,240
it must be related to my uncle's death.

277
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,240
It must be related to Snake Eye and Tong Yu.

278
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,240
But my uncle's body

279
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,240
must be related to the killer.

280
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,240
Open the coffin.

281
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,240
Close the coffin.

282
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,240
Xie Yu Shen's recovery

283
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,240

Xie Jia's recovery

314
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,240
Master Hua, look

315
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,240
the target is the set area

316
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,960
He denies to get to the bottom.

317
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,520
My God.

318
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,480
Hey, bro.

319
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,600
Who?

320
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,240
and also lost half of it.

321
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,240
Your Highness,

322
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,240
once we've put the things in the Bias' hands,

323
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,240
it's different from what we imagined.

324
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,240
The Bias' hands are different.

325
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,240
They are different.

326
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,240
They are different.

327
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,240
They are different.

328
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,240
They are different.

329
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,240
They are different.

330
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,240
They are different.

331
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,240
They are different.

332
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,240
They are different.

333
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,240
They are different.

334
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,240
They are different.

335
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,240
They are different.

336
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,240
They are different.

337
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,240
They are different.

338
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,240
They are different.

339
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,240
What happened to you?

340
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,240
Why did the Shade Boy do to you?

341
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,240
You're very resourceful.

342
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,240
I know very well

343
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,240
that my mission in China is no secret to you.

344
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,240
You can easily look it up.

345
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,240
So is the company's

346
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,240
intention behind my trip.

347
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,240
Jason, you lack experience.

348
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,240
You are new to the Chinese culture

349
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,240
and Asian-Turban exploration.

350
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,240
We count effort to underestimate

351
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,240
the locals for generations.

352
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,240
They gave their lives

353
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,240
in exchange for experience.

354
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,240
We'll be sorry

355
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,240
if Baochuan gets in the way.

356
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,000
So the Brotherhood

357
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
is finalized.

358
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,240
Our purpose is to avenge our brothers.

359
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,240
This has never changed.

360
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,160
There's nothing different.

361
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,760
But I didn't expect

362
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,600
to kill the children.

363
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,200
Some things are like this.

364
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,080
It's better than being strong and strong.

365
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,840
You can only be strong and not retreat.

366
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,480
Otherwise, the Wu Xie people will die even more.

367
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,880
Otherwise,

368
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,360
he might not have changed.

369
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,880
Why are you afraid?

370
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,040
He is your nephew.

371
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,800
I have never never refused any of this.

372
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:44,840
You...

373
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,880
You're couched on my behalf

374
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,480
by the Wu Xie people who once belonged to the Wu overboard.

375
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,480
Look at Wu Xie's fire pit.

376
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,480
And the crab.

377
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,480
Your weakness

378
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,480
will destroy us.

379
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,480
I've told you many times.

380
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,480
I can't hear you.

381
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,480
You're dead!

382
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,480
The ginger palace was Wang Zanhai's final destination.

383
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:36,480
He left an object there which we have neglected for the whole time.

384
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,480
Surely with the copper fish, we could also unlock the secrets.

385
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,480
But if there's a shortcut, why not take it?

386
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,480
What's your motivation for letting Wu Xie go to the ginger palace?

387
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,480
He's attentive and usually has the odds with him.

388
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,480
If he goes to the ginger palace,

389
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,480
he will no doubt find the artifact left by the man who made the copper fish.

390
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,480
Something I haven't find for a long time.

391
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,480
What is it?

392
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:13,480
You were dead before. After you left the sea, you were no longer you.

393
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,480
Our goal is to revenge.

394
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,480
This has never changed.

395
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,480
It has never changed!

396
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,480
Look at me.

397
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,480
Stand up.

398
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,480
Stand up.

399
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:54,480
It will make us all die in the depths of our bodies.

400
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,480
Is it because you sleep so early every day?

401
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,480
I guessed right.

402
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,480
Disappearance.

403
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,480
Maybe it's not because of your health.

404
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,480
I'm sure he has a lot of things to hide from you.

405
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,480
What do you mean?

406
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,480
I know what you mean.

407
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,480
It's a bit ridiculous.

408
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:34,480
And it will affect the image of the light in your heart.

409
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,480
But I'm telling the truth.

410
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,480
I believe you have a feeling too.

411
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,480
Mr. Wu,

412
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,480
the partner behind you is not like the one you're so smart to do.

413
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,480
You're right.

414
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,480
You're right.

415
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,480
So I think you're a good boy.

416
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,480
A good boy.

417
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,480
It's hard to live.

418
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,480
It's too hard to walk the right path.

419
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,480
But you have to remember one thing.

420
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,480
In this world, what's the hardest thing?

421
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,480
The heart.

422
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,480
I can only say so much to you.

423
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,480
And the bodies of the lost village.

424
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,480
What are they doing here?

425
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,480
They also pushed your entire company

426
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,480
and the responsibility to me.

427
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,480
Why?

428
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,480
You're also a ambitious person.

429
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,480
Now you're looking at a blind date.

430
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,480
If...

431
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,480
Don't say those ridiculous assumptions.

432
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,480
I'll go ask Mr. Wu.

433
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,480
You've raised such a friendly and friendly child.

434
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,480
Strange.

435
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,480
My friend is very happy to see you again.

436
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,480
I think you're looking for this.

437
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,480
I thought he was in Chenpiya's hands.

438
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,480
Yes.

439
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,480
I'm in a trade with my master.

440
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,480
For this,

441
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,480
I've paid two shares of my own.

442
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,480
You should know that

443
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,480
this thing is very interesting to me.

444
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,480
But it's not very interesting to Jason.

445
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,480
Go and give Jason to me.

446
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,480
Kid.

447
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,480
In order to get this,

448
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,480
Mr. Wu paid a high price.

449
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,480
How do I know if he was taken away?

450
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,480
This is an ancient wisdom.

451
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,480
I've never seen him like this.

452
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,480
He's a very good man.

453
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,480
Did he get a package?

454
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,480
This is an ancient wisdom.

455
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,480
I remind you.

456
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,480
You can't pay after you open it.

457
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,480
I didn't expect

458
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,480
Mr. Wu and I would talk business.

459
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,480
What's your condition?

460
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,480
The war is over.

461
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,480
The war is over.

462
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,480
Mr. Qiu Dekou is the property owner.

463
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,480
I can't help him.

464
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,480
You can.

465
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,480
Mr. Wu and Mr. Qiu Dekou have been together for so long.

466
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,480
There are some things that we can't let go.

467
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,480
Kid.

468
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,480
Go and ask Mr. Wu.

469
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,480
Mr. Wu likes simple business.

470
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,480
The simpler, the better.

471
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,480
Remember.

472
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,480
I'm in a trade with you.

473
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,480
I'm in a trade with him.

474
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,480
I only talk about interests.

475
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,480
I don't talk about feelings.

476
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,480
OK.

477
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,480
Mr. Qiu Dekou is studying

478
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,480
the war books for so many years.

479
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,480
The pictures that are actually taken

480
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,480
should be...

481
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,480
I want to see them.

482
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,480
I've also been in the business

483
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,480
for a while.

484
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,480
To me,

485
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,480
it's not attractive.

486
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,480
Besides, Jason wants to be the one.

487
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,480
It's not my job.

488
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,480
I'm not a good man.

489
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,480
I'm just asking you.

490
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,480
It's not my job.

491
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,480
I don't care about the trade.

492
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,480
I don't care about your business.

493
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,480
I'm just talking about my conditions.

494
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,480
The jade box

495
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,480
is the one for war books.

496
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,480
The original.

497
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,480
Jason.

498
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,480
You owe me a favor.

499
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,480
Of course.

500
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,480
The company will remember it.

501
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,480
Jason.

502
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,480
You've got the jade box.

503
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,480
Just open the mechanism lock.

504
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,480
Yes.

505
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,480
Mr. Wu must know how to open it.

506
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,480
That's right.

507
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,480
I know.

508
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,480
It's simple.

509
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,480
But I have to make it clear.

510
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,480
Open the lock.

511
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,480
Take the goods.

512
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,480
After opening it,

513
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,480
the jade box can't be returned.

514
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,480
OK?

515
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,480
a little bit more.

516
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,480
Stere balconies.

517
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,480
Xie Yu Hua actually put a certain weapon in it?

518
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,480
This is the Yan Pi.

519
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,480
How do you know it's Yan Pi?

520
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,480
Because I've been with him for many years.

521
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,480
Since it's Yan Pi, the deal just now is not going to be settled.

522
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,480
I told him very clearly.

523
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,480
Take the jade box and exchange it to fight the enemy.

524
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,480
It's the jade box.

525
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,480
It's not the same as this.

526
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,480
Okay.

527
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,480
You knew the Yan Pi in the box, right?

528
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,480
I really don't know.

529
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,480
But I know what you mean.

530
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,480
What do you mean?

531
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,480
You're a fake expert.

532
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,480
You can't do anything.

533
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,480
You can't even use the first one.

534
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,480
It's the jade box.

535
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,480
You're lucky.

536
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,480
Really.

537
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,480
I'm innocent.

538
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,480
I really don't know.

539
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,480
So this jade box is also made by Chen Pi.

540
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,480
What's the use of putting it on?

541
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,480
I said take it away.

542
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,480
I believe you will definitely get the real jade box.

543
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,480
Everyone, thank you.

544
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,480
I gave up the silk book.

545
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,480
Mr. Jason, don't be nervous.

546
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,480
I trust that Wu Xie will promise Wu Sanxing,

547
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:08,480
which is much more valuable than a map for the Cloud Sky Palace.

548
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,480
Didn't I already tell you about this?

549
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,480
I don't want you to go.

550
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,480
It's dangerous there.

551
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,480
Whether it's dangerous or not,

552
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,480
I must go whether it's right or wrong.

553
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,480
I must go.

554
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,480
I must see Uncle Sanxing personally and tell him personally.

555
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,480
This is my biggest wish.

556
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,480
But that black-and-white cave,

557
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,480
it's dangerous.

558
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,480
I'm not sure if I can get it.

559
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,480
I'm sure that I can get it.

560
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,480
I'm sure that I can get it.

561
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:00,480
But I can't tell you the situation in that black-and-white cave.

562
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,480
At that time,

563
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,480
the explosion was too sudden.

564
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,480
My spirit of death

565
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,480
was in a crack.

566
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,480
I was going down the crack.

567
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,480
After I went down,

568
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,480
I think I'm in another world.

569
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,480
That black-and-white cave,

570
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,480
everywhere is black stone.

571
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,480
I was confused by the eyes.

572
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,480
I was climbing up and down.

573
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,480
I went to find that god.

574
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,480
I clearly saw that god over there.

575
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,480
But I couldn't climb up.

576
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,480
I looked this way.

577
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,480
There's a god over here.

578
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,480
I looked this way.

579
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,480
There's a god over here too.

580
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,480
It was all a illusion.

581
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,480
I don't know how long it's been.

582
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,480
I don't know how long it's been.

583
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,480
I found that secret

584
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,480
in this place.

585
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,480
When I went out,

586
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,480
I couldn't find the way in.

587
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,480
I was in a mess.

588
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,480
I saw it.

589
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,480
On the wall,

590
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,480
I saw my face everywhere.

591
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,480
My broken face.

592
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,480
I was in a mess.

593
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,480
I was in a mess.

594
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,480
My hair was messed up.

595
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,480
I was in a mess.

596
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,480
I couldn't see the side.

597
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,480
I was in a mess.

598
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,480
I was in a mess.

599
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,480
I finally got out.

600
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,480
But

601
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,480
the worst thing is

602
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,480
I felt like I was in there for a year.

603
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,480
But I came out to

604
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,480
keep our family's body.

605
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,480
Those bodies were just starting to heal.

606
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,480
It's been a few days.

607
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,480
Elder,

608
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,480
I know what you're talking about.

609
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,480
But there are things

610
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,480
I have to do.

611
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,480
It's been a long time.

612
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,480
This isinals of the minhao Hall,

613
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,480
in it,

614
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,480
there are many hells.

615
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,480
And dangerous things to know.

616
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,480
Elder,

617
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,480
Jin Na.

618
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,040
Brother Kua, we don't have much time.

619
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,920
We might have to leave now.

620
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,320
Thank you, Chang La.

621
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,480
The End

622
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,360
Why do we have to leave in the middle of the night?

623
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,760
But if I don't come tomorrow,

624
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,360
he will be in a hurry.

625
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,040
Why don't you stay and say goodbye?

626
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,080
We are leaving now.

627
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,640
No.

628
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,040
I have to follow you.

629
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,120
Didn't the master say it was dangerous?

630
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,920
I will explain it to him later.

631
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,520
I hope there will be no more trouble here.

632
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,360
Let's go.

633
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,040
Brother Kua has been leaving us for so long.

634
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,080
Is he still not used to our life here?

635
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,480
I think he has slept very little these days.

636
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,920
He has slept very little?

637
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,040
If he has slept very little,

638
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:34,040
then add some herbs in the medicine.

639
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,040
Okay.

640
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,160
Elder Brother Zhang.

641
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,760
�'

642
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,240
What's wrong?

643
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,480
We are in the underground depth.

644
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,480
I'm so hot. I can't even breathe.

645
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,480
We are almost there.

646
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,480
I'm so afraid of the heat.

647
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:34,480
The shadow of the past year is reflected in the empty silence.

648
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,480
The clouds are chasing the wind.

649
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,480
The road is light.

650
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,480
Why is it so dark?

651
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,480
The light is passing through the dark.

652
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,480
The darkness is getting back.

653
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,480
The wind is hiding in the time.

654
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,480
The flowers are blooming.

655
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:08,480
The wings of the past are chasing the wind.

656
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:25,480
The shadow of the past is reflected in the empty silence.

657
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,480
The clouds are chasing the wind.

658
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,480
The road is light.

659
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,480
Why is it so dark?

660
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,480
The light is passing through the dark.

661
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,480
The darkness is getting back.

662
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,480
The light is hiding in the time.

663
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,480
The flowers are blooming.

664
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:58,480
The wings of the past are chasing the wind.

665
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:10,480
The light is passing through the dark.
