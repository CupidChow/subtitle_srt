1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
Dude, please full double deli on this guy.

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,400
陳湖

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,800
I'll do it later.

4
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,720
We can spend a good night with Ange backing her up.

5
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,700
Do you think flowers are edible?

6
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,700
It's delicious.

7
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,500
Of course it is.

8
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,300
It smells so good.

9
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,300
I'm telling you.

10
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,700
It's tasteless.

11
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,700
But I don't want to do this.

12
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,500
Are you feeling unwell?

13
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,700
Don't breathe.

14
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,300
What?

15
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,700
What's going on?

16
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,700
There's a magic circle in your body.

17
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,100
It's not very toxic.

18
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,300
It's easy to wake up.

19
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,900
They're too toxic.

20
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,900
What should we do?

21
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,100
Brother.

22
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,300
We don't have much time.

23
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,500
Let's go and save him.

24
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,100
What did I eat?

25
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,300
Slow down.

26
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,500
Slow down.

27
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,700
The pain here is the substance that causes the disease.

28
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,100
We've been here for a day and a night.

29
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,900
The pain is caused by the night.

30
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,300
People get drunk here.

31
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,900
They fall into a coma in the daytime.

32
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,900
They have hallucinations again in the night.

33
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,900
They fall into this cycle again and again.

34
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,900
People get lost here for a long time.

35
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,700
They don't know how to die.

36
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,900
Let's get out of here.

37
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,100
There may be more mechanisms here.

38
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,300
It's too dangerous.

39
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,300
Let's move.

40
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,500
Let's go.

41
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,900
It's disgusting.

42
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,300
Brother.

43
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,300
Brother.

44
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,300
Brother.

45
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,840
Come.

46
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,000
Let me help you.

47
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,900
Help me.

48
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,300
Brother, I can't do it.

49
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,300
What should we do now?

50
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,100
This isn't the first time.

51
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,700
Miss!

52
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,500
Miss!

53
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,100
No one is watching you.

54
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,500
Come or die.

55
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,700
I can't.

56
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,300
This is the first gate of the imperial mausoleum.

57
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,300
It's called the Heavenly Gate.

58
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:34,300
Remember, when you come out, you must turn around.

59
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,300
Or you will hit the door.

60
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,300
What is this?

61
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:46,300
After the entrance ceremony, those who are in charge and those who are in charge will be killed.

62
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,300
So this is also a kind of yin and yang gate.

63
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:54,300
According to the rules of the old man, when the explorer enters the Heavenly Gate, he must turn around.

64
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,300
Or it will be very troublesome.

65
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,300
Don't be a superstitious man.

66
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,300
Are you a demon? Why don't you understand anything?

67
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,300
I'm just learning from you.

68
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,300
What's wrong?

69
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,300
I saw someone standing there just now.

70
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,300
Didn't you have a hallucination?

71
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,300
Look again. Is it a stone man?

72
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,300
Is this a man?

73
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,300
What you saw was a ghost.

74
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,300
I just saw a man standing there.

75
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,300
I saw a man standing there.

76
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,300
I just saw a man standing there.

77
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,300
I just saw a man standing there.

78
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,300
I just saw a man standing there.

79
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,300
Isn't this scary?

80
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,300
I just saw it.

81
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,300
I don't think I saw it.

82
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,300
There's something behind me.

83
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,300
Don't scare me.

84
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,300
Is it An Ning?

85
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,300
Uncle, let's go back and see.

86
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,300
Maybe it's really them.

87
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,300
Okay, you go first.

88
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,300
You, you, come back with me.

89
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,300
Uncle, be careful.

90
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,300
Don't worry.

91
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,300
I'm here.

92
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,300
Brother.

93
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,300
Go away.

94
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,300
It's disgusting here.

95
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,300
Hurry up.

96
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,300
What?

97
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,300
What?

98
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,300
You said the king of the half-blood was disgusting.

99
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,300
But the pet he raised was so cute.

100
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,300
As long as it is a flower market in Beijing,

101
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,300
it will definitely sell well.

102
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,300
And the pet at home is also a beast.

103
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,300
Don't make me laugh, Fatty.

104
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,300
There are cats and dogs in the forest.

105
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,300
The modern cat anyway beefs,

106
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,300
famous for food,

107
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,300
and for mass存 treats.

108
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:07,880
In the past, dancers

109
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,300
ate the fur,

110
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,660
fed the cat and

111
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,300
cat ate it on the pond,

112
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,300
but some cats

113
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,300
also got fat.

114
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,300
The traditional cat

115
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,300
carries a lot of kita.

116
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,300
Not a cat plate,

117
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,300
it keeps быть here.

118
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,300
Can I?

119
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,300
How fantastic it is.

120
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,300
It must be delicious.

121
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,300
...and he was very happy.

122
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,300
When he was in the business, he was a very successful man.

123
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,300
The ancients believed in the gods and then they worshiped him.

124
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,300
They thought he was the guardian of the night and the dream.

125
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,300
They said he was the god bird that carried the souls of the ancestors.

126
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,300
Xiao was one of the ancestors.

127
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,300
How could he not be admired?

128
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:53,300
When he was in the Western Zhou dynasty, he was completely different.

129
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,300
He was very modest in his art.

130
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,300
He was very modest.

131
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,300
In the end, even Xiao Wen disappeared.

132
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:04,300
The ancient Chinese thought that this was a time when the country was in control of the word Wen.

133
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:09,300
This kind of role is to completely destroy the cultural symbol of the victory of the country.

134
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,300
Why is he here?

135
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,300
Why isn't he moving?

136
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,300
Now we can only go through here.

137
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,300
It seems that the cat and the cat have not changed.

138
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,300
We are the ones who have changed.

139
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,300
Why is it not changing?

140
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,300
Let's catch him first.

141
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,300
What are you doing?

142
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,300
What are you doing?

143
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,300
Where are you going?

144
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,300
Where are you going?

145
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,300
Where are you going?

146
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,300
I am going to kill you.

147
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,300
What happened to your son?

148
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,300
I'm sorry.

149
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,300
I'm sorry.

150
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,300
You're killing yourself.

151
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,300
You're killing yourself.

152
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,300
You're killing yourself.

153
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,300
This is why Mengca asked us to come here.

154
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,300
This is why Mengca asked us to come here.

155
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,300
Find a way.

156
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,300
Go this way.

157
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,300
Go this way.

158
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,300
Why are there so many doors?

159
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,300
Why are there so many doors?

160
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,300
The six ghosts of the Han family.

161
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,300
The six ghosts of the Han family.

162
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,300
The six ghosts of the Han family.

163
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,300
The six ghosts of the Han family.

164
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,300
You guys!

165
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,300
You guys!

166
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,300
Yes.

167
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,300
It seems that the people of the Jets are all killed by the people.

168
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,300
Quark!

169
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,300
It's a bad omen!

170
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,300
Sedation!

171
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,300
It would be better if the people are about to burn it for us.

172
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,300
My god.

173
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:28,020
["Pyamak Lina," a Chinese handles a

174
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,900
You come, it'll be beyond the bike from there!

175
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,580
What?

176
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,540
Xiao Gengar!

177
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,220
Xiao Gengar!

178
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,140
When the call went in, I came all the way back here.

179
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,020
Kovat, I was on a little vehicle.

180
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,900
Kovat?

181
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:06,680
The

182
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,200
sound of burning

183
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,100
burning

00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:27,520
This is

191
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:29,960
of

192
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,460
female

193
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:30,960
men

194
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,480
men

195
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:31,820
women

196
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,820
What happened?

197
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,820
Isn't this Jason's man?

198
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,820
I'll go up and have a look.

199
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,820
Pan, these people died so strange.

200
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,820
There must be a problem.

201
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,820
You have to be careful.

202
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,820
There are more than one.

203
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,820
So many people.

204
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,820
The bullets of these machine guns are very destructive.

205
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,820
Even if you meet a Zongzi, you can fight.

206
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,820
What happened here?

207
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,820
What happened?

208
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,820
What happened?

209
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,820
What happened?

210
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,820
What happened?

211
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,820
What happened?

212
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,820
No, no, no.

213
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,820
You see.

214
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,820
Don't you think the strangest thing is how these bodies went up?

215
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,820
This place is too scary.

216
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,820
Let's go.

217
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,820
Fatty, go, go, go, go.

218
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,820
Oh my God.

219
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,820
Sometimes I don't even know what's in your head.

220
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,820
Fatty, what are you doing?

221
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,820
Come down.

222
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,820
The apartment is good for the city, the city must be good for the air.

223
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,820
These guns are not stupid.

224
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,820
Be careful.

225
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,820
What if there is any danger up there?

226
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,820
It's okay.

227
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,820
If it's not right, I'll come down.

228
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,820
Come down quickly.

229
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,820
There are dead people here.

230
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,820
You go.

231
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,820
Fatty, you be careful.

232
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,820
Don't step on the whole hill.

233
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,820
This is a good person.

234
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,820
Wait, wait.

235
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,820
Come in.

236
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,820
You almost got it.

237
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,820
Fatty, be careful of the body.

238
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,820
Don't touch it, it might be poisonous.

239
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,820
At least one person can get one.

240
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,820
You are...

241
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,820
Fatty, fatty, fatty.

242
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,820
You say sorry.

243
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,820
Why are you lying down?

244
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,820
Your body seems to be alive.

245
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,820
Let's go.

246
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,820
Please come in.

247
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,820
Old lady, she is here.

248
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,820
Old lady.

249
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,820
You sent so many people to fool me.

250
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,820
It seems that Qiu Dekao is old and confused.

251
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,820
This is the fourth time Mr. Qiu Dekao is hospitalized.

252
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,820
I hope you can understand.

253
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,820
He said you must understand his situation.

254
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,820
If it wasn't a sudden accident, he would come personally.

255
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,820
What sudden accident?

256
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,820
It seems that you don't know.

257
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,820
The relics that you and Mr. Qiu Dekao worked together have been damaged.

258
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,820
How is that possible?

259
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,820
What happened?

260
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,820
The relics of Macao were found by Xie Yuhua.

261
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,820
They haven't been found until now.

262
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,820
What?

263
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,820
Mr. Qiu Dekao said that he was a little surprised by your ability to do things.

264
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,820
Currently, there are many problems with the holding of this batch of goods.

265
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,820
Please solve them as soon as possible.

266
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:32,820
It seems that Xie's wings are stiff.

267
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:41,820
My cooperation with you is already a threat to my family.

268
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:46,820
The rules of the old and the new can't be broken because of me.

269
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:51,820
Xie's wings are stiff and he doesn't listen to me anymore.

270
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,820
He hates me.

271
00:18:52,820 --> 00:19:00,820
Please go back and tell Qiu Dekao that he can digest this matter.

272
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:10,820
If he insists on pursuing, he will cause trouble for the Xie family.

273
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,820
Our cooperation is not a threat to the family.

274
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:19,820
Mr. Qiu Dekao said that he would send the young master of the Xie family to a distant place.

275
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,820
Xie Yuchen will go to the Cloud Sky Palace soon.

276
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,820
No.

277
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,820
It's because the Cloud Sky Palace is dangerous.

278
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,820
One more person and one more insurance.

279
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,820
Moreover, Xie Yuchen is the descendant of the Nine Gates.

280
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,820
You should trust his ability.

281
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,820
I will go to the Cloud Sky Palace.

282
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,820
I will go to the Cloud Sky Palace.

283
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,820
I will go to the Cloud Sky Palace.

284
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,820
I will go to the Cloud Sky Palace.

285
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,820
I will go to the Cloud Sky Palace.

286
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,820
You should trust his ability.

287
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:52,820
If not, you should have trusted your daughter's news too.

288
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,820
Did Huo Ling find it?

289
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,820
We haven't solved our problems yet, didn't we?

290
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:05,820
You mean that the Xie family hates the Huo family.

291
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,820
Like the saying, it comes in good or bad.

292
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,820
What do you say?

293
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,820
Goodbye.

294
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,820
Goodbye.

295
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,820
Turn his head around in such a way to miss it.

296
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,820
Massive reaction.

297
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,820
Practice if needed.

298
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,820
You...

299
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,820
Relax.

300
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,820
Keep your qualms.

301
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:31,800
had

302
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,800
Run!

303
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,800
Run!

304
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,800
Don't take that off!

305
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,800
There's still a breath.

306
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,800
Why is he still alive after taking this off?

307
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,800
Is he hallucinating?

308
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,800
He's fine.

309
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,800
Pan Zi, is he still alive?

310
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,800
He can't die.

311
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,800
But he can't live long.

312
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,800
Look, his pupils are getting bigger.

313
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
What do you want?

314
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,800
You want to save him just like that?

315
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,800
He can't live long even if you saved him.

316
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
And if we save him, we...

317
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,800
What if we don't save him?

318
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,800
Are you going to leave him here alone?

319
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,800
He's a living person.

320
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,800
I...

321
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,800
I'll hit you!

322
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,800
What's wrong with you?

323
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,800
Get away!

324
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,800
Get away!

325
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,800
What?

326
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,800
What did he shout just now?

327
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,800
Who knows?

328
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,800
I don't understand.

329
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,800
Is he talking about Ke family?

330
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,800
Maybe it's about big birds.

331
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,800
Brother, brother.

332
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,800
We don't want to hurt you.

333
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,800
We just want to let you go.

334
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,800
You have to fight.

335
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,800
Enough.

336
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,800
Fatty, you can't...

337
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,800
What?

338
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,800
What?

339
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
Again?

340
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,800
Ren Tian Xiao!

341
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,800
Are you okay?

342
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,800
Shunzi, Grandpa Si.

343
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,800
Grandpa Si!

344
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,800
Where's Ke?

345
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,800
I didn't see him when I went out.

346
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
Why is this bird so big?

347
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
You're talking nonsense.

348
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,800
I was looking for you and you kept shaking your head.

349
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,800
He's been behind you.

350
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,800
Shh!

351
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,800
This...

352
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,800
This...

353
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,800
Look!

354
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,800
Who shot just now?

355
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,800
Me.

356
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,800
Me?

357
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,800
And me.

358
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,800
The man in the box is still here.

359
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,800
If you didn't shoot, run away from here.

360
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,800
Why?

361
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,800
Hurry up!

362
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,800
We don't have time!

363
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,800
Go!

364
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
Go!

365
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
Brother Si!

366
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,800
Fatty, get the gun!

367
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,800
What now?

368
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
Don't know.

369
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,800
Then why did you let them get away?

370
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
This is not my idea.

371
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,800
This is your Grandpa Si's idea.

372
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,800
Grandpa Si?

373
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,540
You are a

374
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:31,640
grandpa everyone knows you.

375
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,640
Wait!

376
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,640
Flat out!

377
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,640
Let me go!

378
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,640
Come on, man!

379
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,640
實値我給你把手指進去

380
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,640
What the hell is this?

381
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,640
How can you put your hands like this on men?

382
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,640
Bad luck you are at!

383
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,640
Are you TIRED or SUSPICED?

384
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,640
Listen, stay with me.

385
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,640
But I want you to fish for a man.

386
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,640
Why you doing this?

387
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,640
No chance!

388
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,640
Uncle San?

389
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,640
Don't ask so much.

390
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,640
I'll take you to see San Yan.

391
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,640
You ask him yourself.

392
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,640
Can we see San Yan in this situation?

393
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,640
Maybe the gunshots just now

394
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,640
have shocked everyone around here.

395
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,640
Get out of the way!

396
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,640
Get out of the way!

397
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,640
Be careful.

398
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,640
T messing with us.

399
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,640
be careful be careful

400
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,640
Sheng Zong!

401
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,640
what are you doing?

402
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,160
Shoot!

403
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,920
Fire!

404
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,800
.

405
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,760
Tell me, must no fat man die good for nothing?

406
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,840
Were you waiting for me?

407
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,640
Come on.

408
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,600
Fatty.

409
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,400
A good soldier.

410
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,840
Remember.

411
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,560
You won't shoot anyone.

412
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,680
Yes, I'm a wild deer.

413
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,560
I can use it anyway.

414
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,640
I can just run away.

415
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,200
Fatty.

416
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,880
You go.

417
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,960
Where to?

418
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,120
I said you go.

419
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,640
Don't stay with us anymore.

420
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,000
You tell me where to shoot.

421
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,160
Channel is still not shy.

422
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,240
Fatty.

423
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,320
Shut up.

424
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,400
I'm consulting with the situation team.

425
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,400
You're asking for the exam just because you're out of the door?

426
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,480
No, I'm asking for the exam.

427
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,560
Why are you calling me?

428
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,640
Fatty Wang, stop pretending. I know you too well.

429
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,480
Or maybe...

430
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,560
I really don't know you.

431
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,800
What is this?

432
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,480
What else do you want to say?

433
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,560
What else do you have to explain?

434
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,480
Do you know this is a communication device?

435
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,920
Do you know what the results will be if you send him the message?

436
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,640
I don't know. Don't accuse me of anything you don't know.

437
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,720
Give it to me. Give it to me.

438
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,160
Mr. Wang, is there anything new?

439
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,160
OK.

440
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,960
Ok.

441
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,160
I want an archive.

442
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,080
Where's it card?

443
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,520
So great!

444
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,600
What certificationrying caught...

445
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,640
So I was in a hurry to open a business.

446
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,640
Then I was cheated by the car.

447
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,240
I was cheated by him.

448
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,040
And then he took away my parents' shop.

449
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,160
So I had no choice.

450
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,240
So I used this, do you understand?

451
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,680
And what are you worried about?

452
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,520
I'm always protecting you.

453
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,360
I've been protecting you.

454
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,560
And I didn't tell him the most important thing.

455
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,160
I never told them.

456
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,280
Of course you have to go out and be with me.

457
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,760
Otherwise, how can you report my whereabouts to him?

458
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,520
No, you can't do this because of a communication device.

459
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,240
Are you serious?

460
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,640
You can't do this, okay?

461
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,280
Just because of a communication device.

462
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,720
Fatty Wang.

463
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,840
You...

464
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,160
You're a traitor.

465
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,680
You don't even care about the interests of our team

466
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,920
for your own personal gain.

467
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,080
Okay, Fatty Wang?

468
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:32,840
I can do it.

469
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,720
Fatty Wang, I owe you a lot.

470
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,400
I can even pay you back with my life.

471
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,600
But what about them?

472
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,240
Do you know what kind of people Qiu De Kao is?

473
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,880
You're a little bit of a moral abuser.

474
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,920
I'll say it again.

475
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,680
It's not as serious as you said.

476
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,560
Do you know?

477
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,640
Did you take his money?

478
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,520
Did he pay you back with Qiu De Kao's life?

479
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,720
He can't get what he wants.

480
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,320
Will he give up?

481
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,480
Are you really stupid or are you self-mocking?

482
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,160
Do you think I'm a moral abuser?

483
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,040
Okay.

484
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,200
Then we really aren't on the same side.

485
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:34,400
The anhels and Kimians did not background the

486
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,380
Makar오 Fer 1900 along with the simple

487
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,560
People's Hoarders.

488
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,560
I can't help it. I... I won this case.

489
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,560
And I'm saying this with mercy.

490
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,560
I didn't tell him about the important thing.

491
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,560
Of course I know. I... I...

492
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,560
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I did wrong.

493
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,560
I apologize to you. I'm sorry.

494
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,560
I'm sorry. Just forgive me.

495
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,560
Forgive you.

496
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,560
Okay?

497
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,560
I always thought you were a wise man.

498
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,560
I would think about what you said.

499
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,560
But now you're lying to me.

500
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,560
You're the same as them.

501
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:17,560
You and them are all coming together to lie to me.

502
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,560
For your own personal gain,

503
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,560
you don't even care about your brother's life?

504
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,560
Don't follow us anymore.

505
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,560
Let's separate.

506
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,560
I'm sorry.

507
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,560
I'm sorry.

508
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,560
Let's go.

509
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,560
I followed you?

510
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,560
What did I do to you?

511
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,560
I helped you every day.

512
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,560
What did I do to your family?

513
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,560
I stayed with you in the hospital.

514
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,560
I don't even want my family.

515
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,560
I don't even want my shop.

516
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,560
I stayed with you.

517
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,560
I took care of you.

518
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,560
What did I do to you?

519
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,560
Every time I came down with you,

520
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,560
did I ever sell my treasure?

521
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,560
Did I ever sell my treasure?

522
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,560
Did I ever sell my treasure?

523
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,560
Did I ever?

524
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:37,560
But you always think that I'm a greedy and greedy man.

525
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,560
And now you're right.

526
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,560
You have this.

527
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,560
You have this.

528
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,560
You think more about that I'm a man.

529
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,560
Really.

530
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,560
You're great.

531
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,560
You're great.

532
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,560
I don't want to follow you anymore.

533
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,560
You're going to deal with my family's problems, right?

534
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,560
Okay, Fatty Wang.

535
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,560
Don't ever come back after you leave.

536
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,560
Don't ever come back.

537
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,560
I'm telling you, Tianzhe Wu Xie.

538
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,560
I'm telling you, I want to see you again.

539
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,560
I'll go with you.

540
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,560
Fatty Wang.

541
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,560
Fatty Wang.

542
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,560
Young Master San.

543
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,560
Young Master San.

544
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,560
Young Master San.

545
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,560
Young Master San.

546
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,560
Young Master San.

547
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,560
I don't know where he is.

548
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,560
How can we go?

549
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,560
He should be in the underground palace.

550
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,560
Underground palace?

551
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,560
Yes.

552
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,560
How do you know?

553
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,560
Young Master San told me.

554
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,560
Young Master San told you?

555
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,560
Then tell me where the underground palace is.

556
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,560
According to the rules,

557
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,560
the entrance of the underground palace should follow the third corridor of the divine path.

558
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,560
Under the heaven's sky.

559
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,560
But there must be a roof.

560
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,560
Besides, there are more than 70 bricks and armor with iron and water in it.

561
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,560
Even if we come to the entire imperial army,

562
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,560
we can't dig it without ten days and half a month.

563
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,560
Then how did you get in?

564
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,560
I guess I have a secret entrance.

565
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,560
And it's right on the central line.

566
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,560
It's like the secret entrance of the Cixiling.

567
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,560
It's not in the hidden place of the spiritual house.

568
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,560
But we don't have time to go and dig now.

569
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,560
I don't know where the entrance is.

570
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,560
But I heard from Third Master.

571
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,560
This is the place where the Xuanwu master died.

572
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,560
He said that if I told you this, you would know where the entrance is.

573
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,560
Think about it.

574
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,560
The place where Xuanwu master died?

575
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,560
Yes.

576
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,560
Impossible.

577
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,560
How can there be such a place in the world?

578
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,560
What did he tell you?

579
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,560
Did he tell you anything else?

580
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,560
Nothing.

581
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,560
Just a few words.

582
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,560
The human gun!

583
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,560
Hurry up!

584
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,560
It's too empty here!

585
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,560
Hurry up!

586
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,560
Go!

587
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,560
Hurry up!

588
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,560
Hurry up!

589
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:53,560
