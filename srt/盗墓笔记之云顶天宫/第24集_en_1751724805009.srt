1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh, oh, oh.

2
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Little Third Master.

3
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You made me arrive in advance.

4
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I thank you!

5
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Lighting bullets!

6
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Bad guy!

7
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Don't shoot!

8
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
These birds are half blind.

9
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Under such strong light, they can't see us.

10
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But they are very sensitive to sound.

11
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Fatty.

12
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Fatty, what are you doing?

13
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Behave yourself!

14
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Coming!

15
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Thank you!

16
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We don't have lightings anymore.

17
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Fatty!

18
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You take Third Master away first.

19
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
These people are flying out of the cave.

20
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You run out to the other side of the cave.

21
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Don't bother me!

22
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'll go save Fatty!

23
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
No!

24
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Little Third Master, you take Third Master away.

25
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'll go save Fatty!

26
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Fatty, my blood can heal them.

27
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'll be fine.

28
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Fatty, I'll leave Third Master to you.

29
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
We'll wait for you outside.

30
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll wait for you.

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Give Third Master a gun!

32
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Third Master, let's go.

33
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Let's go!

34
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Fatty!

35
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Don't move!

36
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Don't alert them!

37
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Stay to protect Wu Xie!

38
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Don't move!

39
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Get up!

40
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Don't touch me!

41
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Don't touch me!

42
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Sister!

43
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Don't touch me!

44
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Sister!

45
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Let go!

46
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Let go!

47
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Stand still!

48
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Come here!

49
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Let go!

50
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Give me some good stuff!

51
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Let go!

52
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Hurry!

53
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Give me some good stuff!

54
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Are you okay?

55
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Bite me!

56
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm sorry!

57
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'll kill you today!

58
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You!

59
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Stop it!

60
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
There's a big deal!

61
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's him!

62
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Wow!

63
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Oh, no!

64
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Hey!

65
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Cover me!

66
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Where are you going?

67
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You don't want to live?

68
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Run!

69
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Go!

70
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Let's go!

71
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Go!

72
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Go!

73
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Go!

74
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Hurry!

75
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Go!

76
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Hurry!

77
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Go!

78
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Go!

79
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Go!

80
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Go!

81
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Go!

82
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Go!

83
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Go!

84
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Go!

85
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Go!

86
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Go!

87
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Go!

88
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Go!

89
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Go!

90
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Go!

91
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Go!

92
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Go!

93
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Go!

94
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Go!

95
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Go!

96
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
Go!

97
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Go!

98
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,000
He all went out fighting, huh?

99
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,760
Yes, sir.

100
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,200
What is he after?

101
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,760
Something is wrong with you.

102
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,120
Weak.

103
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,680
Who...

104
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,560
Who told you to attack?

105
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,360
I have no answer to you black gentleman.

106
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,500
I can't pleasure myself with you

107
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,500
I don't know.

108
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,500
What does he want?

109
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,500
I don't know.

110
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Don't you want to go in?

111
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,500
Hurry and stop him!

112
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,500
The leader said that if you open the door of hell, you will be struck by lightning.

113
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,500
The night fire below will burn the entire sky.

114
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,500
Once the door is opened, the mechanism will start.

115
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
By then, the entire sky will be burned to the ground.

116
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,500
No one can escape!

117
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,500
No, there are so many birds, we can't fight them.

118
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
Let's get in the way of a big guy.

119
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,500
Can you calculate this for me?

120
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
You're getting closer.

121
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,500
What are you waiting for?

122
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Hit him!

123
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
Hit him!

124
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,500
You...

125
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,500
Go!

126
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,500
Hurry and go!

127
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,500
Go! Go!

128
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,500
Xiao Ke!

129
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,500
Didn't I tell you not to follow me?

130
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,500
Hurry and go!

131
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,500
Be careful.

132
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,500
Let's go.

133
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,500
Xiao Ke, let's help you!

134
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,500
You can do it alone.

135
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,500
Don't cause trouble for him. Hurry!

136
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,500
Xiao Ke!

137
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,500
Hurry and go!

138
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,500
You go after him!

139
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,500
Hurry!

140
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,500
Hurry!

141
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,500
Hurry!

142
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,500
Hurry!

143
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,500
Hurry!

144
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Hurry!

145
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,500
Hurry!

146
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,500
Hurry and be careful!

147
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,500
Little Third Master!

148
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,500
Pelletie, where's Third Uncle?

149
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,500
Third Master is waiting for you inside.

150
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,500
Let's go.

151
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,500
Third Master! Third Master!

152
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,500
Little Third Master is here.

153
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,500
Third Uncle!

154
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,500
Third Uncle!

155
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,500
How are you?

156
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,500
Don't worry.

157
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
I won't die so easily.

158
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,500
Third Uncle!

159
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
Third Uncle, your wound...

160
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,500
You are too kind.

161
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
You are not the owner of the Wu Family.

162
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
My grandfather's coffin can't be held anymore.

163
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,500
Third Uncle! Third Uncle!

164
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,500
Third Uncle!

165
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,500
Third Uncle,

166
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,500
actually,

167
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,500
Grandpa knows about all these, right?

168
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
This time, you guessed it right.

169
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
If it wasn't for the old man's advice,

170
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,500
this matter would not have been able to continue.

171
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,500
Third Uncle,

172
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,500
you finally told me the truth this time.

173
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
Maybe it depends on my mood.

174
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,500
Third Uncle! Third Uncle!

175
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,500
Okay, okay, okay.

176
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,500
Third Uncle, it's all true.

177
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Back then, in that team,

178
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,500
I found a lot of things wrong.

179
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,500
But I couldn't find out who was the spy.

180
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
I could only take a step at a time.

181
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,500
Later,

182
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,500
when we arrived at the bottom of the sea,

183
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,500
we encountered the mysterious black hand.

184
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,500
We were all injured.

185
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,500
Lian Huan! Lian Huan!

186
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,500
Lian Huan, are you okay?

187
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
I'm fine.

188
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,500
The summer is really harsh.

189
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,500
If we can follow each other into the sea,

190
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,500
we will definitely be in the archaeological team.

191
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,500
The hidden place is really deep.

192
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,500
Is he still here?

193
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,500
When we were fighting,

194
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,500
he should have been injured too.

195
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,500
He should still be here.

196
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,500
Who is he?

197
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,500
What does he want?

198
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,500
No matter what he wants,

199
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,500
he always wants to kill me.

200
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
If I die,

201
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,500
what's the benefit of him and the people behind him?

202
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,500
What's the benefit?

203
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,500
I don't know if you will benefit from your death.

204
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,500
But if you die,

205
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,500
you will be blackened.

206
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,500
Third Uncle.

207
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,500
Third Uncle.

208
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,500
So you thought of it later

209
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,500
to make Xie Lian Huan fake his death.

210
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,500
Then you two shared Wu San Xing's identity

211
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,500
to confuse their behind-the-scenes black hand, right?

212
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,500
There is one thing that can be confirmed.

213
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,500
The Jiu Dui Kou and this matter have nothing to do with each other.

214
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,500
There is another force behind him that we have discovered.

215
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,500
But this force is not what we can deal with.

216
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,500
So we joined hands

217
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
and discovered many secrets.

218
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,500
In the ancient tomb,

219
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,500
there are their shadows everywhere.

220
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,500
We also found that the company behind him is called Alpha.

221
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,500
Alpha?

222
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,500
Then we found that

223
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,500
they are not just for money.

224
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,500
Third Uncle.

225
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
Then their purpose

226
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,500
could it be

227
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,500
impossible?

228
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,500
Their purpose

229
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
is to live forever.

230
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,500
That's great, my friends.

231
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,500
That's really great, my friends.

232
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
We have achieved our goal.

233
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,500
We have finally reached the last step.

234
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,500
We can now cooperate with the Omniscient Life.

235
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,500
We have overcome many difficulties.

236
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,500
We have finally come to this great miracle.

237
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,500
That's really great.

238
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,500
So I want to share with everyone

239
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,500
the secret of this life.

240
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,500
You are really crazy.

241
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
Wu San Xing.

242
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,500
I also thought that

243
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,500
those who were after the life were crazy.

244
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,500
But the secrets of the remains of the sea

245
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,500
are so mysterious.

246
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,500
I know where this madness comes from.

247
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,500
The ancients have tried many things.

248
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
Most of them have failed.

249
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
So in the history book,

250
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,500
we have left one,

251
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,500
another,

252
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,500
funny story.

253
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
But there are also some

254
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,500
infinite success and success.

255
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,500
It's just that these

256
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,500
because they need time to correct,

257
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,500
have been ignored by everyone.

258
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,500
In those experiments,

259
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,500
some want to use the power of the single bird and the insects

260
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,500
to transform the human body.

261
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,500
But they failed.

262
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,500
Some want to use the magnetic field

263
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,500
and the mysterious universe to shoot arrows.

264
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Before the experiment is over,

265
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
it has been destroyed.

266
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500
You...who are you?

267
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,500
I...who are you?

268
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,500
Look.

269
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,500
It must be that you ate badly.

270
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,500
You have lost weight.

271
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,500
Thanks to you,

272
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,500
I have collected a lot of information.

273
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,500
I found some clues.

274
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,500
I also found some clues about the life.

275
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,500
And my current physical condition

276
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,500
can be compared with other leaders.

277
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Even more than

278
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
people younger than me.

279
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,500
Look.

280
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,500
I am not even

281
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,500
able to get a complete longevity index.

282
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,500
I have already lived

283
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,500
for many, many years.

284
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,500
There is another possibility.

285
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,500
You put those things

286
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,500
that are messy

287
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,500
on your body.

288
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,500
It is very possible that

289
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,500
you can become a monster.

290
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,500
What are you afraid of?

291
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
If I become a monster,

292
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
then you should be the ones

293
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,500
who should be afraid.

294
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,500
You are not a normal person now.

295
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,500
I used it on myself.

296
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,500
I collected the results

297
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,500
from various materials.

298
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,500
This is not complete.

299
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
And there will be

300
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,500
some bad consequences.

301
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,500
I want to get the real longevity index.

302
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
And this secret

303
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:19,500
is now in my eyes.

304
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,500
It is right behind this bronze door.

305
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,500
Let him go.

306
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,500
Fatty.

307
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,500
Did you see that?

308
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,500
If you betray me,

309
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,500
the end will be the same as him.

310
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
No one can stop me.

311
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,500
If you were willing to

312
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,500
enter the bronze door with me,

313
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
I would welcome it.

314
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,500
Our power will grow.

315
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,500
In the future,

316
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,500
everything will be possible.

317
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,500
Wu Sanye and Mr. Wang.

318
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
You have worked with me.

319
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,500
You know me.

320
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,500
I will not treat you badly.

321
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,500
You are all the same.

322
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,500
You are a man of your word.

323
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,500
I will tell you again.

324
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,500
Let him go.

325
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,500
Mr. Zhu.

326
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,500
I am willing.

327
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,500
I am willing to work with you.

328
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,500
I will put down the bridge.

329
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,500
Look.

330
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,500
My wound is like this.

331
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,500
There is no resistance.

332
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,500
You can kidnap Wu Xie.

333
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,500
It does not matter.

334
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
But I have a condition.

335
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,500
If you do not agree,

336
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,500
you will not get what you want.

337
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,500
Wu Sanxing.

338
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,500
You want to work with me like this.

339
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
You are not willing to work with me.

340
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,500
I will not let you go.

341
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,500
You want to work with me like this.

342
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,500
Tell me.

343
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
Let me hear it.

344
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,500
It is simple.

345
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,500
I understand.

346
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,500
Why you kidnapped Wu Xie.

347
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,500
After this,

348
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,500
I hope you can prove it to me.

349
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,500
I do not want to be a coward.

350
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,500
Second.

351
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,500
Alpha took one thing from me.

352
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,500
I hope you can get it back.

353
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,500
Third.

354
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,500
That is the most important.

355
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,500
My nephew.

356
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,500
Wu Xie's blood.

357
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,500
It is a patent.

358
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,500
I have a share.

359
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,500
Okay.

360
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,500
Wu Sanxing.

361
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,500
Your greed makes me feel very safe.

362
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,500
Maybe only with people like you.

363
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,500
Only with people like you.

364
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,500
Can you succeed.

365
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,500
Wu Xie.

366
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,500
Tell me.

367
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,500
Third.

368
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,500
I did not hear wrong.

369
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,500
You really do not want Wu Xie's life.

370
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,500
You do not want your nephew's life.

371
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,500
Mr. Wang.

372
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,500
You are really blind.

373
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,500
At this last moment.

374
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,500
You are still so calm.

375
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
I admire you.

376
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,500
But now you are on the right track.

377
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,500
It is your choice to die.

378
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,500
I will tell you again.

379
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,500
Let him go.

380
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,500
I do not care about the long life.

381
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,500
I will not betray my brother again.

382
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,500
Even if I die, I will die with him.

383
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
It is a pity.

384
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,500
I hope you do not regret.

385
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,500
I hope you can get out alive.

386
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,500
Third uncle.

387
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,500
You lied to me.

388
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,500
What is the purpose?

389
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
What is my purpose?

390
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,500
Wu Xie.

391
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,500
It seems that your third uncle did not tell you the truth.

392
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,500
That is right.

393
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,500
My body is already not able to recover.

394
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,500
And you are young and agile.

395
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,500
You have the ability to fight.

396
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,500
And the blood of the body.

397
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,500
As long as you and I enter the Qing Tu Gate together.

398
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,500
We can achieve perfect success.

399
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,500
This is a win-win for us.

400
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,500
Now tie Mr. Wang up.

401
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,500
And let your men push out of this coffin.

402
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,500
Otherwise, I will not be at ease.

403
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,500
Of course, Wu San is also very smart.

404
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,500
I know.

405
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
So our promise.

406
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,500
Wait for me to come back and then implement it.

407
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
We go in now.

408
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,500
Then you better watch your feet.

409
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,500
The road there is not easy to walk.

410
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,500
Thief.

411
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,500
I will teach you one last trick in this life.

412
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,500
At the critical moment.

413
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,500
People do not fear the danger.

414
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,500
The heaven and the earth are destroyed.

415
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:52,500
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,240
you

422
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,520
1

423
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,760
Oh

424
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,940
Help!

425
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:42,300
Tagain orangutans!

426
00:26:47,520 --> 00:27:17,520
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:26,520
Hm

428
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:33,520
Hmm

429
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,520
we

430
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,520
Yeah

431
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,520
boundaries

432
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,520
he

433
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,520
Yeah

434
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,080
Little Master San.

435
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,960
Qian Zhi.

436
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,360
Little Master San.

437
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,160
You've suffered a lot.

438
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,520
Your ball is broken.

439
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,520
How are you?

440
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,520
I...

441
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,520
Little Master San.

442
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,020
Pan Zi.

443
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,020
You...

444
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,020
Why are you here?

445
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,020
Where's Third Uncle?

446
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,020
Third Master asked me to come back to protect you.

447
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,520
It's too dangerous here.

448
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,020
Let's hurry and go.

449
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:40,520
No!

450
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,520
You go find Third Uncle.

451
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,520
I'll stay with Fatty.

452
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,020
We're still looking for Little Brother.

453
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,020
I'll go find him.

454
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,020
You hurry and go!

455
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,020
Third Uncle's injury hasn't healed yet.

456
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,020
You go!

457
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,020
Little Master San.

458
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,020
You're too bold to move forward.

459
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,020
Move forward.

460
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,020
Don't look back.

461
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,020
With me and Third Master,

462
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,020
you don't have to be afraid.

463
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,020
Third Master.

464
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,520
You're really good at holding your tongue.

465
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,020
Huh?

466
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,020
Who's holding his tongue then?

467
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,520
Why?

468
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,020
Are youinet't my brother!

469
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,520
This is for my sister.

470
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,520
Oh my god.

471
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,880
Little Master,

472
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,520
I'm with you.

473
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,020
Get me up!

474
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,020
Go now and getと思 iged.

475
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,020
It's just the first time we are seeing each other's face.

476
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,020
On the way to the agent,

477
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:13,520
I forgot what the agent

478
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,520
We're very relieved to hear you say that.

479
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,520
Let me go!

480
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,520
What kind of man is playing tricks on me?

481
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,520
So, I'll ask you again.

482
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,520
Are you sure you want to leave Huo Xiu Xiu to us?

483
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,520
Why are you calling?

484
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,520
You want to be safe?

485
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,520
The Huo family has already known my purpose.

486
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,520
This time, I will definitely get the longevity tree.

487
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,520
But it's not enough to just have longevity.

488
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,520
I don't want to wait until I come out of the sky,

489
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,520
the outside world has already changed.

490
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,520
I have no place to hide.

491
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,520
Huo Xian Gu, you help me, I'll help you.

492
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,520
Do you want me to help you deal with Xie Yu Chen?

493
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:08,520
Not only him, but also the company and Wu San Xing.

494
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,520
You have a lot of enemies.

495
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,520
It's no fun to live alone.

496
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,520
Huo Xian Gu, we're old friends.

497
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,520
Old friends help each other, and help each other.

498
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,520
I'm not interested.

499
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,520
A wise man never speaks of the dark.

500
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,520
This is my last card.

501
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,520
You have no more benefits you want.

502
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:35,520
People will be famous if they live too long.

503
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,520
You can only see what you want after you live long.

504
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,520
Who has the Huo Ling?

505
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,520
I'm sure you have a guess.

506
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:47,520
I can tell you that the company has the information.

507
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,520
But it's not as much as I do.

508
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:54,520
I'm not sure what the consequences of the missing information will be.

509
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,520
But who will they test on?

510
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,520
You should know, too.

511
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,520
Where is my Nian thirsty?

512
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,520
Master, is your wound okay?

513
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:00,520
You don't recognize me now.

514
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,760
Where's your sunshine?

515
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,120
Well.

516
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,160
Why?

517
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,620
She had to...

518
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,400
Your sunshine.

519
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,800
Fans help you get her clothes.

520
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,080
Same place, same dress.

521
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,680
Nothing.

522
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,260
It's April 3rd.

523
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,460
That Zifeng should leave with us.

524
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,960
Okay.

525
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:31,800
Hello.

526
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,840
How are you?

527
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,960
We have missed you.

528
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,600
Xiao Shu is back.

529
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,480
Run!

530
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,560
ok

531
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,560
cool

532
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:24,220
Who are you?

533
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:30,300
We met

534
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,300
I don't know.

535
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,300
What is this place?

536
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,300
I don't know.

537
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,300
All of this is finally over.

538
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,300
Finally.

539
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,300
Finally.

540
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,300
The hell is over.

541
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,300
Uncle, what is going on?

542
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,300
To stop them from doing anything,

543
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:17,300
Wu San Xing and I have been living in hell for years.

544
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,300
It's okay.

545
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,300
I'm tired.

546
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,300
I just want to sleep.

547
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,300
Don't wear a mask.

548
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,300
Sleep well.

549
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,300
Xiao Ge.

550
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,300
What are you doing here?

551
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,300
What's the matter?

552
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,300
Xiao Ge.

553
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,300
Are you okay?

554
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,300
I'm fine.

555
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,300
I'm fine.

556
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,300
I'm fine.

557
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,300
I'm fine.

558
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,300
I'm fine.

559
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,300
I'm fine.

560
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,300
Are you having a headache again?

561
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,300
Leave this place.

562
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:36,300
The things in the door are not something you can handle.

563
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,300
What is this?

564
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,300
Li Yi He!

565
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,300
Goodbye.

566
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,300
Xiao Ge!

567
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,300
Xiao Ge!

568
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,300
Xiao Ge!

569
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,300
Xiao Ge!

570
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,300
Goodbye.

571
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,300
The wind blows in the clouds.

572
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:02,300
I've forgotten how to respond.

573
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,300
I've passed through the night and the dark.

574
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,300
I've got an answer.

575
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,300
The time flies.

576
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:16,300
The flowers bloom.

577
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:25,300
I'll fly to the sky.

578
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:31,300
I'll fly to the sky.

579
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:37,300
I'll fly to the sky.
