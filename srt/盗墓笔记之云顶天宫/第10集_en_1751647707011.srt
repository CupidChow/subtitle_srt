1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

2
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,360
You

3
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,360
I'm

4
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,600
sure you can't

5
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,600
I'm

6
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,240
sure you can't

7
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,240
I'm

8
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,240
sure you can't

9
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,240
You

10
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,240
You

11
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,240
You

12
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,240
You

13
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,240
You

14
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,240
You

15
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,240
You

16
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,240
You

17
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,240
You

18
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,240
You

19
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,240
Xia Ge

20
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,240
I was too tired yesterday

21
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,240
There were many things I didn't understand

22
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,740
I was thinking

23
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,240
I want to ask you two questions

24
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,240
What's the problem?

25
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,240
It's the same as the picture that Grandpa Si took of the copper fish.

26
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,740
It's exactly the same as the picture that was published in the newspaper.

27
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,240
What's so strange about that?

28
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,740
Grandpa Si was arrested after he left the Palace of Secrecy,

29
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,240
and then the Cultural Bureau kept him for a few years.

30
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,240
After Grandpa Si got out of prison, he set fire to the Cultural Bureau.

31
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,740
After the fire, Grandpa Si took back the copper fish.

32
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,740
No, that's not what I meant.

33
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,740
I mean, if there's no other problem,

34
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,740
then Grandpa Si is the one who stole the treasure in Guangxi Palace.

35
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,740
Then how did he react when he saw Xiao Ge?

36
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,740
What reaction did you two have?

37
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,740
You forgot?

38
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,740
After the elder of Miao Village saw Xiao Ge's face.

39
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,740
Oh.

40
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,740
Grandpa Si was arrested, and he even made the head of Miao Village blind.

41
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,740
He looked exactly like Xiao Ge.

42
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,740
So he...

43
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,740
Maybe he's old, he's a moron,

44
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,740
so he doesn't remember what he looks like.

45
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,740
So he didn't react when he saw Xiao Ge.

46
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,740
Do you think Grandpa Si looks like a moron?

47
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,740
Why don't you ask him yourself?

48
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,740
You ask him?

49
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,740
Four.

50
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,740
Six.

51
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,740
Seven.

52
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,740
Eight.

53
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,740
Nine.

54
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,740
Ten.

55
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,740
Four.

56
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,740
Ten.

57
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,740
Six.

58
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,740
Seven.

59
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,740
I didn't expect it to snow for three days.

60
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,740
But we've wasted a lot of time.

61
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,740
If there's no supply,

62
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,740
maybe we'll run out of food before we get there.

63
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,740
People who come out to play won't be like this.

64
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,740
Actually, I don't have any other way.

65
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,740
How about we go back and come back?

66
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,740
Or we distribute food,

67
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,740
and everyone eats less.

68
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,740
Going back...

69
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,740
It's impossible now.

70
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,740
I'm not going back.

71
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,740
I'm going to go back.

72
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,740
Going back...

73
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,740
It's impossible now.

74
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,740
Let's go.

75
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,740
Go.

76
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,740
That mountain.

77
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,740
It's that mountain.

78
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,740
The mountain in the mural painting.

79
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,740
That's right.

80
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,740
How come I didn't see it?

81
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,740
Mr. Hua.

82
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,740
The information in the computer must be deleted within 24 hours.

83
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,740
It can't leave a trace.

84
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,740
Jia Sha.

85
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,740
Go help me investigate the Huo family.

86
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,740
The Huo family?

87
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,740
Help me investigate what happened between the old lady and the prayer dog.

88
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,740
Be careful.

89
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,740
Don't leak it.

90
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,740
Mr. Hua.

91
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,740
How much did we investigate?

92
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,740
Miss Huo was not in the painting.

93
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,740
We didn't find anything.

94
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,740
How much did we investigate?

95
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,740
Miss Huo is the granddaughter of the Huo family.

96
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,740
Investigate.

97
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,740
I'll think of a way to get rid of that.

98
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,740
Miss Huo, you're here.

99
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,740
This is 114,000 yuan in total.

100
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,740
What's all this?

101
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,740
I'm just a guard.

102
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,740
What does this Huo look like when it comes in?

103
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,740
I guarantee it will look like this when it goes out.

104
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,740
As for what Huo it is,

105
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,740
I shouldn't be in charge of it.

106
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,740
How long have you been working here?

107
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,740
Seven years.

108
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,740
You ship goods like this once a year?

109
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,740
Sometimes once a year.

110
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,740
Sometimes for half a year.

111
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,740
That's how much it is every time?

112
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,740
It's probably all foreign goods.

113
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,740
All foreign goods?

114
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,740
Yes.

115
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,740
How many warehouses like this are there in the country?

116
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,740
I'm not sure.

117
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,740
Please take a look.

118
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,740
If there's nothing wrong, please sign it.

119
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,740
Miss Huo, it's 114 in total.

120
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,740
114.

121
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,740
You have to wipe the footrest too.

122
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,740
Miss.

123
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,740
Where's Grandma?

124
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,740
She's in the study.

125
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,740
Look at how vivid this flower is.

126
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,740
Grandma.

127
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,740
I went to the warehouse where the exam was.

128
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,740
I saw her goods.

129
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,740
The goods are fine, right?

130
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,740
That's right.

131
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,740
114.

132
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,740
Grandma, there are all cultural relics inside.

133
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,740
I heard that the goods are of this size.

134
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,740
Every year or once in six months.

135
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,740
Yes.

136
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,740
How many cultural relics did the exam ship?

137
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,740
I can't imagine.

138
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,740
Yes.

139
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,740
Grandma, are we really going to ship the goods out?

140
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,740
Why not?

141
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,740
Don't forget how the Huo family started.

142
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:02,740
Now, Qiu Dakao and Wu Sansing are having a fight.

143
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,740
They can't get along.

144
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,740
They're already looking for new partners.

145
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,740
At this time, they're still giving a lot of power to the Huo family.

146
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,740
Now, Jason has a new channel.

147
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,740
I see.

148
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,740
We're the ones who are taking the initiative.

149
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:26,740
Whether we can continue to cooperate is very important for the Huo family.

150
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,740
But it's very risky.

151
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,740
And...

152
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,740
And there are so many cultural relics.

153
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,740
We can't get them back.

154
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,740
I can't bear to...

155
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,740
Don't forget that the Huo family is a tomb.

156
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,740
But Aunt is a archaeologist.

157
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,740
Grandma.

158
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,740
It's too early to be helpless.

159
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,740
So hurry up and ship the goods.

160
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,740
So that there won't be too many dreams.

161
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,740
A lot of things will happen.

162
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:55,740
Grandma, what did Qiu Dakao promise you?

163
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,740
Is that money?

164
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,740
I don't believe it.

165
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,740
You're not that kind of person.

166
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,740
Are you going to make my decision?

167
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,740
You...

168
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,740
You don't want to do it anymore, do you?

169
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,740
You're letting others do it, right?

170
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,740
You can leave.

171
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,740
Grandma.

172
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,740
Then you don't have to interfere with the Huo family's business anymore.

173
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,740
Grandma.

174
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,740
Okay, I'll give you the last choice.

175
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,740
I'll sit.

176
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,740
I'll sit.

177
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,740
I'll sit.

178
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,740
Xiao Hua.

179
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,740
I need your help with something.

180
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,740
Look at that.

181
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,740
The mountain is in good condition.

182
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,740
The snow is not broken and the three sides are solid.

183
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,740
This is a very rare old dragon.

184
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,740
From the wind, this is the legendary dragon seat.

185
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,740
See?

186
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,740
Three mountains, three dragon heads.

187
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,740
It's very suitable for making a group.

188
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:43,740
If the eastern and western yellow spirits are buried in the cliff of the Three Holy Mountains,

189
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,740
then the two small dragons on both sides

190
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,740
should be the funeral graves of the Empress and Jin Chen.

191
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,740
Three dragon heads and this kind of tomb?

192
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,740
Yes.

193
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,740
For example, the Three-Personal Tomb of the Three Kingdoms of the Mountain of the Blind in 1987.

194
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,740
It's a three-part ancient tomb that is related to the Three Kingdoms.

195
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,740
It's divided into three mountains on the same slope.

196
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,740
Each of the ancient tombs has a half-meter long path

197
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,740
and a half-meter long path to the center of the tomb.

198
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,740
But when the archaeological team discovered it,

199
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,740
the tombs were already collapsed.

200
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,740
The archaeological team couldn't determine if the tombs really existed

201
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,740
or if they were just a symbol.

202
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,740
Other than these, what else is there to say?

203
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,740
There's also this.

204
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,740
The three dragon heads have a very strange pattern.

205
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,740
The three dragon heads must be connected.

206
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,740
Otherwise, the three dragons fly in different directions.

207
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,740
The dragon will not have a direction and make a group in the air.

208
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,740
The people buried here will kill each other.

209
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,740
So if there are funeral graves,

210
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,740
there must be a secret passage to the center of the tomb.

211
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,740
Right, Sang Hu?

212
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,740
After my buddy said that,

213
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,740
you can rest assured.

214
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,740
Okay.

215
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,740
Let's go.

216
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,740
This way.

217
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,740
Let's go.

218
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,740
Let's go.

219
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,740
Let's go.

220
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,740
Let's go.

221
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,740
Let's go.

222
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,740
Let's go.

223
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,740
Let's go.

224
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,740
Let's go.

225
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,740
Let's go.

226
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,740
Grandpa Si.

227
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,740
Have some water and rest.

228
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,740
Okay.

229
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,740
Grandpa Si.

230
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,740
You can give me some advice.

231
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,740
I've seen the murals of the Cloud Sky Palace.

232
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,740
It's a very famous building.

233
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,740
Although we now know that this Dongxia State

234
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,740
has existed for more than 70 years,

235
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,740
but in the later period, the number of people it left behind

236
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,740
is very small.

237
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,740
If we live in the old forest,

238
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,740
where can we find such a huge human and material strength

239
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,740
to build such a huge imperial tomb?

240
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,740
You brat.

241
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,740
You've come here to make up stories, haven't you?

242
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,740
If you don't even have this little idea,

243
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,740
do you still deserve to be a dog's grandson?

244
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,740
Grandpa Si.

245
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,740
I'm just guessing.

246
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,740
It's not necessarily right.

247
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,740
I want to hear your opinion.

248
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,740
I think that the Cloud Sky Palace

249
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,740
has existed from the beginning.

250
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,740
It's not built by the Dongxia people.

251
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,740
It's just that the King of Wan Nu

252
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,740
thought that this place was not bad,

253
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,740
so he took it over and made it his tomb.

254
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,740
But if that's the case,

255
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,740
then the question arises again.

256
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,740
Who built this Cloud Sky Palace?

257
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,740
We'll know when we get there.

258
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,740
Why are you so anxious?

259
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,740
Grandpa Si.

260
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,740
This Snake Eye Copper Fish is a key.

261
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,740
Where did you get it?

262
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,740
Does that place have anything to do with the Cloud Sky Palace?

263
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,740
There's nothing I can't say.

264
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,740
Back then, in Guangxi's Wofo,

265
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,740
I entered this stone tower.

266
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,740
Except for some old stone statues,

267
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,740
there was nothing else.

268
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,740
Not even a valuable thing.

269
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,740
It's just a eight-fold treasure box.

270
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,740
The snake eye copper fish is inside the box.

271
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,740
So this process is going smoothly?

272
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,740
What do you mean?

273
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,740
No, isn't it that

274
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,740
in the ancient tombs of treasures,

275
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,740
there are some mechanisms?

276
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,740
Then this stone tower...

277
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,740
That stone tower is inside the valley.

278
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,740
It's difficult to get down there.

279
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,740
It's a natural barrier.

280
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,740
Grandpa Si,

281
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,740
why don't you go down to this stone tower

282
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,740
and tell me the details of the snake eye copper fish?

283
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,740
Then,

284
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,740
what could be the clue that you neglected?

285
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,740
You look down on me, old man.

286
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,740
No, no, no, I don't.

287
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,740
No, no.

288
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,740
You're quite bold.

289
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,740
This is quite like a dog.

290
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,740
How is it?

291
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,740
He didn't say anything.

292
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,740
And...

293
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,740
I feel like he's trying to escape from this problem.

294
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,740
It's like he doesn't know the details of the process.

295
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,740
But he doesn't want to lie to me.

296
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,740
Maybe when we arrive at the cloud tower,

297
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,740
we'll be able to see the snake eye copper fish.

298
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,740
That's right.

299
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,740
I think we should go.

300
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,740
Maybe when we arrive at the cloud tower,

301
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,740
we'll be able to solve all the mysteries.

302
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,740
Let's go.

303
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,740
I'll go.

304
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,740
Shun Zi,

305
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,740
I can't sleep.

306
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,740
Let me exchange with you.

307
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,740
I'll take care of this.

308
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,740
You go back and sleep.

309
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,740
No need.

310
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,740
I've already taken your money.

311
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,740
If I can't do this,

312
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,740
I'll feel so guilty.

313
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,740
Okay.

314
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,740
What did you do before?

315
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,740
I was a herbivore, a hunter.

316
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,740
Just like my dad.

317
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,740
I followed him to the mountains since I was little.

318
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,740
I'm familiar with this snow mountain.

319
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,740
They all call me A Lang Cai.

320
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,740
A Lang Cai?

321
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,740
He's the son of the snow mountain.

322
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,740
By the way, Boss Wu,

323
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,740
what are you guys doing here in the mountains?

324
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,740
Can you tell me?

325
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,740
Actually, even if I don't tell you,

326
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,740
you can guess it out, right?

327
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,740
I'm not a genius.

328
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,740
I'm just a genius.

329
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,740
I'm just a genius.

330
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,740
I'm just a genius.

331
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,740
I'm just a genius.

332
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,740
I'm just a genius.

333
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,740
I'm just a genius.

334
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,740
I'm just a genius.

335
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,740
I'm just asking.

336
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,740
Don't worry.

337
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,740
When you take us to the place,

338
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,740
I'll make sure you come back safely.

339
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,740
By the way,

340
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,740
they told me that

341
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,740
the herbivore on the snow mountain here

342
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,740
is very profitable.

343
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,740
Compared to the snow mountain guide

344
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,740
who is not good at it,

345
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,740
why don't you continue to pick herbs?

346
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,740
I'm not a professional guide.

347
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,740
It's rare to take guests to the mountains several times.

348
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,740
It's rare to take guests to the mountains several times.

349
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,740
It's not that deep.

350
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,740
It's not that deep.

351
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,740
Usually, it's covered by the girls' lake.

352
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,740
This is the first time I bring people here.

353
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,740
Don't joke with me.

354
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,740
Really?

355
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,740
I didn't lie to you.

356
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,740
Let me tell you the truth.

357
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,740
Now, in this season,

358
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,740
no one will bring you here.

359
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,740
If I don't bring you here,

360
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,740
you can only come here by yourself.

361
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,740
That's too dangerous.

362
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,740
If it weren't for the Buddha's blessing,

363
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,740
we would have died long ago.

364
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,740
It's a miracle

365
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,740
that we can come here without any trouble.

366
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,740
But don't worry.

367
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,740
Although I didn't bring anyone here,

368
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,740
I often go to the snow mountain.

369
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,740
I'm familiar with it.

370
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,740
I won't be in trouble.

371
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,740
You are not familiar with this place at all.

372
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,740
You still have to bring us here.

373
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,740
Do you really lack that little money?

374
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,740
Actually, I don't.

375
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,740
Mainly because of my dad.

376
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,740
My dad also brought a bunch of guests to the mountain.

377
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,740
And the way they walked was similar to yours.

378
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,740
But later,

379
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,740
none of them came back.

380
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,740
I remember that

381
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,740
the tourists at that time

382
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,740
were also in this season.

383
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,740
They had to go to the mountain.

384
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,740
So when I saw you,

385
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,740
I decided to bring you here.

386
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,740
Maybe this idea is very naive.

387
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,740
I think following you

388
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,740
can know what happened to my dad.

389
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,740
So you asked me the reason why we came up here.

390
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,740
You will never understand.

391
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,740
A person who knows that his father is always at the mountain.

392
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,740
But never can see his feelings.

393
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,740
By the way, Mr. Wu.

394
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,740
I think you are different from others.

395
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,740
Don't say it out.

396
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,740
I'm afraid they have some concerns.

397
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,740
Especially that

398
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,740
the person who brought you here.

399
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,740
I don't know.

400
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,740
I think you are different from others.

401
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,740
I'm afraid they have some concerns.

402
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,740
Especially that

403
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,740
the person who brought you here.

404
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,740
What's wrong with you?

405
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,740
Go!

406
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,740
Go!

407
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,740
Go!

408
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,740
Go!

409
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,740
Old man.

410
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,740
Is this the Longziu treasure you said?

411
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,740
Tianbing is the first gate.

412
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,740
It's a good place.

413
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,740
From the small wind,

414
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,740
the dragon plate of the two mountains in the first gate

415
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,740
is full of energy.

416
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,740
This place is very special.

417
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,740
It's full of courage.

418
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,740
Grandpa.

419
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,740
You and Mr. Wu are right.

420
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,740
There must be a tomb down here.

421
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,740
Let's go.

422
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,740
The tomb of the first gate

423
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,740
Zhai Gui.

424
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,740
Bro.

425
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,740
Zhai Gui.

426
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,740
Zhang San.

427
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,740
Zhang San.

428
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,740
Inform the boss.

429
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,740
Jason took our back wall.

430
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,740
Probably when passing by a intersection,

431
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,740
someone drilled a hole.

432
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,740
Then the car in the road was broken.

433
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,740
He took us to a wrong place.

434
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,740
Don't play tricks on me.

435
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:06,740
The ghosts I caught are more clever than you.

436
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,740
Yes.

437
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,740
Yes.

438
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,740
You've grown up, haven't you?

439
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,740
You can do such a big thing.

440
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,740
But you?

441
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:18,740
You joined the outsiders to find your own family.

442
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,740
What do you think?

443
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,740
I don't want the Huo family to be the stray dogs of the Chou Du Kou.

444
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,740
The Huo family?

445
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,740
What do you mean by the Huo family?

446
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,740
You're the one who's been there.

447
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,740
The Huo family?

448
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,740
When did you become the owner of the Huo family?

449
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,740
Grandma.

450
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,740
Didn't you say you'd give the Huo family to me?

451
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,740
I don't want a Huo family controlled by the Chou Du Kou.

452
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,740
I'm not dead yet.

453
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,740
You want to be the owner?

454
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,740
What do you think, grandma?

455
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,740
Cooperation with the Chou Du Kou will only bring the Huo family into deep injustice.

456
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,740
All our efforts a few years ago were in vain.

457
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,740
We're taking a detour, grandma.

458
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:56,740
Are we really going to be stubborn and confused when we get old?

459
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,740
How dare you!

460
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,740
Get lost!

461
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,740
Get lost!

462
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,740
Get lost!

463
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,740
Get lost!

464
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,740
This is a small step for Fatty.

465
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:08,740
But this is a big step for Mo Jin Xiao Wei.

466
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,740
This is a big step.

467
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,740
It's worth the leap.

468
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,740
No wonder people say that

469
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,300
when you reach the Pong Lai

470
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,740
No wonder people say that when you reach the Pong Lai

471
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,740
you can't stop at the Chang Bai.

472
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,740
The scenery in the North,

473
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,740
the snowfall in the ten thousand miles,

474
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,740
it's too spectacular.

475
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,740
The Pong Lai

476
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,740
Shun Zi

477
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,740
You should also tell us about this place.

478
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,740
According to the legend of Chang Bai Mountain

479
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:48,740
there are three holy mountains here.

480
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,740
In the Yellow Emperor period, there was only one mountain.

481
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,740
When the rain was pouring,

482
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,740
they used a rope to cut the mountain.

483
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,740
One mountain became three mountains.

484
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,740
I heard from Grandpa that

485
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,740
the view seen in the three mountains is different.

486
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,740
For example, in our little holy mountain,

487
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,740
you can see the Great Holy Mountain and the Three Holy Mountains at the same time.

488
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,740
But in the Great Holy Mountain,

489
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,740
you can't see the Great Holy Mountain,

490
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,740
you can only see the Three Holy Mountains.

491
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,740
The strangest thing is that

492
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,740
in the military leader of the Three Holy Mountains,

493
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,740
you can not only see the Great and Small Holy Mountains,

494
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,740
but also see the sky-high peak

495
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,740
that is opposite to the Three Holy Mountains.

496
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,740
The sky-high peak is more dangerous than the Three Holy Mountains.

497
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,740
The adults carry heavy things.

498
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,740
Chang Chun, there is a sky-high peak above that can reach the sky.

499
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,740
It is the corridor between the human realm and the immortal realm.

500
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,740
If the weather is good,

501
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,740
you can see a rainbow-like light between them.

502
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,740
No, that's not right.

503
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,740
Shouldn't the sky-high peak be on the Three Holy Mountains?

504
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,740
Why are you going to the sky-high peak again?

505
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,740
I know this.

506
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,740
Before coming here, I specifically investigated this phenomenon.

507
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,740
I guess it was because of the construction of the sky-high peak.

508
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,740
Because of the wind and the snowfall around,

509
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,740
the sea-like gorge was formed.

510
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,740
Look, in the middle of the mountain,

511
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,740
the mid-year fog does not disperse,

512
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,740
forming a kind of fog.

513
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,740
So after the sea-like gorge is folded in,

514
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,740
it looks like the sky is in the sky.

515
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:07,740
Isn't the sea-like gorge only in the desert and the lake?

516
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:11,740
It is indeed very rare that the sea-like gorge can be formed in the snowy mountains.

517
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:15,740
I think it has something to do with the terrain here and the dragon's pulse.

518
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,740
Moreover, in this kind of natural conservation,

519
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,740
nothing strange happens.

520
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,740
The sky-high peak is a very rare phenomenon.

521
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

522
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

523
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

524
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

525
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

526
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

527
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

528
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

529
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

530
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

531
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

532
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

533
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

534
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

535
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

536
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

537
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

538
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

539
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

540
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

541
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

542
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

543
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

544
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

545
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

546
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

547
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

548
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

549
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

550
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

551
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

552
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

553
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,740
It is a very rare phenomenon.

554
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,740
