00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The End

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
My grandfather's notebook has always been this picture.

4
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Because there is no explanation, I don't know what he drew.

5
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Later, I found it by accident.

6
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh my god, isn't this Long Mai?

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Why didn't we find it before?

8
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
No wonder Qiu De Kao couldn't find it.

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
He turned Long Mai into a star in the sky.

10
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Isn't he unable to find the Milky Way?

11
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Three snakes and fish,

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
were found in the Seven Stars Palace,

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Guangxi Jing'er Palace,

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and Xisha Sea.

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
These three places are connected into an unobstructed out-of-the-water dragon.

16
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's the out-of-the-water dragon.

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But from the point of view of Feng Shui,

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
this Long Mai still lacks a dragon head.

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The Mount Changbai.

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's absolutely right. It's Mount Changbai.

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm telling you, you're really good. This is the Cloud Sky Palace.

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What?

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This is your shop?

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Come on.

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm going to the toilet.

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm going to the toilet.

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Is your uncle waiting for you there?

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
He didn't tell me.

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Have something to eat.

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm going to get something to eat.

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What?

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Why are you so sad?

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You're learning to sing.

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You're thinking about An Ning?

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Hurry up and go to sleep.

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Okay.

37
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Take a picture of me.

38
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
If you don't want to take a picture,

39
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I can't help it.

40
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
But in fact,

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
we didn't hurt you at all.

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But those people you've always believed in,

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
may not be so reliable.

44
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's not a bad thing to leave a way for yourself.

45
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Da da da.

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm going to the toilet.

47
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Tomo and Jerry.

48
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Jerry.

49
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Mr. Jason,

50
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
would you like something to drink?

51
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Ning, please bring some coffee for our guest.

52
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I don't understand how you can be so relaxed.

64
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The deadline is approaching,

65
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
and we haven't been able to find the Copperfish.

66
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Mr. Jason,

67
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
there's no need to rush.

68
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The team of Wu Sanxing and Wu Shen

69
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
have already reached the Cloud Palace.

70
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Isn't that exactly why we should rush?

71
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You are too impatient.

72
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Keep it together.

73
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The palace is more dangerous

74
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
than all the terms we have explored combined.

75
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's the ultimate secret of Wang Zanghai.

76
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We must be extra careful.

77
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Wu Sanxing and his team are experienced.

78
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
With them taking the lead at the risk,

79
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
we will be able to reap the reward at the end.

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Listen,

81
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I have planted eyes in their team.

82
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
We will be informed if anything turns up.

83
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Okay?

84
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Wu Xie, you finally answered.

85
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I must explain to you something.

86
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Jason has received information

87
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
and is also going to Chen Banshan.

88
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Wu Xie, you may not believe me,

89
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
but I still have to remind you

90
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Jason's men are acting as police officers

91
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
and are investigating the case at the station.

92
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You must be careful.

93
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I will be there.

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I will be there.

95
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I will be there.

96
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I will be there.

97
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I will be there.

98
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I will be there.

99
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I will be there.

100
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Thank you, Jason.

101
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You...

102
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What are you doing?

103
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yunxi...

104
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yunxi...

105
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
What's wrong?

106
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Someone is following me.

107
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Who?

108
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I don't know.

109
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Maybe it's Jason or Qiu Dakao.

110
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Anyway, they are all the same.

111
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
They are all the same.

112
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
No, you...

113
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Don't think about it.

114
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You can't, right?

115
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I can't.

116
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What is this?

117
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You gave it to me.

118
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I hope it's a call.

119
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Do you believe him?

120
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Of course not.

121
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What's wrong with you?

122
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm fine.

123
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
No, I...

124
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Qiu Dakao has a lot of eyes.

125
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
We should be careful.

126
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Hello?

127
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm back.

128
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Where are you?

129
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
No.

130
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:28,240
Where are the

131
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
other people?

132
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm in the shop.

133
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Where are you?

134
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Where did you go?

135
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm in the shop.

136
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Hey.

137
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You still want to come back?

138
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You don't plan to buy medicine in the shop, do you?

139
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm here to buy a bag.

140
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You are the one who wants to buy a bag.

141
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Come back soon.

142
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Come back and find me.

143
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Here.

144
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Where is the stuff?

145
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I just came back.

146
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You don't know how to get the money.

147
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You are like a debtor to me.

148
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What's this?

149
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I don't have it.

150
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You are playing with me.

151
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The owner is waiting for the painting.

152
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Can you stop playing with me?

153
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I can't give you money.

154
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I really don't have it.

155
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Brother, don't tease me.

156
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm back.

157
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I like to see you like this.

158
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Get out of here.

159
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Serious.

160
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'll be back soon if you sell it.

161
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Really?

162
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You want to eat it?

163
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Really?

164
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm telling you, the owner is from Hong Kong.

165
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Last week, he gave out 9 times the value of a 5-billion-yuan real thing.

166
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You really don't have a 10-billion-yuan real thing.

167
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Are you sure it's real?

168
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Hey, where is he?

169
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Guangxi?

170
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Okay, I know.

171
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Thank you.

172
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That's it.

173
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You little...

174
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Mr. Wang.

175
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Oh my god, I didn't lock the door.

176
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What time is it?

177
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's closed.

178
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm sorry.

179
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Mr. Wang.

180
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Please help me see how to get this painting.

181
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I can't see it.

182
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I have a business trip in a few days.

183
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Please, Mr. Wang.

184
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I asked around and many people found you.

185
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
They said you used to be an expert in this field.

186
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You do big business.

187
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
My family is sick and in a hurry to get money.

188
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That's why I sold the things from my ancestors.

189
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Okay.

190
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But I have to say something.

191
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You don't have to take out the new house.

192
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I have to see the craftsmanship of the old house.

193
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
No.

194
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
This is the real thing.

195
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The real thing of Tang Yin.

196
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's really Tang Yin.

197
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It must be Tang Yin.

198
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Okay, okay.

199
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
If you succeed this time,

200
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'll pay you back for what I owe you.

201
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Okay.

202
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Take a look.

203
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What?

204
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'll stop talking.

205
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Let's open the door and see the mountain.

206
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
If Mr. Yu's painting is okay,

207
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
let's move on to the next step.

208
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Okay?

209
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Mr. Yu.

210
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Can you let our boss see the painting first?

211
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
He feels a little impatient.

212
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Okay, okay.

213
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm willing to take this painting.

214
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But I have to pay a few days.

215
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I can't pay this money at once.

216
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What do you mean?

217
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Our painting is so expensive.

218
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You have to hesitate for a few days.

219
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You misunderstood.

220
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
This is not a small amount.

221
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Moreover, this gentleman wants cash.

222
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Can you reserve it for me for a few days?

223
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's okay.

224
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Pay the deposit first.

225
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Pay the deposit first.

226
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You say, I say.

227
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
How about this?

228
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Pay the deposit first.

229
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Give one point to the three-day deposit.

230
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Mr. Wang.

231
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
But this deposit

232
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
is not guaranteed to us.

233
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's hard to say if Mr. Yu

234
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
will take the deposit and never return it.

235
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm not that kind of person.

236
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Everyone thinks the same.

237
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Then are you willing to leave us three days?

238
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
This is the electronic contract.

239
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Please have a look.

240
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
If Mr. Wang can make this guarantee,

241
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
we will be assured.

242
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But we also need some collateral.

243
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's all listed here.

244
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
If you don't have any questions,

245
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
please sign it.

246
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
What do you mean?

247
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Take my store as collateral?

248
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You misunderstood, Mr. Wang.

249
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
We just need a guarantee.

250
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
If Mr. Yu appears with this painting three days later,

251
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
you certainly don't have to pay any price.

252
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm sorry.

253
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Sorry.

254
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
The number you have dialed cannot be connected for the time being.

255
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Please redial later.

256
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm sorry.

257
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The number you have dialed cannot be connected for the time being.

258
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Try again later.

259
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
The customer you have dialled can't be connected.

260
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Boss Jiang.

261
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Shi Jing.

262
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
That Mr. Yu...

263
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Mr. Wang, this is me.

264
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Mr. Wang...

265
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Mr. Wang?

266
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You...

267
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You...

268
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,400
You set me up, didn't you?

269
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
What's your purpose?

270
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,000
You just want to take over my store?

271
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,400
You're full of shit, aren't you?

272
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,400
Mr. Wang, can I tell you my purpose?

273
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,200
I'm working with you with kindness.

274
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,900
You're generous?

275
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,100
If you're generous,

276
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,400
I don't need your travel contract.

277
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,400
I'll give you a corresponding salary.

278
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,900
And I just want you to do me a small favor.

279
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,200
I tell you, I don't even admit your contract.

280
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,000
You know?

281
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,700
What contract? I don't admit it.

282
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
And that little thing.

283
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,000
I really don't have time to serve you.

284
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,400
I just want you to help me with the fraud.

285
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,200
And report to me about his situation.

286
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,600
I don't do this kind of thing, you know?

287
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,400
Don't be so hasty.

288
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,400
I just want to know the move of the fraud.

289
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,400
I can help you solve some problems when necessary.

290
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,000
Think about it.

291
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,600
It's no surprise to you.

292
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,800
And do you still have the right to say no?

293
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,000
That contract is legally valid.

294
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,400
Hello.

295
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:46,800
Hello.

296
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,740
What's the matter?

297
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,740
No matter how you see it,

298
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,740
you wouldn't have a single thought of breaking up.

299
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:36,740
Why?

300
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,740
You say not picking me up based on a secret harmony?

301
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,300
That sister...

302
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
You look so ugly, man.

303
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,500
I've drops in my eyes recently.

304
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,940
Just one good-looking girl.

305
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,140
Madam.

306
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,980
You seem interested.

307
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:58,740
Have a sir.

308
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,240
Okay.

309
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,900
Yeah

310
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,960
Come on let's finish this

311
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,260
No, you don't have time

312
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,260
Come on, drink

313
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,000
Just a little more

314
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:11,980
Drink że tam

315
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,260
Go away

316
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,440
Just a little more

317
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,840
Ok ok ok

318
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,420
Drinkmee

319
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,740
One more

320
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,400
Cheers!

321
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,400
Here, cheers!

322
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,400
Try to drink, cheers!

323
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
You guys drink, you guys drink!

324
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
Go find more!

325
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
You guys are all useless!

326
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,400
Boss, your drink is on my shirt.

327
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
Boss, your shirt is expensive.

328
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,400
Hang it!

329
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,400
You...

330
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,400
Don't think I don't want to...

331
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,400
Don't move!

332
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,400
Hurry, hurry!

333
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,400
Hurry, hurry!

334
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,400
Boss!

335
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
Xie Yuchen!

336
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,400
Long time no see, Jason.

337
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,400
What do you mean?

338
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,400
Nothing.

339
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,400
I'm just making friends with you.

340
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,400
Is this the way you old nine-dwellers make friends?

341
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,400
This is the way I make friends.

342
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,400
Making friends is a prerequisite.

343
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,400
The prerequisite is that you have to know your situation.

344
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,400
You can be my friend, or not.

345
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
I'm afraid you're not counting.

346
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
Does it count?

347
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,400
It doesn't count.

348
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,400
You can try.

349
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,400
I'm willing to accompany you.

350
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,400
But you haven't found the Cloud Sky Palace yet.

351
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,400
You're just going to be a big head here.

352
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,400
I think your boss is not very happy.

353
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,400
Xie Yuchen, just like I said.

354
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,400
Two losses and one loss are not good situations.

355
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,400
So you'd better not provoke me.

356
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,400
That's why I never beat a dog that bites people.

357
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
Jason, you've been dragging me around.

358
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,400
I've already given you a lot of respect for today.

359
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,400
What do you want?

360
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,400
It's simple.

361
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,400
I want to give you a chance to cooperate.

362
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,400
A chance to cooperate?

363
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,400
You've been looking for the Cloud Sky Palace.

364
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
It's in Mount Changbai.

365
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,400
How do you know?

366
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,400
I have my own source of information.

367
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,400
And I know that Qiu Decao will stop you.

368
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,400
And he'll use an excuse that sounds good.

369
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,400
For example, let Wu Xie be the target and explore the road first.

370
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,400
Do you think I'll believe you?

371
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,400
Believe it or not, it's your business.

372
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,400
But I only know that you don't believe in Qiu Decao.

373
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,400
You know better than anyone that remote operation can never catch up with real action.

374
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:28,400
If I were you, I wouldn't want to waste a minute of your time and effort.

375
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,400
But Wu Xie has already left.

376
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,400
You still have time to go.

377
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
I know where they will meet.

378
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,400
Xie Yuchen, what do you want?

379
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,400
It's simple.

380
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
Someone stole my Snake Eye Copper Fish.

381
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
I want you to help me get it back.

382
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
It doesn't matter if it fails.

383
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,400
It's okay to cause them some trouble.

384
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,400
I want them to know that my Xie Yuchen's stuff is not easy to get.

385
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,400
That's it?

386
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,400
And I want the information about the underwater tomb and the archaeological team.

387
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,400
I think you know that you've already attracted the police's attention.

388
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:34,400
If you don't have my help, it may take a few more days for you to handle it yourself.

389
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,400
It may take a few more days.

390
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,400
Wu Xie and the others have already left.

391
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,400
If you're a few days late, you should just go back to the US.

392
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,400
Didn't your company put pressure on you?

393
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,400
If your company knows that you've been excluded from the plan,

394
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,400
what will happen to you after you return to the US?

395
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,400
I'll just go back to the US.

396
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
Then I'll thank you for your kindness.

397
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,400
Water.

398
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,400
An Ning, I think Jason is up to something soon.

399
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,400
Why don't you go to Changbai Mountain?

400
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,400
It's better if you stay with Wu Xie.

401
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
Ah.

402
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,400
Shh.

403
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
They are mutiny police.

404
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,400
No.

405
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,400
Hurry up.

406
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,400
Then I...

407
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,400
Hurry up.

408
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,400
What kind of road is this?

409
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,400
They are mutiny police.

410
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,400
How do you know?

411
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,400
Didn't you see that they were mutiny?

412
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,400
They were all mutiny.

413
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,400
The rest are guns.

414
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,400
Then do you think they came for us?

415
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,400
Didn't you say before that you've been investigated once?

416
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,400
Thank you.

417
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,400
Then may I ask, who are you?

418
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,400
Where are you going?

419
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Changbai Mountain.

420
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,400
We're going to that area.

421
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,400
Let's take a walk.

422
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,400
Let's go.

423
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,400
You're so capable.

424
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,400
You're so bad.

425
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,400
Look at Xiao Ge.

426
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,400
Big boss, big boss.

427
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,400
Let's go.

428
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,400
Let's go.

429
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,400
Let's go.

430
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,400
Let's go.

431
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
Let's go.

432
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,400
Let's go.

433
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,400
Let's go.

434
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,400
Where are you going?

435
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,400
Let me ask.

436
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,400
Where are you going?

437
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,400
Where are you going?

438
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,400
Are you going to take a taxi?

439
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,400
Come on.

440
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,400
Sir, sir.

441
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,400
Come with me.

442
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,400
My car is over there.

443
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,400
It's close.

444
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,400
Come on.

445
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,400
We're going to this place.

446
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,400
Okay, let's go.

447
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,400
What do you mean?

448
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
Let's go.

449
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,400
I'm going to this place too.

450
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,400
Let's go.

451
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,400
My car is over there.

452
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,400
Let's go.

453
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,400
Over there?

454
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,400
Yes, yes.

455
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,400
Come on.

456
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,400
Sir, sir.

457
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,400
Let's go.

458
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,400
What are you doing?

459
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,400
What are you doing?

460
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,400
Come on, come on.

461
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,400
Let's go.

462
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,400
Slow down.

463
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,400
We're almost there.

464
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,400
Hold on.

465
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,400
Let's go.

466
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,400
Don't worry.

467
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,400
This way.

468
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
Sit down.

469
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,400
Come on.

470
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,400
Sit inside.

471
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,400
Sit down.

472
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,400
Sit down.

473
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,400
Listen,

474
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,400
it's snowing heavily now.

475
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,400
It's hard to get to the place you're going to.

476
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,400
Not many people can get there.

477
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,400
Luckily, you met me.

478
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,400
If you can get there,

479
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,400
you're in big trouble.

480
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,400
You have good taste.

481
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
How did you know?

482
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,400
You have a pair of scissors on your hands.

483
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,400
And a pair of earplugs.

484
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,400
You're wearing a leather jacket.

485
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,400
And when I saw the way you hold the steering wheel,

486
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,400
it means I was right.

487
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,400
Is that necessary?

488
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,400
You're amazing, sir.

489
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,400
Wait, we're on the same boat.

490
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,400
What's your number?

491
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,400
What's wrong?

492
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,240
The

493
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,400
You're all useless.

494
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,400
You lost your roots.

495
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,400
And you got caught by the police.

496
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,400
Boss,

497
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
they're on the mountain road.

498
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,400
Our car is stuck.

499
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,400
I got it.

500
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,400
Go get a new car.

501
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,400
Go to Changbai Inn.

502
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,400
Yes, sir.

503
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,400
Changbai Inn

504
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,400
This way.

505
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,400
Fatty.

506
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
How much?

507
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,400
300.

508
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,400
Okay, 300 is 300.

509
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,400
Here you go.

510
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,400
Thank you, sir.

511
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,400
Thank you, sir.

512
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
I tell you, you gave too much.

513
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,400
How could I give you that much?

514
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,400
Seriously.

515
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,400
This way.

516
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,400
This dog is nice.

517
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,400
Let's go.

518
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,400
Uncle Hai.

519
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,400
Uncle Hai.

520
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,400
What are you doing here?

521
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,400
You're here.

522
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,400
So you're Mr. San.

523
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,400
I'm an advisor.

524
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,400
I'm not worth mentioning.

525
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,400
Mr. San,

526
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,400
why are you here?

527
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,400
I'm here to see my uncle.

528
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,400
Do you know where he is?

529
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,400
Your uncle?

530
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,400
Your uncle is a man of great power.

531
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,400
How can I see him?

532
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,400
Boy,

533
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,400
I'm very curious.

534
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:01,400
Why are you here with Chen Pi and Si?

535
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,400
Who?

536
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,400
The old man on the street.

537
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,400
You should call him

538
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,400
Grandpa Si.

539
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,400
Fatty.

540
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,400
You're from the same team, right?

541
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,400
What are you doing here?

542
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,400
We're from the extreme sports club.

543
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,400
We're invited to take part in the ski resort test.

544
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,400
Ski resort?

545
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,400
Yes.

546
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,400
We're going to build a ski resort here.

547
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,400
We'll check it out first.

548
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,400
See if it's suitable.

549
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,400
If it's not,

550
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,400
we'll go to the ski resort.

551
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,400
Okay.

552
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,400
Thank you.

553
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,400
Thank you.

554
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,400
Thank you.

555
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,400
Thank you.

556
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,400
Thank you.

557
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400
Thank you.

558
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,400
Thank you.

559
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,400
Thank you.

560
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,400
Thank you.

561
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,400
See if it's suitable.

562
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,400
If it's suitable,

563
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,400
the ski resort and the resort can be built

564
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,400
and it can also move the local economy.

565
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,400
That's good.

566
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,400
But don't go to the mountains.

567
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,400
It's not safe.

568
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,400
Of course.

569
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,400
We have so many people.

570
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,400
I can't afford to be alone.

571
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,400
I have to be careful.

572
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,400
Okay.

573
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,400
Open the trunk and check it.

574
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,400
How is the scenery in the mountains this season?

575
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,400
The four seasons are beautiful.

576
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,400
Summer and autumn are more crowded.

577
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,400
But winter

578
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,400
is not as beautiful as it seems.

579
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,400
It's just too cold.

580
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,400
The weather changes every three days.

581
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,400
It's not safe.

582
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,400
I don't recommend it.

583
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,400
Okay, okay.

584
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,400
Let's go.

585
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,400
Be careful.

586
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,400
Thank you.

587
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,400
I can't see it.

588
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,400
The four grandpas are much younger

589
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,400
than the autumn test.

590
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,400
Probably.

591
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,400
Is he old enough to go to Mount Changbai?

592
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,400
Do you remember?

593
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,400
His skills are still there.

594
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,400
Last night on the train,

595
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
his body and speed

596
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,400
are not inferior to the young.

597
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
The young are the most important.

598
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,400
Yes.

599
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
The young are the most important.

600
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,400
You are right.

601
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,400
I'm not sure.

602
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
I don't think so.

603
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,400
I don't think so.

604
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,400
I don't think so.

605
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,400
I don't think so.

606
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,400
I don't think so.

607
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,400
I don't think so.

608
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,400
I don't think so.

609
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,400
I don't think so.

610
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,400
I don't think so.

611
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,400
The speed is not inferior to the young.

612
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,400
Yes.

613
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,400
He is the one mentioned by Kuaxiong.

614
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,400
You think this kind of person

615
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,400
can only be found

616
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,400
in martial arts novels.

617
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,400
The four grandpas are good.

618
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,400
We were really blind just now.

619
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,400
We were really blind.

620
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,400
I'm not saying you are blind.

621
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,400
I...

622
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,400
He is not blind.

623
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,400
Young Master San,

624
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,400
you are here too.

625
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,400
Pan Zi.

626
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,400
Pan Zi.

627
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,400
I cleaned the room.

628
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,400
Pan Zi, why are you here?

629
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,400
Young Master San told me to wait here.

630
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,400
Uncle San?

631
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,400
Uncle San?

632
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,400
Uncle San?

633
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
Uncle San?

634
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
Uncle San?

635
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,400
Uncle San?

636
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,400
Uncle San?

637
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,400
Uncle San?

638
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,400
Uncle San?

639
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,400
Uncle San?

640
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,400
Uncle San?

641
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,400
Uncle San?

642
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,400
Uncle San?

643
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,400
Where is Uncle San?

644
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,400
He went down.

645
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,400
I thought he went with you.

646
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,400
He said if he didn't go down,

647
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,400
he would have to wait for several days.

648
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:54,240
Did you come for the fake

649
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,400
lambs?

650
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,400
Pan Zi, I'm a little tired today.

651
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,400
I'll go back to my room to rest.

652
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,400
I'll find you later.

653
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,400
Okay.

654
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,400
You have a good rest.

655
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,400
I'll go find Xiangdao.

656
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,400
Okay.

657
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,400
I'll go back first, Pan Zi.

658
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,400
Okay.

659
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,400
Okay.

660
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,400
Uncle Hai.

661
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,400
Such a big storm.

662
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,400
I thought you guys wouldn't come.

663
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,400
How could we, Uncle Hai?

664
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,400
You know that this is a wish of Mr. Hai for many years.

665
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,400
And you said that Wu Xie and the others have already come?

666
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,400
Will you go that way?

667
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,400
Not today.

668
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,400
We'll wait at the top.

669
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,400
Yes, Master.

670
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,400
Okay.

671
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,400
Let's go inside.

672
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,400
Go?

673
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,400
Are you going in first?

674
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,400
Yes.

675
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,400
Wait.

676
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,400
Come.

677
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,400
I'm going in first.

678
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,400
Wait.

679
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,400
It's the wrong side.

680
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,400
It設 adjustable by travel.

681
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,400
We'll move up a little?

682
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,400
Yes!

683
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,400
What?

684
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,400
You're going in first?

685
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,400
You are already a youth?

686
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,400
Forget about��

687
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,400
Where did the people go?

688
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,400
Let's not go up the mountain.

689
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,040
There's no other way?

690
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:41,800
Although Uncle Hai is the chopsticks of Jiala Ma,

691
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,640
I think Chen Ping A-Si is the key figure.

692
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,520
If he can cooperate with us,

693
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,600
but he has a strange temper,

694
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,880
let him handle everything.

695
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,880
Pan Zi.

696
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,480
You said Uncle Hai is the chopsticks of Jiala Ma?

697
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,400
Why can't he tell me clearly?

698
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,000
He probably doesn't know you're here to Jiala Ma.

699
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,400
Impossible.

700
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,800
This time I came to Changbai Mountain for the Chou De Kao.

701
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,800
Uncle Hai was sent by Chou De Kao.

702
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,800
How could he not know why I came?

703
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
You think too much.

704
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,400
What are you thinking?

705
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,000
That Uncle Hai has a very good sense of direction.

706
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,600
He's a very good person.

707
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,200
He's a very good person.

708
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,800
He's a very good person.

709
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,400
He's a very good person.

710
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,200
What?

711
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,800
That Uncle Hai is likely to cooperate with Chou De Kao.

712
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
So he's embarrassed to see you.

713
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,000
It's awkward.

714
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,400
Actually, I tell you,

715
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:45,000
the most important thing is to find a way to go up the mountain.

716
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,400
I'm talking to you.

717
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,000
I want to, too.

718
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,400
But look at the snow.

719
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,600
We can only wait.

720
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,600
And I don't know if Uncle Hai has already gone up.

721
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,600
Fatty.

722
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,800
You...

723
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,200
You come along.

724
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:05,800
Oh, I'll fly

725
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,800
Oh, I'll

726
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,800
Oh, I'll

727
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:19,800
Oh, I'll

728
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,800
《 追着云 追着风》

729
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,800
《 追着云 追着风》

730
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,800
《 追着云 追着风》

731
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,800
一路经忘了自己怎么抵达

732
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,800
一路经忘了自己怎么抵达

733
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,800
穿过夜 穿过雾

734
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,800
谜底在黑暗中得到了回答

735
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,800
谜底在黑暗中得到了回答

736
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,800
时光的芳心藏匿着

737
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,800
时光的芳心藏匿着

738
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,800
盛开灿烂的花

739
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,800
盛开灿烂的花

740
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,800
围之的枝上

741
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,800
围之的枝上

742
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,800
围之的枝上

743
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,800
围之的枝上
