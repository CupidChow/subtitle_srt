00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's just made.

4
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's also a good old jade.

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Third, I know.

7
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's not easy for your family to get to Wu Xie's level.

8
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You were worried about getting to Wu Xie's level and then going into the water, right?

9
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That's the only root of the family.

10
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's so young.

11
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's not good to be a good person.

12
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You have to go to the dead end.

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You little bastard.

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You can't say that.

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Let go if you have to.

16
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Do you know what island Wu Xie is in?

17
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's in Guangxi.

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's the place where Chen Piya died.

19
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's a good thing for young people to exercise and have a good time.

20
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You've said all the right things.

21
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'll let that kid call you uncle.

22
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That's what you said, Third.

23
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm telling you, I didn't hide anything from you.

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I heard you were looking for the Xie family.

25
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What are you doing?

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's just some news.

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I heard that the young master of the Xie family offended Chen Piya.

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
These young people are still losing money.

29
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Chen Piya?

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
He's been buried half a month.

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Xie Yuchen offended him.

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Chen Piya is gone,

33
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
but his disciple is still here.

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Forget it. He's almost gone.

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What's the use of his disciple?

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Third, you...

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You've been in this island for so long.

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Isn't it a life of honor to live?

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You think he can't just sit and do nothing about Chen Piya's face?

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
If he's trampled on by someone,

41
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
how can he do anything about it?

42
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Besides, Chen Piya and Xie Yuchen

43
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
are from the Jiumen family.

44
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
He's also a disciple of Er Yuehong.

45
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Maybe Chen Piya can really do something for Xie Yuchen.

46
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
If Second Master is expelled from the mountain,

47
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm afraid Chen Piya will never be able to do anything.

48
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
If he can do anything for Xie Yuchen,

49
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
he will be a complete failure.

50
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Besides, Chen Piya doesn't know he's alive.

51
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Don't bother me.

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
This is not what you're looking into.

53
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I can't hide anything from you, Third.

54
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes.

55
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I heard that something really happened to the Xie family.

56
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Xie Lianhuan's body was found.

57
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
How is that possible?

58
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I just heard about it.

59
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I don't know if it's true.

60
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
They say Xie Yuchen is going to make up for half of his funeral

61
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
and send out the snake-stained copper fish.

62
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But it sounds like it's true.

63
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Third, I find you're really interesting.

64
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You don't even care about your nephew.

65
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
How can you care about the Xie family?

66
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I don't care about the Xie family.

67
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I only care about the snake-stained copper fish.

68
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
This priest has a hard time living in the underground.

69
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We risked our lives to save him.

70
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Is that a merit for them?

71
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So, what do you think if you ask them to marry Kun Na to me as a exchange?

72
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I don't know.

73
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The Xie family

74
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's been so many years.

75
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Why haven't you changed?

76
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Elder, get up.

77
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Elder, why haven't you changed?

78
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Elder, this is our friend.

79
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
He's not your old leader.

80
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Do you have any misunderstanding?

81
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I won't admit my mistake.

82
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's been so many years.

83
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Why haven't you changed?

84
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's impossible.

85
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Sit.

86
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Sit.

87
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Your friend is too much like our old leader.

89
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I've been trapped in the underground for over 40 years.

90
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I can't see the sun.

91
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Anyone could go crazy.

92
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I don't know your identity.

93
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I don't know what you're going to do.

94
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So I have to stop you.

95
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I won't let you go in there.

96
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You can't go there again.

97
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
From the beginning,

98
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
it's an ominous place.

99
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Our village has been here for generations.

100
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The village is built on the mountain gods' eyebrows.

101
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Our duty is to protect the mountain gods.

102
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
If the mountain gods get angry,

103
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
the mountain will shake.

104
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The suffering in the tower will fall on the earth.

105
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So we have to worship the mountain gods every year.

106
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Worship the mountain gods and bless us.

107
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Go!

108
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Go!

109
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Go!

110
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Go!

111
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Legend has it that the monster in the tower

112
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
will bring the people to the earth.

113
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Watch out! Help him up.

114
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
This man's appearance

115
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
is a series of bad luck.

116
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I suspect he's the monster in the tower.

117
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Who are you?

118
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm a history teacher at Wuhan University.

119
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I brought some students to the tower

120
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
to collect some data.

121
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But I didn't expect a lot of strange things to happen.

122
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Then I met an enemy.

123
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I beg you to save my students.

124
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Please save my students.

125
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Are you sure your students fell from the tower?

126
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yes.

127
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Let's go.

128
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Let's go.

129
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Let's go.

130
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Let's go.

131
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Hurry.

132
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
No one fell from the tower.

133
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You're here to take the treasure.

134
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You killed my people.

135
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You're so cruel.

136
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'll kill you.

137
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Go!

138
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Go!

139
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Sorry.

140
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Chen Pia Si's eyes

141
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
are blind when they shake.

142
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
My grandfather told me about this.

143
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
The leader took them to search the jungle.

144
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Suddenly, they heard a explosion.

145
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
The leader knew something bad was going on.

146
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So he called them to the tower.

147
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Who are you?

148
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Why did you go down?

149
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I...

150
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I don't know who triggered the trap.

151
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
The underground palace collapsed.

152
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I was afraid they were in danger.

153
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
So I went down to check.

154
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You're lying.

155
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The rule of our tribe

156
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
is to kill people if they make mistakes.

157
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
If they make mistakes,

158
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
our leader will kill them.

159
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Like a bull.

160
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
His eyes will be destroyed.

161
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Elder Kuwa.

162
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Can you tell me

163
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
what kind of secret is buried there?

164
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Let the secret

165
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
be buried with the underground palace.

166
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Don't hurt yourself

167
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
because of greed.

168
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Everyone.

169
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Elder Kuwa is not fully recovered.

170
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Let him rest.

171
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Rest.

172
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Ready to open the coffin.

173
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
This is the body of Xie Lian Huan.

174
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
They have made several

175
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
very difficult bones.

176
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
They are real.

177
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The secret was lost.

178
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Xie Lian Huan got one.

179
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
This is the most likely one.

180
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
But Xie Yushen's foster father died.

181
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
He agreed to Xie family soon.

182
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
He is a tough character.

183
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
This time, it's not easy.

184
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Be careful.

185
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Do you think our family

186
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
is just for fun?

187
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Just a few local masters.

188
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Master Hua.

189
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Why did you do this?

190
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I've been investigating for years.

191
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
If someone didn't do it on purpose,

192
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I wouldn't have found nothing.

193
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Although I don't know who that person is,

194
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
it must be related to my uncle's death.

195
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's related to the snake's tail.

196
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
But my uncle's body

197
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
must be related to the person who killed him.

198
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
medida

199
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
blood

200
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:08,360
blood

201
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,400
Shut the door.

202
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,400
Catch a Ingredient.

203
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,400
Oh

204
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,400
Oh

205
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,960
Oh

206
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,220
Oh

207
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,720
Oh

208
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,680
Oh

209
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,680
The target has reached the target area.

210
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,680
The target has reached the target area.

211
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,680
Who is it?

212
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,680
It's like a beast.

213
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,680
Huayan, once the target is in the hands of Chen Pi,

214
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,680
it's different from what we're thinking.

215
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,680
You're right,

216
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,680
but I think it's better to wait until the target is in the hands of Chen Pi.

217
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,680
No...

218
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,680
I think we should wait until the target is in the hands of Chen Pi.

219
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,680
But...

220
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,680
I think we should wait until the target is in the hands of Chen Pi.

221
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,680
Sigh...

222
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,680
The target is in the hands of Chen Pi.

223
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,680
The target is in the hands of Chen Pi.

224
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,680
The target is in the hands of Chen Pi.

225
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,680
The target is in the hands of Chen Pi.

226
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,680
The target is in the hands of Chen Pi.

227
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,680
The target is in the hands of Chen Pi.

228
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,680
The target is in the hands of Chen Pi.

229
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,680
The target is in the hands of Chen Pi.

230
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,680
The target is in the hands of Chen Pi.

231
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,680
The target is in the hands of Chen Pi.

232
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,680
The target is in the hands of Chen Pi.

233
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,680
The target is in the hands of Chen Pi.

234
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,680
The target is in the hands of Chen Pi.

235
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,680
The target is in the hands of Chen Pi.

236
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,680
You'll see.

237
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,680
What happened to you?

238
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,680
What did the shit boy do to you?

239
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,680
You're very resourceful.

240
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,680
I know very well that my mission in China is no secret to you.

241
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,680
You can easily look it up.

242
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,680
So is the company's intention behind my trip.

243
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,680
Jason, you lack experience.

244
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,680
You are new to the Chinese culture and Asian timber exploration.

245
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,680
We can't afford to underestimate the locals for generations.

246
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:16,680
They gave their lives in exchange for experience.

247
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,680
Hmm.

248
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,680
Do we have to be so stubborn?

249
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,680
This is different from our original intention.

250
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:59,680
Our purpose is to avenge our brothers.

251
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,680
This has never changed.

252
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,680
What's the difference?

253
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:09,680
But I didn't expect to hurt the children.

254
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,680
That's how it is.

255
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,680
Like a horse on a wall.

256
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,680
You can only get in but not back.

257
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,680
Otherwise, Wu Xie and the others will die more miserably.

258
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,680
Besides, he's not dead.

259
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,680
What are you afraid of?

260
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,680
He's your nephew.

261
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:42,680
I've never denied that.

262
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,680
You're so heartless.

263
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,680
You saw Wu Xie die.

264
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,680
You saw Wu Xie jump into the fire.

265
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,680
And Xie Zi.

266
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,680
Your indecision

267
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,680
will ruin us.

268
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,680
I've tried to persuade you many times.

269
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,680
But I can't listen.

270
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,680
You're dead!

271
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,680
The Ginger Palace was Wang Zanhai's final destination.

272
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,680
He left an object that we have neglected for the whole time.

273
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:42,680
Surely, with the copper fish, we could also unlock the secrets.

274
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,680
But if there's a shortcut, why not take it?

275
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,680
Was your motivation for letting Wu Xie go to the Ginger Palace?

276
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,680
He's attentive.

277
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,680
And usually has the odds with him.

278
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,680
If he goes to the Ginger Palace,

279
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:02,680
he will no doubt find the artifact left by the man who made the copper fish.

280
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,680
Something I haven't found for a long time.

281
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,680
What is it?

282
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,680
You were dead before.

283
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,680
You're not you anymore.

284
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,680
Our goal is revenge.

285
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,680
This has never changed.

286
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,680
Never!

287
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,680
Look at me.

288
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,680
Stand up.

289
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,680
I'm sorry.

290
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:54,680
It will make us all die.

291
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,680
Do you sleep this early every day?

292
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,680
I guessed right.

293
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,680
Sorry.

294
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,680
Maybe it's not a physical reason.

295
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,680
I'm sure he has a lot of things to hide from you.

296
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,680
What do you mean?

297
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,680
I know what I'm saying.

298
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,680
It's a little bit of a provocation.

299
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:34,680
And it will affect the image of Qiu Daikao in your heart.

300
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,680
But I'm telling the truth.

301
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,680
I believe you have feelings too.

302
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,680
Mr. Wu,

303
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:46,680
it's not like you're smart enough to slander your partner.

304
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,680
Well said.

305
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,680
Very well said.

306
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,680
So I think you're a good kid.

307
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,680
Good kid.

308
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,680
It's hard to survive.

309
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,680
It's so hard to follow the right path.

310
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,680
But there's something you need to remember.

311
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,680
What's the hardest thing in this world?

312
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,680
The heart.

313
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,680
I can only say so much to you.

314
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,680
And

315
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,680
the body of Miu Cun.

316
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,680
What did Qiu Daikao use it for?

317
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,680
He didn't report the results to the company.

318
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,680
And he put the blame on me. Why?

319
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,680
You're a person with a wild ambition.

320
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,680
Now you're looking at the same thing.

321
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,680
You're making ridiculous guesses.

322
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,680
Stop talking.

323
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,680
I'll go get Mr. Wu.

324
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,680
Look,

325
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:42,680
Qiu Daikao raised a child with such affection.

326
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,680
Miracle.

327
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,680
I'm sorry.

328
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,680
My friend is very happy to see you again.

329
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,680
I'm sorry.

330
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,680
I think you're looking for this.

331
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,680
I thought it was in Chen Pias' hands.

332
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,680
Yes.

333
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,680
I made a deal with Mr. Wu.

334
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,680
For this, the Wu family has made two shares.

335
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,680
Actually, you should know.

336
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,680
This thing is very important to me.

337
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,680
But for Jason,

338
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,680
it's not necessarily a good thing.

339
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,680
Go get Jason here.

340
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,680
Kid.

341
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,680
To get this,

342
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,680
Mr. Wu paid a high price.

343
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,680
How do I know if he was transferred?

344
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,680
This is the wisdom of the ancients.

345
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,680
I remind you,

346
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,680
once you open it, you can't restore it.

347
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,680
I didn't expect

348
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,680
Mr. Wu would talk business with me.

349
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,680
What's your offer?

350
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,680
The war country's book.

351
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,680
The war country's book is Mr. Qiu Daikao's property.

352
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,680
I can't make decisions for him.

353
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,680
You can.

354
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,680
Mr. Wu and Mr. Qiu Daikao have been working together for so long.

355
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,680
There are some things that I can't let go.

356
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,680
Kid.

357
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,680
Go ask Mr. Wu.

358
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,680
He likes to do business simply.

359
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,680
The simpler, the better.

360
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,680
Remember, I'll do business with you.

361
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,680
He and I have a business.

362
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,680
We only talk about interests, not feelings.

363
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,680
Okay?

364
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,680
Mr. Qiu Daikao has been studying the war country's book for so many years.

365
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,680
The pictures he scanned should...

366
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,680
I want the original.

367
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,680
The social media is in my hands.

368
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,680
I've been doing it for a while.

369
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,680
To be honest, it's not attractive to me.

370
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,680
Besides, Jason wants it now.

371
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,680
If it wasn't for me, I wouldn't have paid for this deal.

372
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,680
I don't care how you do business.

373
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,680
I just want to make a condition.

374
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,680
The jade box.

375
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,680
The original for the war country's book.

376
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,680
Jason.

377
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,680
Jason.

378
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,680
You owe me a favor.

379
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,680
Of course.

380
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,680
The company will remember.

381
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,680
Mr. Wu.

382
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,680
You've got the book.

383
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,680
Please open the lock for us.

384
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,680
Yes.

385
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,680
Mr. Wu must know how to open this lock.

386
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,680
That's right, I know.

387
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,680
It's simple.

388
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,680
But I'll make it clear.

389
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,680
Open the lock.

390
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,680
Okay.

391
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,680
Mr. Wu.

392
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,680
You have to open the lock.

393
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,680
Okay.

394
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,680
Mr. Wu.

395
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,680
You have to open the lock.

396
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,680
Okay.

397
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,680
Mr. Wu.

398
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,680
But I'll make it clear.

399
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,680
Open the lock.

400
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,680
Get the goods.

401
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,680
After opening it, the jade box can't be restored.

402
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,680
Okay?

403
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,680
I'll check the jade box.

404
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,680
Okay.

405
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,680
Open the lock.

406
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,680
Okay.

407
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,680
The analyzer.

408
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,680
Xie Yuhua put the analyzer in there.

409
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:59,680
Wu San Shen, since this is a smoke, the deal just now was not valid.

410
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,680
I just made it very clear.

411
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,680
Take the jade box and exchange it for the original sword of the Warring States.

412
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,680
It's a jade box, not a snake sister's agreement. Okay?

413
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,680
You knew that the box was a smoke, right?

414
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,680
I really didn't know.

415
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,680
But I know who the Fourth Master is.

416
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,680
What do you mean?

417
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,680
The Fourth Master is a master of making fakes.

418
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,680
Anything that he does, whether it's the original sword or not,

419
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,680
depends on luck.

420
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,680
Really. I'm innocent. I really don't know.

421
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,680
So this locator is also from the Zhenpiya case.

422
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,680
What's the use of it?

423
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,680
I said take it away.

424
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:45,680
I believe you will definitely get the real jade.

425
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,680
Everyone, thank you.

426
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,680
Why give up the silk book?

427
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,680
Mr. Jason, don't be nervous.

428
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,680
I trust that Wu She will promise Wu San Shen,

429
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,680
which is much more valuable than a map for the Cloud Sky Palace.

430
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,680
I'm going.

431
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,680
Didn't we already talk about this?

432
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,680
I don't want you to go.

433
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,680
It's dangerous there.

434
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,680
No matter if it's dangerous there,

435
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,680
I must go.

436
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,680
I must see Third Uncle and hear him tell me.

437
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,680
That's my biggest wish.

438
00:35:54,680 --> 00:36:01,680
But I can't explain the situation in the Black Crystal Cave.

439
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:09,680
At that time, the explosion came too suddenly.

440
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:16,680
My priest's seal fell into a crack in the open.

441
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,680
I climbed down along the crack.

442
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,680
After going down,

443
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,680
I felt like I was in another world.

444
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,680
In that Black Crystal Cave,

445
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,680
there were black stones everywhere.

446
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,680
When I saw the black stones,

447
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,680
I climbed and climbed.

448
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,680
I went to look for the seal.

449
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,680
I saw the seal was there.

450
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,680
But I couldn't find it.

451
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,680
I looked this way.

452
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,680
There was a seal here.

453
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,680
I looked this way.

454
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,680
There was a seal here too.

455
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,680
There were black stones everywhere.

456
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,680
I don't know how long it was.

457
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,680
Right here,

458
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,680
I discovered that secret.

459
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,680
When I was going out,

460
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,680
I couldn't find the way in.

461
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,680
I climbed everywhere.

462
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,680
On my face,

463
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,680
my face was everywhere.

464
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,680
I was in a state of collapse.

465
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,680
I was caught, I was beaten,

466
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,680
my hair was messed up.

467
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,680
My eyes were blocked.

468
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,680
I couldn't see the side.

469
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,680
I climbed and climbed.

470
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:16,680
I finally climbed out.

471
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:22,680
But the most terrifying thing was

472
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:30,680
I felt like I had been in there for a year.

473
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,680
But when I came out,

474
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,680
I had to restrain the bodies of our tribe.

475
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:42,680
Those bodies had just begun to decay.

476
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,680
It was only a few days after that.

477
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,680
Elder,

478
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,680
I know all the dangers you mentioned.

479
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:59,680
But there are things I still have to do.

480
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,680
This is the map I drew.

481
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,680
There are many

482
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,680
hot spots and dangers there.

483
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,680
Elder.

484
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,680
You must be careful.

485
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,680
I will.

486
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,680
Okay.

487
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,680
Thank you, Elder.

488
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,680
We don't have much time.

489
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,680
We might have to leave now.

490
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,680
Thank you, Elder.

491
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,680
Elder.

492
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,680
Why did you have to leave so early?

493
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,680
Kun Na will be worried if I'm not around tomorrow.

494
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,680
Why don't you stay and say goodbye?

495
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,680
I have to follow you.

496
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,680
Didn't the Elder say it was dangerous?

497
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,680
I'll explain to him later.

498
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,680
I hope you won't be disturbed again.

499
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,680
Let's go.

500
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,680
Elder Hua has been away from us for so long.

501
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,680
Is he still not used to our life here?

502
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,680
He doesn't sleep much these days.

503
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,680
He doesn't sleep much?

504
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,680
If he doesn't sleep much,

505
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,680
then add some sedatives to his medicine.

506
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,680
Okay.

507
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,680
Elder!

508
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,680
Elder!

509
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,680
Why is it so hot?

510
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,680
Elder.

511
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,680
How deep are we?

512
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,680
I'm so hot that I can't breathe.

513
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,680
We should be here soon.

514
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,680
I'm afraid of heat.

515
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,680
I'm afraid of heat.

516
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,680
I'm afraid of heat.

517
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,680
I'm afraid of heat.

518
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,680
I'm afraid of heat.

519
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,680
I'm afraid of heat.

520
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,680
I'm afraid of heat.

521
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,680
I'm afraid of heat.

522
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,680
I'm afraid of heat.

523
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,680
I'm afraid of heat.

524
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,680
I'm afraid of heat.

525
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,680
I'm afraid of heat.

526
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,680
I'm afraid of heat.

527
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,680
I'm afraid of heat.

528
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,680
I'm afraid of heat.

529
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,680
I'm afraid of heat.

530
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,680
I'm afraid of heat.

531
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,680
I'm afraid of heat.

532
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,680
I'm afraid of heat.

533
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,680
I'm afraid of heat.

534
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,680
I'm afraid of heat.

535
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,680
I'm afraid of heat.

536
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,680
I'm afraid of heat.

537
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,680
I'm afraid of heat.

538
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,680
I'm afraid of heat.

539
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,680
I'm afraid of heat.

540
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,680
I'm afraid of heat.

541
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,680
I'm afraid of heat.

542
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,680
I'm afraid of heat.

543
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:22,180
This world I drill

544
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:26,480
It's using these blades

545
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,680
Chili sauce

546
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,180
Chile sauce

547
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,680
Chilis sauce

548
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,180
Today I'll greet you

549
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:37,180
Here, some sea crossed

550
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,140
Mutta

551
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:38,680
It's eating sea

552
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:45,420
It

553
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,720
Mei

554
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,720
No.

555
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:53,480
