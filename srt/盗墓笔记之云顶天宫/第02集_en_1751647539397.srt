00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 16

2
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Where did you put the heavy machine?

3
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What are you looking for?

4
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Isn't it here?

5
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's here.

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Heavy machine.

7
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Run.

8
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Run!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Run!

10
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Run!

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Run!

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The next room.

13
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Hey, next door.

14
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Why is there a path down there?

15
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Is there a hole down there?

16
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What are you looking at?

17
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I think I saw a shadow passing by.

18
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes, stop it.

19
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I really saw a shadow.

20
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Really, I just looked at it and it was gone.

21
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You are interesting.

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You should be serious.

23
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What's wrong with this road?

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The person who came in just took the Eight-Purple Treasure Box.

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
There is no heavy machine down there.

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So I didn't find a path down there.

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I guess there must be a pattern down there.

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Where are we going?

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Keep going.

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
How do you know which way is which?

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We can't pick up the stone steps.

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And we have to try one by one.

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We can try to go to the Monkey King's house.

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What do you think is the difference between these paths?

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The path is different.

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What's the difference?

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Wrong!

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The four paths on your side have the same direction.

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And I think if you go in the stone steps,

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
you can't get out.

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I heard from Uncle San that this is a secret trick

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
that the person who designed the tomb left.

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
In order to cover the real tomb,

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
they designed it.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So you mean the one on your side is correct.

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Why?

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Because this path has a darker color.

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What is that?

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
A pond?

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
A pond?

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Let's go.

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Maybe we can go to the main tomb.

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But...

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Why are you so annoying?

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You're always fighting with me.

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You're so timid.

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I...

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What does that have to do with being timid?

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's too dark.

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I have a headache.

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
There's something behind me.

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't know why we built the tower before.

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But Wang Zang Hai changed his sword

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
because he wanted to hide the snake's eyes.

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You said there wouldn't be a Zongzi here, right?

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Can't you be quiet for a while?

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
No, you said there was something behind it.

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Then I have to see it.

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I said it was a black shadow.

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You, you're poisonous.

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
No.

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I might be watching a play.

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What do you hear here?

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It sounds like the sound of the water flowing.

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We should be approaching the water source.

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Why doesn't it sound like the sound of the water flowing?

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Fatty.

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
This passage leads down.

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It must be a place that leads to the stone tower.

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I think the two rest of the totems are down there.

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Let's go.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Dead end.

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Didn't you carve this?

84
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What's going on?

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Have we been here?

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
No.

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Someone moved their hands and feet on this stone wall.

88
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
There's a mechanism in this tomb.

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
There's really someone else besides us.

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I think we should go.

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Let's go.

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Let's go.

93
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What are you doing?

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm going to blow up this wall.

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You used explosives.

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I don't need it anymore.

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You're crazy.

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
If someone really moved their hands and feet,

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
it means that he must be more familiar with this place than we are.

100
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Instead of looking for other ways,

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
we should just blow up this wall and come here quickly.

102
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
When did you become so violent?

103
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Do you think it's your third uncle?

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Calm down.

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What if the whole thing falls down?

106
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It won't.

107
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm going to blow up this wall.

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm going to blow up this wall.

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Let's go.

110
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You really have the same style as my fat grandpa.

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Let's go.

112
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Is there really a rabbit?

113
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's not up to you.

114
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What is this?

115
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:15,940
This is rabbit's

116
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,940
This is rabbit's

117
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,940
That's deer.

118
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,940
That's sheep.

119
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,940
That's cow.

120
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,940
You're also giving a big fork to the King of the Sea.

121
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,940
Are you going to fish?

122
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,940
What's wrong?

123
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,940
Fatty, lie down.

124
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,580
What do you want me to do?

125
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,060
Why are you so surprised?

126
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,340
What the...

127
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,860
What the...

128
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,140
What's wrong?

129
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,140
What's that sound?

130
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,060
Fatty!

131
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,900
Cover your face!

132
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,780
What's wrong?

133
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,180
Don't come over!

134
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,660
Don't bite me!

135
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,260
Fatty!

136
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,100
Don't come over!

137
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,580
Don't bite me! Don't bite me!

138
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:44,780
Close your eyes!

139
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,580
Hey!

140
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,420
Hey!

141
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,260
Where am I?

142
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:52,900
Let's go.

143
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,620
Who am I?

144
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,180
Let's go!

145
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:09,700
Fatty!

146
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,540
Fatty!

147
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,300
Are you okay?

148
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,340
Are you okay?

149
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,580
Fatty!

150
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,540
Don't scratch it.

151
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,980
If the bag is broken,

152
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,180
the pus will come out and touch the air and it will corrode your skin.

153
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,980
You're so stubborn.

154
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,260
I'm going to be hit by a car and you're going to be hit by a car.

155
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,180
You're fine.

156
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,420
You're smiling.

157
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,420
Anyway,

158
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,660
if the bag is broken and infected,

159
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,660
it will be partially removed.

160
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,740
Don't scratch it.

161
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,700
Look at me.

162
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,740
Look at me!

163
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:16,820
Come on.

164
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,580
Chew it.

165
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,020
Is it working?

166
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,620
It's working.

167
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,340
Chew it.

168
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:33,860
Is it done?

169
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,460
You've tested it?

170
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,020
No.

171
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:41,660
No.

172
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,980
I told you to chew it.

173
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,020
It's applied on your wound.

174
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,220
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

175
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,060
How could I know you're so stupid?

176
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,260
You just need to apply some of the blood and apply it on me.

177
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:53,580
This...

178
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:55,580
This...

179
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,420
This...

180
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,260
I've checked it.

181
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,660
Pan Zi is looking for you.

182
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,380
In other words,

183
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,780
he's looking for the copper fish in your hand.

184
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,660
Who is he helping?

185
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:18,740
Qiu De Kao.

186
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,580
He also told me one thing.

187
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,780
Qiu De Kao has an agency in China.

188
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,220
He often helps some foreign businessmen

189
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,260
and cultural relics vendors.

190
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:28,980
It's convenient.

191
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,660
Recently, there's a guy named Jason.

192
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,060
He often goes to his agency.

193
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,300
Jason has something to do with that guy.

194
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,260
Where are Wu Xie and the others?

195
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,620
I think they've entered the Palace of the Mirror.

196
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,300
Pan Zi is following them.

197
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,580
They'll be fine.

198
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:47,900
Master Hua,

199
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,420
there are too many people

200
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,180
who are in favor of the copper fish in your hand.

201
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,460
They have their own goals

202
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,980
and their own backgrounds.

203
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,140
I'm worried that

204
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,300
it's too difficult to find your uncle

205
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,940
with the copper fish as a clue.

206
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,300
I can't find my uncle with just a copper fish.

207
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,900
I'm looking for the copper fish

208
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,020
not just for my uncle.

209
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,500
You're helping Master Wu San to find Wu San Xing?

210
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,380
Master Hua,

211
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,980
I know you're loyal to him.

212
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,420
But in the current situation,

213
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,380
your kindness

214
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,220
will make him see more things

215
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,340
that he doesn't want to see.

216
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,300
Turn him around.

217
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,660
I hate you.

218
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,100
Whether he hates me or not,

219
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,900
I have to help him.

220
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,620
I can't see him getting deeper and deeper in danger.

221
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,100
Help me find that red-haired man

222
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,940
and let him help me release some information.

223
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:37,980
Okay.

224
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:40,940
Okay.

225
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,260
Miss me?

226
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,060
Are we still good friends?

227
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,900
You're calling me to leave?

228
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,180
I have to go down again.

229
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,660
And I think your brain

230
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,860
is also broken.

231
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,460
We can't go down together, right?

232
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,900
You're the one who's been covered.

233
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,380
You can't just kill the mule first.

234
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,620
Okay.

235
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,740
Then you can go down a few more times.

236
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,180
Make sure you're okay before you go.

237
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,660
Otherwise, if something happens to you down there,

238
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,620
I won't be responsible for it.

239
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,700
You're just a thug.

240
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,100
You'll regret it when you lose me.

241
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,100
Okay.

242
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,300
Tianzhen.

243
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,780
Is the one you made for me really useful?

244
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,540
Yes.

245
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:58,620
Yes.

246
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,460
But I think I'm wearing a little...

247
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,860
Why are you laughing?

248
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,780
But you're very considerate.

249
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,900
I'm not afraid of those things

250
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,220
if you make this for me.

251
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,540
Let's go.

252
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,940
It's so ugly.

253
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,780
What are you talking about?

254
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,420
Let's go.

255
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,780
We've been here before.

256
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,660
Right?

257
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,940
We've been here.

258
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,580
Now, you've already blown it up, haven't you?

259
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,820
This stone wall can really be broken.

260
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,860
There will be gaps.

261
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,220
We can blow it up again.

262
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,820
Blow it up.

263
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,460
There it is!

264
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:17,680
whatever

265
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,480
You degrees?

266
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,680
No, I'm fine.

267
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,080
It's okay. It's okay.

268
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,280
I have the clothes you made for me.

269
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,480
I'm just a random person.

270
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,080
Look, he wants to bite me.

271
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,480
Go, go, go, go!

272
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,680
Go, go, go, go!

273
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,680
Fatty, it's okay.

274
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,080
Fatty!

275
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,380
Fatty!

276
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,480
Fatty!

277
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,480
Don't hide! Fatty is coming out!

278
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,480
Fatty!

279
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,480
Fat...

280
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,480
Fatty!

281
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,480
Fatty!

282
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,480
Fatty!

283
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,480
Fatty!

284
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,480
Fatty, come out!

285
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,480
You can't even get in the water in the first kilometer!

286
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,480
Come out!

287
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,480
Where's the bee? Come out!

288
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,480
Come out!

289
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,480
Where's the bee?

290
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,480
It's gone.

291
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,480
It's gone. It's gone.

292
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,480
I said, why are you so hungry?

293
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,480
Did I lie on my bones just now?

294
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,480
Look at it yourself.

295
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,480
It's full of a pond.

296
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,480
It's all covered in mud.

297
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,480
There are animals and people.

298
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,480
They're everywhere. They're all with you in the bath.

299
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,480
Just pretend you didn't see it.

300
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,480
It's important to get us out of here.

301
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,480
Oh.

302
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,480
Don't touch it.

303
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,480
There's another pond here.

304
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,480
Is it all filled up?

305
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,480
Look, it's all filled up.

306
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,480
Let's go up. I don't want to be covered by bees.

307
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,480
You've suffered a lot, Fatty.

308
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,480
It's okay.

309
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,480
What?

310
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,480
I don't know.

311
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,480
What is it?

312
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,480
Is it a seed?

313
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,480
Fatty, there's no seed in this world.

314
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,480
Yeah, I've never seen a seed this fast.

315
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,480
Let's just go.

316
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,480
Hurry up!

317
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,480
Hurry up!

318
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,480
Wait!

319
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,480
Fatty!

320
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,480
No.

321
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,480
Run this way!

322
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,480
Fatty! Run this way!

323
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,480
Run!

324
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,480
The door is spinning!

325
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,480
What's going on?

326
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,480
Let's go!

327
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,480
Run!

328
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,480
Run!

329
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,480
Run!

330
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,480
Did you catch it?

331
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,480
I've never seen such a dense hole.

332
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,480
What kind of place is this?

333
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,480
Is this a demon tower?

334
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,480
Is this a demon-tower?

335
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,480
Fatty, there are so many seagulls here.

336
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,480
Why aren't there any heads?

337
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,480
Who said there are no heads?

338
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,480
There are dogs, cows, humans, sheep, all heads.

339
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,480
We're in the place where demons eat.

340
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,480
This is a big canteen.

341
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,480
Where are all these demons?

342
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,480
This is...

343
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,480
Fatty!

344
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,480
Xiao Ge?

345
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,480
Help me.

346
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,480
Help me.

347
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,480
Do you know how much we miss you at this moment?

348
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,480
Xiao Ge, what is this?

349
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,480
Why is it so disgusting?

350
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:45,920
This is a mutant

351
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,920
This is a mutant that is attached to the skeleton of the skeleton.

352
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,920
This thing moves because of the monster?

353
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,920
When the monster was alive, it was born in the flesh.

354
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,560
Until the monster died, they entered the

355
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,560
cultivation ground.

356
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,560
Now I can smell the fresh flesh.

357
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,560
This can help them find a new host.

358
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,560
Host?

359
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,560
And you?

360
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,560
You...

361
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,560
No, this bug is over.

362
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,560
Hurry!

363
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,560
Yes!

364
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,560
Hurry!

365
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,200
Hurry!

366
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,200
Come here!

367
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,200
Hurry!

368
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,200
Hurry!

369
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,200
Xiao Ge!

370
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,200
Hurry!

371
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
Time!

372
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,200
You are not a human being.

373
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,200
You are a human being.

374
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
I am a human being.

375
00:26:51,200 --> 00:27:02,680
I am the host of the royal editator

376
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,200
I'm so beautiful and so proud of you.

377
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,200
Fatty.

378
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,200
Little boy, protect the innocent.

379
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,200
Fatty.

380
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,200
Fatty!

381
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,200
Come, come here.

382
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,200
Come, come.

383
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,200
Slowly.

384
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,200
Be careful.

385
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,200
They're inside.

386
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,200
You go in.

387
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
Thank you.

388
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,200
Thank you for saving our Elder Kua Xiong.

389
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,200
I'm the team leader, Dang Mang.

390
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
Your friends will be with us.

391
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,200
We can cure him.

392
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
When can our friends wake up?

393
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,200
The poison on the sword is special.

394
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,200
But we have the antidote.

395
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,200
It's just that he was bitten by the wind too badly.

396
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,200
It's been a few days.

397
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,200
Where's the priest who came out with us?

398
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,200
He's not here.

399
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,200
Where's the priest who came out with us?

400
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,200
He's been in the basement for too long.

401
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,200
His eyes are broken.

402
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,200
We're treating him.

403
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,200
I'm sorry to ask.

404
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,200
What are you doing here?

405
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,200
We're here to pick the wind.

406
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,200
I saw the collapsed building there.

407
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,200
I can't control my curiosity.

408
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
I wanted to go down and see.

409
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,200
I didn't expect...

410
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,200
Anyway, thank you.

411
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,200
Thank you for saving our missing people for many years.

412
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,200
Take a rest.

413
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,200
The doctor will be back soon to treat him.

414
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,200
If your third uncle doesn't want you to find him,

415
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,200
you'll never find him.

416
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,200
He's only interested in people who have direct interests.

417
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,200
Who wants me to go to Guangxi Jing'er Palace?

418
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,200
If you really want to know the secret behind Wu Sanxing,

419
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,200
you must go to Jing'er Palace.

420
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,200
Tianxun, don't go there.

421
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,200
I'll find a way for you.

422
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,200
Tianxun.

423
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,200
Fatty.

424
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,200
Tianxun.

425
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,200
Xiao Ge, you know their language.

426
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,200
Help me ask what's going on.

427
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,200
Fatty is having a high fever.

428
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,200
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

429
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,200
I'll be back soon.

430
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,200
I'll be back.

431
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,200
I'll be back.

432
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,200
What's going on?

433
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
Fatty is having a high fever.

434
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,200
It's okay.

435
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,200
He's not having a fever because of the inflammation of his wound.

436
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,200
It's because he wants to get rid of the poison on the sword.

437
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,200
It's more likely to have a high fever.

438
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,200
Don't worry too much.

439
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,200
Xiao Ge, you know a lot.

440
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,200
And it feels like you've lived with them before.

441
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,200
You know their language.

442
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,200
Have you ever learned it?

443
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,200
I don't know.

444
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,200
I just said it naturally.

445
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,200
I can't remember anything else.

446
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,200
Xiao Ge.

447
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,200
The treatment has just ended.

448
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,200
The elder should be asleep.

449
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,200
His eyes are still open.

450
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,200
Thank you.

451
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,200
Don't thank us anymore.

452
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,200
We really didn't do anything.

453
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,200
You don't know.

454
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,200
He's been missing for over 40 years.

455
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,200
A lot of bad things happened in the village that year.

456
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,200
No one mentioned the whereabouts of the elder.

457
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,200
I didn't think he was still alive.

458
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,200
Elder Brother Hua's disappearance

459
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,200
is the same year as the stone tower collapse.

460
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,200
The snake and the fish were stolen by the tomb raider.

461
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,200
There must be some connection between these things.

462
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,200
Wu Xie.

463
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,200
It's not just an ordinary stone tower.

464
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,200
The underground palace inside has been transformed by a large number of people.

465
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,200
There are too many unknown mechanisms.

466
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,200
It will be dangerous if we continue to walk.

467
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,200
When Fatty is recovered, you can go back.

468
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,200
What are you looking for?

469
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,200
I'll help you find it.

470
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,200
Tell me about the people who came here.

471
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,200
I only said that there is something

472
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,200
more important than the snake and the fish.

473
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
But I don't know what it is.

474
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,200
But Xiao Ge.

475
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,200
The underground palace you mentioned has been transformed.

476
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
It's like a person's hand.

477
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,200
Plus the snake and the fish.

478
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,200
When Fatty and I were in the underground palace,

479
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,200
we also speculated that

480
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,200
he must have something to do with Wang Zang Hai.

481
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,200
The Elder must know what happened back then.

482
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,200
A banquet?

483
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
The Elder wants to thank you.

484
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,200
We appreciate it.

485
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
But we don't need to thank him.

486
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,200
Since the Elder is awake,

487
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,200
we want to see him as soon as possible.

488
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
Although the Elder just woke up,

489
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
he is still very weak.

490
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
Can we ask him after the ceremony?

491
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,200
But...

492
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,200
Thank you.

493
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,200
Fatty.

494
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,200
You recovered.

495
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,200
How are you?

496
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,200
Do you feel uncomfortable?

497
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,200
I feel comfortable.

498
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,200
Tianzhen.

499
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,200
You know that my butt is also covered with poison.

500
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,200
You must tell me that

501
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,200
you were the one who applied the medicine on my butt.

502
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,200
Not me.

503
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,200
Then Xiao Ge did it.

504
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,200
Xiao Ge.

505
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,200
I really appreciate it.

506
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,200
I'm sorry.

507
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,200
It's me.

508
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,200
It's like this.

509
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,200
You were badly bitten by the poison.

510
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,200
If you don't treat it in time,

511
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,200
the wound will be infected and it will not be good.

512
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,200
Please forgive me.

513
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,200
No, no, no. I didn't blame you.

514
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,200
I thank you.

515
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,200
Except for my mom, no one has ever seen my butt.

516
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,200
I really appreciate it.

517
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,200
It's good that you're awake.

518
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,200
I'll get you some food.

519
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,200
You need to take more supplements.

520
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,200
Don't bother. I really don't need it.

521
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,200
It's okay. You should rest well.

522
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,200
Except for my mom, no one has ever...

523
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,200
Stop laughing.

524
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,200
What's going on?

525
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,200
What's going on?

526
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,200
You were bitten by the poison.

527
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,200
Then you were shot by the poison.

528
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,200
Then you were hit by the poison.

529
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,200
I didn't say that.

530
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,200
I'm talking about you.

531
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,200
The big one down there.

532
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,200
And the one with the character Ji.

533
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,200
What the hell is that?

534
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,200
And the thing you're looking for.

535
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,200
Did you find it?

536
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,200
Stop.

537
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,200
I don't know what you're talking about.

538
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,200
Don't ask me.

539
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,200
All the answers are on that old man.

540
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,200
Let's go and ask him.

541
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,200
I asked him.

542
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,200
He just woke up.

543
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,200
To thank us for saving him.

544
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,200
He's going to host a long-term party to treat us.

545
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,200
We need to wait until the party is over.

546
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,200
I...

547
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,200
I...

548
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,200
I...

549
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,200
I...

550
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,200
I...

551
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,200
I...

552
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,200
I...

553
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,200
I...

554
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,200
I...

555
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,200
I...

556
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,200
I...

557
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,200
I...

558
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,200
I...

559
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,200
I...

560
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,200
I...

561
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,200
I...

562
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,200
I...

563
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,200
I...

564
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,200
I...

565
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,200
I...

Mm.

637
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,200
You're right.

638
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,200
You're not Wu San Xing's opponent.

639
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,200
You shouldn't keep stopping him.

640
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,200
It's not up to me.

641
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,200
He's my third uncle.

642
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,200
Wu Xie, I have no malice.

643
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,200
If you insist on going,

644
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,200
I'll go with you.

645
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,200
Okay.

646
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,200
We'll see.

647
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,200
It's getting late.

648
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,200
We have to see the elders tomorrow.

649
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,200
Have a good rest.

650
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,200
Okay.

651
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,200
I'm tired.

652
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,200
I'm tired.

653
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,200
I'm tired.

654
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,200
I'm tired.

655
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,200
I'm tired.

656
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,200
I'm tired.

657
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,200
Beat them!

658
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,200
Ja tires!

659
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,200
Beat them!

660
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,200
Liuo breaking glass...

661
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,240
Brush

662
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,280
Mr.San

663
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,240
Why are you here?

664
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,760
I've been passing from the main building

665
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,640
No one will see me

666
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:22,840
Don't be afraid of a phantom

667
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:23,960
just be afraid of a prophet

668
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,080
Do you understand?

669
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,580
Say something, Gao cape

670
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,880
The one who helped masters

671
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,880
I'm afraid that if you get involved in these two things,

672
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,880
I'm afraid it won't be good for you.

673
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,880
Pan Zi, Pan Zi, Pan Zi.

674
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,880
Don't worry about me. I've told you many times.

675
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,880
Just keep an eye on Wu Xie.

676
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,880
If he moves, you'll be dead.

677
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,880
Everything else has nothing to do with you.

678
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,880
Understand?

679
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,880
Yes.

680
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,880
I understand.

681
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,880
I understand.

682
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,880
I understand.

683
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,880
Understand?

684
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,880
Yes.

685
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,880
Pan Zi, it's been so many years.

686
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,880
We live on the edge of the knife every day.

687
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,880
Sometimes I think that this kind of life can only be improved.

688
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,880
So one day, if I have any problems,

689
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,880
thank you for taking care of me.

690
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,880
Take care of Wu Xie, that kid.

691
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,880
That's the only root of the Wu family.

692
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,880
What are you talking about, Third Master?

693
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,880
You're still alive.

694
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,880
Enough, Pan Zi.

695
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,880
Pan Zi,

696
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,880
listen to me.

697
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,880
If anything happens,

698
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,880
don't forget to take care of Little Third Master.

699
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,880
Don't worry.

700
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,880
Now he's pregnant.

701
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,880
What can Young Che meaning of Love adds to this?

702
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,880
Young Che,

703
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,880

704
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,880

705
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,880
I'm happy.

706
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,880
That's what I meant.

707
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,880
Young Che!

708
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,880

00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,760
