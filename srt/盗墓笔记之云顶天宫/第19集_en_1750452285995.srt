1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The first time I saw a cat, I thought it was a cat.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I was surprised that it was a cat.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I was surprised that it was a cat.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I was surprised that it was a cat.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I was surprised that it was a cat.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It wasn't a cat.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It was a cat.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I was surprised that it was a cat.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It was a cat.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It was a cat.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It wasn't a cat.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Episode 1

13
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,520
Who's there?

14
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,680
Pan Zi?

15
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,800
San Ye?

16
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,480
San Ye, I finally found you!

17
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
San Ye, are you okay?

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,320
I'm fine. I'm fine.

19
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,040
I'm sorry, San Ye.

20
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,240
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,840
I'm sorry, San Ye.

22
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,760
I didn't take good care of you.

23
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,880
It's good to find you.

24
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,560
It's good to find you.

25
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,000
I feel like I'm being locked up for a rest.

26
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,200
Shun Zi,

27
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,200
tell me what happened

28
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,680
when San Ye told you that?

29
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,680
If not,

30
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,200
it would've been too much.

31
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,880
I don't know where to start.

32
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,480
About a month ago,

33
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,280
I was on a group of guests on the mountain.

34
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,680
I wasn't as good as you.

35
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,040
I was walking around

36
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,200
to see if there was snow.

37
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,800
San Ye was in the middle of the road.

38
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,000
When he was on the mountain,

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,480
he suddenly called me out.

40
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,600
He was mysterious.

41
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,200
He told me that

42
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,200
I was in this world

43
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,000
waiting for someone called Wu Xie

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,600
to bring them to the mountain.

45
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,200
He said that as long as I brought you to him,

46
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,600
he would give me a lot of money.

47
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,200
That's what he said to me at that time.

48
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,000
By the way, he also emphasized

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
that as long as it was you,

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
he would understand.

51
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,200
Shun Zi,

52
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,800
he really said that?

53
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,200
As long as it was you,

54
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,400
he would understand.

55
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
We don't understand.

56
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,400
Why is that?

57
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,200
It's because it was you.

58
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
Tian Zhen,

59
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
you think so.

60
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,400
Think about it.

61
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,800
What's different about us?

62
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,200
What's different?

63
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,400
You studied, I didn't.

64
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,600
You studied, I didn't.

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Shun Zi,

66
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
why did you

67
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,400
break up with Master

68
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,200
and tell me about it?

69
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,200
I'm not stupid.

70
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,400
When I saw you,

71
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,600
I thought that you were in a bad mood.

72
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,400
I think there were two different people living together.

73
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,400
I didn't know what they were doing.

74
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,200
So I just pretended to be stupid.

75
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,000
After all, I received Master's deposit.

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,600
If I made a mistake,

77
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,400
it would be bad to delay your business.

78
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,200
You look pretty accurate.

79
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,400
Why do I think it's not that simple?

80
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,800
How do I feel that you are Master's person?

81
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,800
Do you have any other news?

82
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,600
There are many rumors about the valley.

83
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,400
There are many bad things we've encountered.

84
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,600
Every year, there are many people

85
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,400
who want to go to the mountains.

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,400
If you don't know,

87
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,200
you will know something.

88
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,000
So,

89
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,600
when I saw you walking in the mountains,

90
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,800
I figured out what you were doing.

91
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,400
If Master didn't lead us,

92
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,000
I wouldn't let you

93
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,800
go further when the mountain was snowing.

94
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,400
Another spy.

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,400
Saes quand can break it.

96
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:33,220
Do you have any

97
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,400
Tool?

98
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,100
I found it out that theon

99
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,000
has gone,

100
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,100
but it's not officially revealed.

101
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,100
It's not his own face.

102
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,100
This sentence is...

103
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,100
Is it the sound of this character?

104
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,100
This sentence is Hangzhou dialect.

105
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,100
You three are talking too much.

106
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,100
Use Hangzhou dialect to pass the message.

107
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,100
The place of the great master Xuanwu.

108
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,100
What do you say?

109
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,100
Yanou Qisizi.

110
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,100
Right?

111
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,100
You are so strange.

112
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,100
I don't understand Hangzhou dialect.

113
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,100
But the place of the great master Xuanwu.

114
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,100
Just like you said, do us this child.

115
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,100
We will go to Fengshui when we hear the great master Xuanwu.

116
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,100
We can't ask for anything else.

117
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,100
Pan, you have been in Hangzhou for so many years.

118
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,100
Why didn't you think of it?

119
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,100
I can't think of anything.

120
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,100
If I can think of anything,

121
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,100
then you think it's so dangerous.

122
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,100
Do you still need to think about it?

123
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,100
I don't understand even if it's about the great master.

124
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,100
Alright, alright.

125
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,100
Don't worry.

126
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,100
The great master is the old Jianghu.

127
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,100
He is very strict.

128
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,100
Even if something happens,

129
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,100
he won't wait until it happens.

130
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,100
We can take care of ourselves now.

131
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,100
We are now forced by your uncle.

132
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,100
He can give this clue.

133
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,100
It means he knows more than us.

134
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,100
Yanou Qisizi.

135
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,100
This is not what he usually says.

136
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,100
It sounds more like a plot in ancient times.

137
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,100
I suspect that the purpose of my uncle's assassination

138
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,100
is to get the information there.

139
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,100
And Ning's purpose is not to kill Haidimu,

140
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,100
but to make the sky.

141
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,100
If Ning is in the sea,

142
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,100
will she get the key information of the sky?

143
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,100
No way.

144
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,100
If she can get the key information,

145
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,100
then you need to...

146
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,100
It's true.

147
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,100
My uncle is already dead.

148
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,100
Let's go.

149
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,100
You...

150
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,100
Boss.

151
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,100
What's going on?

152
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,100
How did you come here?

153
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,100
How long did it take?

154
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,100
We've been wandering here for a whole day.

155
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,100
How could this road be so long?

156
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,100
Boss, I don't feel well.

157
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,100
We might have been involved in some emergency operation.

158
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,100
There can't be such a long road here.

159
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,100
We can't waste our energy anymore.

160
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,100
You go find some people to explore the road.

161
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,100
The rest of you, stay at the ground.

162
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,100
Yes.

163
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,100
Let's go.

164
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,100
Let's go.

165
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,100
Why did you sleep so long?

166
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,100
Take off his clothes.

167
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,100
What should we do?

168
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,100
What should we do?

169
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,100
Hold him.

170
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,100
My uncle asked us to go along the water.

171
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,100
Now there's no water left.

172
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,100
What should we do?

173
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,100
Why is there another big tunnel here?

174
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,100
We can't go anywhere.

175
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,100
We can't stay here.

176
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,100
Why is it impossible?

177
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,100
It's not your fault.

178
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,100
You're the one who built it.

179
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,100
Why can't we go anywhere?

180
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,100
I'm afraid that's too easy.

181
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,100
Let's go.

182
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,100
Let's go.

183
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,100
Let's go.

184
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,100
Let's go.

185
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,100
Let's go.

186
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,100
Let's go.

187
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,100
Let's go.

188
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,100
Let's go.

189
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,100
Let's go.

190
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,100
Let's go.

191
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,100
Let's go.

192
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,100
It's impossible.

193
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,100
You didn't build it.

194
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,100
It's all water.

195
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,100
It's the same as the water we built.

196
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,100
It's water.

197
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,100
There's a sign here.

198
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,100
I remember it.

199
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,100
Tianzhen,

200
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,100
where did we see the Buddha?

201
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100
Oh, my God.

202
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,100
There's something strange.

203
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,100
What's that?

204
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,100
It's a sign.

205
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,100
It's a sign.

206
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,100
It's a sign.

207
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,100
It's a sign.

208
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,100
It's a sign.

209
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,100
I remember it.

210
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,100
We saw this sign

211
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,100
on the sea floor.

212
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,100
I was also thinking

213
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,100
that it could be

214
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,100
the third uncle

215
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,100
or the archaeologist.

216
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,100
I've been following the third uncle for ten years.

217
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,100
There are many small holes here.

218
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,100
I've never seen

219
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,100
this kind of sign before.

220
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,100
Moreover,

221
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,100
it's impossible

222
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,100
to see such sign.

223
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,100
It's not him.

224
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,100
Anyway,

225
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,100
this road should be the right one.

226
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,100
Someone has entered this cave.

227
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,100
The entrance to the underground palace

228
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,100
should be below here.

229
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,100
The problem is,

230
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,100
should we go there now?

231
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,100
What's wrong?

232
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,100
Where's Xiao Ge?

233
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,100
Xiao Ge.

234
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,100
He came to Wei Ying to go to the Buddha Sect.

235
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,100
He didn't have to tell us.

236
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,100
But the key is,

237
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,100
we must hurry back

238
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,100
when it's dangerous.

239
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,100
We didn't see

240
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,100
Xiao Ge.

241
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,100
Then he...

242
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,100
Xiao Zi, are you okay?

243
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,100
How are you?

244
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,100
Please take care of your ancestors.

245
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,100
When I come back,

246
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,100
I'll give you a big red envelope.

247
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,100
You have your ancestors.

248
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,100
Who?

249
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,100
Cao Cao.

250
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,100
Tian Zhen, look.

251
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,100
The foot print is from the mountain shoes.

252
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,100
Oh, my God.

253
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,100
How many people have arrived here first?

254
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,100
Hurry up.

255
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,100
Hurry up.

256
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,100
Hurry up.

257
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,100
Let's go.

258
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,100
How come there are more than a thousand bottles?

259
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,100
How long has it been since I've been buried?

260
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,100
The slave king is quite capable of drinking.

261
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,100
There's still a place like this.

262
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,100
It's a construction site.

263
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,100
I guess.

264
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,100
Let's go further.

265
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,100
There are more treasures.

266
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,100
The treasure from the north of the capital,

267
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,100
there's a part of it in the silk handkerchief.

268
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,100
There's also a part of it in the silk handkerchief.

269
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,100
It's a piece of silk.

270
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,100
It's a piece of silk.

271
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,100
It's a piece of silk.

272
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,100
There's a part of it in the silk handkerchief.

273
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,100
There's also a part of it in the wood.

274
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,100
Don't think too much.

275
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,100
The men's contribution is all about the spirit and the slave.

276
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,100
They don't just put it here.

277
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,100
They've already messed up the house.

278
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,100
So you'd better consider the interests of the eyes.

279
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,100
What interests?

280
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,100
Look at this broken wine.

281
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,100
The production is so rough.

282
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,100
They don't even want to give these to Yan Xian dishes.

283
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,100
It smells good.

284
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,100
It's not bad.

285
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,100
It's quite good.

286
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,100
I don't know what good wine it is.

287
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,100
I'm out of water.

288
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,100
This half of the wine is made of gold.

289
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,100
Do you have a guarantee for this?

290
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,100
You don't know that.

291
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,100
You can't even tell.

292
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,100
You can't tell.

293
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,100
You can't tell.

294
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,100
You can't tell.

295
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,100
You can't tell.

296
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,100
You can't tell.

297
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,100
You can't tell.

298
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,100
You can't tell.

299
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,100
You can't tell.

300
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,100
You can't tell.

301
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,100
There's a guarantee for the wine.

302
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,100
It won't be bad even if you put it in thousands of years.

303
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,100
And the wine that's been made in thousands of years

304
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,100
can be tasted without any problem.

305
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,100
You know, if you put a large batch of wine

306
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,100
in Henan Valley,

307
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,100
that 3000 years of wine

308
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,100
will be a huge amount of wine.

309
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,100
You don't even know.

310
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,100
Fatty.

311
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,100
What?

312
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,100
Are you crazy?

313
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,100
You dare to eat the things in the valley.

314
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,100
Aren't you afraid that you'll die?

315
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,100
It's okay.

316
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,100
There's a lot of it.

317
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,100
It's a dragon.

318
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,100
What are you doing?

319
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,100
You two take a look.

320
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,100
What are you two doing?

321
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,100
You're dead.

322
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,100
What are you talking about?

323
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,100
You're dead.

324
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,100
This third prince told me

325
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,100
that this is a monkey that's not mature.

326
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,100
He's going to make a monkey head wine

327
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,100
with the wine he's made.

328
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,100
I don't know if he can live a long life

329
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,100
after drinking it.

330
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,100
But

331
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,100
I'm sure that this is the one that's going to make a monkey head wine.

332
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,100
Fatty,

333
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,100
why don't you try it?

334
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,100
The golden turtle is here to remind you.

335
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,100
Why don't you try it first

336
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,100
and then you'll be able to drink it?

337
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,100
It's enough for you.

338
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,100
It's very strong.

339
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,100
But it's useless if I drink it.

340
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,100
Why don't you try it now?

341
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,100
I'm done.

342
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,100
I'm leaving.

343
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,100
Where are you going?

344
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,100
This way.

345
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,100
Someone's going to give us a chance.

346
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,100
When are you going to show us the way?

347
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,100
Go back there.

348
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,100
You...

349
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,100
Xi Ke.

350
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,100
Mr. Hua, come here.

351
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,100
Do you want to try something?

352
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,100
I've never taught you how to do it.

353
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,100
But you missed a master of the wisdom.

354
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,100
What are you talking about?

355
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,100
I just want to sell some wine,

356
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,100
old books, old paintings, old newspapers,

357
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,100
and these old paintings

358
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,100
are all some unknowing things.

359
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,100
Compared with Mr. Hua's business,

360
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,100
how can you be so skilled?

361
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,100
Uncle Hai, this is no longer a joke.

362
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,100
Like Uncle Hai,

363
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,100
he can't even recognize the most excellent art works

364
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,100
in the Yanping.

365
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,100
In the past,

366
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,100
we have to call it a lifetime.

367
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,100
I think that

368
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,100
no one knows how many art works

369
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,100
are sold in the sea.

370
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,100
It's all a joke.

371
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,100
It's not that exaggerated.

372
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,100
Oh, right.

373
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,100
You don't know

374
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,100
that I'm here this time, right?

375
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,100
Is there anything else

376
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,100
that you can do about it?

377
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,100
Mr. Hua,

378
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,100
there are some things

379
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,100
that you shouldn't ask me.

380
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,100
You should have

381
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,100
a professional businessman

382
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,100
to help you.

383
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,100
Am I right?

384
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,100
Are you in the northeast?

385
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,100
Good boy.

386
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,100
You're indeed the descendant of the Xie Laojiao.

387
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,100
I don't know

388
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,100
where you got this information from.

389
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,100
But let me tell you.

390
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,100
The things you want,

391
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,100
you should find a person

392
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,100
who is closer to you.

393
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,100
He knows more.

394
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,100
You should go and find him.

395
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,100
Master,

396
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,100
just like before,

397
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,100
I can't walk or walk.

398
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,100
I can't even find the fire.

399
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,100
I can't use the signal.

400
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,100
It's all wood.

401
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,100
It's burnt.

402
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,100
I have to find it.

403
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,100
I'm afraid that

404
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,100
I'll get burnt.

405
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,100
I'll go find it.

406
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,100
I'll go find it.

407
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,100
I'll go find it.

408
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,100
I'll go find it.

409
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,100
I'll go find it.

410
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,100
I still don't have signal.

411
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,100
It's the forest.

412
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,100
There must be some expert

413
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,100
who knows the power of the power.

414
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,100
Unfortunately, we don't know

415
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,100
these people.

416
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,100
Master.

417
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,100
Master, you're awake.

418
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,100
Master.

419
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,100
I'm fine now.

420
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,100
How do you feel?

421
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,100
I have some painkillers here.

422
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,100
Thank you.

423
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,100
Master.

424
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,100
Master.

425
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,100
Master.

426
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,100
Master.

427
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,100
Master.

428
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,100
What's wrong?

429
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,100
It's a dead end.

430
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,100
It's a dead end.

431
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,100
It often appears in the woods.

432
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,100
But it's not dangerous.

433
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,100
Let's go.

434
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,100
What's this?

435
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,100
Is this a door?

436
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,100
It's not a door.

437
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,100
It's a seal.

438
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,100
It's a seal.

439
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,100
It's made of a big stone.

440
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,100
It's sealed with copper water.

441
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,100
It's a whole.

442
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,100
It seems that the wood is important.

443
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,100
We can go to the ground

444
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,100
with the mark.

445
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:15,100
And the hole is for us.

446
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,100
Whoever it is,

447
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,100
it may be strong.

448
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,100
Fatty, be careful.

449
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,100
What's inside?

450
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,100
It's a wood.

451
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,100
And a seal.

452
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,100
It seems that the red-and-red is safe.

453
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,100
Don't be ridiculous.

454
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,100
There are three doors and three locks.

455
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,100
At least there are three seals.

456
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,100
It's called the Three Thousand World.

457
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,100
I don't understand you.

458
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,100
Do you remember that my home has three locks?

459
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,100
Who knows how many locks you have?

460
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:56,100
I couldsteb

461
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:11,100
and

462
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:17,100
someone else.

463
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,100
The whole underground palace is in the middle of the river.

464
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,100
Otherwise, it wouldn't be so beautiful without a reason.

465
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,100
Then come and take a look.

466
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,100
See if there are any signs of the past.

467
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,100
Let's go.

468
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,100
The underground palace is in the middle of the river.

469
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,100
The underground palace is in the middle of the river.

470
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,100
The underground palace is in the middle of the river.

471
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,100
The underground palace is in the middle of the river.

472
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,100
The underground palace is in the middle of the river.

473
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,100
The underground palace is in the middle of the river.

474
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,100
The underground palace is in the middle of the river.

475
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,100
The underground palace is in the middle of the river.

476
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,100
The underground palace is in the middle of the river.

477
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,100
The underground palace is in the middle of the river.

478
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,100
The underground palace is in the middle of the river.

479
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,100
The underground palace is in the middle of the river.

480
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,100
The underground palace is in the middle of the river.

481
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,100
The underground palace is in the middle of the river.

482
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,100
There is a number.

483
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,100
Isn't this the firecracker of the探學界?

484
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,100
Okay.

485
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,100
Then let's follow the standard.

486
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,100
Let's go.

487
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,100
Right?

488
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,100
I told you, it must be a small trick.

489
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,100
Although he lost it,

490
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,100
he has been thinking about it.

491
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,100
Let's go.

492
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,100
Wait.

493
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,100
This number and the previous two numbers are completely different.

494
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,100
Look.

495
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,100
Although these numbers are all made up by their own mother.

496
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,100
But they are all together without any meaning.

497
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,100
It doesn't look like a curse or a virtue.

498
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,100
At first, I thought it was just a simple route.

499
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,100
It's like a simple pattern.

500
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,100
It just tells us that we can go this way.

501
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,100
That's all.

502
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,100
But that kind of number will not change.

503
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,100
Look.

504
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,100
But now the number has changed.

505
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,100
Then...

506
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,100
It means that he has other intentions.

507
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,100
At the same time, he is giving us instructions.

508
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,100
He also wants to tell us some other information.

509
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,100
For example,

510
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,100
the two numbers we saw before.

511
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,100
Those two routes are not dangerous.

512
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:46,100
But now this number is different.

513
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:50,100
Then it means that it's dangerous to go this way.

514
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,100
Then are we going?

515
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,100
Mr. San.

516
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,100
The four of us are only you.

517
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,100
Look carefully.

518
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,100
You can't translate the whole sentence.

519
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,100
You can't translate the whole word.

520
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,100
What does it mean to be able to make up a word?

521
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,100
But it's not a single word.

522
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,100
He can't make it up.

523
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,100
I think we should think about

524
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,100
who left it.

525
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,100
What is the purpose of leaving it?

526
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,100
It's not Xiao Ge who can make it up.

527
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,100
If Xiao Ge left it,

528
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,100
then at least he has to use the way we understand.

529
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,100
That's Ning.

530
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,100
They are inside the number.

531
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,100
They are here to separate the actions

532
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,100
and then make the mark here.

533
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,100
I think this number is not like

534
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,100
the one in front of us.

535
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,100
There is no danger in front of us.

536
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,100
We have to go to know it.

537
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,100
It's not possible to make a mark after going back.

538
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,100
It's not scientific.

539
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,100
I understand.

540
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,100
This number

541
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,100
is the one who taught himself when he entered the tomb.

542
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,100
It means that he went this way.

543
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,100
This is called chasing the language.

544
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,100
What is it?

545
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,100
When I was in the special training in the forest in Vietnam,

546
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,100
I learned to chase knowledge and know some chasing language.

547
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,100
To put it simply,

548
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,100
a person is lost in the forest.

549
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,100
He must be on the way he walked

550
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,100
and make some marks and mark marks.

551
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,100
When the rescue staff arrived,

552
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,100
they would know his situation through the mark and mark marks.

553
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,100
These marks and mark marks are usually very rules.

554
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,100
For example, when the food is full, it is a kind of mark.

555
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,100
When the food is short, it is a kind of mark.

556
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,100
When someone is in the team, it is a kind of mark.

557
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,100
When it's more dangerous,

558
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,100
the rescue team can follow the mark

559
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,100
to get to the rescue.

560
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,100
This was invented when the old man in the US

561
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,100
was in the South China Sea.

562
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,100
Okay, you learned it.

563
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,100
Then quickly translate it.

564
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,100
This question is...

565
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,100
Sister!

566
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,100
Sister!

567
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,100
How did that thing go?

568
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,100
I thought you were going to make a change again.

569
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,100
What's wrong with you?

570
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,100
I could clearly hear your voice and movements.

571
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,100
But I just couldn't move.

572
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,100
There's always a voice in my mind that interferes with me.

573
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,100
I'm not sure if I can make it.

574
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,100
I'm not sure.

575
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,100
I'm not sure.

576
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,100
I'm not sure.

577
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,100
I'm not sure.

578
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,100
I'm not sure.

579
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,100
I'm not sure.

580
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,100
I'm not sure.

581
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,100
There's always a voice in my mind that interferes with me.

582
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,100
I'm not sure.

583
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,100
But I just couldn't do it.

584
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,100
I know he took a photo of me.

585
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,100
What's the sound like?

586
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,100
I can't tell.

587
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,100
But my eyes are telling me that it's dangerous.

588
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,100
Let's go.

589
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,100
If anything happens, you'll be fine.

590
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,100
Let's go.

591
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,100
Then we need to break through the code first.

592
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,100
Pan Zi, you've learned it.

593
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,100
This code is different from what I've learned.

594
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,100
I've never seen such a code.

595
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,100
But this kind of code change...

596
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,100
Is it because of that person's corner?

597
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,100
If it's like this, it's not a small number.

598
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,100
Then the person who left the code is too heartless.

599
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,100
Then aren't we just busy walking along the blind road?

600
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,100
As I said, we don't have any use in chatting here for a long time.

601
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,100
Because this code is not for us at all.

602
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,100
As I said, we just walk our own path.

603
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,100
Isn't it just a path?

604
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,100
You should have said it earlier.

605
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,100
We don't have to waste time on this code.

606
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,100
Let's go.

607
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,100
We still need to be careful.

608
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,100
There might be a way out and a full-fledged mechanism in this path.

609
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,100
Let's go.

610
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:04,100
I'm telling you, we still need to try the field.

611
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:08,100
Even if there's a mechanism, they'll break it first.

612
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,100
Oh my god, my old man.

613
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,100
Oh my god, my old man.

614
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,100
What did I say?

615
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,100
What did I say?

616
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,100
What did I say?

617
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,100
The broken bone of a man and the broken bone of a woman.

618
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,100
I'm going to kill you.

619
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,100
I'm dead.

620
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,100
I feel so comfortable.

621
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,100
Shunzi, what are you looking at?

622
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,100
Shunzi.

623
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,100
What else can I do?

624
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,100
Shunzi.

625
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,100
Shunzi.

626
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,100
Shunzi.

627
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:56,100
I said, these people have been dead for a long time.

628
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,100
Are they our classmate?

629
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:03,100
They are the most popular in the eight to ninety years.

630
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:07,100
Do these people have to be killed or killed?

631
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,100
Impossible.

632
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:12,100
Our experts are the ones who have to go to the place where they were.

633
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,100
How could those people have to be killed?

634
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,100
Impossible.

635
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,100
Be careful.

636
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,100
Shanghai Cemetery.

637
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,100
The old house.

638
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,100
This woman is not a thief.

639
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:44,100
Even if the mayor was in charge of this, it wouldn't be so difficult for her to be in charge of this.

640
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:48,100
If she was missing, she would have been a big accident.

641
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:53,100
Shunzi, did you have a good time here?

642
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:57,100
Shunzi, did you have a good time here?

643
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,100
Shunzi.

644
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,100
Shunzi, I'm talking to you.

645
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,100
Shunzi.

646
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,100
Shunzi.

647
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,100
Shunzi.

648
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,100
Dad.

649
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,100
Shunzi.

650
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,100
Shunzi.

651
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,100
Thank you.

652
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,100
You're welcome.

653
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,100
Shunzi.

654
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,100
I'm very clear.

655
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,100
I hope you won't tell Qiu Dekang.

656
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,100
I can guarantee that.

657
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:41,100
But I can't guarantee that, Sir.

658
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:48,100
Didn't Qiu Dekang tell you what he did to Tian Gong?

659
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,100
Just like you.

660
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,100
No.

661
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,100
I can rely on him to grow up.

662
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,100
I can understand you.

663
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,100
What do you want to say?

664
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,100
I want to say that you should think about it.

665
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,100
A person of such a big age,

666
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:09,100
can run, can jump, can climb snow mountains.

667
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:13,100
Of course, you won't believe many things you didn't see.

668
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,100
After he comes out, you should observe it.

669
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:20,100
Some people were kissed by the god when they were born.

670
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,100
They have the talent to surpass ordinary people.

671
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,100
Ask him if he's not the god.

672
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,100
He's the devil.

673
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,100
The devil of ancient wood.

674
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,100
Before things are over, stay here.

675
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,100
Don't go out for a walk.

676
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,100
Why did you do that?

677
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,100
Why?

678
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,100
Are you so scared that I'll break your plan for Qiu Dekang?

679
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,100
I can clearly solve them all.

680
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:03,100
Grandma, people say you're a good girl.

681
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,100
Are you scared?

682
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,100
You're afraid of me?

683
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,100
I'm afraid of you.

684
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,100
I'm afraid of you.

685
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,100
I'm afraid of you.

686
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,100
Are you scared?

687
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,100
What kind of agreement did you make with Qiu Dekang?

688
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,100
How did he convince you?

689
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,100
Why did you give up on the truth?

690
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,100
You didn't investigate it seriously.

691
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,100
He's so naive.

692
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,100
Why?

693
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,100
Grandma, give me some.

694
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,100
Grandma.

695
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,100
Grandma.

696
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,100
Grandma.

697
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,100
I understand your feelings.

698
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,100
My grandpa went there too.

699
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,100
But God has been looking after you.

700
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:40,100
He asked us to come here to find your father.

701
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,100
So,

702
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,100
don't care about his hair.

703
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,100
You won't get a single one when you're done.

704
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,100
Thank you.

705
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,100
Shun Zi.

706
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,100
Take care.

707
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,100
I always think

708
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,100
that these people who came here

709
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,100
are a little strange.

710
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,100
What's so strange about this?

711
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,100
Look.

712
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,100
Shun Zi's father didn't say anything.

713
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,100
They were just imagining things.

714
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,100
What about the rest of them?

715
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,100
They also had to come here

716
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,100
when they were not in the first place.

717
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,100
That means

718
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,100
they must not be ordinary tourists.

719
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,100
Isn't this strange?

720
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:44,100
Why are you afraid of this?

721
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,100
Dash each time.

722
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:05,100
It can't prove their identities.

723
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,100
They don't even have a ID.

724
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,880
But what you stole

725
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,200
They're all dead.

726
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,400
They can definitely go out.

727
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,400
How can they go out?

728
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,800
Don't you think it's weird?

729
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,240
No matter what,

730
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,280
they're capable of going out.

731
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,840
They should die on the way out.

732
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,640
But they're sitting here.

733
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,560
It seems like they're...

734
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,280
Waiting for death?

735
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,800
Are they not willing to let these treasures go?

736
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,600
Don't talk nonsense.

737
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,520
You found that there's not a single thing missing?

738
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,520
What's missing?

739
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,760
Food.

740
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,160
Look.

741
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,160
They're all gone.

742
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,680
They're not dead on the way out.

743
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,600
They're all gone.

744
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:10,920
