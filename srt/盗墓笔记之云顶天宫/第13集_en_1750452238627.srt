1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not sure.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not sure.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not sure.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not sure.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not sure.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not sure.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not sure.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not sure.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not sure.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not sure.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Is that strong?

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's strong...

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Let's see.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If you use Sparks of Honor,

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I don't use it as a 부itetop.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I don't use it.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I don't Wow

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Qian.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Can you speak a word of annoyance to me?

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
No.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
If you draw it in a line, these two pieces can be combined.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But if these two pieces are combined, the other pieces will be wrong.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Actually, I think the most important problem is the line.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I think the most important problem is the line.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Actually, I think the most important problem is the line.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is the same.

45
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,000
Boss Ji Wei, eat something first. It's been so long.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Boss Ji Wei, eat something first.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Fatty, can you stop making trouble?

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You can't do anything stupid.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'll go and get it.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Look, is this part of the line fighting?

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
According to my understanding, it's more accurate.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Fight?

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Boss Ji Wei, eat something first.

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Jia Sha.

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Master.

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Mrs. Huo helped Qiu De Kou to make a lot of cultural relics.

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Then the photo could be Qiu De Kou's photo.

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Mrs. Huo asked me to do it.

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'll do it.

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But the thing is that Miss Xiuxiu knows about it.

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
After all, the cultural relics case, if she helps,

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
then you will be more convenient to deal with it.

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Go and get Xiuxiu.

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Okay.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It seems that grandma really participated in the cultural relics.

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Xiuxiu, we found some information about her in the business.

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You take the breath first.

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
This matter is not as important as we thought.

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'll go and get Xiuxiu.

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Okay.

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
How can it be so simple?

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Maybe grandma has something to be worried about.

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Master Hua.

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Look.

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
This person is Zhang Hao's superior.

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
His name is Dao Ge.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This Dao Ge is very cautious.

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Even looking for a woman, he has to be on his own.

80
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Without two secret codes, you can't see him.

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And this person is very busy with business.

82
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
He is on his own.

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Just like the current clear-cut operation route,

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
there are old houses, Thailand,

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and then the waterway to Europe.

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Why is he so cautious?

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He has changed a lot of things in the picture.

88
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So it's hard to investigate the case.

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Everyone likes Dao Ge's mouth and way.

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So the whole 70% of the seller of Changsha

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
has a cooperation with him.

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So to speak,

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
this Dao Ge has a large amount of trading orders.

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
If we want to enter the group,

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
we must control it.

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
But Master Hua, this Dao Ge is very cunning.

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Even the ancient treasure is an ancient disease.

98
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I think the general way is that he won't be fooled.

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Little brother, I have a way.

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
This is the story of the death of the King of Wan Nu

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
after he was buried in the bottom of the sea.

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
He was re-punished to the town

103
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
to fight the killing of Xi Nan.

104
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But I always think that...

105
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So the 12-digit treasure in the bottom of the sea

106
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
is the wife of the King of Wan Nu?

107
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's quite interesting.

108
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The one in the back is a love letter.

109
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yes, it says what is love?

110
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Two flying leaves are in a lifetime.

111
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's all about the long journey.

112
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The long journey is endless.

113
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The lost love in life.

114
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What's the point of living in the end?

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
This...

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
This is obviously the word Yan Qiu in the story of the King of Wan Nu.

117
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What is love in the world?

118
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's all about the long journey.

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The two flying leaves in the southern part of the world

120
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
are all about the long journey.

121
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The lost love in life.

122
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The lost love in life.

123
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The lost love in life.

124
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The lost love in life.

125
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
The lost love in life.

126
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The lost love in life.

127
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

128
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I've never seen Teacher Jing's fairy-tale.

129
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So...

130
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You wrote a bunch of love letters in the back.

131
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's all about the love letter.

132
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's a love letter.

133
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It must be the love letter that the King of Wan Nu expressed to Wang Qi.

134
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
The wife of the King of Wan Nu.

135
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
One is from the northeast, one is from the southwest.

136
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
One is from the southern part.

137
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Just a big bug.

138
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What's so cute about it?

139
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's all about the love letter.

140
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Are you guys okay?

141
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm fine.

142
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Wu Xin.

143
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The King of Wan Nu

144
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The King of Wan Nu

145
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The King of Wan Nu

146
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Are you sure that your team is correct?

147
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I think so.

148
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I made the letter with Wu Xin.

149
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I think it's right.

150
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Wu Xin.

151
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Wu Xin.

152
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Wu Xin.

153
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Wu Xin.

154
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Wu Xin.

155
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You...

156
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You can't do it, Wu Xin.

157
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Fatty.

158
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Where's the one that you touched earlier?

159
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Where did you touch?

160
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Where did you touch?

161
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I mean, did you touch anything else?

162
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Me again?

163
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
This statue is our only variable now.

164
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Come here.

165
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Help me clean the chicken blood.

166
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The King of Wan Nu

168
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
The King of Wan Nu

169
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The King of Wan Nu

170
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
The King of Wan Nu

171
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The King of Wan Nu

172
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The King of Wan Nu

173
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,240
This King of Wan Nu

174
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,000
needs you to do it, · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · ·

175
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,560
So, he wasnik

176
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,580
That's why they add vinegar and wentل

177
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,000
and helped him grow.

178
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,560
You won't hire them.

179
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,080
I didn't think the King of Wan Nu

180
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,580
was so old for so long.

181
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,580
What else do you think?

182
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,880
Isn't this reasonable?

183
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,080
Doesn't matter how.

184
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,080
It's the wisdom of a resort official.

185
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,080
Have you sons.

186
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,480
In all, this door is opened.

187
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,420
No, it's not...

188
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:52,920
Anyways

189
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,180
No one invites us against...

190
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,560
...the door?

191
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,740
No one wants to?

192
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,660
S lecture...

193
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,540
Clean up guys!

194
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,840
Jiang Qin you're killing me right now.

195
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,240
You're taking my blood?

196
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,340
You want to die?

197
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,140
酬

198
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,540
My blood?

199
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,620
Did untericaner say anything?

200
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:33,840
What now?

201
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,580
Playdy-dun correctly?

202
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,580
Isn't Su Cheng just a big worm?

203
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,060
Generally speaking,

204
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,980
the one who is buried in Pei Zang is the purple green tree of the Mu people.

205
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,580
Otherwise, it would be the worm.

206
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,260
But if it's the purple green tree,

207
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,380
the content of these paintings should be their daily life.

208
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,580
If it's the worm,

209
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,980
the one who is depicted should be the relative of the Chao family.

210
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,380
For example, the cultural and intellectuals,

211
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,380
the military and the military,

212
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,780
if you look at it like this,

213
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,180
these paintings...

214
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,180
seem to be not two-faced.

215
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,580
Why are there bugs?

216
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,980
You're right.

217
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,180
And even if it's a dragon,

218
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,980
the people who worship it must have a leader.

219
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,780
This is Pei Zang.

220
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,580
Then they should be considered as the King of Wan Nu.

221
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,580
The one who is depicted in Pei Zang should be the King of Wan Nu's left and right.

222
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,780
But look at now.

223
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,980
Besides soldiers and slaves,

224
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,180
it's so strange.

225
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:43,380
And this is the painting in the imperial order.

226
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,780
But it's too unusual.

227
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,780
Is it possible that this painting is also double-layered?

228
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,780
Let's dig it out.

229
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,980
Don't dig it out.

230
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,980
This is a cultural item.

231
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,980
Look.

232
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,380
It's already fallen off.

233
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,780
But there's nothing special behind it.

234
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,780
It's all clear and clear.

235
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,780
We can't get out of here.

236
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,780
The King of Wan Nu

237
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,780
The King of Wan Nu

238
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,780
The King of Wan Nu

239
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,780
Jiao Sha.

240
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,780
The room next to the knife and knife can be opened every time.

241
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,780
You have to make sure both sides are prepared.

242
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,780
You must control the knife and knife in the first place.

243
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,780
Don't worry, Your Highness.

244
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,780
I've already settled down the upper floor.

245
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,780
It's a very hidden place.

246
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,780
Is Qiao Qiao reliable?

247
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:09,780
This Qiao Qiao is always the one who makes the soup.

248
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,780
She can trust me.

249
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,780
The King of Wan Nu

250
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,780
Little Brother Hua.

251
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:35,780
Look at my dress and your flower-like smile.

252
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,780
Who's beautiful?

253
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,780
Xiao Xiao.

254
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,780
This isn't a joke.

255
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,780
If you're not ready, I have a plan.

256
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,780
Thank you, Miss.

257
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,780
The way you dress now

258
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,780
is totally in line with the knife and knife.

259
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,780
That's natural.

260
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,780
Okay.

261
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,780
Xiao Xiao.

262
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,780
From now on, your name is Samer.

263
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,780
There's a positioning device in this earring.

264
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,780
You should be careful with the hidden ones.

265
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,780
If there's anything wrong, you can protect yourself.

266
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,780
Got it.

267
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,780
All right.

268
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,780
Listen up.

269
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,780
Get ready.

270
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,780
The guests will be here soon.

271
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,780
Miss.

272
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,780
Samer.

273
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,780
I'll find you a perfect actor for today's show.

274
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,780
Thank you, Miss.

275
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,780
I'll recommend you to do it yourself.

276
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,780
Miss, you're so nice to me.

277
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,780
I'll depend on you.

278
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,780
Thank you, Miss.

279
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,780
I didn't expect such a nice scene.

280
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,780
Next time, we'll have a great scene.

281
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,780
Take your sisters with you.

282
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,780
Did you hear that?

283
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,780
A great scene.

284
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,780
Come on.

285
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,780
I'll go first.

286
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,780
I'll go pick up the bags.

287
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,780
Come on.

288
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,780
You must take me with you.

289
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,780
Yes, I have to go.

290
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,780
Don't be so shy.

291
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,780
We're all sisters.

292
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,780
We're all sisters.

293
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,780
Thank you.

294
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,780
I'll go pick up the bags.

295
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,780
This is too poor.

296
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,780
There's no funeral.

297
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,780
It's not like the king of the Wandong

298
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,780
has put all the funeral stuff in his room.

299
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:17,780
There's nothing left in the funeral.

300
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,780
Can you cover such a big tomb?

301
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,780
Can't you spare those funeral items?

302
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,780
I think there must be some special reason.

303
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,780
That's not right.

304
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,780
No matter how he makes up the small country,

305
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,780
no matter how he makes up the small country,

306
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,780
no matter how he makes up the small country,

307
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,780
no matter how he makes up the small country,

308
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,780
no matter how he makes up the small country,

309
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,780
no matter how he makes up the small country,

310
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,780
no matter how he makes up the small country,

311
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,780
no matter how he make up the small country,

312
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,780
no matter how he makes up the small country,

313
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,780
no matter how he makes up the small country,

314
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,780
no matter how he makes up the small country,

315
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,780
no matter how he makes up the small country,

316
00:23:51,780 --> 00:24:01,780
no matter how he makes up the small country,

317
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,720
There are three

318
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,780
on the whole.

319
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,780
Three on the platform.

320
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,780
Is Pei Deng's brother

321
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,780
really loyal

322
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,780
to his wife and child?

323
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,780
This is a honey stone.

324
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,780
Look.

325
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,780
The entrance to the underground palace

326
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,780
must be up here.

327
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,780
Did Pei Deng

328
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,780
just look here?

329
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,780
Come on.

330
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,780
Wait a minute.

331
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,780
Brother Xia,

332
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,780
do you want to check

333
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,780
if there are any mechanisms here?

334
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,780
How is it?

335
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,780
No.

336
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,780
Come on.

337
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,780
Come on.

338
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,780
Let's do it together.

339
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,780
Listen to me.

340
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,780
One, two, three.

341
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,780
One, two.

342
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,780
Come on.

343
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,780
Let's add more strength.

344
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,780
One, two.

345
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,780
One, two.

346
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,780
Come on.

347
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,780
One, two, three.

348
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,780
One, two.

349
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,780
One, two.

350
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,780
Come on.

351
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,780
Come on.

352
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,780
What's going on?

353
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,780
Is this honey stone fake?

354
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,780
No way.

355
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,780
This is the most basic thing.

356
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,780
I can't play with this.

357
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,780
I'm sure it's down there.

358
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,780
Is it down there

359
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,780
in this blue brick?

360
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,780
These new bricks

361
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,780
are not sealed by iron.

362
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,780
This means

363
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,780
it's not necessarily sealed

364
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,780
by the entrance.

365
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,780
Open it first.

366
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,780
Right?

367
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,780
Come on.

368
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,780
This is not right.

369
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,780
Come on.

370
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,780
Come on.

371
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,780
Miss Xiu Xiu is really extraordinary.

372
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,780
It's been a while.

373
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,780
She's already in their internal part.

374
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,780
Jia Sha.

375
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,780
Jia Sha.

376
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,780
Don't be so exaggerated

377
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,780
in the future.

378
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,780
The more you participate,

379
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,780
the better.

380
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,780
I got it.

381
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,780
Master Hua,

382
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,780
Dao is here.

383
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,780
Dao,

384
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,780
look.

385
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,780
The girls are waiting.

386
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,780
Hi, girls.

387
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,780
Come on.

388
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,780
Dao.

389
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,780
Dao,

390
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,780
there's a new girl today.

391
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,780
What's her name?

392
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,780
My name is Samar.

393
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,780
I'm a mask.

394
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,780
You know

395
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,780
it better go.

396
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,780
Your clothes

397
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,780
on.

398
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,780
You should wear it simultaneously

399
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,940
when you ROBCUAL

400
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,220
people ask for it.

401
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,780
I'm afraid you can't take care of her.

402
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,780
We're saved! Go!

403
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,780
Sit down, sit down! You guys sit down!

404
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,780
Be careful, everyone.

405
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,780
The target is in the elevator.

406
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,780
Sit down.

407
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,780
Brother Dao,

408
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,780
let's drink some wine first.

409
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,780
Drink some wine?

410
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,780
No, I don't want to.

411
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,780
Drink some wine.

412
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,780
Don't you feel it after drinking?

413
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,780
Drink some wine.

414
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,780
Why are you playing music?

415
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,780
I'm just going to wake up.

416
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,780
Let's listen to the song first.

417
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,780
Let's listen to the song.

418
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,780
What song?

419
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,780
Let's dance after listening to the song.

420
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,780
What song?

421
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,780
Brother Dao, you...

422
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,780
Let's dance first.

423
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,780
Everyone, get ready to dance.

424
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,780
Brother Dao, let's drink some wine first.

425
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,780
Drink some wine.

426
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,780
Come on.

427
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,780
Cheers.

428
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,780
Wait.

429
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,780
I'll drink this one.

430
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,780
Cheers.

431
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,780
Why don't you drink it?

432
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,780
Brother Dao, you really can drink it.

433
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,780
I won't make a mistake with you.

434
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,780
I'll go take a shower first.

435
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,780
What shower? Come on.

436
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,780
Brother Dao, you...

437
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,780
What?

438
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,780
Master,

439
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,780
this kind of lady will be in danger.

440
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,780
Who's there?

441
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,780
Hold the gun.

442
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,780
Go after her.

443
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,780
Go.

444
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,780
Oh, my.

445
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,780
Is this the seal?

446
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,780
No.

447
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,780
Why is this shell on the woman's face?

448
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,780
Why hasn't the underground palace been opened yet?

449
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,780
What are you talking about?

450
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,780
Didn't you know that she was naked?

451
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,780
Come on.

452
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,780
This stone is a stone carved by a monk.

453
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,780
What's wrong?

454
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,780
What's wrong?

455
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,780
What's wrong?

456
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,780
I'm hurt.

457
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,780
Master.

458
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,780
These three dragons are fake.

459
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,780
The dragon head's defense is wrong.

460
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,780
How could it be fake?

461
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,780
Master.

462
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,780
This...

463
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,780
Such a big stone carved by a monk.

464
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,780
When we were near the mountain,

465
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,780
the stone was already affected.

466
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,780
The first thing that Master used

467
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,780
to set the stone with the dragon head

468
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,780
was the wrong thing.

469
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,780
The dragon head was also

470
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,780
broken out by the wrong thing.

471
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,780
Of course it's fake.

472
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,780
But this Kunlun Pill,

473
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,780
this Ice Ball,

474
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,780
and this Spirit Palace,

475
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,780
are all fake.

476
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,780
They're all lies.

477
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,780
They're all to

478
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,780
cause the crime of us

479
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,780
coming here in this trap.

480
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,780
I'm just saying why

481
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,780
there's no such thing as a gift

482
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,780
as a gift.

483
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,780
There's nothing

484
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,780
that should be in the spirit palace.

485
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,780
What's going on?

486
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,780
Are they all dead?

487
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,780
You and I

488
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,780
are not even

489
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,780
able to turn to the Three Kingdoms.

490
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,780
If we're going back to the rest area,

491
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,780
we'll waste all the time

492
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,780
we have to go back.

493
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,780
We're in a bad health condition.

494
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,780
We have to rest a few more days.

495
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,780
We have no time.

496
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,780
We're all wasted.

497
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,780
Even if they leave,

498
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,780
they'll definitely be in front of us.

499
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,780
Don't worry.

500
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,780
We'll go back to the village

501
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,780
and get out of here

502
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,780
and leave.

503
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,780
It's impossible for this time

504
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,780
to take so long.

505
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,780
It's impossible to

506
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:55,780
transfer all the stuff

507
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,780
and the stuff.

508
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,780
It's impossible.

509
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,780
If we come back as soon as possible,

510
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,780
we'll definitely

511
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,780
have some more food.

512
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,780
Have some more food?

513
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,780
You came all the way

514
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,780
to eat some more food, right?

515
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,780
You're really a good cook.

516
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,780
Li Zhaoduo, you tell me.

517
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,780
Didn't you say

518
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,780
you were going back to the rest area?

519
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,780
Go back.

520
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,780
You're early.

521
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,780
Do you know how to do it?

522
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,780
I know how to do it.

523
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,780
Why are you taking me out?

524
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,780
I can take you out.

525
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,780
But now

526
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,780
everyone's physical strength is transparent.

527
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,780
We have to rest for a while.

528
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,780
Otherwise, we'll be tired

529
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,780
on the way.

530
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,780
What do you think?

531
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,780
You're a mischievous person.

532
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,780
Shut up.

533
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,780
Yes, you can.

534
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,780
Say it.

535
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,780
Come on.

536
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,780
Say it.

537
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,780
Say it.

538
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,780
Are you crazy?

539
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,780
What are you talking about?

540
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,780
You're blaming me, right?

541
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,780
I'm blaming you.

542
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,780
What are you guys arguing about?

543
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,780
If something happens,

544
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,780
we'll...

545
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,780
We'll have to make up for it.

546
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,780
No need to make up for it.

547
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,780
I'm telling you,

548
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,780
it's okay.

549
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,780
If you keep doing this,

550
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,780
no one will get hurt.

551
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,780
Do you dare to say

552
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,780
they didn't get hurt?

553
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,780
They might have

554
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,780
made the whole area wrong.

555
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,780
They might have been

556
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,780
beaten up by the border guards.

557
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,780
I'm telling you,

558
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,780
you have to go back

559
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,780
as soon as possible

560
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,780
and pack your stuff.

561
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,780
Come back when you're done.

562
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,780
What waste of time?

563
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,780
Let's go.

564
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,780
Are you out of your mind?

565
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,780
Are you out of your mind?

566
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,780
I'm out of your mind.

567
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,780
Are you out of your mind?

568
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,780
I'm leaving.

569
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,780
Stop it.

570
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,780
Come here.

571
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,780
Fatty, listen to me.

572
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,780
Don't you think it's weird?

573
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,780
We've been

574
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,780
so anxious

575
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,780
since we came here.

576
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,780
Even if we know

577
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,780
we shouldn't be so impatient.

578
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,780
Now, you're working hard.

579
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,780
I'm working hard.

580
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,780
She's working hard.

581
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,780
Come here.

582
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,780
This time

583
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,780
can affect

584
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,780
the strong and strong

585
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,780
emotions.

586
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,780
It will make people

587
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,780
feel very emotional.

588
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,780
So I hope you can

589
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,780
control your emotions.

590
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,780
Xiao Ge.

591
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,780
Are you headache again?

592
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,780
I'm not in serious blackout.

593
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,780
But I can feel it.

594
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,780
This place is weird.

595
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,780
I think it will be found.

596
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,780
Where?

597
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,780
This is another road.

598
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,780
There's another spirit.

599
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,780
I don't think it's possible.

600
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,780
The parking lot and the fence

601
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,780
have exposed

602
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,780
the owner of the tomb

603
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,780
to deceive us.

604
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,780
If that's the case,

605
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,780
the person who got scared

606
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,780
and the evil spirit

607
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,780
broke down here.

608
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,780
Then the real spirit

609
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,780
will be exposed.

610
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,780
Is there any other place?

611
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,780
I think

612
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,780
there must be other places.

613
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,780
It seems different.

614
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,780
But where is the hidden place?

615
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,780
How did you find it?

616
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,780
What's so weird?

617
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,780
I think it's the same.

618
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,980
A bit of林圖

619
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:43,420
When they sent a

620
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:49,980
Shun Zi, since he was ill, his health has changed a lot.

621
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:54,980
When he was scared, he was looking for a way out.

622
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:07,780
It's getting dark outside. The temperature here is getting lower. Let's clean up.

623
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,180
Let me tell you.

624
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,580
I used the same medicine as the medicine. It was fully open.

625
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,980
And it didn't affect the other side.

626
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:24,580
It wasn't you who used the poor thing.

627
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:27,580
Do you believe that I'm going to put the medicine in your mouth?

628
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,480
Lang Feng, Lang Feng, calm down.

629
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,380
Don't forget that we're in a bad mood.

630
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,980
You're a big shot. Just wait.

631
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,980
Don't be so weak.

632
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,380
We can't go out this time.

633
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:47,980
Zhen Ming Qiang got a very special special structure.

634
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,580
He could only open it from that side. He was sealed from outside.

635
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,180
He couldn't see that we couldn't go out.

636
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,180
This is the method of repairing the wood.

637
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,780
It's used to repair the escape tunnel.

638
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:59,980
I guess this tunnel can directly reach the real wood.

639
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,880
We can't open it from here.

640
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,980
It's been hundreds of years.

641
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,480
We can't open it.

642
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,280
It's mainly because of its special structure.

643
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,480
When the craftsman left, the craftsman was moving towards the outside.

644
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,380
He used the rope structure to seal the hole.

645
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,380
This way, the equipment was guaranteed to be used.

646
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,780
We didn't need to prepare too much money.

647
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:20,180
At the same time, it was guaranteed to be very strict and insensitive.

648
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:23,880
It's just that the smell of this hall is too strong.

649
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,880
In the past craftsmen,

650
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,780
the material was not so strong.

651
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,080
They couldn't support it.

652
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:32,080
So this is the main reason why we're in a bad mood.

653
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,480
I'm afraid that if we use the current method to remove the wood,

654
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,880
it will cause a lot of damage.

655
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,480
So, we'd better go to the other side.

656
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,260
I...

657
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,280
I can't control.

658
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,460
I don't even have a safe house.

659
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,480
If you don't network,

660
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,780
you may lose yourself to the walls.

661
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:56,980
It will destroy all rot coloring.

662
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,480
However,

Hua Ye, his soldiers have been taken care of.

669
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,180
Take him away.

670
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:24,180
What are you doing? I can't find you!

671
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,180
Wait!

672
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,180
This must be the ancestral edict. We must return it.

673
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,180
Otherwise, we can't go out forever.

674
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,180
Lang Fang!

675
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,180
Let him burn it.

676
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,180
Otherwise, we will go out forever.

677
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,180
Xiao Ge'er.

678
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:54,180
What if the soldiers in the hall melt?

679
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:15,180
The sun is shining.

680
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:18,180
The wind is blowing.

681
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:22,180
The wind is blowing.

682
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:25,180
The wind is blowing.

683
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,180
The wind is blowing.

684
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,180
The wind is blowing.

685
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:48,180
The wind is blowing.

686
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,180
The wind is blowing.

687
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,180
The wind is blowing.

688
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:54,180
The wind is blowing.

689
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:56,180
The wind is blowing.

690
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:58,180
The wind is blowing.

691
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,180
The wind is blowing.

692
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,180
The wind is blowing.

693
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:04,180
The wind is blowing.

694
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:06,180
The wind is blowing.

695
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:08,180
The wind is blowing.
