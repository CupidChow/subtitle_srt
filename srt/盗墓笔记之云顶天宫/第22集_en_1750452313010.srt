1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 1

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 1

8
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 1

9
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Episode 1

10
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We need to fix this.

11
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We just had a bad fight.

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We need to recover our strength.

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Didn't you see that?

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We've been resting for two hours.

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I think we should leave right away.

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Two hours?

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Where do you think this is?

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Is there a playground?

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We can rest here.

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What is this place?

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We can get out of here.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
If we die, what's the point?

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We've prepared everything.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We've just finished the tour.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We won't come here so soon.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You know this ancient tomb.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
How dangerous it is to wait for us.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This is the best chance.

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I know you're in a bad state.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But you can't go on your own.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Rest for one more hour.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You can leave immediately after one hour.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Are you sure?

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm sure.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Master Chen, you'd better sit down.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You'll be on your way.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What's the matter?

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'll go get you a little girl.

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You want to follow me?

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Master Chen?

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I've been looking for you.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I really don't know about you.

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I've been looking for you for a long time.

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I've been looking for you for a long time.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I've been looking for you for a long time.

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I haven't come here yet.

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You didn't come here, did you?

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
No, I didn't.

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I didn't come here to see you.

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I didn't come here to see you.

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Who is Jing Jing?

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What's wrong with you? You're so tired.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You haven't been there yet.

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You still don't understand the situation.

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
We have to be on the same side, you know?

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm telling you, Ning and the others are bad.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What's wrong with you?

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Slow down.

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Are you okay?

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's okay with you.

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
No.

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You can't look at the wound.

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Or it'll be dangerous.

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Everyone is going to die.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
No one can believe it.

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Don't worry, Third Master. I'll remember.

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Fatty. Fatty.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Come here and help me boil water.

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Where is Third Master?

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He's injured and he's walking around.

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
He's gone to the water.

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Third Master is the most worried about others.

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
He takes care of him like a patient.

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Come and help.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Xiao Zhao, go out and have a look.

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What does Master Chen and Third Master need to help?

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes.

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What are you looking at?

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The water is going to be boiled.

80
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Help me.

81
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Come in.

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Fatty.

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Can't you let us go?

84
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What's wrong?

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Let me ask you.

86
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Do you know where this is?

87
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
This...

88
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
This...

89
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
This is the Cloud Sky Palace.

90
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That's wrong.

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
This is where you will die.

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
If you still believe in Yan,

93
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
you will die soon.

94
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Third Master.

95
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I didn't call you.

96
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I just respect you.

97
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But it doesn't mean you know me.

98
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You can care about me.

99
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And I'm not the only one who's out of this world.

100
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I can't find the purpose of this fight.

101
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
For this fight,

102
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I've been messed up by many things.

103
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I really don't want you to get involved again.

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Wu Xie.

105
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
This time, you are a very important person.

106
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You've made a choice.

107
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You have to take responsibility for your own choice.

108
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Doing things,

109
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
the most important thing is to be gentle.

110
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Remember what's most important.

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Some things your Third Uncle thinks

112
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
are not the best time to tell you.

113
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
slap

114
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Wu Xie, I have to go.

115
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But before that,

116
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
hurry back.

117
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,920
If you keep going,

118
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,520
this is where you're not going to die.

119
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,300
What's this again?

120
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,020
Your Majesty!

121
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,820
What is happening?

122
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,420
Your Majesty.

123
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,520
The document of the book is open to the entire line of three drafts.

124
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:21,520
You're crazy. You can't do it.

125
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,520
But you have to tell me how much you've got.

126
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,520
To be honest, I can't do this.

127
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:42,520
You know that I can't hold the old Shao Shao of the Huo family anymore.

128
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:48,520
I've already been hurt by the old Shao Shao of the Huo family.

129
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,520
Look at you. You're just a waste of time.

130
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,520
You're going to make the Huo family suffer.

131
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,520
You're so famous.

132
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,520
You don't want Huo Ling to be in charge of this?

133
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,520
That's our mother and daughter's fate.

134
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,520
Fate is endless.

135
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,520
You think we won't have any traces of what we used to do?

136
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,520
You think we won't be prepared?

137
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,520
You've already been with us for a long time.

138
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,520
You don't want to see the Huo family rot in your hands, do you?

139
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,520
You have to do this.

140
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,520
You have to do it, too.

141
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,520
You have to do it.

142
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,520
Look, you can sign it if you have no problem.

143
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,520
If you want to delay your time and wait for your men to come,

144
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,520
I don't think it's necessary.

145
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,520
Because they're not my opponents.

146
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,520
There's a little girl who keeps hiding behind the door.

147
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,520
But she just ran out.

148
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,520
Madam!

149
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,520
Madam!

150
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,520
Bad news.

151
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,520
Miss Xiu Xiu has left.

152
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,520
She even stole the house.

153
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,520
She's been hiding behind the door.

154
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,520
She's been hiding behind the door.

155
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,520
She's been hiding behind the door.

156
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,520
She's been hiding behind the door.

157
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,520
Miss Xiu Xiu has left.

158
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,520
She even stole the key and the box of the machine gun.

159
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,520
Madam!

160
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,520
Come here!

161
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,520
Call the doctor!

162
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,520
Madam!

163
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,520
Xiao Ge left me a note.

164
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,520
She said she'd leave by herself.

165
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,520
She said she'd leave by herself.

166
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,520
She said she'd leave by herself.

167
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,520
Uncle San.

168
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,520
How do I feel that you already know?

169
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,520
Xiao Ge took Chen Pi A away with her.

170
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,520
She should be with him.

171
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,520
Where did Xiao Ge go by herself?

172
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,520
I've changed my mind.

173
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,520
How do I know where she went?

174
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,520
Xiao Hua mentioned this to me when we were chatting.

175
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,520
Someone used to make human skin masks.

176
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,520
After wearing them,

177
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,520
they can use fake needles to compare the current plastic surgery.

178
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,520
Xiao Hua has also learned to make it for a while.

179
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,520
Although it's not so perfect,

180
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,520
but if I'm not a very familiar person,

181
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,520
I can't tell the difference.

182
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,520
Really?

183
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,520
So,

184
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,520
when did Chen Pi A Seng

185
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,520
get the bag you dropped?

186
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,520
Did he...

187
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,520
Did he...

188
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,520
Did he...

189
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,520
Did he...

190
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,520
Did he...

191
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,520
Did I, Uncle San,

192
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,520
do...

193
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,520
do...

194
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,520
do...

195
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,520
Little thief,

196
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,520
did you fall from the top

197
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,520
and break your head?

198
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,520
What are you looking at?

199
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,520
Maybe they are over there.

200
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,520
Go to a rest Area.

201
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,520
They too.

202
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,520
Over here.

203
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,840
What?

204
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:41,800
All the action was based on

205
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,040
You can give Ning a chance to break them.

206
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,240
What? You...

207
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,240
Shhh!

208
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,440
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

209
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,120
We should have waited for Huahe to be here.

210
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,360
We should have let him break them.

211
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,760
Why did you have to work with Qiu?

212
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,640
You are not the only one who knows the rules.

213
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,040
You are also the one who has to deal with the situation.

214
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,920
You are talking about him?

215
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,600
It selbst against clothes.

216
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,600
It dato the brain.

217
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,320
It requires a smart operation of the 솔 Unfortunately, Yoon Yuck showed that he used a powder.

218
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,920
Voice trouble.

219
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,920
He got mad.

220
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,280
Running the movies.

221
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:37,200
This cooperation is okay, but how can we discuss it?

222
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,680
I didn't get the money this time.

223
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,160
The key is that we don't know what they know.

224
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,480
When we know what they know,

225
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,680
we'll have a deal with them.

226
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,960
Right?

227
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,560
Okay, then you can talk to them.

228
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,320
I'm really lazy to talk to them.

229
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,440
Okay?

230
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,360
Third Master, are you feeling better?

231
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,160
No, I'm getting more and more painful.

232
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,280
You want to cooperate?

233
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,280
But since we're working together,

234
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,280
we have to make a deal.

235
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,280
Tell me your demands.

236
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,280
I'm not very clear about Third Master's purpose.

237
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,280
I just want to listen to his orders.

238
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,280
But I can explain the past to you.

239
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,880
When I was at the bottom of the sea, I received orders to find two things.

240
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,880
One is the jade seal,

241
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,280
which is the jade seal of the Wenshian Foundation.

242
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,280
It can summon the army of the Yin family,

243
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,280
and the other one is the structure of the Cloud Sky Palace.

244
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,280
Unfortunately, I didn't find it.

245
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,980
Jade seal?

246
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,880
The Jade seal of King of Lu Shan's?

247
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,280
In the bottom of the sea?

248
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,880
After King of Lu Shan's tomb was found by the Wanzhang Sea,

249
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,280
he replaced the jade seal with the snake-meat jade seal.

250
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,880
We always thought that the jade seal was brought into the bottom of the sea to bury it,

251
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,480
but we didn't find anything in the bottom of the sea.

252
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,880
And the structure of the Cloud Sky Palace

253
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,880
must have been in Wu San Xing's hands.

254
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,280
Until now, we don't know how many times Wu San Xing has been put in place,

255
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,680
but we still have to cooperate with him.

256
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,480
Because his news is more accurate than ours.

257
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,280
Then what have you found in the bottom of the sea?

258
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,280
Don't mess with the evidence.

259
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,480
These are the details of the details of the secret paintings of the bottom of the sea.

260
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,480
Look at them.

261
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,080
You surprised me this time.

262
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,080
What do you mean?

263
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,080
I know. You are an old man.

264
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,880
In your eyes, I am just a half-sister-in-law.

265
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,080
It's easy for me to say, but...

266
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,680
You must know some things sooner or later.

267
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,680
Otherwise, there is no way to work together in the next step.

268
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,080
Even so, you have to dig deeper into the bottom of the sea.

269
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,480
This is the style of your old man, isn't it?

270
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,880
It's really too tiring to be a person like you.

271
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,880
You are really talking nonsense. Do you still want to see it?

272
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,080
I will see.

273
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,880
I will see.

274
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,480
The person who was captured was Wang Zanghai.

275
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,480
Yes.

276
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,080
It means that Wang Zanghai built the Cloud Sky Palace.

277
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,680
He might have been broken.

278
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,680
He was captured.

279
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,080
I will tell you later.

280
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,080
I will tell you later.

281
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,080
I will tell you later.

282
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,080
I will tell you later.

283
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,080
I will tell you later.

284
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,080
I will tell you later.

285
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,080
In the later pictures,

286
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,080
they are all the experiences he had in the hands of the people in the East.

287
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,080
Wait. Is this the imperial forest?

288
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,080
So the imperial forest here wasn't built by Wang Zanghai.

289
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,080
It was built by him.

290
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:46,080
We have studied that the entire appearance of the imperial forest was caused by injury.

291
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,080
What we see now is the name of the person who was built by Wang Zanghai.

292
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,080
It has been too long.

293
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,080
We can't use it anymore.

294
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,080
We can't solve these.

295
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,080
It looks like a myth.

296
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,080
Okay. We can see the pictures later.

297
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,080
We have told you everything.

298
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,080
Now, should you tell me what it is?

299
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,080
Our things have been removed from the plate.

300
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,080
You and Wu Sanqing's things.

301
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,080
Do you want to keep it from me?

302
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,080
What are you telling me?

303
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,080
You have already crossed all the important points.

304
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,080
Just like Bai Shuo, you treat me like a fool.

305
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,080
Wu Bu, do you want to eat?

306
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,080
Three hundred knives.

307
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,080
No.

308
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,080
I'm telling you, really.

309
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,080
You are giving me cash or transfer money?

310
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,080
I'm telling you, you are a good person.

311
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,080
You are right.

312
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,080
No.

313
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,080
There is not much time left.

314
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,080
Do you have a person who understands women's words?

315
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,080
Yes.

316
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,080
Tell her to come over and break something.

317
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,080
You want to know all the contents in these two copper jade.

318
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,080
You...

319
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,080
Lie down.

320
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,080
How can you take it out?

321
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,080
You actually have two.

322
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,080
Where did you get them?

323
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,080
I didn't take them.

324
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,080
I thought you were a good man.

325
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,080
I'm very grateful.

326
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,080
I'm sorry.

327
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,080
You are very kind.

328
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,080
I'm sorry.

329
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,080
You are a good man.

330
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,080
I'm sorry.

331
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,080
You are a good man.

332
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,080
I'm sorry.

333
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,080
You are a good man.

334
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,080
Where did you get them?

335
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,080
You are the one who cares.

336
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,080
Can you translate it?

337
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,080
I'll try.

338
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,080
I'm sorry.

339
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,080
I'm sorry.

340
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,080
That's what I was talking about.

341
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,080
That's what Wang Zang Hai just said.

342
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,080
Hope that there will be something in the future.

343
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,080
Even if someone finds out,

344
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,080
we hope it's the Han people, not the women.

345
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,080
Why did he use women's words to record it?

346
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,080
The Han people understand women's words.

347
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,080
I think it's the dual insurance.

348
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,080
You can think about it.

349
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,080
If the real women get the same kind of love,

350
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,080
they don't know the mechanism of the Chinese.

351
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,080
They may not find the secret to the above.

352
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,080
Turn it over.

353
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,080
If the Chinese get the same kind of love,

354
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,080
they don't know the truth.

355
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,080
It's useless to get the truth.

356
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,080
Understand?

357
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,080
What Uncle San said is the truth.

358
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,080
San Yan.

359
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,080
You don't have to worry about me.

360
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,080
I'll continue to think about it.

361
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,080
Hurry.

362
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,080
The next one is to record the thing

363
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,080
that Wang Zang Hai was exposed to the East.

364
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,080
It's similar to the one that was recorded on the mural.

365
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,080
That's what he said.

366
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,080
In order to repair the forest,

367
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,080
he needs a lot of things without protection.

368
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,080
So Wang Zang Hai has made a lot of mistakes.

369
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,080
He found a few places with this opportunity

370
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,080
to get rid of the spirit.

371
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,080
He secretly released the same fish.

372
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,080
He hopes that this secret

373
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,080
will be found by someone.

374
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,080
Then the old man is a double-headed man.

375
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,080
He wants to find someone,

376
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,080
but he doesn't want to find someone.

377
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,080
He's a human.

378
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,080
You don't have to worry about me.

379
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,080
Keep going.

380
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,080
Keep going.

381
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,080
Hurry.

382
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,080
Wang Zang Hai was trapped here

383
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,080
for ten years.

384
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,080
He was taken to the underground door

385
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,080
that was called the door of the god.

386
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,080
Is there a place

387
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,080
that is recorded on the underground door?

388
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,080
No.

389
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,080
Under the yellow bell,

390
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,080
the mountain of the mountain of the white mountain.

391
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,080
The original name of the mountain

392
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,080
must have been the place of the lower period.

393
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,080
And the passage to the underground door

394
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,080
is a kind of bird that looks like a human.

395
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,080
This kind of bird likes to catch the prey

396
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,080
and throw it to death.

397
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,080
Then hang it on the top,

398
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,080
and dry it.

399
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,080
What is that cat's head for?

400
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,080
By the way,

401
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,080
he also said that he has been to the underground door.

402
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,080
After he went in,

403
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,080
he found a piece of the fish.

404
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,080
He can only use this method

405
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,080
to see the situation inside.

406
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,080
Other secret tools

407
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,080
are useless at all.

408
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,080
I can't understand

409
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,080
the text behind this.

410
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,080
A piece of the fish?

411
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,080
Is this recorded by Wang Zang Hai?

412
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,080
When you were resting,

413
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,080
you were afraid of dreaming.

414
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,080
What did you say?

415
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,080
Brother,

416
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,080
will you lie?

417
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,080
No.

418
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,080
We are talking about it, right?

419
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,080
We are talking about something.

420
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,080
We are just looking for it.

421
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,080
There are some things

422
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,080
that only the underground door

423
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,080
can know.

424
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,080
We need to do

425
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,080
the things we have to do first.

426
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,080
Let's open the gate

427
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,080
of the closed gate first.

428
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,080
Let's see what's inside.

429
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,080
Third Master.

430
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,080
Third Master, what's wrong with you?

431
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,080
Third Master.

432
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,080
Third Master.

433
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,080
Third Master.

434
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,080
Water.

435
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,080
Water.

436
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,080
Come on.

437
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,080
Third Master, wake up.

438
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,080
Third Master.

439
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,080
Third Master.

440
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,080
Third Master, keep burning.

441
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,080
What should we do?

442
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,080
It's too dangerous.

443
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,080
Third Master.

444
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,080
Third Uncle.

445
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,080
Third Uncle.

446
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,080
Third Uncle.

447
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,080
Pan Zi.

448
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,080
How about this?

449
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,080
Send Third Uncle to the mountain

450
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,080
and find a hospital.

451
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,080
I

452
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,080
won't go.

453
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,080
Third Master.

454
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,080
You are burning too much.

455
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,080
You can't keep your body

456
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,080
even if you have a small waist.

457
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,080
Besides,

458
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,080
Third Master is here.

459
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,080
Why are you still worried?

460
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,080
You can't be confused.

461
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,080
I

462
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,080
can't go.

463
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,080
Third Uncle.

464
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,080
Why do you have to

465
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,080
be so stubborn?

466
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,080
Third Uncle.

467
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,080
Third Uncle.

468
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,080
Third Uncle.

469
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,080
What do you want?

470
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,080
Third Uncle.

471
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,080
What do you want?

472
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,080
Third Uncle.

473
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,080
I want to see your wound.

474
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,080
But

475
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,080
I know

476
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,080
my wound.

477
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,080
Third Uncle.

478
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,080
Why don't you let me see it?

479
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,080
Is it really that serious

480
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,080
that you are injured?

481
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,080
You are so stupid.

482
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,080
When will you

483
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,080
still think about it?

484
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,080
Third Uncle.

485
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,080
I believe you.

486
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,080
Because I believe you.

487
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,080
So why do you want me to see it?

488
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,080
Third Uncle.

489
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,080
Third Uncle.

490
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,080
Third Uncle.

491
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,080
Why?

492
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,080
You are so stupid.

493
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,080
I can't do it.

494
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,080
Go.

495
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,080
You can bring that doctor

496
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,080
to my house.

497
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,080
I will kill you.

498
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,080
Third Uncle.

499
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,080
Why do you want to see it?

500
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,080
Third Uncle.

501
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,080
Is that Si Ha Gong

502
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,080
Xie Yan?

503
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,080
Zhang Ping.

504
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,080
Who is he?

505
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,080
How do I know?

506
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,080
When will you two hide it?

507
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,080
Why do you two ask each other's name?

508
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,080
And it has been

509
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,080
so many years.

510
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,080
Let's talk about it later.

511
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,080
I don't know.

512
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,080
I don't know.

513
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,080
Let's talk about it later.

514
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,080
But will you two

515
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,080
be together in the future?

516
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,080
I just think

517
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,080
you are not the one

518
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,080
I saw before.

519
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,080
Is that important?

520
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,080
Little boy.

521
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,080
Who is important to me?

522
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,080
You have to know

523
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,080
what is most important

524
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,080
in this world.

525
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,080
Don't give Third Uncle

526
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,080
a lot of trouble.

527
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,080
Fine.

528
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,080
Third Uncle.

529
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,080
What did the doctor say?

530
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,080
Is your wound okay?

531
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,080
Can you still hold it?

532
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,080
You are still concerned about Third Uncle.

533
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,080
How kind of you.

534
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,080
Who is Third Uncle?

535
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,080
He has been poisoned for many years.

536
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,080
Have you died?

537
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,080
But this行 is

538
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,080
the greatest blessing

539
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,080
if you don't die.

540
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,080
It's the greatest blessing.

541
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,080
Don't cry.

542
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,080
Smile.

543
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,080
Smile.

544
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,080
Why are you crying?

545
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,080
I know you can't control your face.

546
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,080
Let's go.

547
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,080
Hurry up.

548
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,080
Why are you so cruel to others?

549
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,080
You are cruel to yourself.

550
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,080
Hurry up.

551
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,080
I'm leaving, Third Uncle.

552
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,080
I'm leaving.

553
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,080
Third Uncle.

554
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,080
Wait for him to take the sand.

555
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,080
Pan Zi.

556
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,080
There are some things

557
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,080
that we can't tell

558
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,080
even if we die.

559
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,080
Tianzhen.

560
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,080
The scene of Xuanwu Garden

561
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,080
is like a coffin in a white rain.

562
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,080
After that, it's like a bug in a nest.

563
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,080
It's still deep.

564
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,080
You know,

565
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,080
it's a treasure chest

566
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,080
or a trash bag.

567
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,080
The handkerchief is not transparent.

568
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,080
I'm so dirty.

569
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,080
It's still deep.

570
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,080
I'm so dirty.

571
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,080
You can't see anything.

572
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,080
Yes.

573
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,080
Be careful.

574
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,080
The worm has no effect on you.

575
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,080
But if you fall,

576
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,080
you will fall into hell.

577
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,080
Do you think it's like

578
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,080
a ghost door to hell?

579
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,080
Wu Xie.

580
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,080
Don't be so reckless.

581
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,080
What if the rumors in the coffin

582
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,080
are still going on?

583
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,080
What about us?

584
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,080
Don't worry.

585
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,080
The rumors are coming up.

586
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,080
The beast is biting me.

587
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,080
It's eating my fat.

588
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,080
It's not your turn.

589
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,080
Just take care of yourself.

590
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,080
Hey.

591
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,080
Is this a entrance?

592
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,080
If we go down,

593
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,080
it won't be long enough.

594
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,080
And if we fall,

595
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,080
we will be bitten to death.

596
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,080
It looks like a trap

597
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,080
if we don't want to enter.

598
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,080
But the problem is,

599
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,080
the entrance is only here.

600
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,080
If it's not the entrance,

601
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,080
where else can it be?

602
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,080
Yes.

603
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,080
Yes.

604
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,080
It's impossible to enter.

605
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,080
Where is the entrance?

606
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,080
Master San,

607
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,080
have some water.

608
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,080
It's a bit like a map.

609
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,080
Try it.

610
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,080
See if it's a trap.

611
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,080
Wu Xie.

612
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,080
We've checked this round.

613
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,080
Except for the rotation,

614
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,080
there's no use.

615
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,080
Then who should we check?

616
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,080
When we check it,

617
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,080
we'll know the mystery of it.

618
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,080
Do you know the mystery of it?

619
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,080
Fang Zi.

620
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,080
Fang Zi.

621
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,080
Fang Zi.

622
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,080
Fang Zi.

623
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,080
Fang Zi.

624
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,080
Fang Zi.

625
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,080
Fang Zi.

626
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,080
Fang Zi.

627
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,080
Fang Zi.

628
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,080
Fang Zi.

629
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,080
Fang Zi.

630
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,080
Fang Zi.

631
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,080
Fang Zi.

632
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,080
Fang Zi, get out of my way.

633
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,080
Fang Zi.

634
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,080
Get out of the way.

635
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:48,080
�

636
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:41,080
I told you, this is like the secret lock of that security cabinet.

637
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,080
He's on it.

638
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,080
He's on it.

639
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,080
Let's wait.

640
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,080
Stop, stop.

641
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,080
Stop, stop.

642
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,080
It seems that I can...

643
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,080
I can...

644
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,080
I can...

645
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,080
I can...

646
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,080
Here.

647
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,080
Hey.

648
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,080
Go.

649
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,080
You...

650
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,080
You...

651
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,080
You...

652
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:30,080
A warm home.

653
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:34,080
And the white tiger and the white tiger are all the same.

654
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,080
It must be a plan.

655
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,080
We can't just let the machine

656
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,080
take it out and take it with us.

657
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,080
We can take it away.

658
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,080
We'll take it back.

659
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:47,080
I found Tianzhen and I'll give them the ugly words.

660
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,080
It's not your fault.

661
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,080
But you can help us move it.

662
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,080
Fatty, can you be more serious?

663
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,080
We're looking for the way out.

664
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,080
If we can't find the way out, we're in trouble.

665
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,080
I'll take it.

666
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:00,080
I'll move it when you're done.

667
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,080
Mom, did you find anything else

668
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,080
when you were looking for the way out?

669
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,080
Nothing.

670
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,080
Except...

671
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,080
Except what?

672
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,080
Except the grass behind this green pebble,

673
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:24,080
it seems to be the same as the original one.

674
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,080
I'll take it.

675
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,080
I'll take it.

676
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,080
You're a little ghost.

677
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,080
Even the green dragon doesn't know

678
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,080
how to solve the machine.

679
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,080
You're so funny.

680
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:40,080
The green dragon is a white tiger.

681
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,080
It's a rare animal.

682
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,080
I'll take it and feed it to you.

683
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,080
Mom!

684
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,080
Mom!

685
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,080
Mom!

686
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,080
Mom!

687
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,080
Mom!

688
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,080
Mom!

689
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,080
Mom!

690
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,080
Mom!

691
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,080
Mom!

692
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,080
Mom!

693
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,080
Mom!

694
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,080
The green dragon is a wood.

695
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,080
Let's go.

696
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,080
The white tiger is a gold.

697
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,080
The white tiger is a water.

698
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,080
The pig is a fire.

699
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,080
The white tiger is a fire.

700
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,080
The white tiger is a fire.

701
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,080
The white tiger is a fire.

702
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,080
The white tiger is a fire.

703
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,080
The white tiger is a fire.

704
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,080
The white tiger is a fire.

705
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,080
The white tiger is a fire.

706
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,080
The white tiger is a fire.

707
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,080
The white tiger is a fire.

708
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,080
The white tiger is a fire.

709
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,080
The white tiger is a fire.

710
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,080
The white tiger is a fire.

711
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,080
The white tiger is a fire.

712
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,080
The white tiger is a fire.

713
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:55,080
Be careful.

714
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,080
Mom!

715
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,080
Mom!

716
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,080
Look!

717
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,080
Let's go.

718
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,080
The wind is blowing.

719
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,080
The wind is blowing.

720
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,080
The wind is blowing.

721
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,080
The wind is blowing.

722
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,080
The wind is blowing.

723
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,080
The wind is blowing.

724
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,080
The wind is blowing.

725
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,080
The wind is blowing.

726
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,080
The wind is blowing.

727
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,080
The wind is blowing.

728
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,080
The wind is blowing.

729
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,080
The wind is blowing.

730
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,080
The wind is blowing.

731
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,080
The wind is blowing.

732
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,080
The wind is blowing.

733
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,080
The wind is blowing.

734
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,080
The wind is blowing.

735
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,080
The wind is blowing.

736
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,080
The wind is blowing.

737
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,080
The wind is blowing.

738
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,080
The wind is blowing.

739
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,080
The wind is blowing.

740
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,080
The wind is blowing.

741
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,080
The wind is blowing.

742
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,080
The wind is blowing.

743
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,080
The wind is blowing.

744
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,080
The wind is blowing.

745
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,080
We're right together now.
