1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Couple of Houses

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The End

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 13

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This is a double-edged wood.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The real coffin should be here.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It should be from this door.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That number is the one who went in.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Who's more fast than us?

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This door is very secret.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If it opens from here,

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
the original plate shouldn't be placed in the original place.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But...

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
it's not here.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Then this person

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
might have known the secret door's location long ago.

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
He even opened the secret door.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Even the secret door's location is known.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Isn't it clear the entire structure of the underground palace?

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We need to hurry in.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This person must not have been in recently.

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Look at that number.

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's not recently.

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
If that person had been in long ago,

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
would that thing have already been taken away by him?

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You...

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Xiao Ge.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I can't believe you found out that

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
since Xiao Ge entered the Cloud Sky Palace,

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
she's become more powerful.

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Anyway, no matter what,

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
we'll find out when we go in.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Xiao Ge.

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
We've been walking down the road for a long time.

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's considered as the inner part of the Chang'an Mountain.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
If we keep walking like this,

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
we'll have to walk to where?

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The bottom of the heart?

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I think we've reached the level of the fire mountain.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The area is very deep.

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
We've been walking down the road for a long time.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's considered as the inner part of the Chang'an Mountain.

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If we keep walking like this,

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
we'll have to walk to where?

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The bottom of the heart?

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The area I'm going to now

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
is the level of the fire mountain.

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
There's a hot spring and a salt river there,

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
so the temperature will be higher.

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
If it wasn't for Ning,

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'd want to be tied up.

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Be careful.

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
San Yan, slow down.

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Watch your hands.

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Don't move.

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
San Yan, slow down.

82
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Go, go, go.

83
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Watch your hands.

84
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It looks like these iron chains

85
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
aren't designed by the East.

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
They must have been curious

87
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
what kind of shape the iron chains are.

88
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Will these bronze chains

89
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
be designed by the ancestors who built this place?

90
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Let's let something fall down.

91
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
For example, the one in the mural,

92
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
the one with dark and soft texture.

93
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's possible.

94
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
There's no enemy here.

95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
They're fighting without enemies.

96
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Is the enemy a shadow?

97
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Could it be the cat-head shadow

98
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
that was built by the ancestors?

99
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It flies up and is fast and fast.

100
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It can't see the stars.

101
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Isn't that a shadow?

102
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's impossible.

103
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
There are in the wood and outside.

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Look.

105
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The little pigeon has gone down.

106
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Is there someone who's drawn the mark on it?

107
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Who is he?

108
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Why did he lead us?

109
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I was still wondering where he was going.

110
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
He's been gone long ago.

111
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
We're gone, too.

112
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
We're gone, too.

113
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We're gone, too.

114
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
San'er.

115
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Ming.

116
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Thanks a lot.

117
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You did a great job.

118
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
But I will take over the rest of the operation from here.

119
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Jason.

120
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Mr. Qiu Dekou is really the last one to leave.

121
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
He's faster than us.

122
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
He's really good at it.

123
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
That's right.

124
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
If we're too late to go with you,

125
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
we'll be running out of time.

126
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Everyone here can get to the place.

127
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
They're already the chosen ones.

128
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I hope you can be patient.

129
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Don't be so anxious.

130
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Sir.

131
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
We've studied the roots down there.

132
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
We should have our people at the tail

133
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
and send some Mousenxing people to the front.

134
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Once down there,

135
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
many things will be unpredictable.

136
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
In any case, I hope my research pays off.

137
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Over there.

138
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Hello, Miss Qiu.

139
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Hello, Miss Qiu.

140
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Hello, Miss Qiu.

141
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Hello, Miss Qiu.

142
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Hello, Miss Qiu.

143
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Hello, Miss Qiu.

144
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Hello, Miss Qiu.

145
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Hello, Miss Qiu.

146
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Madam,

147
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I just found out the record of the airport.

148
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's a ticket for Miss Qiu

149
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
to buy two hours later.

150
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Stop her.

151
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Don't let her get in this time.

152
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Go in and see if she can.

153
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yes.

154
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You know everything?

155
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You're Xie.

156
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You should call me Mr. Si.

157
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Mr. Si.

158
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Mr. Si.

159
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's all a mess outside.

160
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I haven't asked you how you got here.

161
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Where's your subordinate, He?

162
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Don't worry.

163
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
He's not dead.

164
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Don't worry about it when you're in trouble.

165
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Besides,

166
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
if I really live in the dragon,

167
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
they'll notice that I'm not convenient.

168
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You've said the same thing.

169
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yes.

170
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
They're all rich.

171
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's been so many years.

172
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I think this place

173
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
and this place,

174
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
you can see it.

175
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I really have a good idea with him.

176
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
All right, let's not talk about it.

177
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You go back

178
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
so they can rest in peace.

179
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Mr. Si.

180
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,640
There's some simple

181
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,000
antibiotics here.

182
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
We'll take some medicine this time.

183
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Keep it.

184
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I don't need it.

185
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Just now,

186
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Pan Zi gave me some medicine

187
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
that made me feel better.

188
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
We must pass through this place

189
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
as quickly as possible.

190
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Kid,

191
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
remember me.

192
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Although Wu San Xing isn't a good person,

193
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
at least he's a real person.

194
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Some people

195
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
can't even be considered a person.

196
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
There are some mechanisms here.

197
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Mr. Si.

198
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Why did you and Uncle San Xing

199
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
tell each other these years?

200
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Did Uncle San Xing tell you?

201
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I wouldn't tell you.

202
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
All right, all right.

203
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Go back.

204
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Or they'll be suspicious.

205
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Remember, don't look for me on the road.

206
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
If there's anything,

207
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
just ask Uncle San Xing.

208
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You told me this plan is so unethical.

209
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Do you think your experiences

210
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
are useful to all the people?

211
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I can't live without experience.

212
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Why did you ask me?

213
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Just to use my experience.

214
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And why do you always

215
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
let my brothers go first?

216
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Not your brothers. Tell me.

217
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Why?

218
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Why not?

219
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Don't forget that you're the leader

220
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
of the company.

221
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Of course, you should go ahead.

222
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Don't be so serious.

223
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
We're still arguing here.

224
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Tell me.

225
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What's the purpose of your delaying time?

226
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
What are you suspecting?

227
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What are you suspecting?

228
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Let me tell you.

229
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Our old friends

230
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
know more about Yin Ding.

231
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
They know more than you do.

232
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And...

233
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
there's no time.

234
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You can't get anything

235
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
without time.

236
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Xia Mian, you're only there.

237
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Do you know anything?

238
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I know so much.

239
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'll tell you.

240
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
If you don't have time,

241
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
you'll have no regrets.

242
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I can't let my brothers

243
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
die for nothing.

244
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Understand?

245
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You...

246
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Sir, I think we should listen to Wu San Xing.

247
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Stay steady for the final step.

248
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Even your daughter, me.

249
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Ning, now you trust him

250
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
more than me now.

251
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I don't mean that.

252
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm just worried about your health.

253
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
We should rest for the night.

254
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm fine.

255
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I don't want to wait any longer.

256
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Let's pack in the girl.

257
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Let's pack in the girl.

258
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Your people know you.

259
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Indeed.

260
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Who raised you?

261
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Tie her up!

262
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Help me up.

263
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Wait.

264
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Okay.

265
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I can do it.

266
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
But let me make it clear.

267
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
There's no surprise.

268
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You all should escape.

269
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Don't just ask my brothers to save you.

270
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Okay.

271
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Who saw Sir?

272
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What's going on?

273
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Sir is missing.

274
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
No one found him when he disappeared?

275
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You're greedy.

276
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Think about it.

277
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
What can you tell

278
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
if you can get more money?

279
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What's the use of being a coward?

280
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Enough.

281
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
We're leaving now.

282
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Now!

283
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What should we do?

284
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
My package

285
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
is labelled the den.

286
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
An icon 한 lucky bow

287
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
with the arrows.

288
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm what you mean?

289
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
itz you lost trust

290
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
in me.

291
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Who will the other person be?

292
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Then let's see if we can make it.

293
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Slow down.

294
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Slow down.

295
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Go!

296
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Your opinion is different from Ge.

297
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Fatty,

298
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm really in a hurry to make it.

299
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I feel that all of our secrets are in the last step.

300
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
If we don't go on like this,

301
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I might regret it for the rest of my life.

302
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
That makes sense.

303
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Let's go.

304
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Let's go.

305
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Let's go.

306
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Master, go to the airport.

307
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Master,

308
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
why don't we go to the high-speed railway station?

309
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Okay.

310
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Master.

311
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Master.

312
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Master.

313
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Master.

314
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Master.

315
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Master.

316
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Master.

317
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Master.

318
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Master.

319
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Master.

320
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Wu Sai Jin, you...

321
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Uncle San.

322
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Da Tian.

323
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Master.

324
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Hurry up.

325
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Hurry up and give Master a decree.

326
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
We'll take a rest tonight.

327
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
We'll set off tomorrow.

328
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Master.

329
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Thank you.

330
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Take it off.

331
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
The patient is in a high fever.

332
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
He's breathing is difficult.

333
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Let the air flow through.

334
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's all gone.

335
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Take care.

336
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Master Wu's wound is severely infected.

337
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's because the poison in the swimming pool

338
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
can't cure the wound.

339
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
The wound is very deep.

340
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
The poison has entered the internal organs.

341
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
With our current medical conditions,

342
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm afraid we can't get the poison out of the body.

343
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm afraid it will be more intense

344
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
by night.

345
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I think...

346
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
When can I cure it?

347
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Tomorrow?

348
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Doctor,

349
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
can the hospital make it?

350
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
The movement of the poison

351
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
will make the patient worse.

352
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I want to give him a detox.

353
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Take some oxygen.

354
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
If he can survive tonight,

355
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
tomorrow,

356
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
there will be hope.

357
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Master will be able to make it.

358
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
He said it himself.

359
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
He's been so scared.

360
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
He didn't face any danger.

361
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
He'll be able to survive this time.

362
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
At last,

363
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
don't delay our progress.

364
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Otherwise,

365
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
we'll be in trouble.

366
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Don't.

367
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's okay.

368
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
What Qiu Zhe said is that

369
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
he's the boss.

370
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
He should be paid.

371
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
He's a bad guy.

372
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Which one of you

373
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
will be killed for him?

374
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Maybe one day,

375
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
he'll be in trouble.

376
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Maybe it's your turn.

377
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You're dead.

378
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You're dead.

379
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You're dead.

380
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You're dead.

381
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You're dead.

382
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You know that?

383
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Calm down.

384
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's okay.

385
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's okay.

386
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's okay.

387
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's okay.

388
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's okay.

389
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's okay.

390
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Madam,

391
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Miss Xiu Xiu didn't take the plane.

392
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
The airport we mentioned

393
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
was a fake.

394
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Maybe someone was helping her.

395
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Someone was helping her?

396
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Yes.

397
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Was it Xie Zi?

398
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
No.

399
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I think someone is trying to drag us down.

400
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You let all those people come back.

401
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
We'll go straight to the top.

402
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Yes.

403
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Yes.

404
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
You've got a lot of songs,

405
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
but you can't just write them all.

406
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's okay.

407
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I know how to do it.

408
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'll keep it a secret from you.

409
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
But can we still use it?

410
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm not sure.

411
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'll get some of the songs.

412
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
But we can use it.

413
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I don't think so.

414
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'll get some of the songs.

415
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I'll get some of the songs.

416
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You're right.

417
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'll get some of the songs.

418
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
How is it?

419
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It's 39 degrees.

420
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It's so high.

421
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It's so hot.

422
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It's not a fire.

423
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Hold it.

424
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Help us.

425
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
What's wrong?

426
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Tell me.

427
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Uncle San's body temperature is still low.

428
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
We'll go up and get him some ice.

429
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
You're crazy.

430
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
It's so hard to walk up there.

431
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And you have a strong arm.

432
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You're already in the snake.

433
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Who are you?

434
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I think we should ask

435
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
where the doctor at the hospital is.

436
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
The doctor is not a liar.

437
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I asked him about dinner.

438
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
The doctor kept pushing me.

439
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
We don't need to call him.

440
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
There are many places

441
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
where the earth is cold.

442
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
There are two.

443
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
You're a pair of twins.

444
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You came here.

445
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
You passed the fire.

446
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Didn't you have a talk?

447
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Fine.

448
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
You sleep here.

449
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
You don't want to help Uncle San.

450
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I'll go by myself.

451
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Don't.

452
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Let's go.

453
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Come.

454
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
There are some anti-inflammatory drugs

455
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
and anti-inflammatory drugs here.

456
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And the vitamin.

457
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Give it to Wu San Xing first.

458
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Thank you.

459
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I said it in the hospital.

460
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
They're already making trouble.

461
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Qiu Dekao is a living being.

462
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I have to leave.

463
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Uncle San.

464
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
What happened to you?

465
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Does it hurt again?

466
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Uncle San.

467
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Brother-in-law.

468
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Uncle San, you're awake.

469
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I'm not.

470
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Uncle San, you're awake.

471
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Uncle San, you're awake.

472
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Don't talk to me.

473
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
You're very weak now.

474
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
We'll listen to the doctor.

475
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It'll be fine as long as you're back.

476
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I've experienced so many times.

477
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
This time, I'm not different.

478
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I'm afraid I can't get over it.

479
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Uncle San.

480
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
My nephew.

481
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
After Uncle San died,

482
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
no matter if you're happy or sad,

483
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
you should give me a heart attack.

484
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Don't let anyone see it.

485
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Then, you should leave them.

486
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Go to the old town.

487
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
On the third of next month,

488
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Chen Pi-an died there waiting for me.

489
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
After you see him,

490
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I'll tell you everything.

491
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
If he's not here,

492
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I'll take care of all the family affairs.

493
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Uncle San.

494
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Uncle San, I don't understand your business.

495
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You can handle it yourself.

496
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
You're still talking to Uncle San.

497
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
You want to be a second-class man who can eat and drink.

498
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Uncle San.

499
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
You're a little boy.

500
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
You just escaped.

501
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
You're just a little boy.

502
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
How can you escape from me?

503
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
You should go back to Hangzhou.

504
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Uncle San, I was forced by my grandpa.

505
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
You let me hide here.

506
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
But don't tell him.

507
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I told him.

508
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
He came here to play.

509
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
He never took part in business.

510
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
You're lying.

511
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I didn't teach you.

512
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
How would I know you really let me see these accounts?

513
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I'm not afraid.

514
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
When I saw your accounts,

515
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I found your gray business.

516
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
You're still purple.

517
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
You're so capable.

518
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
What did you find?

519
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Your accounts are all yours.

520
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
You're still the same.

521
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Uncle San, I won't look at it anymore.

522
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I won't look at it anymore.

523
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Don't look at it anymore.

524
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Don't look at it anymore.

525
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
You don't let me look at it anymore.

526
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I won't look at it anymore, okay?

527
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Uncle San, aren't you awesome?

528
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Get up now.

529
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Don't pretend to be sick.

530
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I don't understand your business.

531
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Don't teach me.

532
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
If you want to teach me,

533
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I'll give you a break next day.

534
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
You little brat.

535
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
You dare to break things.

536
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I'll let Pan Zi beat you every day.

537
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
You beat me every day.

538
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
You beat me every day.

539
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
You beat me every day.

540
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
You beat me every day.

541
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
My nephew.

542
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Uncle San.

543
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Before Uncle San did a lot of things that made you sorry.

544
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
You had to do it.

545
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Who told you to be the only one?

546
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Some things can't tell you now.

547
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,000
That's because the sooner you know, the better you will be.

548
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Forgive Uncle San.

549
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Don't let him leave with regrets.

550
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Uncle San.

551
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Do you think I'm so soft?

552
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
If you don't get better,

553
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I won't forgive you for the rest of my life.

554
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Uncle San is dying.

555
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Can't you forgive him?

556
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Just once.

557
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Uncle San.

558
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
A name.

559
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
What's the situation with him?

560
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Still unconscious. I'm afraid.

561
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
We're kid with animals.

562
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
We set out right after meal.

563
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Uncle San.

564
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Uncle San.

565
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Uncle San.

566
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Please wake up.

567
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Uncle San.

568
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Uncle San.

569
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Uncle San.

570
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Uncle San is gone.

571
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Uncle San.

572
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Uncle San.

573
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Uncle San.

574
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Uncle San.

575
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Uncle San.

576
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Uncle San.

577
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Uncle San.

578
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Uncle San.

579
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Don't worry.

580
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I'm just afraid.

581
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
If you want to bring Uncle San back,

582
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I'll take you back, Uncle San.

583
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Uncle San.

584
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Uncle San.

585
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
You're so mean.

586
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
You're making me so angry.

587
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Uncle San.

588
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Uncle San.

589
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Uncle San.

590
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Uncle San.

591
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Uncle San.

592
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
You're fine.

593
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
After crying,

594
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I don't think this kid is a good boy.

595
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
He's still hungry.

596
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
This kid is not conscience.

597
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Uncle San.

598
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Uncle San.

599
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
You can't scare me like this.

600
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Don't cry.

601
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I'm happy.

602
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I'm happy.

603
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Uncle San.

604
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
You're happy.

605
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Don't scare me.

606
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Ani. Ani.

607
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
We are reaching our goal.

608
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Ani.

609
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Ani.

610
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
We are reaching our goal.

611
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Ani.

612
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Ani.

613
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Ani.

614
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Ani.

615
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Ani.

616
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
It's amazing.

617
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
This is definitely

618
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
not the product

619
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
that the ancient people

620
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
could make.

621
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
This is definitely not for people.

622
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
This door

623
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
can't be opened

624
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
with a lot of people.

625
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Uncle San.

626
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
This is a miracle.

627
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
This is the door

628
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
that Wang Zahai mentioned.

629
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
What do you think

630
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
there is in there?

631
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I feel like I'm too small now.

632
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
The ball didn't come down.

633
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
This old fox must have been caught up in something bad.

634
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
He won't show up in such a critical place.

635
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
He won't show up in such a critical place.

636
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
The nine dragon's crown is over.

637
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
The nine dragon's crown is over.

638
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Mr. Xiaosan, this is the nine dragon's crown.

639
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
My god, he's not running away.

640
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
This is definitely true.

641
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Look, the nine dragon's crown.

642
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
That's the nine dragon's crown.

643
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Go.

644
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Don't go. There's danger.

645
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
What's wrong?

646
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Didn't you see the rumor on the top?

647
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Isn't he a stone?

648
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
What are you afraid of?

649
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
What are you talking about?

650
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I'm not talking about the stone.

651
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
It's the rock.

652
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Are you sure?

653
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
What should I do?

654
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
The big bug has changed.

655
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Why is it so big?

656
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Isn't this normal?

657
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Ning, your boss is really famous.

658
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
It's dangerous to hide in the morning.

659
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
So he hid in the morning.

660
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Is it because we helped him

661
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
to make a bold way out?

662
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Ning, this is the toughest moment before success.

663
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
You must help me.

664
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
If you're afraid, you can leave.

665
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
No one needs you here.

666
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Look.

667
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
This thing,

668
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
it's usually only been 20 years.

669
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
It looks like a little mouse.

670
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
But these rumors are so big.

671
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
It's been a few thousand years.

672
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
No, they're afraid it won't move.

673
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Here's the news.

674
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
They're still in the East.

675
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
It won't be easy for them to wake up.

676
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
No matter if they wake up or not,

677
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
they'll be done in a few days.

678
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,080
Let's just take a look at the

679
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,000
people in the East.

680
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
No.

681
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
You said it before.

682
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
After this,

683
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
his behavior will attract other comrades.

684
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
There are so many rumors on the way.

685
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
What if they all come?

686
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
What about the sea?

687
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
It's okay if they're afraid.

688
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
By the way,

689
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
please stay away from Qiu De.

690
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
He'll take you as a shield.

691
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Pan Zi,

692
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
protect Xiao Sanye when you get in trouble.

693
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Well, An Ning,

694
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I don't have a gun.

695
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I'll use your gun.

696
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
You're not a good guy.

697
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Come on.

698
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Tang Dao,

699
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
look at that pen.

700
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
What's written on it?

701
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I'll just take a look.

702
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
The text on it

703
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
looks like a woman's text,

704
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
but it's not a woman's text.

705
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
If there's enough information and time,

706
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
maybe we can still study it.

707
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I'm afraid we'll be in a situation like this.

708
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Can you both understand it?

709
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Are you okay, Sanye?

710
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I'm fine.

711
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I'm fine.

712
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I'm here, Mr. Long Tai.

713
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
What's wrong?

714
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I...

715
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Where's Pan Zi?

716
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Where's Pan Zi?

717
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Xiao Sanye, look!

718
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I'm here.

719
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Pan Zi!

720
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
What are you doing, Wang Pan Zi?

721
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Get down!

722
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Xiao Sanye, don't be anxious.

723
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Is he giving you a speech?

724
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I saw that Yan's tail

725
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
was on the heart.

726
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
He shouldn't be in danger.

727
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Are you sure?

728
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
No.

729
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
But...

730
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
You think

731
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
he's a good guy

732
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
when he's the first one to open the gate?

733
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Pan Zi, you're so mean!

734
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Go on!

735
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Take the ceremony with you.

736
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Okay.

737
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,780
A trap sangly to his subordinates.

738
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,160
Him a familiar suit made foranny,

739
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:02,800
whose ensurekey things like bloodshot feasts

740
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,800
Come on.

741
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,300
Are you okay, Xiao Zeyi?

742
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,300
I'm fine.

743
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,600
You like playing golf?

744
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,480
It's dressing.

745
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,740
Har...

746
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,000
...you!

747
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,800
The wind blows through the darkness without a trace

748
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,800
The smell of darkness is getting stronger

749
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,800
The wind blows through the darkness without a trace

750
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,800
The flowers bloom in the spring sun

751
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,800
