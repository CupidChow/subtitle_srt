1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The End

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
How far are we now?

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm so tired.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm almost out of breath.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We're almost there.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm so scared.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The black hole is right ahead.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The danger that Elder Brother Hua told me

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I've told you all.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We must be more careful when we get in.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Especially you.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Don't touch anything that shouldn't be touched.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Tianzhen, you're so hurtful.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I...

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You're the kind of person.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No, Elder Brother Hua, you tell me.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Am I the kind of person?

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Elder Brother Hua.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Look, Elder Brother Hua is angry.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's all because of you.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Don't talk nonsense.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I...

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Elder Brother Hua.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This is the first time I've been to such a strange place.

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Why are you so nervous?

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Will there be a fairy-tale again?

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
We have to go out then, right?

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm not afraid of you.

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm afraid that you'll be trapped in here.

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I won't kill you.

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I have a feeling that I'm not normal here.

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The more I get closer to you, the more powerful I am.

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I must find her quickly.

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Otherwise, I'll be in danger.

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's okay.

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Just protect me.

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It should be a place with a letter.

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The closer we get to this place, the more powerful we will be.

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
We'll try not to get into the cave here.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's okay.

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'll lead the way.

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm here, Fairy Qi.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm here.

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm here.

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm here.

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm here.

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Thank you.

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Thank you.

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I think I'm dizzy.

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Everyone, be careful.

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Don't look up at the four walls.

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
We can't get along with the four walls here for long.

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
We must climb up to the top like the old man.

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Did I make a mistake?

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Xiao Ge is using her phone.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Xiao Ge, are you threatening me?

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm not threatening you.

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Xiao Ge,

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
then you can leave me a phone number.

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I have yours.

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Everyone, be careful.

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Think about our goal.

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yes.

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Fairy Qi, let's go.

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Fairy Qi,

99
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Let's go.

100
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's too hard to get through.

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
We've been climbing for a long time.

102
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
We've made a few turns.

103
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I can't feel where the cave is.

104
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm not sure.

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's crazy.

106
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's not right.

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Is it a illusion?

108
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I have to kneel.

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's a waste.

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's just because

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
the four walls here have reached the top.

112
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Time and gravity

113
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
have reached the top.

114
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
How about we go back first?

115
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We can't find a way to get to the top.

116
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
We can find a way to get to the top.

117
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We can find a way to get to the top.

118
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Tian Zhen,

119
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
can this cave change?

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's getting bigger and smaller.

121
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
How many caves have we made?

122
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I think 18.

123
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
We don't have the ability to feel it.

124
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I don't know.

125
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The scariest thing is,

126
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
we've been climbing for a long time.

127
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Do you feel hungry?

128
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Cheng,

129
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
why don't you

130
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
go back?

131
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I can't stand it.

132
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
My head is too heavy.

133
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Let's go.

134
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Come on.

135
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's really been two years.

136
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I feel like we've been here for a long time.

137
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's really been two years.

138
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
We've been here for a long time.

139
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
We've been here for a long time.

140
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
We've been here for a long time.

141
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
No,

142
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I really don't believe it.

143
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Nice,

144
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
nice,

145
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
nice,

146
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Fatty,

147
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Fatty, don't try it.

148
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I want to puke.

149
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I want to puke.

150
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I want to puke.

151
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I want to puke.

152
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Let's listen to the next one.

153
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Don't be so careless.

154
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You're wasting your energy.

155
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Xiao Ge,

156
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
do you have any other way?

157
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
For example,

158
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
to blow this hole.

159
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I've tried the Black Mirror before.

160
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The Black Mirror is very hard.

161
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Then,

162
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
do we have to

163
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
keep climbing like this?

164
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I feel like

165
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
we've been here

166
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
for a month.

167
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
How can we lose our senses

168
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
in such a long time?

169
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You two are playing on the ground.

170
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I've been climbing.

171
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Wu Xin,

172
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
follow me.

173
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm coming in.

174
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I see.

175
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So, you can come out like this.

176
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So powerful.

177
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So powerful.

178
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Look.

179
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What is this?

180
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Go back.

181
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Don't follow...

182
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Qin Li Shen Shu?

183
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
This is the sacred account

184
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
of Elder Brother Kua's poem.

185
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I don't know why.

186
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The closer I get to him,

187
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
the more I feel that he's getting better.

188
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Qin Li Shen Shu's Qing Dong

189
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
has a lot of放tionous material.

190
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So, this is why

191
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
he has the ability to make people lost.

192
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Lost you?

193
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Qing Dong is the same.

194
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So,

195
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Elder Brother Kua used his poem

196
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
to help people to return to the past.

197
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
He saw the miracle in the end.

198
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And we just touched you.

199
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
All the illusions

200
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
and the lost feeling

201
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
are his own.

202
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And this coin

203
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
is made of high-heeled black gold.

204
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's a jewel of light.

205
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's a great influence on us.

206
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What are you looking at?

207
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Fatty.

208
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
This...

209
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I told you not to follow...

210
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
What is this?

211
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's a magic.

212
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I feel like I'm in the first place.

213
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Fatty,

214
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
you've been attacked.

215
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Don't let anything happen to you.

216
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
This is the trap I've been trying to hide.

217
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Hurry up.

218
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I have to cross the middle of the road.

219
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Hurry up.

220
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Brother.

221
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
He's not in front of us.

222
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Where did he go?

223
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Brother.

224
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Brother.

225
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Why did he leave

226
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
without the mysterious mysterious person in the house?

227
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Who is he?

228
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Maybe he has his own secret.

229
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Who is he?

230
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You two are in the same boat.

231
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Yes, he doesn't have a phone.

232
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You call him.

233
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What a trick.

234
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I know.

235
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm just going to leave it to the country.

236
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What's the trick?

237
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
The text on it.

238
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It means...

239
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Snow Mountain.

240
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Snow Mountain.

241
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Where is the Saintess?

242
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Where is the Saintess?

243
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Kunlun Snow Mountain.

244
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Kunlun Snow Mountain.

245
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Kunlun Snow Mountain.

246
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Snow Mountain is good.

247
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Then what does it have to do

248
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
with that snow mountain in the Cloud Sky Palace?

249
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It doesn't matter.

250
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Anyway, this is a place of culture.

251
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Right?

252
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That's a myth.

253
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
That's the origin of Chinese mythology.

254
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yes, you know.

255
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You know.

256
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Okay?

257
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Fatty.

258
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Look.

259
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Is this light in the magic power

260
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
a piece of cake?

261
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I know.

262
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
This is the 50th year of the US

263
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
of the MK80 series.

264
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's a piece of cake.

265
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It's a piece of cake.

266
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's a piece of cake.

267
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It's a piece of cake.

268
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's a piece of cake.

269
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You mean this is the cake of the US?

270
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The building is crazy.

271
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
This is the common cake of the MK80 series.

272
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Although they are from different countries,

273
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
this is a military product.

274
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It wasn't a land war at all.

275
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
What do you mean?

276
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It was a human-made land war.

277
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
They had been ordered here.

278
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
The Qiu Dacau had been ordered here.

279
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
The Qiu Dacau?

280
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's all English.

281
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
We have to tell the villagers.

282
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You...

283
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Oh, my God.

284
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Did you get me?

285
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You started shooting again?

286
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
No.

287
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
What...

288
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
What should we do?

289
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Let's go.

290
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Let's go.

291
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Over there.

292
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Wait.

293
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It's too late.

294
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Let's go.

295
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Hurry.

296
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Hurry.

297
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Get out.

298
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Stop.

299
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Stop.

300
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Don't run.

301
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Don't, don't, don't.

302
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's all a misunderstanding.

303
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
No, no, no.

304
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What's going on?

305
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I didn't get Kun Na.

306
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Don't worry.

307
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
What's going on?

308
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Tell me.

309
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Don't let anything happen to Liu Xue.

310
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Your girlfriend?

311
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Ning.

312
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
What's going on?

313
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Give us one.

314
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
What do you want?

315
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
We want to give you one, too.

316
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
What do you want?

317
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Give us one.

318
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Give us one.

319
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
What do you want?

320
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Give us one.

321
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
What do you want?

322
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
What do you want?

323
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
We want to give us one, too.

324
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
This one.

325
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Run.

326
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You're dead.

327
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
This one.

328
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
What's your expression?

329
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I just didn't expect you to give it back to me.

330
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Thank you.

331
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
What did you say?

332
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Nothing.

333
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You gave me everything.

334
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Or I'll treat you to a meal.

335
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I saved your life.

336
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I should have given you a meal.

337
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You're not leaving.

338
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I won't cook if you stay.

339
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I can only treat you to instant noodles.

340
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Okay.

341
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Okay.

342
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Sir.

343
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Ning.

344
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Looks like your trick didn't work on Wu Xie.

345
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Now let me do the honor.

346
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Hello, Wu Xie.

347
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm happy to see you are back safely.

348
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Why are you looking for me?

349
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
What's the matter?

350
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I like your double-edged sword.

351
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'll go to the mountain.

352
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You know I want to work with you.

353
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Your uncle can't get close to you.

354
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
You're different.

355
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You're more responsible than him.

356
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And you have the bottom line.

357
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I believe we can be very close friends.

358
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You're talking about the bottom line with me.

359
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You're joking.

360
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Wu Xie, I really want to be honest with you.

361
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Wu Sanxing doesn't know my heart anymore.

362
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I've been working with him for years.

363
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
He's been very hard on me.

364
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
He's not only working with me, but also with others.

365
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
He can sell friends and betray his family.

366
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Stop.

367
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Don't say that.

368
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You just want me to deal with Wu Sanxing.

369
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
But I'm not interested in what you're doing now.

370
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm not interested in him either.

371
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Whatever you want, whatever you want.

372
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Your attitude surprised me.

373
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
We've been fighting for so many years.

374
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
You've helped me a lot.

375
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm grateful to you.

376
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
That's why I let Ning save you.

377
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
This time, we're different.

378
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You've been in trouble for 30 years.

379
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
He needs you more than anything.

380
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
He doesn't want you to get involved in what we're doing.

381
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
But this time, it's different.

382
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You...

383
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
He'll invite you to the Cloud Sky Palace.

384
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
But he can hurt you once.

385
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Nanbao won't hurt you again.

386
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
He'll never leave you with us.

387
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Don't hesitate.

388
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Think about it.

389
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'll wait for your answer.

390
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Well...

391
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You can go now.

392
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
No, I...

393
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You think it's suitable for me to answer?

394
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I'm leaving.

395
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I'm not eating anymore.

396
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I heard it.

397
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Don't you really trust them?

398
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm stupid.

399
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Or your girlfriend will be angry.

400
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Hello?

401
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
What are you doing, kid?

402
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Come over here.

403
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I have something for you.

404
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Who is it?

405
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Where are you?

406
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Where else can I be?

407
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Wake up.

408
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Come over here.

409
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
What did he say?

410
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Hey, hey, hey.

411
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
What's up?

412
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Wake up.

413
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Now?

414
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I'm not going to wake up.

415
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I'm not going to wake up.

416
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I'm not going to wake up.

417
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I'm not going to wake up.

418
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Sit down here.

419
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Your grace.

420
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Hurry up.

421
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
salute

422
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
defeated

423
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
you

424
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,400
Suven

425
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,400
I go

426
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,280
Lao Zhe

427
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:19,720
ous...

428
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:21,760
People

429
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:22,680
Oh wait

430
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,440
some of this

431
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,760
Uncle San.

432
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,200
I know.

433
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,400
You hate Uncle San.

434
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,960
Tell me.

435
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,440
What's the matter?

436
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,640
I don't have that much money.

437
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,880
My nephew.

438
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,120
Back then, in Guizhou...

439
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,200
Don't mention Guizhou to me.

440
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,800
If I were you,

441
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,480
I wouldn't mention those words in my whole life.

442
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,440
You don't care about me anymore, do you?

443
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,560
What's the matter?

444
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,040
What else can I do?

445
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,840
How can you talk to Uncle San?

446
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,720
You're a man of no mercy.

447
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,200
You're a adult.

448
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,920
Don't kill your child.

449
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,440
You can't talk to him.

450
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,840
What else can you do?

451
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,800
He said I didn't do any means.

452
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,600
Overall,

453
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,680
I don't care about Guizhou to you anymore.

454
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,720
I will never do anything.

455
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,800
sujet n I

456
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,020
a

457
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,400
Why you keep trying at me and said others?

458
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,480
because

459
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,480
Come on, don't be so polite.

460
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,480
My nephew,

461
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,480
the matter of the General's case is...

462
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,480
I said don't mention that matter!

463
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,480
It's too much of a clean-up.

464
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,480
Wu Xie!

465
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,480
Uncle San,

466
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,480
actually, you asked me to come this time.

467
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,480
I'm very happy.

468
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,480
I was thinking,

469
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,480
no matter how you talk to me,

470
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,480
even if you're the one who made it out,

471
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,480
you should tell me the truth.

472
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,480
Actually, I thought

473
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,480
I was the one you brought up.

474
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,480
I know you the best.

475
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,480
Yes, although you usually lie to me about those trivial things,

476
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,480
I believe you.

477
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,480
You should go and believe those non-sense foreigners.

478
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,480
At least you won't harm me.

479
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,480
But I was wrong.

480
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,480
My nephew,

481
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,480
I'm sorry for what happened in the study.

482
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,480
I'll just say it out loud.

483
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,480
Uncle San,

484
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,480
you know me the best.

485
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,480
You know I hate those fake Yanping cards.

486
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,480
You even brought me such a Yanping card.

487
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,480
What do you want?

488
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,480
I'm just kidding.

489
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,480
I want to see your true nature.

490
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,480
Or else, I'll give you the treasure.

491
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,480
I'll leave it to you.

492
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,480
Look.

493
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,480
This is real.

494
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,480
Look.

495
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,480
Where did you get it?

496
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,480
I used a few pieces of wood

497
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,480
to replace it with a pure stone.

498
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,480
Did you suddenly become a gold digger

499
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,480
or a fool?

500
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,480
What are you talking about?

501
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,480
Pure stone is a kind of goods.

502
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,480
You never buy or sell it.

503
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,480
That's your business.

504
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,480
And I don't know what you're doing.

505
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,480
Don't be too stubborn.

506
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,480
You're not good.

507
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,480
Uncle San,

508
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,480
there's been a lot of things

509
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,480
that happened to me recently.

510
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,480
I spent a long time looking for you.

511
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,480
I wanted to know where you were

512
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,480
and what you were doing.

513
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,480
But I couldn't find the answer.

514
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,480
You're always my uncle.

515
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,480
Am I still your nephew?

516
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,480
Of course you are my nephew.

517
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,480
You're my nephew.

518
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,480
Why don't you give me the treasure?

519
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,480
I'm worried about you.

520
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,480
You asked me to come here

521
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,480
to give me the war-torn tree.

522
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,480
To give you the war-torn tree?

523
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,480
Aren't you afraid

524
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,480
I'll find out what wood I need to use to make wood?

525
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,480
It's over.

526
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,480
I've told you.

527
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,480
You're my nephew.

528
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,480
You're my nephew.

529
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,480
It's not over yet.

530
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,480
Besides,

531
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,480
the water is so deep on this road.

532
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,480
It's so dangerous.

533
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,480
I'm afraid you'll fall down

534
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,480
because I'm going to lose you.

535
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,480
It's better now.

536
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,480
You're grown up.

537
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,480
You won't listen to me.

538
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,480
Fine.

539
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,480
I'll be free.

540
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,480
Fine.

541
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,480
What do you want?

542
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,480
Help me.

543
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,480
You want me to help you?

544
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,480
The minister is still in charge of the army.

545
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
Kid,

546
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,480
tell me.

547
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,480
You want to find something

548
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,480
to go to the Cloud Sky Palace with me.

549
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,480
You're in the woods.

550
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,480
I don't want to help you.

551
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,480
Fine.

552
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,480
Uncle San,

553
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,480
if you want me to go,

554
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,480
I'll go.

555
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,480
Fatty.

556
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,480
I thought we must be enemies.

557
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,480
So don't worry.

558
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,480
Was it you?

559
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,480
No.

560
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,480
I don't know any female target.

561
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,480
Sometimes I just recognize

562
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,480
that your husband is a female target.

563
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,480
I guess,

564
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,480
I can take him to the fantasticalぇ life.

565
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,480
Yan Dong,

566
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,480
there's no time to shift here.

567
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,480
I come to question you.

568
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,480
Sing a song when you need help.

569
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,480
I knew you could be my wife.

570
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,480
But I am not your friend

571
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,480
so I have to apologize.

572
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,480
I'm sorry for your impulsiveness.

573
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,480
Brother,

574
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,480
I've called for help.

575
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,480
With it,

576
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,080
You came with Uncle into the Cloudcommittee.

577
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,520
And you are in my MERCY.

578
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,480
Uncle San.

579
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,480
It's all right.

580
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,480
Have a taste.

581
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,480
This wine is cotton.

582
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,480
It's rich in flavor.

583
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,480
It's just like watching a person.

584
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,480
It's a good drink.

585
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,480
Have a taste.

586
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,480
Uncle San.

587
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,480
You called me here today.

588
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,480
Is it just for the sake of the wine?

589
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,480
Yu Chen.

590
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,480
I asked you to ask me for a favor.

591
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,480
Can you lend me your name and name?

592
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,480
I know.

593
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,480
This has a great relationship with Yun Ding.

594
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,480
You're old.

595
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,480
I'll take care of the name.

596
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,480
I'll do something bigger.

597
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,480
How about it?

598
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,480
Uncle San.

599
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,480
I should call you that.

600
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,480
Yes.

601
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,480
I called you Uncle San this time

602
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,480
because I didn't have any agreement.

603
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,480
I hope we don't break up.

604
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,480
This matter

605
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,480
won't be mentioned again.

606
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,480
I know who you're working with.

607
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,480
I also know you just said a few words.

608
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,480
A few words are fake.

609
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,480
It's weird.

610
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,480
You're the older brother of my brother.

611
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,480
You and my uncle's personality difference

612
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,480
is so big.

613
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,480
You're a little bit different

614
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,480
from the way you speak.

615
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,480
You're so good at speaking.

616
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,480
If your father knew you were so good at it,

617
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,480
he wouldn't have been so good at it.

618
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,480
You still don't trust me.

619
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,480
How could I trust you?

620
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,480
Xiao Zui.

621
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,480
You're so bad at speaking.

622
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,480
I feel so bad.

623
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,480
Master, the old man is broken.

624
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,480
The snake has been missing.

625
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,480
We have a plan for Wu Sanxing.

626
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,480
Master, the surveillance has been dropped.

627
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,480
It's in your computer.

628
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,480
The second surveillance camera was taken by the study.

629
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,480
It's the one that killed me.

630
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,480
I'm sorry.

631
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,480
What's wrong?

632
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,480
Wu Xie, are you okay?

633
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,480
I met my uncle.

634
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,480
He asked me to go to the Sky Palace with him.

635
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,480
You promised.

636
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,480
No matter what, he's my uncle.

637
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,480
Wu Xie, if you need me,

638
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,480
I can go with you.

639
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,480
It has nothing to do with you.

640
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,480
Okay.

641
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,480
Since you've decided, I'll support you.

642
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,480
But you're in danger.

643
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,480
I don't want you to be involved.

644
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,480
I'll let Jia Sha give you a tracking device.

645
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,480
You can stay with him.

646
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,480
If there's any danger, I'll find you.

647
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,480
Thank you.

648
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,480
No.

649
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,480
No.

650
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,480
Wu Xie, let's talk.

651
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,480
Nothing to talk about.

652
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,480
I have something to do.

653
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,480
It's important for you.

654
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,480
What's wrong?

655
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,480
What's the matter?

656
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,480
Tell me.

657
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,480
Wu Xie, don't get me wrong.

658
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,480
This is because I don't believe in Jie Sen.

659
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,480
I don't want to see the thing happening here.

660
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,480
We can communicate through this.

661
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,480
For example, I can tell you the people who are in Jie Sen's way.

662
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,480
Here.

663
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,480
Here you can shoot a video and then tell them.

664
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,480
You can take the video of Yun Ding's inner palace.

665
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,480
If you don't want to take it, I can't.

666
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,480
But in fact, we can't cause any harm to you.

667
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,480
Because you have been defending us.

668
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,480
But those people whom you always believe in

669
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,480
may not be so reliable.

670
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,480
How can you defend their harm to you?

671
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,480
It's not bad to leave a mark on yourself.

672
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,480
Oh.

673
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,480
So you're so good at talking.

674
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,480
If you think I'm right,

675
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,480
it's because you've already thought it through.

676
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,480
You just don't want to admit it.

677
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,480
Do you agree with my opinion?

678
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,480
I'll consider it.

679
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,480
Wu Xie, no matter if you believe it or not,

680
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,480
I'm not here to ask Mr. Ke to let me come.

681
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,480
I only represent my own opinion.

682
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,480
I hope you can understand.

683
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,480
I understand.

684
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,480
I'm not here to ask Mr. Ke to let me come.

685
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,480
I'm here to ask Mr. Ke to let me come.

686
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,480
I understand.

687
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,480
I'm leaving.

688
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,480
I'm leaving.

689
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,480
Here, have something to eat.

690
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,480
Have some water.

691
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,480
Look at me.

692
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,480
What are you doing?

693
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,480
Thank you.

694
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,480
Thank me for what?

695
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,480
I said I'd come to Yunting Sky Palace.

696
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,480
But you didn't say you'd come.

697
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,480
Isn't this normal?

698
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,480
If I come, what if something good happens?

699
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,480
Let's be serious.

700
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,480
Why are you so sure that Yunting Sky Palace is on Changbai Mountain?

701
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,480
What did your uncle tell you?

702
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,480
I don't know what his purpose is.

703
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,480
But I found this in Beijing.

704
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,480
My grandpa's handwriting is always like this.

705
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,480
Because there's no explanation, I don't know what he drew.

706
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,480
Later, I found out...

707
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,480
Isn't this Long Mai?

708
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,480
I'm sorry.

709
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,480
I'm sorry.

710
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,480
I'm sorry.

711
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,480
I'm sorry.

712
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,480
I'm sorry.

713
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,480
I'm sorry.

714
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,480
I'm sorry.

715
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,480
I'm sorry.

716
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,480
I'm sorry.

717
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,480
I'm sorry.

718
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,480
I'm sorry.

719
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,480
I'm sorry.

720
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,480
I'm sorry.

721
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,480
I'm sorry.

722
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,480
I'm sorry.

723
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,480
I'm sorry.

724
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,480
I'm sorry.

725
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,480
I'm sorry.

726
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,480
I'm sorry.

727
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,480
I'm sorry.

728
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,480
I'm sorry.

729
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,480
I'm sorry.

730
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,480
I'm sorry.

731
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,480
I'm sorry.

732
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,480
I'm sorry.

733
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,480
I'm sorry.

734
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,480
I'm sorry.

735
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,480
I'm sorry.

736
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,480
I'm sorry.

737
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,480
I'm sorry.

738
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,480
I'm sorry.

739
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,480
I'm sorry.

740
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,480
I'm sorry.

741
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,480
I'm sorry.

742
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,480
I'm sorry.

743
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,480
I'm sorry.

744
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,480
I'm sorry.

745
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,480
I'm sorry.

746
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,480
I'm sorry.

747
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,480
I'm sorry.

748
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,480
I'm sorry.

749
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,480
I'm sorry.

750
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,480
I'm sorry.

751
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,480
I'm sorry.

752
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,480
I'm sorry.

753
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,480
