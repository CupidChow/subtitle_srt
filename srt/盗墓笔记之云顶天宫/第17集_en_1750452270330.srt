00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,940
Myuage

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Second HEAD

3
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
they're nice

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,020
We will help your aunt or Andhreya to find a good cook.

5
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,120
Quickly depart now.

6
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,300
Thank you.

7
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,280
Doctor,

8
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,280
you should seekchist,

9
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,680
It's delicious.

10
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,680
It must be.

11
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,480
It smells so good.

12
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,680
I'm telling you, it's not good.

13
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,880
But I don't want to do this.

14
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,080
It's so good.

15
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,480
Xia Ge.

16
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,080
Are you okay?

17
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,880
Don't breathe.

18
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,680
What?

19
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,720
Can't see you.

20
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,280
Can't handle these.

21
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,660
Here's your

22
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,480
Fake hand.

23
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,640
So sweet.

24
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,280
What's wrong with it?

25
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,160
It's so real.

26
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,280
It killed the two of them.

27
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,440
They're so actual.

28
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,140
Never mind

29
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,100
At this moment

30
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,260
Princess

31
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,600
How is everything going?

32
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,740
officer

33
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,400
Wait, I don't want to just sit here and eat juice in this stage.

34
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,460
This first year class...

35
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,720
It's not a game why don't you just show your face in here?!

36
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,960
You..

37
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,480
uh...

38
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,240
Hello.

39
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,540
I think we can...

40
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,540
We have been here for a whole night.

41
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,540
This is the place where people get drunk at night.

42
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,540
They go to sleep in the night.

43
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,540
They go to sleep at night and then go back to sleep.

44
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,540
They go back to sleep and then go back to sleep.

45
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,540
They have been here for a long time.

46
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,540
They don't know what's going on.

47
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,540
Let's leave here.

48
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,540
There's no way to get here.

49
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,540
It's too dangerous.

50
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,540
Let's go.

51
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,540
Hurry up.

52
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,540
Hurry up.

53
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,540
Hurry up.

54
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,540
Hurry up.

55
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,540
Hurry up.

56
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,540
It's too dangerous.

57
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,540
DALLOK

58
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,300
Then I can find the place to wait for a while.

59
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,120
If there is a Doctor it is gone

60
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,080
but he can't find it.

61
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,720
Be patient, here.

62
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,520
Master. Look.

63
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,540
This is the first gate of the forest.

64
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,540
It's called the Heaven Gate.

65
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,540
Remember this.

66
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,540
When you come out, you must come here.

67
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,540
You must knock on the door.

68
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,540
What is this?

69
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,540
After the training is completed,

70
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,540
the officials and the soldiers will be killed.

71
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,540
So this gate is considered a British gate.

72
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,540
According to the old rules,

73
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,540
the scholars enter the Heaven Gate once,

74
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,540
and when you come out, you must go there.

75
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,540
Otherwise, it will be troublesome.

76
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,540
Feng Jianmin, you must be careful.

77
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,540
Are you a stranger?

78
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,540
Why don't you understand anything?

79
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,540
I'm just talking to you.

80
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,540
What's wrong?

81
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,540
What's wrong?

82
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,540
I saw a person standing there.

83
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,540
Didn't you go out to change?

84
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,540
Look again. Is it a stone?

85
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,540
Isn't it scary?

86
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,540
I just saw it.

87
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,540
I didn't see it. It seems to be a human face.

88
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,540
There is something behind me.

89
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,540
Don't scare me. Is it Ning?

90
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,540
What?

91
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,540
Master, why don't we go back and see?

92
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,540
Maybe they are really their people.

93
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,540
Okay, you go first.

94
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,540
You.

95
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,540
You, go back with me.

96
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,540
Master, be careful.

97
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,540
Go back. Be careful.

98
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,540
Don't worry.

99
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,540
Where is he?

100
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,540
Brother.

101
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,540
Go away.

102
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,540
It's too disgusting.

103
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,540
Go, go, go.

104
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:34,540
Laplace

105
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,420
The秀 King is pretty disgusting.

106
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,420
But the pest is really cute.

107
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:50,420
Liuxiang is, one of the cheapest mosquitos in Beijing.

108
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,420
... subscribed and partialed I tell you.

109
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,740
It's a legendary delicacy.

110
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,980
I should love it.

111
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,980
tactics

112
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,380
Well done!

113
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,420
Even if you were hungry,

114
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,760
I was several days away from home to cut my clothes and wear the soup.

115
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,580
I fed each step...

116
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,500
... I talked to one of the couples.

117
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,740
I needed to get back to the village.

118
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
I spoken to them to find their excuse.

119
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:14,860
...

120
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,340
It made me laugh so much.

121
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:37,480
wię all the

122
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,440
No wonder they fell in love with their Creator.

123
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,500
When the Dragon Slayer left his house in July,

124
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,940
he became totally different from the real Afteramo-sage Tentworld.

125
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,120
Taking on the artistic strategychuckles everyone'shand.

126
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,360
They made a choice even for the stakes to becasting.

127
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:07,640
The creator had been plundered by the landscape.

128
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,640
I had no interest in making a movie.

129
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,020
I should've blend the artistic performance in the country instead.

130
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:42,300
Do you know we've been on your terms,

131
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,300
Kukuk! Kukuk!

132
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,300
Kukuk!

133
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,300
Kukuk!

134
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,300
Kukuk!

135
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,300
Kukuk!

136
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,300
Your son?

137
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,300
and

138
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,580
am

139
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,080
I'm

140
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,000
前

141
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,600
this shoot

142
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:40,640
I can not

143
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:42,940
We'll make a good match today...

144
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,320
...for the discussions ahead are within limit.

145
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,280
parody

146
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,260
How could you put over,

147
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:10,700
The look of the real world

148
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,300
There you are

149
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,180
Look at you

150
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,200
The ev��� attacked the enemy

151
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,640
From the rest strategies, then they will kill everybody

152
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,520
Hey, come out!

153
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,720
Guys, what are you doing?

154
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,280
Shall we wait outside?

155
00:12:45,280 --> 00:13:00,440
And we'll send you back to the northeast

156
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,620
Speak.

157
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,720
What monster?

158
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,920
Getting up.

159
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,300
There's no one eats them.

160
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,360
They might be eating them.

161
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,020
Come on.

162
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,180
Let him go.

163
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,020
Stay here.

164
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,300
Don't let him know.

165
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,720
You sold Ming Vegas!

166
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,400
Here is yours, dad.

167
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,060
Brother, you!

168
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,000
What are you doing here?

169
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,920
Enough talking to me.

170
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,720
Don't bother around with it.

171
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,720
Why is he going this way?

172
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,720
Let's go.

173
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,720
I don't see anything.

174
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,720
It looks like something is going down.

175
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,720
And they shot him.

176
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,720
No, it's the opposite.

177
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
Look at the angle of the bullet.

178
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,720
The gun is going up.

179
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,720
Someone is going down.

180
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,720
What?

181
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,720
What's wrong?

182
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,720
Isn't this the one with the body?

183
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,720
Let me go up and see.

184
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,720
Pan Zi, this is so weird.

185
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,720
There must be something wrong.

186
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,720
There are so many people.

187
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,720
These bullets are very destructive.

188
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,720
Even if they hit the bullet, it's still a battle.

189
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,720
What's going on here?

190
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
No, no, no.

191
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,720
You...

192
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,720
Don't you think the strangest thing is...

193
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,720
How did you get up there?

194
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,720
This place is so scary. Let's go.

195
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,720
Let's go.

196
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
Oh my god.

197
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,720
Oh my god.

198
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,720
Sometimes I don't even know what's in your mind.

199
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,720
Pan Zi, what are you doing? Get down.

200
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,720
The public bath is a good thing.

201
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,720
You must be careful.

202
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,720
These guns are not good.

203
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,720
You're stupid.

204
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,720
Get up.

205
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,720
Be careful.

206
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,720
If there is something dangerous...

207
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,720
It's okay.

208
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,720
If something goes wrong, I'll get down.

209
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,720
Get down quickly.

210
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
This is killing people.

211
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,720
Get out.

212
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,720
Pan Zi, be careful.

213
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,720
Don't you think the whole river is in the water?

214
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,720
This is a good thing.

215
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
Come on, get in.

216
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
You're almost there.

217
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
Pan Zi, be careful.

218
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,720
Don't take it.

219
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,720
You might get poisoned.

220
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,720
You should be careful.

221
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,720
You...

222
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,720
Pan Zi, Pan Zi, Pan Zi.

223
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,720
What are you doing?

224
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,720
What are you doing?

225
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,720
What are you doing?

226
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,720
You're still alive.

227
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Get out.

228
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,720
Please come in.

229
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,720
Madam, she's here.

230
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,720
Madam.

231
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,720
You're here to protect me.

232
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,720
You're so stupid.

233
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,720
It seems like you're a fool to be here.

234
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,720
This is the fourth time Mr. Qiu Dekou is hospitalized.

235
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,720
I hope you can understand.

236
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,720
He said you must know his situation.

237
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,720
If it weren't for the sudden attack, he would have come here personally.

238
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,720
What kind of attack?

239
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,720
You don't know yet.

240
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,720
There was a case of you and Mr. Qiu Dekou working together.

241
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,720
How is that possible?

242
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,720
What's going on?

243
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,720
The document of the Omen was found by Xie Yu Hua.

244
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,720
It hasn't been published yet.

245
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,720
What?

246
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,720
Mr. Qiu Dekou said he had some problems with your office.

247
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,720
There are many problems with the goods.

248
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,720
Please solve them quickly.

249
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,720
It seems that Xie Zi's wings are hard.

250
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:42,720
I've already been a part of your family.

251
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,720
The rules of the old house can't be broken because of me.

252
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,720
The wings are hard.

253
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,720
It's getting harder and harder to listen to me.

254
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,720
My uncle is getting harder and harder to listen to.

255
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
He even hates my grandma.

256
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,720
Please go back and report to Qiu Dekou.

257
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,720
He can digest this.

258
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,720
If he insists on pursuing the Omen,

259
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,720
he will be in trouble.

260
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,720
Our cooperation will be in danger.

261
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,720
Mr. Qiu Dekou said he would go somewhere far away from Xie Jasha.

262
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,720
Xie Yuchen will go to the Omen soon.

263
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,720
No.

264
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,720
It's because the Omen is dangerous.

265
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,720
There is one more person to be safe.

266
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,720
Xie Yuchen is a descendant of the old house.

267
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,720
You should trust his ability.

268
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,720
Compared to your daughter's news,

269
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,720
I think you can understand.

270
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,720
You are looking for Huoling?

271
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,720
Our problem hasn't been solved yet.

272
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,720
You are trying to make Xie family hate Huo family.

273
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,720
It's a good thing.

274
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,720
What do you think?

275
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,720
I don't think so.

276
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,720
What do you think?

277
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,720
Goodbye.

278
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,720
The conversion won't be successful,

279
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,600
we cannot do the same thing with Huo family.

280
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,800
Yes.

281
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:05,580
Old Mazai School

282
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:26,480
Begin the assassination

283
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,800
You...

284
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,800
Relax.

285
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,800
Keep your body strong.

286
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,800
Sir, we have a red.

287
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,800
This is a shamish Putin!

288
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,800
No!

289
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,800
Run!

290
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
No!

291
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,800
Don't take it off.

292
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,800
Take a deep breath.

293
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,800
Why did he take it off?

294
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,800
He's still alive.

295
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,800
He's a hallucination, right?

296
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,800
Are you okay?

297
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,800
Pan Zi,

298
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
I'm fine.

299
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Pan Zi, is he still alive?

300
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,800
He can't die.

301
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,800
But he can't live long.

302
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,800
Look, he's got a big hole.

303
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
What do you want?

304
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,800
He's still alive?

305
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,800
He can't live long even if he's saved?

306
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,800
And if he's saved, how...

307
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,800
What if he's not saved?

308
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,800
Can he put him here alone?

309
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,800
He's a big man.

310
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,800
I...

311
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,800
Wait!

312
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,800
Wait!

313
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,800
What's wrong?

314
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,800
Get down!

315
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,800
Wait!

316
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,800
What did he say before he died?

317
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,800
Who knows?

318
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,800
I don't understand.

319
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
He said it was a fake.

320
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,800
It was probably a big bird.

321
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,800
What's wrong?

322
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,800
We want to kill you.

323
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,800
We want your uncle to leave.

324
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,800
You have to fight.

325
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,800
You said...

326
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
Enough.

327
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,800
Pan Zi,

328
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,800
you can't...

329
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,800
What are you doing?

330
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
What's wrong?

331
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,800
He's coming again?

332
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,800
He's laughing!

333
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,800
OK!

334
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,800
He's dying!

335
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,800
What is that?

336
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,800
Maybe...

337
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,800
He's though someone is trying to prevent it.

338
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,800
You've got twenty false evidences.

339
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,800
Why don't you go first?

340
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,800
You were so loud just now.

341
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,800
He was right behind you.

342
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,800
Look!

343
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,800
Who was the one who shot the gun?

344
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,800
Me.

345
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,800
Me? And me?

346
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,800
The gun was fired.

347
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
The gun was fired.

348
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,800
Why?

349
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,800
There's no time for that.

350
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,800
Go! Go!

351
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
Stop!

352
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,800
Take the gun!

353
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,800
What should we do now?

354
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,800
I don't know.

355
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,800
Then why did you let them run away?

356
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
This is not my idea.

357
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,800
It's your third master's idea.

358
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,800
Third master?

359
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,800
You're also a third master.

360
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,800
Third uncle?

361
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,800
Don't ask so much.

362
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,800
I'll take you to see the third master.

363
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,800
You can ask yourself.

364
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,800
We can still see the third master.

365
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,800
Maybe the gun just now...

366
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,800
...could move the father.

367
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,800
Come!

368
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,800
Move!

369
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,800
Stop!

370
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,800
Move!

371
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,800
Shizan!

372
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,800
Shizan!

373
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,800
How's that?

374
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,800
Fatty, are you crazy?

375
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,800
Wait for me!

376
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,800
Shizan!

377
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,800
Shizan!

378
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,800
Fatty, you remember a good soldier.

379
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,800
He won't shoot you.

380
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,800
I'm a wild man.

381
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,800
I can use it anyway.

382
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,800
You dare not leave?

383
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,800
Fatty, you go.

384
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,800
Where are you going?

385
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
You go.

386
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,800
Don't stay with us.

387
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,800
Your eyes are yellow.

388
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,800
You'll be Nephew's wife soon.

389
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,800
Shizan?

390
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,800
Just you watch then.

391
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,800
Don't you have the Dass weirdsein to kill me?

392
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:06,800
Myology gear told me like that for this house actually.

393
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,800
How dare you do something so shameful!

394
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,800
No, I can't remember it.

395
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,800
You're asking me to take a test?

396
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,800
No, that's not a test.

397
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,800
What are you trying to say?

398
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,800
Fatty Wang, don't hit me. I know you so well.

399
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,800
Or I might not know you well.

400
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
What is this?

401
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,800
What else do you want to say?

402
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,800
What else can you explain?

403
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,800
Do you know this is a classmate?

404
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,800
Do you know what the news will bring us?

405
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,800
I don't know. Don't blame me for not picking up.

406
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,800
Give it to me. Give it to me.

407
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,800
What's the new situation, Mr. Wang?

408
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,800
I didn't tell him what I wanted to say.

409
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,800
Thank you.

410
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,800
You're welcome. Listen to me.

411
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,800
Listen.

412
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,800
You know I've been taking care of you in the hospital.

413
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,800
I've been running around the whole time.

414
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
So I was in a hurry to open the shop.

415
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,800
I was in a hurry to buy the goods.

416
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,800
Then I was kicked out by the car.

417
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,800
I was locked up by him.

418
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,800
Then my parents' shop was taken away.

419
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,800
So I had no choice. So I used this.

420
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,800
And you don't have to worry.

421
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,800
I'm always protecting you.

422
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,800
I've been protecting you.

423
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,800
But I never told them what's most important.

424
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,800
You have to stay with me.

425
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,800
Otherwise, how can you report my actions?

426
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,800
You can't do this because of a communication device.

427
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,800
You're not a communication device, okay?

428
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,800
Because of a communication device?

429
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,800
Wang Fatty.

430
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,800
You're a traitor.

431
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,800
You don't care about our interests.

432
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,800
Okay, Wang Fatty. I can do this.

433
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,800
I owe you a lot.

434
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,800
I can give you a life.

435
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,800
But what about them?

436
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,800
Do you know what kind of person Qiu Dekang is?

437
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,800
You're a bit arrogant.

438
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,800
I'll say it again.

439
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,800
It's not as serious as you said.

440
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,800
Do you understand?

441
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,800
Your father will take his money.

442
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,800
He took his money as a person.

443
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,800
He paid you for what he wanted.

444
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,800
He'll take his money back.

445
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,800
Are you stupid or are you trying to hide it from me?

446
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,800
Do you think I'm a traitor?

447
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,800
Okay.

448
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,800
We're not that kind of people.

449
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,800
Yes.

450
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,800
I admit that I was wrong about this.

451
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,800
But don't forget that

452
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,800
the shop that my family left for me

453
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,800
was taken away by Qiu Dekang.

454
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,800
I had no choice but to do this.

455
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,800
Besides, I didn't tell her about the drug.

456
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,800
Of course, I know that I...

457
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,800
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

458
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,800
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

459
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,800
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

460
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,800
Forgive me.

461
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,800
Forgive me.

462
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,800
What?

463
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,800
I used to think that you're a smart person.

464
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,800
I'll think about it seriously.

465
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,800
But now you're lying to me.

466
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,800
You're the same as everyone else.

467
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,800
You're the same as everyone else.

468
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,800
You're doing this for your own good.

469
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,800
You don't even care about your brother's life.

470
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,800
Don't follow us anymore.

471
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,800
Let's go.

472
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,800
Follow you?

473
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,800
What did I do to you?

474
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,800
What did I do to you?

475
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,800
I helped you every day to deal with your family.

476
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,800
What did I do to you?

477
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,800
I was with you in the hospital.

478
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,800
I didn't want a home.

479
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,800
I didn't want a shop.

480
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,800
I was with you.

481
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,800
I took care of you.

482
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,800
I didn't care about you.

483
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,800
Every time I came down with you,

484
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,800
did I take the treasure and sell it?

485
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,800
Did I?

486
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:37,800
But you always think that I'm a smart person.

487
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:43,800
And now you're thinking that I'm a smart person.

488
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,800
Really?

489
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,800
Don't be afraid.

490
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,800
I've always wanted to follow you.

491
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,800
You want to deal with those bad things?

492
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,800
Okay, Fatty.

493
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,800
You're leaving and you're not coming back.

494
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,800
I'm telling you, Tian Jiu Bu Xie,

495
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,800
I'm telling you, I want to see you again.

496
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,800
I'll follow you.

497
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,800
Fatty.

498
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,800
Fatty.

499
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,800
Fatty.

500
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,800
Fatty.

501
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,800
Mr. San.

502
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,800
Mr. San.

503
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,800
I don't know where Mr. San is.

504
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,800
How can we leave?

505
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,800
He should be in the underground palace.

506
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,800
Underground palace?

507
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,800
Yes.

508
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,800
Mr. San told me.

509
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,800
Mr. San told you?

510
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,800
Where is the underground palace?

511
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,800
According to Chang Li,

512
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,800
the entrance to the underground palace

513
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,800
should be the third tunnel to the underground palace.

514
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,800
It's underground.

515
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,800
But there must be a copper roof.

516
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,800
In addition, there are 70-storey windows

517
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,800
and a rack of water-based steel.

518
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,800
Even if we come to the entire Kongming group,

519
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,800
we can't get out of here in 10 days and half a month.

520
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,800
How can Mr. San go in?

521
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,800
I think there's an entrance.

522
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,800
And it's right here.

523
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,800
It's like the secret entrance to the underground palace.

524
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,800
It's not just in the hidden secret room.

525
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,800
But where do we have time to find and dig?

526
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,800
I don't know where the entrance is.

527
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,800
But I heard from Mr. San that

528
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,800
this is the place of Xuanwu's master.

529
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,800
He said that if I tell you this,

530
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,800
you'll know where the entrance is.

531
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,800
Think about it.

532
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,800
The place of Xuanwu's master?

533
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,800
Yes.

534
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,800
It's impossible.

535
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,800
How could there be such a place in the world?

536
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,800
What else did he tell you?

537
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,800
Did he tell you anything else?

538
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,800
No.

539
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,800
Just these few things.

540
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,800
This way.

541
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,800
Let the smoke go.

542
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,800
It's too dangerous here.

543
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,800
Let's go.

544
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,800
Let's go.

545
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,800
Let's go.

546
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,800
Let's go.

547
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,800
Let's go.

548
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,800
Let's go.

549
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,800
Let's go.
