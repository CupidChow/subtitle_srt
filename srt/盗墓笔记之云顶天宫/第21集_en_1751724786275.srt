00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 16

2
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,500
No need to prove it.

3
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,500
Little Third Master.

4
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,500
Look.

5
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,000
These are six bodies.

6
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Assuming that there are eight people in total,

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
it means that two people are missing.

8
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Although we don't know how those two people got out,

9
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
but if according to what you said, there is a space to fold,

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
then there should be eight bodies here.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So we don't need to consider the third point.

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
If we consider the third point,

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
it means that we are dead.

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You said eight people, maybe only six people got in.

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Why don't you understand?

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It doesn't matter how many people got in.

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What matters is that these six people didn't get out even if they died.

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'll go check their notes and see if there are any clues.

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Go check it out.

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Get up and go check it out.

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What are these?

22
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
A lot of the letters on it are already very blurry.

23
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Except for the people's phone numbers,

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
they are some records of information

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and some small and tiny things.

26
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I don't know what they are.

27
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
They are all like a kind of puzzle.

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And some small and tiny things.

29
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I can't see any names.

30
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I can't see any names.

31
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Save some power.

32
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Turn off your mobile phone.

33
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Use the stove to light it.

34
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
How did you know?

35
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Listen up.

36
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This is the last thing we sold today

37
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
from the sea.

38
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
We took 3,000 yuan and gave it to Li for 1,500 yuan.

39
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
We owe money and we paid him back.

40
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The one from the sea, has he been to the seabed?

41
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Pan Zi,

42
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,320
I told you to find clues.

43
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,560
Why are you reading novels?

44
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,560
You're cheating.

45
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,840
Stop it.

46
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,960
Stop it.

47
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,880
What if there's any clue?

48
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,480
Look at this.

49
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,680
Look at this person.

50
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:14,960
This person.

51
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,640
This...

52
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,800
Isn't this Master San?

53
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,520
No, this isn't Master San.

54
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,600
This is Xie Lian Huan.

55
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,000
The person who took the photo is Master San.

56
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,480
Calm down.

57
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,240
This person.

58
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,720
Master San, Xiao Ge.

59
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
Why?

60
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,920
Is the whole archaeological team

61
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,120
in the Cloud Sky Palace now?

62
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,720
Why?

63
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,360
Why do they have to come here?

64
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,840
No, calm down.

65
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,720
Fatty.

66
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,280
Shang Zhang is going to blow up this place.

67
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,960
I'm leaving right now.

68
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,960
I'm going to ask Master San

69
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,800
what's going on here?

70
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,520
Shang Zhang.

71
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,440
We can definitely get out.

72
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,000
Calm down.

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,200
Think about how to get out.

74
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,640
Let's go find Master San.

75
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,520
Okay?

76
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,040
Master San, let's go.

77
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,840
Come.

78
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,560
Come, think about it.

79
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,120
Look at this.

80
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,240
Come, give me this.

81
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,120
Drink some water.

82
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,120
Calm down.

83
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,760
Think about it.

84
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,960
Come.

85
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,920
Master San.

86
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,560
You'd better keep your courage.

87
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,280
You have internal injuries.

88
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,480
How about we

89
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,920
end it here today?

90
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,040
Let's keep a good state tomorrow.

91
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,600
I know you have something on your mind.

92
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
But these things

93
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,160
can't be solved in a flash.

94
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,160
Master San.

95
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,440
If I had known we wouldn't follow the symbols and leave.

96
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,320
The symbols clearly

97
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,240
belonged to the eight people who stayed.

98
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,800
They must have been divided into two groups.

99
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,000
The six people here and the two people there.

100
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,120
Where did they leave the symbols?

101
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,440
Maybe that direction is more dangerous.

102
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,240
Not necessarily.

103
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,600
Maybe those two people

104
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,280
found the missing people here.

105
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,680
So they left the symbols.

106
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,680
Maybe.

107
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
The symbols.

108
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
The symbols.

109
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Yes.

110
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,000
The symbols.

111
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,120
Calm down.

112
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,080
Calm down.

113
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,680
This tomb is a back door.

114
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,400
It's impossible to get in.

115
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,720
Take your time.

116
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
Listen to me.

117
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,040
If it's a space fold,

118
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,040
no matter what the reason is,

119
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,640
there must be a process

120
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,840
of turning around in this tomb.

121
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,360
Right?

122
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,040
Yes.

123
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,040
Right?

124
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,840
Yes.

125
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,160
If I hold the pen

126
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,040
and draw the signs and move forward,

127
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,480
there will be a long line of signs behind me

128
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,480
following me.

129
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,240
What will happen after I turn around?

130
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,120
There are signs on the wall.

131
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,720
Focus.

132
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,040
The point is that after we turn around,

133
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,840
the whole direction will reverse.

134
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,200
I would have been holding the pen

135
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,120
and drawing the signs on the other wall.

136
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,680
Right?

137
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,760
Do you admit it?

138
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,120
Yes.

139
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,720
Do you understand?

140
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,320
So,

141
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,440
this is a logical conclusion.

142
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:55,960
So,

143
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,800
logically,

144
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
no matter what the reason is,

145
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,800
there must be a turning point.

146
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,080
When we walk to the turning point,

147
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,800
it's like

148
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,720
walking in a mirror.

149
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,160
We go straight to the opposite direction of the object.

150
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,160
Right?

151
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:07,960
Okay.

152
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,240
Here's the question.

153
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,400
If this back door really exists,

154
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,520
how thick is it?

155
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,800
How thick?

156
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,880
How thick?

157
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,040
How thick?

158
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,680
Very thick.

159
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,680
Right.

160
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,280
It must be thick.

161
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,120
If the back door is not thick,

162
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,680
when we walk to the back door,

163
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,600
the front and back parts of our bodies

164
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,680
will overlap

165
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,280
when we pass through the mirror.

166
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,080
Right.

167
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,080
Because the front part of our bodies

168
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,520
has passed through the back door.

169
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,360
But the back part

170
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,600
is still outside the mirror.

171
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,360
If I'm right,

172
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,120
when we pass through the mirror,

173
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,960
we will inevitably become monsters.

174
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Your nose will

175
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,040
grow up on your back.

176
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,000
But we've walked so many times

177
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,840
and we're not dead.

178
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,080
That's what I'm saying.

179
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,760
This reflection surface

180
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,920
must be much thicker than a person's.

181
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,960
It's a reflected structure.

182
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,120
We walk in from this end

183
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,600
and then walk out from the other end.

184
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,360
In this process,

185
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,360
we complete the fold of the whole space.

186
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,800
Here's the question.

187
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,640
How much is the distance?

188
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,840
How much?

189
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,560
Well,

190
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,720
if we assume that

191
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,920
there are only two or three steps away,

192
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,720
when we enter the space,

193
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,640
we enter the space,

194
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,320
but Fatty didn't enter the space

195
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,320
when he was outside.

196
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,280
Because there are only two or three steps

197
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,200
away from the space.

198
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,600
So, we can see

199
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,800
both sides of the front and back.

200
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,680
What will happen at this time?

201
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,160
We will see

202
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,760
the same Fatty Wang.

203
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,360
Right.

204
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,360
There will be two

205
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,720
same Fatty Wang in front and back.

206
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,800
You say this is annoying.

207
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,480
At this time,

208
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,760
the back is coming.

209
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,440
Can Fatty Wang A behind us

210
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,360
see Fatty Wang B behind him?

211
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,520
Don't say it.

212
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,280
Or,

213
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,200
we can

214
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,720
hold Fatty Wang A's hand.

215
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,680
Stop talking.

216
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,600
Listen to me.

217
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,160
Can I make a suggestion?

218
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,240
Don't always use me as an analogy.

219
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,440
Use Lang Feng as an analogy.

220
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,360
How could this happen?

221
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,240
Right.

222
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,120
So, the so-called

223
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,800
mirror space is impossible to exist.

224
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,520
The path that we can't walk out

225
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,640
is not based on logic.

226
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,520
The existence of this path

227
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,720
is illogical.

228
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,680
Fatty Wang is not a god.

229
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,640
He can't create

230
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,920
his own physical rules.

231
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,920
The light of the mirror

232
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,800
has nothing to do with Fatty Wang.

233
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,000
These bodies are not

234
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,480
trapped here because of these light.

235
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,280
What we are facing now

236
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,520
is a new problem.

237
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,200
It's a new speciality.

238
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,800
We are misled by these bodies.

239
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,080
And the most capable of this kind of misunderstanding is...

240
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,720
What?

241
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,040
There is a ghost.

242
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,200
Where is my black donkey?

243
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,760
Lord.

244
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,240
There is a ghost.

245
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,160
There is a ghost.

246
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,400
There is a ghost.

247
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,120
I said so much.

248
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,400
You just analyze a ghost for me.

249
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,000
Just give me the conclusion.

250
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,160
Illusion?

251
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,800
Didn't you say it the second time?

252
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,480
Fatty Wang.

253
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,080
We have experienced

254
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,080
such an illusion.

255
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,920
The bronze tree.

256
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,120
The bronze tree.

257
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,160
Little Third Master.

258
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,520
What are we looking for?

259
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,520
You haven't told me.

260
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,880
When we were in Qinlin,

261
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,440
we encountered a strange bronze.

262
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,120
It can affect people around us.

263
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,600
It makes people feel trapped in one place

264
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,200
and can't get out.

265
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,200
Just like what we are doing now.

266
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,120
Gold, silver, and pearl.

267
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,120
I can't find it.

268
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,120
Did you find it?

269
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,120
We will find it.

270
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,120
We will find it.

271
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,120
Come on.

272
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,120
Tianzhen.

273
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,120
Come and see.

274
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,120
Hurry up.

275
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,120
You are finally found.

276
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,120
This is what I have been looking for.

277
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,120
I found it.

278
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,120
Hurry up.

279
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,120
Burn it.

280
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,120
I found it.

281
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,120
I found it.

282
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,120
What's that sound?

283
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,120
Where is he?

284
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,120
Shunzi.

285
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,120
Shunzi.

286
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,120
Where are you?

287
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,120
I am here.

288
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,120
Where are you?

289
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,120
I am here.

290
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,120
Where are you?

291
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
Shunzi.

292
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
I am telling you.

293
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,120
Don't force him.

294
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,120
Don't let him attack us from behind.

295
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,120
Go.

296
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,120
Shunzi.

297
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,120
Shunzi.

298
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,120
Shunzi.

299
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,120
Shunzi.

300
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,120
Tianzhen.

301
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:53,920
.

302
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,920
What happened?

303
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,160
Hua

304
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,100
Why are you here?

305
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,620
Are you okay?

306
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,840
I'm fine

307
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,920
Why are you here?

308
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,120
What happened?

309
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,720
How long can your needle keep him from sleeping?

310
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,800
Don't worry, it won't hurt him

311
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,480
We're out!

312
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,420
We're out!

313
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,800
How did you find this place?

314
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,080
Someone used explosives

315
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,260
Could it be San Ye and the others?

316
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,720
The amount of the medicine is quite large. Is there something wrong?

317
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,760
Wu Xie

318
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,480
Let's talk

319
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,920
I'll go with you

320
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,360
Do you know what they said?

321
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,920
How did you find this place?

322
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,920
Wu Xie

323
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,920
What secret is hidden in the sky?

324
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,920
It attracts everyone to come here

325
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,920
Wu Xie

326
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,920
You came to the sky for your third uncle

327
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,920
I came for someone

328
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,920
Who?

329
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,920
Before this

330
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,920
I have a few questions for you

331
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,920
Can I?

332
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,920
First question

333
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,920
No matter what your third uncle did

334
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,920
You will unconditionally believe him

335
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,920
He is my third uncle

336
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,920
I know him

337
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,920
Second question

338
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,920
Do you know what happened to your third uncle and my uncle in the west?

339
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,920
Why haven't they made any progress after all these years?

340
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,920
Wu Xie

341
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,920
You've been to the bottom of the sea

342
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,920
Did you find anything?

343
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,920
Back then, we were in the bottom of the sea

344
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,920
We've found a lot of the devices there

345
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,920
The traces left by the archaeology team have been destroyed

346
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,920
We...

347
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,920
We encountered a lot of strange things

348
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,920
Okay

349
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,920
Third question

350
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,920
I see you as my brother who is in danger

351
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,920
My best friend

352
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,920
My best friend

353
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,920
Are you the same?

354
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,920
Of course

355
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,920
What do you want to ask me?

356
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,920
Wu Xie

357
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,920
In the eyes of the public

358
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,920
I am the youngest uncle of the Old Nine Sect

359
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,920
I am the one who is the master of the Xie family

360
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,920
I am the one who is the business man

361
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,920
But in your eyes

362
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,920
I am not

363
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,920
Except for your brother and friend, I am nothing

364
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,920
Wu Xie, you are a smart person

365
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,920
I think you can guess

366
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,920
I left the Xie family and chased to the top of the sky

367
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,920
Not just for a few simple questions

368
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,920
I think you should guess

369
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,920
I have found out the truth

370
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,920
I just don't believe that you would keep it from me

371
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,920
All along

372
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,920
I have never kept anything from you

373
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,920
Just like Xie Lian Huan

374
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,920
To Wu San Xing

375
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,920
I have never kept anything from you

376
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,920
So I want to ask you in person

377
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,920
Give you another chance

378
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,920
But I didn't expect

379
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,920
You would still lie to me

380
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,920
Xiao Hua

381
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,920
Xiao Hua, listen to me

382
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,920
I didn't mean to hide it from you

383
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,920
I know what you want to know

384
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,920
But I just think

385
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,920
I should tell you everything after I find out

386
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,920
Didn't you lie just now?

387
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,920
Yes

388
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,920
Yes

389
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,920
I shouldn't lie to you

390
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,920
But I just thought

391
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,920
At first

392
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,920
I wanted to tell you

393
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,920
But I don't know why

394
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,920
I am just a ghost

395
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,920
I didn't say anything

396
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,920
From then on, I can't find a chance

397
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,920
I am afraid after I tell you this

398
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,920
You will have other thoughts about me

399
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
I

400
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,920
Okay

401
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,920
Whatever I say, it's wrong anyway

402
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,920
I am sorry

403
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,920
Don't be silly

404
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,920
After you find out the truth

405
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,920
After you find out the truth

406
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,920
And the truth is behind your imagination

407
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,920
After you find out that Wu San Xing is the bad guy

408
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,920
You still won't tell me

409
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,920
Xie Lian Huan chose the wrong brother

410
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,920
It seems

411
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,920
I chose the wrong one too

412
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,920
You are my last concern to the Wu family

413
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,920
Now I am relieved

414
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,920
Now I am relieved

415
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,920
Thank you

416
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,920
Huan

417
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,920
I can't be your brother

418
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,920
I only advise you to say one last word

419
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,920
Stop it

420
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,920
I am afraid you will never leave this place

421
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,920
Huan

422
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,920
Huan

423
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,920
Huan

424
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,920
She left

425
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,920
Why did she leave?

426
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,920
What did she say to you?

427
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,920
Tian Zhen

428
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,920
Tian Zhen

429
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,920
Tian Zhen

430
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,920
Tian Zhen, stop

431
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,920
Tian Zhen

432
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,920
Stop

433
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,920
What did you say to Huan?

434
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,920
Why didn't she come with us?

435
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,920
This time we will go the other way

436
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,920
How do you know?

437
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,920
The kid told you?

438
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,920
No, how does she know?

439
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,920
Is it reliable?

440
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,920
Yes

441
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,920
Wu Xie

442
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,920
I won't go with you

443
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,920
I have brought the painting that Wu San asked me to bring

444
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,920
I am not happy with his money

445
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,920
I am not happy

446
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,920
And

447
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,920
My father has found it

448
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,920
I want to take him back home

449
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,920
I don't want to be involved in your future

450
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,920
Besides

451
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,920
I am not suitable to follow you

452
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,920
I have to go to the hot spring

453
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,920
Shun Zi

454
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,920
Can you go back alone?

455
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,920
Don't worry

456
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,920
I am better than you

457
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,920
But we dragged you back, right?

458
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,920
Brother Huan

459
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,920
You know I didn't mean that

460
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,920
Enough

461
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,920
Don't tease him

462
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,920
Shun Zi

463
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,920
Be careful on your way back

464
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,920
Boss Wu

465
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,920
I know you have a lot of things in your heart

466
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,920
You won't get out if you don't find a result here

467
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,920
But don't forget

468
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,920
You will be out of food soon

469
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,920
You have a few days to go down the mountain

470
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,920
You know what you are doing

471
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,920
Be careful

472
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,920
San Ye

473
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,920
This...

474
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,920
Pan Zi

475
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,920
Did San Ye tell you?

476
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,920
He...

477
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,920
What?

478
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,920
Forget it

479
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,920
Let me ask him myself

480
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,920
What?

481
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,920
San Ye

482
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,920
Is this a dead end?

483
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,920
San Ye

484
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,920
Be careful

485
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,920
Safe

486
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,920
Let's take a break

487
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,920
Ok, let's go

488
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,920
Go

489
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,920
Why are you here?

490
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,920
Please let us meet Mr. Takao

491
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,920
Where is he?

492
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,920
He is almost here

493
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,920
San Ye

494
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,920
Is there something wrong with San Ye?

495
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,920
Why doesn't he answer the phone?

496
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:18,920
He won't show up until he sees the answer

497
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,920
Mr. Takao asked us to bring the doctor here

498
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,920
He brought a doctor with a lot of experience

499
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,920
You are too injured

500
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,920
Let him show you

501
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,920
Thank you

502
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,920
Don't move

503
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
Especially in a distance

504
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,920
Thank you

505
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,920
There must be a lot of treasures in here

506
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,920
San Ye

507
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,920
San Ye

508
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,920
San Ye

509
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,920
San Ye

510
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,920
Madam

511
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,920
What is it?

512
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,920
Madam

513
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,920
Takao's men want to see you

514
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,920
No

515
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,920
He is in a bad mood recently

516
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,920
He doesn't want to see these dogs

517
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:26,920
He said it was about the truth you and Mr. Takao agreed on

518
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,920
He said you must be interested in seeing him

519
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,920
This way

520
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:17,920
They are in a trap

521
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,920
Do you need help?

522
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,920
How can we help?

523
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,920
You and all of them are so useless

524
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,920
Unless we use the rope to hang them

525
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,920
But Takao's men are all blind

526
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,920
We saved Madam a few times before

527
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,920
I will tell you when it's over

528
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,920
He is not soft when he kills us

529
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,920
Uncle San

530
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,920
San Ye

531
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,920
San Ye

532
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,920
What's wrong with you?

533
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,920
Be careful

534
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,920
Be careful

535
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,920
Listen

536
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,920
San Ye

537
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,920
San Ye

538
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,920
You bastard

539
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,920
Come

540
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,920
Please go back

541
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,920
Ok

542
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,920
I will talk to you in person when Mr. Takao comes back

543
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,920
Takao must have arrived at the Cloud Sky Palace

544
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,920
I'm afraid you won't see him for a while

545
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,920
You can open the door and see the mountain

546
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,920
What do you want?

547
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,920
People like the world champion Guo Jingjing and Wu Minxia

548
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,920
They jump down because there is water below

549
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,920
Why are you playing around?

550
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,920
You have to turn around and turn around for three and a half weeks

551
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,920
Ok

552
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,920
I will give you a cough

553
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,920
Hurry up

554
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,920
Don't waste the medicine

555
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,920
San Ye

556
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,920
San Ye, what's wrong with you?

557
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,920
San Ye, how did you take care of San Ye?

558
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,920
Don't worry

559
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,920
I'm not dead yet

560
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,920
I'll see your wound

561
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,920
Come

562
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,920
You finally show up

563
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,920
Drink water

564
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,920
Come

565
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,920
How is San Ye?

566
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,920
He was dragged into the flesh by the strong skewers

567
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,920
He was dragged into the flesh by the strong skewers

568
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,920
It must have hurt a lot

569
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,920
What are you talking about?

570
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,920
This is San Ye

571
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,920
You would have been hurt to death if it were you

572
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,920
There is no good meat in his chest

573
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,920
The strong skewers of this bastard are broken when he pulls

574
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,920
The rest of the half can still be dragged into the flesh

575
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,920
In the end, it was cut open with a knife to jump out

576
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,920
Ok, stop talking

577
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,920
You have worked hard

578
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,920
Come

579
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,920
Don't let An Ning see it

580
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,920
Eat something

581
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,920
Eat

582
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,920
San Ye

583
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,920
San Ye

584
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,920
How is he?

585
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,920
He is not in good condition

586
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,920
He is still on the exam

587
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,920
San Ye

588
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,920
San Ye

589
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,920
If there is no problem

590
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,920
Mr. Qiu Dakao still hopes to continue to cooperate with the Huo family

591
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,920
You have a big appetite

592
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,920
I'm afraid the Huo family can't keep you

593
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:43,920
You will have to make up for it by yourself

594
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,920
I believe you will have a way

595
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,920
Unless you don't care about the Huo family anymore

596
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:59,920
What else can you threaten me with besides this?

597
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,920
I'm sorry

598
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,920
Qiu Dakao has a big appetite

599
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,920
He is touched by everything in the Heavenly Palace

600
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,920
This is the last time

601
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,920
You should know what is in the Heavenly Palace

602
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,920
It doesn't matter if you get it or not

603
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:05,920
The mark of the past is laughing in the hole

604
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,920
The lonely breeze

605
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,920
I chase the clouds and the wind

606
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,920
I have forgotten myself all the way

607
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,920
How can I make it?

608
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:28,920
I passed through the night and I was forced to answer in the dark

609
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:41,700
The heart was

610
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,920
сто
