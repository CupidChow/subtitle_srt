1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You're a Self-Cected Specialist,

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
the Superunknownanding auspiciousaisus of the dead world,

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Lady As a figure affected my name

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
means theọnbulage on your leg.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The asphalt that has put your foot down

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
must have been destroyed before,

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
then Otona blew it down.

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What was that?

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,600
We said something about it

49
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,000
before.

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm sorry, Langfang.

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I didn't mean that.

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Can you go out now?

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Can you go out now?

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm still early.

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Anyway, we need to confirm it.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Other than the stone,

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
there's nothing else that can disturb the signal.

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Otherwise, we'll be the same.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I've been a ghost since I was a kid.

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But today, I...

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
hate animals.

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I heard that your people

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
want to use the Xie family's horse

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
to transport the weapons that were received by China.

67
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Is that true?

68
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You've been asking about the past for a long time.

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Our team is currently focusing on the Yunding Celestial Palace project.

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's impossible for you to tell me.

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But that person has

72
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
the logo and weapon of your illegal company.

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No, you don't think about it.

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We're working together now.

75
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Why are you so bold and acting like a gunman?

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I suspect that it was designed by the Huo family.

77
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Or it was the Qiu Dekou High School.

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You want me to be the one to blame?

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Qiu Dekou and you are working together.

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
His eyes won't be so united.

81
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That's right.

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We're now in a team that's suitable for An Ning.

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But Qiu Dekou wants to drop our unit.

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's not the first time.

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
This time too.

86
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That's strange.

87
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
As far as I know, Qiu Dekou and the company

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
have been working together.

89
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
They've already established some of the contracts.

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
How did they suddenly break up

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
after so many years of good relations?

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Is it because of the company's record?

93
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
According to the company's record,

94
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
the cooperation between Qiu Dekou and the company

95
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
has been going smoothly.

96
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
We've worked together for many years.

97
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But in the past few years,

98
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Qiu Dekou started to reduce the cooperation of the project.

99
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
He even kept the information

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
that should be shared in some long-term projects.

101
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Especially now.

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
He even started to report about

103
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
the private sector of the company.

104
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Is this cooperation worth...

105
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Of course.

106
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I also guessed a few things.

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The western sea wood,

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
the Guizhou Miwu Village,

109
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
and the Yunding Sky Palace.

110
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I've seen the information

111
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
that you sent me to the western sea wood.

112
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I found something very interesting.

113
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Qiu Dekou

114
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
sent people to join the test team.

115
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And you also sent people there.

116
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The two people secretly fought

117
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and caused a lot of trouble for the test team.

118
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I think

119
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
even the missing of the test team

120
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
can't escape from you.

121
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I know a lot about this.

122
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
After all, I haven't entered the company

123
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
at that time.

124
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But I know what you want to ask me.

125
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Xie Lian Huan's death has nothing to do with us.

126
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Of course, this is indeed a doubt.

127
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I want to know the most about this.

128
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Other than Wu San Xing,

129
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Qiu Dekou

130
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
according to the information I received,

131
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Wu Xie has entered the Yunding Sky Palace with the funeral.

132
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And Wu San Xing

133
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
is probably a step earlier than him.

134
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Qiu Dekou is on the way.

135
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I think you can find the answer

136
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
that you want to know.

137
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I want this answer.

138
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What do you want to exchange?

139
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Heiguo has already buried it on my head.

140
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I think Huo Jia and Qiu Dekou

141
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
won't let me go easily.

142
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I hope you can teach them

143
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
to return the key to the key

144
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and let them take it away in time.

145
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
By the way,

146
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
find out who is the one who framed me.

147
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Okay, I want this answer.

148
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
They want a chance.

149
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Ye Zun.

150
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Leaf for Xie YuHua with some interest.

151
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Is that reliable?

152
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Are we still having any other ideas?

153
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Maybe the office...

154
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Who cares about my work?

155
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Since we were sent to China,

156
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
starting with some locate details

157
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
were all soutilised.

158
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The company won't waste its energy on useless people.

159
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But we are in a fight.

160
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Now, we can only rely on the flower.

161
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This is very bad for us.

162
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It doesn't matter what's outside.

163
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
As long as we can find the secret in the Cloud Sky Palace,

164
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
victory is ours.

165
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The fire in A Ning is much more than ours.

166
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Don't worry.

167
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
According to the news from the Cloud Sky Palace,

168
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
there's a chance to get them to pick up the fire.

169
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Sir.

170
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Name. What's the status?

171
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Jason joined Xie Yuchen.

172
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
There seems to be a more useless team.

173
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
They plan to exhaust our...

174
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Sir, are you okay?

175
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You know I have to manage my businesses.

176
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And I don't have enough energy to take care of many projects at the same time.

177
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
How are you, sir? What did the doctor say?

178
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I don't have much time now.

179
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'll trust you will handle Jason by yourself.

180
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
At the moment, Wusha's safety is your top priority.

181
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Wait for my arrival.

182
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
After you get to the Palace, you will get rid of Jason.

183
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Even if someone tells you the Palace is fake,

184
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
just pretend you believe in him.

185
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Okay.

186
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And then stay there and wait for me.

187
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's so hot.

188
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's the rule of death.

189
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's a bit useful.

190
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
How is it?

191
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's done.

192
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's done.

193
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Sir.

194
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Sir.

195
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Sir.

196
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Sir.

197
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Sir.

198
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Sir, wait for me.

199
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Sir.

200
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Sir.

201
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Sir, where are you going?

202
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Sir.

203
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Sir.

204
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Why are you...

205
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Why are you acting?

206
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
What do you want to say to me?

207
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Sir.

208
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Is your eyes always good?

209
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Sir.

210
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Sir.

211
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Don't move.

212
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Fatty.

213
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
This good thing is not bad.

214
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's good for the foreign to take it away.

215
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Why don't we go into the water and get the moon?

216
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You have something to hide from me.

217
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Don't you know what I'm saying?

218
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Tell me the truth.

219
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I won't blame you.

220
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What are you talking about?

221
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm saying you're not good.

222
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You've been hiding too much from me.

223
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm very disappointed in you.

224
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Come back.

225
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Come back.

226
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Your phone keeps ringing.

227
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Don't you want to see it?

228
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Come back.

229
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Hello.

230
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Mr. Wang.

231
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Why don't you have a signal?

232
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Where are you now?

233
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Didn't I tell you not to call?

234
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I have to know if I have money to get the water.

235
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Now Tianzhen has found it.

236
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Did you do it on purpose?

237
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You know Tianzhen will find it, right?

238
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You should have thought about it when you got the money.

239
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Why are you blaming me now?

240
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Mr. Wang, we have a contract.

241
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You can't go back.

242
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I tell you.

243
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Get out of here.

244
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
How many did you hear?

245
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I didn't hear anything.

246
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Where are they?

247
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Why is there no one?

248
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
No one.

249
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I don't know.

250
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Why is the stone still here?

251
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
We have to stay here all the time.

252
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Hurry up.

253
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'll blow it up.

254
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Hurry up.

255
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Hurry up.

256
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Hurry up.

257
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Hurry up.

258
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Hurry up.

259
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Hurry up.

260
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'll blow it up.

261
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Okay?

262
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
No.

263
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's too dangerous.

264
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's too dangerous.

265
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Trust me.

266
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Run.

267
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Run.

268
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Why does it look so familiar?

269
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Of course.

270
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
This is the love poem on the map.

271
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
No.

272
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Sagao.

273
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Sagao.

274
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Sagao.

275
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's you, Sagao.

276
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Sagao.

277
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Sagao.

278
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Sagao.

279
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Sagao.

280
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Sagao.

281
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Who are you?

282
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Who are you?

283
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Uncle San.

284
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You...

285
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Why did you lose?

286
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Yes.

287
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm your uncle San.

288
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What's wrong?

289
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Uncle San, where did you get this dress?

290
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I wore it.

291
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Little thief.

292
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Hello, I'm Uncle San.

293
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Lend me a hand.

294
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'm your uncle San.

295
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I am your uncle.

296
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I am your uncle.

297
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Little boy, wake up.

298
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Wu Xie, I am your uncle.

299
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
My nephew.

300
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Wake up.

301
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Wake up.

302
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
My nephew.

303
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Wake up.

304
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Get up.

305
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Wake up.

306
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Wake up.

307
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Wake up.

308
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Fatty, stop playing.

309
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
The storm is coming.

310
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I am not playing.

311
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
What is this?

312
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
What is going on here?

313
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
People, listen.

314
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You two...

315
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,000
They were delighted at being fought against by myen old men!

316
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
pesos used to hatch and make the old railw many men would hate to kill us!

317
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,320
right now!

318
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,900
Everyone leave here soon!

319
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,800
Go now!

320
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,000
Go leave me now!

321
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,400
Hurry m-move!

322
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,200
The little turtle!

323
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,800
Who are youludest!

324
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,100
Hurry up

325
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,800
How many times has A-Pang'Tab found us and the police a funk?

326
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,960
No, they must be looking for us.

327
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,020
They'd like to see us

328
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,320
But they have yet to find you.

329
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,840
Where are they?

330
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,920
Maricang你ine Victim

331
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,620
Take two steps toward A-Pang

332
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,440
Nine sheets of paper

333
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,040
Let's go

334
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:41,620
Nurung

335
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,180
Up ahead

336
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,180
Come

337
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,320
Come

338
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,700
May I know your age?

339
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,800
The police don't know you

340
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,940
Will you be zuetted right here?

341
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Come on.

342
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Brother!

343
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Fatty!

344
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Fatty!

345
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Let's go.

346
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
This way.

347
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Uncle San!

348
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
You ran away when you saw him.

349
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
What do you mean?

350
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
This place is very safe.

351
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Come in.

352
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
What do you mean?

353
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Your prison has lied to me.

354
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Then you disappeared with me.

355
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Now you care about me.

356
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Cheng Xiang Yu is very powerful.

357
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I tell you.

358
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
You'll remember it in a while.

359
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'll be back.

360
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I'll be back.

361
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'll be back.

362
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
You'll remember it in a while.

363
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
You'll be right when you run away with Uncle San.

364
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
What's Cheng Xiang Yu?

365
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Fatty, tell me.

366
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
You don't even know Cheng Xiang Yu.

367
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
He's a kind of thing that can attract snakes and bugs.

368
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Even a big one like a rooster

369
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
can attract 10 meters of bugs.

370
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It's the first time I've met my third grandfather.

371
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
After that thing got into the family,

372
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I divided it into three parts.

373
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Then what do you want him to do?

374
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And Fatty,

375
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
you knew it long ago.

376
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

377
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
No.

378
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
You're not done yet.

379
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Let me tell you.

380
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
That magnet can make you unconscious.

381
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
It can kill you.

382
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Then you can become a beggar.

383
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
The magnet of this magnet

384
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
must be completely burned back.

385
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Then it can disappear.

386
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
No wonder we were in the tunnel just now.

387
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
How can we turn around?

388
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
This is...

389
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Uncle San.

390
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Uncle San.

391
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Can you stop talking?

392
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Can you talk to me?

393
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Can you?

394
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Even just once,

395
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
you tell me your plan first.

396
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Don't let us

397
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
turn around like a dead pig, okay?

398
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Third Master,

399
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
don't be angry.

400
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I can't be angry.

401
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I can.

402
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Uncle San.

403
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
How much do you know about

404
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
this Cloud Sky Palace?

405
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Do you know

406
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
that the people of Chiesan

407
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
have arrived?

408
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I know.

409
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
You brought people here.

410
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
You know a lot.

411
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Can you

412
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
share your information

413
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
with your big nephew?

414
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Big nephew?

415
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
There must be a secret, right?

416
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Look at me.

417
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I respect Big nephew's privacy.

418
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I'm afraid you'll hate me

419
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
for being so hard on me.

420
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Uncle San.

421
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Are you the one who helped me?

422
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Or did you help Jiesen?

423
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Or did you help

424
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
someone who gave you more money?

425
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Little boy, you're right.

426
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Sometimes

427
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I help someone who gave me more money.

428
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Shut the door.

429
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Look at the door.

430
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Hurry up.

431
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Uncle San.

432
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
What's going on?

433
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
You took so many sticks.

434
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Uncle San.

435
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
It's from the Cloud Sky Palace.

436
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I told you

437
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
to keep it safe.

438
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Uncle San.

439
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Uncle San.

440
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Uncle San.

441
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
The fan is hot.

442
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Run, Fourth Master.

443
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Hurry up.

444
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Run.

445
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Run.

446
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Hold it.

447
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Hold it.

448
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
All right.

449
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
You only have Fourth Master.

450
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Don't worry about me.

451
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I don't care about him.

452
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
No one cares about him.

453
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Look at him.

454
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
It's all right.

455
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
It's all right.

456
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Wolf Fang.

457
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It's me.

458
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Third Master is here.

459
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Third Master.

460
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
You've ruined me.

461
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Uncle San.

462
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
You're the one

463
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
who followed Fourth Master.

464
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Yes.

465
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
My name is Wolf Fang.

466
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I'm glad to see you, Third Master.

467
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Why are you alone?

468
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Where are the others?

469
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
They're all gone.

470
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I was just

471
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
running around alone.

472
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
But I felt that

473
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
the more I ran, the less I felt.

474
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
From the hall to the back hall,

475
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
it was about 500 meters away.

476
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
But I ran for about ten minutes.

477
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I didn't make it.

478
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Then I found out

479
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
that the others were gone.

480
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Then I just found a way

481
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
and came here.

482
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
We're also...

483
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
What kind of magic

484
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
or mechanism are we in?

485
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Have you ever

486
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
run into a bug?

487
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
A bug?

488
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
What bug?

489
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
It's a brick.

490
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It's a secret.

491
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
It fell from the hall.

492
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
It fell down to Xia Yu.

493
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I'm not going to write it.

494
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I'm begging you.

495
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Don't say that.

496
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I'm the most afraid of this.

497
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Fourth Master.

498
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
What should we do now?

499
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
It's quite a mess.

500
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
We can't go back.

501
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Let's go ahead.

502
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Come with me.

503
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
What's wrong?

504
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Third Master.

505
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Don't you think that Wolf King

506
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
is strange all the way?

507
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
What's wrong?

508
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Tell me.

509
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
It's just a feeling.

510
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
He's always

511
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
sending messages to people.

512
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Are you sure?

513
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I can.

514
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I really admire you.

515
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I'm still your third master.

516
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

517
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
When is it?

518
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I didn't catch him.

519
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
He's a letter.

520
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And he's from Fourth Master.

521
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
What if he's wrong?

522
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
When will you

523
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
die from death?

524
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
You're still a young man.

525
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
What's the name of the letter?

526
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
It's from Maria.

527
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Pan Zi.

528
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Pan Zi.

529
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Pan Zi.

530
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Let's go.

531
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Let go of me.

532
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Let go of me.

533
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Third Master.

534
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Don't touch me.

535
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Let go of me.

536
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Let go of me.

537
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Let go of me.

538
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Third Master.

539
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
What's going on?

540
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Third Master.

541
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
What else?

542
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
You're so stupid.

543
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Fourth Master.

544
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
He's your soldier.

545
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I can't do anything.

546
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
You do it.

547
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Third Master.

548
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Who are you?

549
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I'm your disciple.

550
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I'm a disciple who's been

551
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
beaten to death

552
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
by three of you.

553
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Tell Third Master

554
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
to let me go.

555
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Let me go.

556
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Third Master.

557
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Third Master.

558
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
You bastard.

559
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Third Master.

560
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Pan Zi.

561
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Fourth Master is soft-hearted.

562
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Go and tell him the truth.

563
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Third Master.

564
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
This is not good for Third Master.

565
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Really?

566
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
No.

567
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Third Master.

568
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Go.

569
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Third Master.

570
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
What's wrong with your father?

571
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Your Highness.

572
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Your Highness.

573
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Your Highness.

574
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Your Highness.

575
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
What's the matter?

576
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
That knife man told me.

577
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Why?

578
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
He's not holding back

579
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
and saying he's the second father?

580
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
He told me everything.

581
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
He said the next trading period

582
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
will be tomorrow.

583
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Is the news reliable?

584
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
The number of trading is different.

585
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
As for the next trading period,

586
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
he doesn't know.

587
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
If you want to know,

588
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
you have to let him out first.

589
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
It's enough.

590
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
This knife man

591
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
can't make a joke again.

592
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Third Master.

593
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I asked you about the problem.

594
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Can you tell me the answer?

595
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Is my answer so important to you?

596
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Third Master.

597
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I feel like

598
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I've never met you before.

599
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
What else?

600
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I know.

601
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Many people have two faces.

602
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
One for themselves

603
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
and the other for outsiders.

604
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
But Third Master.

605
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Do you have

606
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
more than one face?

607
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Kid.

608
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I'm warning you.

609
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
If you think about it again,

610
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I'll kill you.

611
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Third Master.

612
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
You're avoiding the problem

613
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
because you're trying to save the family.

614
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Can't you be more sincere

615
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
to your nephew?

616
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
There are some things

617
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
that won't come to an end.

618
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I'll tell you when it does.

619
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Third Master.

620
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
We've come in.

621
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I've already chosen this matter.

622
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I can't get rid of the relationship.

623
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Why?

624
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
What are you hiding from me?

625
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Because you're the poison of the Wu Family.

626
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I don't want you to be involved in too many things.

627
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I hope you can be

628
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
a quiet person.

629
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Isn't that good?

630
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Third Master.

631
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
It's because I'm from the Wu Family.

632
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
So the Wu Family

633
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
has something to do with me.

634
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
And now that I've grown up,

635
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
even if I get involved in these things,

636
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I'll have my own principles.

637
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
But Third Master.

638
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
What's your principle?

639
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
What's your principle?

640
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I remember.

641
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
You brought a red-plated gold

642
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
with you.

643
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
It seems that you learned it from a scholar.

644
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Third Master.

645
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Aren't you still avoiding the problem?

646
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Fine.

647
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
What do you want to know?

648
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I'll tell you everything today.

649
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Ask.

650
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Start.

651
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Ask.

652
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Forget it.

653
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I...

654
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
don't want you to

655
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
just make up stories to fool me.

656
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Little thief.

657
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I really want to tell you.

658
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
But I said you don't believe me.

659
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
You asked me to

660
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
get a rope.

661
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
What for?

662
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
To kill Third Master.

663
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Third Master.

664
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I've heard that

665
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
this guy is a jie-sense.

666
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
He's been sending messages to the jie-sense.

667
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And he's got a certain kind of weapon.

668
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
He said that this guy is a jie-sense.

669
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
He's been in a daze.

670
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
He's got a lot of people.

671
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
He's with An Ning now.

672
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I think he's almost there.

673
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
He's already here.

674
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Their speed is faster than I thought.

675
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Yes.

676
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
He's here again.

677
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I'll go.

678
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Okay.

679
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Look.

680
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Look.

681
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Look.

682
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Wait.

683
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Third Master.

684
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Don't pull me.

685
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Third Master.

686
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Hold on.

687
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I can't get away.

688
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Third Master.

689
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Third Master.

690
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
What's wrong with the medicine?

691
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Look.

692
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
What's that?

693
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I'm going to kill you.

694
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I'm going to kill you.

695
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Third Master.

696
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Wu Xie.

697
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
You...

698
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Run.

699
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Run.

700
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Third Master.

701
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Third Master.

702
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Don't call me Third Master.

703
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Don't call me Third Master.

704
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Third Master.

705
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I'm afraid of the snake.

706
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Third Master.

707
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Wake up.

708
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I'm going to the Chongda Hall.

709
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Isn't Chong Zi a secret place?

710
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
We're going to get him out of the Hall.

711
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Bullshit.

712
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Look.

713
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Look.

714
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Is there a way?

715
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
No.

716
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Don't take this risk.

717
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Third Master.

718
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
We're in the Dianran City.

719
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
They're not here to heat up.

720
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
We're in the Dianran City.

721
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
We can't get away.

722
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
How can you talk nonsense?

723
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
When the bug-hunting people

724
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
are chasing the whole street,

725
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
it's not embarrassing.

726
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
What do you think we should do?

727
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
We should kill them.

728
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Kill them.

729
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Third Master.

730
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
What's wrong?

731
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Third Master.

732
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Are you okay?

733
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Don't be sad.

734
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
It's not my fault.

735
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Fifth Third Master.

736
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Fourth Master.

737
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
The situation is urgent.

738
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
We're in a hurry.

739
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
We're in a hurry.

740
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
We're in a hurry.

741
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Next time,

742
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
you have to see if there's anyone here.

743
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
In case you get hurt.

744
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Fourth Master.

745
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Do you think we can

746
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
take his equipment?

747
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Or...

748
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Forget it.

749
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Give it to me.

750
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I'll take it.

751
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
You take it.

752
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Slow down.

753
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Slow down.

754
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Why are you so cold?

755
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
