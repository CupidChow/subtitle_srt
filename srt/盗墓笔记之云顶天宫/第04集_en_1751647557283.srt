00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,880
Episode 28

2
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,200
We are on the bottom.

3
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,800
I feel almost suffocated.

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We should be there soon.

5
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,640
I'm afraid of heat.

6
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,840
There's a black hole ahead.

7
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,840
Elder Huaxiong told me about the danger.

8
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,840
I told you guys.

9
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,840
We must be careful when we go in.

10
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,340
Be careful.

11
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,840
Especially you.

12
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,840
Don't touch things you shouldn't touch.

13
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,840
No, Tianzhen.

14
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,180
You're hurting my feelings.

15
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,180
I...

16
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,180
You're that kind of person.

17
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,180
No, Brother, you tell me.

18
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,180
Am I that kind of person?

19
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,180
Brother.

20
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,180
Look, Brother is angry.

21
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,180
It's all because of you.

22
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,180
Stop talking nonsense.

23
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,180
Just go.

24
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,180
I...

25
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,180
No, I...

26
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,180
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,180
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,180
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,180
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,180
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,180
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,180
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,180
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,180
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,180
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,180
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,180
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,180
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,180
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,520
It's fine.

41
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,520
If that's so...

42
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,520
Come on.

43
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,520
Don't you know we've become the first one who has been caught from this.

44
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,180
Go and look for the security guards.

45
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,020
Wait.

46
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,180
Fire!

47
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,480
It's so real.

48
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,480
I have a feeling that this place is unusual.

49
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,480
The closer you get, the more painful it gets.

50
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,480
We must hurry and find it.

51
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,480
Otherwise, there will be danger.

52
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,480
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

53
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,480
It's okay.

54
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,480
As long as there are seven fairies, it's fine.

55
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,480
This must be a underground mine with a magnet.

56
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,480
The closer we get, the more people's impression will be.

57
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,480
Later, we'll try not to touch the east wall here.

58
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,480
It's okay.

59
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,480
I'll lead the way.

60
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,480
Seven fairies, I'm coming.

61
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,480
Hey!

62
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,480
Thank you, everyone.

63
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,480
I think I'm dizzy.

64
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,480
Everyone, be careful.

65
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,480
Don't look at the east wall.

66
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,480
We can't recover for long.

67
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,480
We have to climb like the elders.

68
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,480
Then we can move forward.

69
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,480
I'm hallucinating.

70
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,480
Xiao Ge has a phone.

71
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,480
Xiao Ge,

72
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,480
scan the code and add a WeChat.

73
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,480
I don't have a WeChat.

74
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,480
Xiao Ge,

75
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,480
then leave me a phone number.

76
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,480
I have yours.

77
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,480
Everyone, pay attention.

78
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,480
Think about our goal.

79
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,480
Yes.

80
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,480
Seven fairies, let's go.

81
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,480
Let's go.

82
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,480
Come on.

83
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,480
Oh!

84
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,480
Oh!

85
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,480
Oh!

86
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,480
This is too hard to find.

87
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,480
We've climbed for a long time.

88
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,480
I feel like

89
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,480
we've been around a few times.

90
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,480
I can't feel

91
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,480
where the line of the east wall is.

92
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,480
Where is it?

93
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,480
I'm going crazy

94
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,480
around this second needle.

95
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,480
Is it a hallucination?

96
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,480
I have to kneel.

97
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,480
Nonsense.

98
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,480
It's because

99
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,480
the magnetic field here

100
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,480
is already strong to a certain extent.

101
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,480
The time and gravity

102
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,480
are already twisted to a certain extent.

103
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,480
How about

104
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,480
we go back first?

105
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,480
It's not a good idea

106
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,480
to find such a blind place.

107
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,480
Next time,

108
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,480
we'll choose a direction

109
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,480
by ourselves.

110
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,480
We'll keep looking.

111
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,480
We can find it.

112
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,480
Tianzhen, can this hole

113
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,480
change at will?

114
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,480
It can get bigger or smaller.

115
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,480
How many holes have we turned?

116
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,480
I think I've been through 18 holes.

117
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,480
We don't have the ability to sense it.

118
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,480
I don't know either.

119
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,480
The most horrible thing is

120
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,480
we've been climbing for so long.

121
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,480
Do you feel hungry?

122
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,480
Yes.

123
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,480
I'm full.

124
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,480
Or else,

125
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,480
let's go back.

126
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,480
I can't take it anymore.

127
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,480
I'm too heavy. Let's go.

128
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,480
It's really been two hours.

129
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,480
I feel like we've been here

130
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,480
for a long time.

131
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,480
It's really

132
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,480
recovered.

133
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,480
It's been so little time.

134
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,480
It's gone.

135
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,480
No.

136
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,480
I really don't believe it.

137
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,480
I'm so tired.

138
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,480
I'm going to sleep.

139
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,480
I'm going to sleep.

140
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,480
I'm going to sleep.

141
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,480
Good night.

142
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,480
Good night.

143
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,480
Fatty, don't sleep.

144
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
I want to vomit.

145
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,480
You...

146
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,480
I want to vomit.

147
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,480
I want to vomit.

148
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,480
Let's stop.

149
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,480
Don't waste your energy

150
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,480
on this.

151
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,480
Little guy, do you have any other ways?

152
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,480
For example,

153
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,480
blow up this hole.

154
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,480
I've tried the black crystal.

155
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,480
The black crystal is very hard.

156
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,480
Then we have to

157
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,480
lie down like this?

158
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,480
I feel like

159
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,480
we've been here

160
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,480
for a month.

161
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,480
We've been lost for a long time.

162
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,480
We'll really get lost here.

163
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,480
What?

164
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,480
What are you two doing on the ground?

165
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,480
I've been climbing.

166
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,480
Wu Xie, follow me.

167
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,480
I'm coming in.

168
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,480
So this is how you get out.

169
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,480
I've got the power.

170
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,480
Look.

171
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,480
What is this?

172
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,480
Don't follow...

173
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,480
The magic of qin.

174
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,480
Okay.

175
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,480
This is the magic of Elder Kuaxiong's last life.

176
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,480
I don't know why,

177
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,480
the closer I get to him,

178
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,480
the more painful I feel.

179
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,480
The qin tree's qin

180
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,480
has a lot of radioactive substances.

181
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,480
So this is why

182
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,480
it has the magic of bewitching people.

183
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,480
It bewitches you.

184
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,480
The same goes for the qin tree's magic.

185
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,480
So when Elder Kuaxiong

186
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,480
took it as his priest,

187
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,480
everyone bowed down

188
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,480
and saw the magic.

189
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,480
And in the cave,

190
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,480
all our illusions

191
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,480
and the lost sense

192
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,480
were influenced by it.

193
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,480
And on the wall of the cave,

194
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,480
the high-precision black crystal

195
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,480
formed a light reflection.

196
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,480
It had a big impact on us.

197
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,480
Look at that.

198
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
Fatty.

199
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,480
I told you not to...

200
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,480
What is this?

201
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,480
Salt.

202
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,480
It's indeed a hallucination.

203
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,480
I feel like I'm in a real place.

204
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,480
Fatty,

205
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,480
you've got the mechanism.

206
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,480
I told you not to take those things.

207
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,480
This is the mechanism

208
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,480
I set up in the sea.

209
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,480
Let's go.

210
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,480
It's only been half an hour.

211
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,480
Hurry.

212
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,480
Hurry.

213
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,480
Hurry.

214
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,480
Hurry.

215
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,480
Brother.

216
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,480
Isn't he in front of us?

217
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,480
Where did he go?

218
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,480
Brother.

219
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,480
Why did he leave

220
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,480
in the dark?

221
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,480
He must have his own

222
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,480
secret.

223
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
Yes, yes, yes.

224
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,480
He has a phone problem.

225
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,480
Call him.

226
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,480
I'll go.

227
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,480
It's going to be a scam.

228
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,480
I know.

229
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,480
What's the point of giving it to the country?

230
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,480
The words on it

231
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,480
probably mean

232
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,480
Snow Mountain.

233
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,480
Snow Mountain.

234
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,480
Where is the Holy Land?

235
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,480
There's no Snow Mountain in the west.

236
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,480
Snow Mountain in Kunlun.

237
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,480
Snow Mountain.

238
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,480
What does it have to do

239
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,480
with the Snow Mountain in Yunding?

240
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,480
It's okay.

241
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,480
This is a place

242
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,480
where culture is originated.

243
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,480
Right?

244
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,480
That's the origin of Chinese mythology.

245
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,480
Yes, yes, yes. You know.

246
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,480
Okay.

247
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,480
Come.

248
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,480
Fatty.

249
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,480
Look.

250
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,480
Is the glow in the wali

251
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,480
a piece of egg?

252
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,480
I know.

253
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,480
This is a piece of bomb

254
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,480
from the K-80 series.

255
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,480
It's an airplane bomb.

256
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,480
You said it was an American bomb.

257
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,480
Are you crazy?

258
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,480
It was a common airplane bomb.

259
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,480
Although they export it to

260
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,480
different countries,

261
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,480
it's a waste.

262
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,480
It wasn't an earthquake.

263
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,480
What do you mean?

264
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,480
It was caused by humans.

265
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,480
They targeted here.

266
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,480
We have to go back and tell the villagers.

267
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,480
Oh my god.

268
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
What's wrong?

269
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,480
What should we do?

270
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,480
Let's go.

271
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,480
Over there.

272
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,480
Wait.

273
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,480
It's too late. Let's go.

274
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,480
Hurry.

275
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,480
Hurry.

276
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,480
Stop.

277
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,480
Don't run.

278
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,480
Don't.

279
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,480
It's a misunderstanding.

280
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,480
Don't.

281
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,480
What's wrong?

282
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,480
I didn't hurt Kun Da.

283
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,480
What's wrong?

284
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,480
Tell me.

285
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,480
I don't want to

286
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,480
have an accident.

287
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,480
Your girlfriend?

288
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,480
Ning?

289
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,480
What's going on?

290
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,480
Give us one.

291
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,480
What do you want?

292
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,480
We want one too.

293
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,480
Give us five.

294
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,480
Run.

295
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,480
Run.

296
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,480
Run.

297
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,480
No.

298
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,480
No.

299
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,480
This is for you.

300
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,480
What's that look?

301
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,480
I just didn't think you would

302
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,480
return it to me.

303
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,480
Thank you.

304
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,480
What did you say?

305
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,480
Nothing.

306
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,480
You returned everything to me.

307
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,480
I'll treat you to a meal.

308
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,480
I just saved your life.

309
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,480
You should treat me to a meal.

310
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,480
You're not leaving?

311
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,480
If you stay, I won't cook.

312
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,480
I can only treat you to instant noodles.

313
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,480
Okay.

314
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,480
Okay.

315
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,480
Sir.

316
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,480
Ning,

317
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,480
looks like your trick

318
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,480
didn't work on Wu Xie.

319
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,480
Now let me do the honor.

320
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,480
Hello, Wu Xie.

321
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,480
I'm happy to see you are back

322
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,480
safely.

323
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,480
Are you kidding me?

324
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,480
Wu Xie, I really

325
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,480
want to be honest with you today.

326
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,480
Wu San Xing is not worth my trust anymore.

327
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
All these years,

328
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,480
my cooperation with him

329
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,480
has been very difficult.

330
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,480
He not only cooperates with me,

331
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,480
but also with others.

332
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,480
He can betray his friends,

333
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,480
and also betray his family.

334
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,480
Stop.

335
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,480
Don't say that.

336
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,480
You just want me to deal with Wu San Xing.

337
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,480
But I'm not interested in what you guys are doing now.

338
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,480
I'm not interested in him either.

339
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,480
You can do whatever you want.

340
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,480
Your attitude

341
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,480
surprised me.

342
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,480
We've been fighting for so many years.

343
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,480
You've helped me a lot.

344
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,480
I'm grateful to you.

345
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,480
That's why I asked Ning

346
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,480
to save you.

347
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,480
This time is different from the past.

348
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,480
Your uncle San Xing has been in trouble.

349
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,480
He needs you more than ever.

350
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,480
He doesn't want you

351
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,480
to get involved in our business.

352
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,480
But this time is different.

353
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,480
You...

354
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,480
He will invite you to go to the Cloud Sky Palace.

355
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,480
But he can hurt you once.

356
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,480
He won't hurt you again.

357
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,480
If you cooperate with us,

358
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,480
at least you can be sure

359
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,480
that he won't abandon you.

360
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,480
Don't refuse him.

361
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,480
Think about it carefully.

362
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,480
I'll be waiting for your answer.

363
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,480
You can go now.

364
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,480
No, I...

365
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,480
Do you think it's time to explain?

366
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,480
I'm leaving.

367
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,480
I'm not eating take-out.

368
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,480
I heard it.

369
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,480
You don't believe them, do you?

370
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,480
I'm stupid.

371
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,480
Your girlfriend will be angry.

372
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,480
Hello?

373
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,480
What are you doing, little boy?

374
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,480
Come here.

375
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,480
Who?

376
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,480
Where are you?

377
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,480
Where else can I be?

378
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,480
Come here, come to Xingxing House.

379
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,480
What did he say?

380
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,480
What are you doing?

381
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,480
Go to Xingxing House.

382
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,480
Now?

383
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,480
Let's go.

384
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,480
Master Hua, the signal was not working

385
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,480
since we arrived at Qiu De Gou's camp yesterday.

386
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:31,020
Sorry for not hoping in a veryд 1 month ago, Lmeri Top9 player who also played just before signing for this year's player competition.

387
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,480
I know you hate me.

388
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,480
Tell me, what's the matter?

389
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,480
I don't have much money.

390
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,480
My nephew, in Guizhou...

391
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,480
Don't mention Guizhou.

392
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,480
If I were you, I would never mention Guizhou.

393
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,480
You don't care about me anymore, do you?

394
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,480
What's wrong?

395
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,480
What else do you need from me?

396
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,480
How can you talk to your uncle?

397
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,480
Wu Xie, you're an adult.

398
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,480
Don't be a child.

399
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,480
Wu Xie, don't be a child.

400
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,480
Look, the boy.

401
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,480
He got it a few days ago.

402
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,480
How delicate.

403
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,480
I was wondering,

404
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,480
such a delicate thing is ruined by someone else.

405
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,480
Who?

406
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,480
My nephew.

407
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,480
Here, don't be shy.

408
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,480
Don't be shy.

409
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,480
My nephew,

410
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,480
about the Zhang Junfa,

411
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,480
I told you not to mention it.

412
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,480
It's too innocent.

413
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,480
Wu Xie.

414
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,480
Uncle San,

415
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,480
actually, I'm happy that you asked me to come.

416
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,480
I thought,

417
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,480
no matter what, you have to tell me something.

418
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,480
Even if it's something you made up,

419
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,480
you have to tell me the truth.

420
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,480
Actually, I thought I was brought up by you.

421
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,480
I know you best.

422
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,480
Yes, although I have to tell you the truth,

423
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,480
I'm not a child.

424
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,480
Yes, although you lie to me about trivial things,

425
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,480
I believe you.

426
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,480
I believe those strangers.

427
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,480
At least you won't hurt me.

428
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,480
But I was wrong.

429
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,480
My nephew,

430
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,480
I'm sorry for some things in the study.

431
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,480
Just scold me a little bit.

432
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,480
Just get angry.

433
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,480
Uncle San,

434
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,480
you said you know me best.

435
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,480
You know I hate the tricks of fake Yanping.

436
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,480
You even use such Yanping to fool me.

437
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,480
What do you want to do?

438
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,480
I'm just kidding.

439
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,480
I want to see your real skills.

440
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,480
Or I'll give you the heirloom.

441
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,480
I'll leave it to you.

442
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,480
Look.

443
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,480
This is real.

444
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,480
Look.

445
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,480
Where did you get it?

446
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,480
I used a few ancient tombstones

447
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,480
to exchange it for the Qiu De Kao.

448
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,480
You suddenly become a psycho

449
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,480
or the Qiu De Kao became a fool?

450
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,480
What are you talking about?

451
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,480
The Qiu De Kao is a fake.

452
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,480
He never does business with the real money.

453
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,480
That's just your deal.

454
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,480
There's something I don't know.

455
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,480
Don't be too stubborn.

456
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,480
It's not good.

457
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,480
Uncle San.

458
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,480
There's been a lot of things

459
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,480
that happened to me recently.

460
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,480
I spent a lot of time looking for you.

461
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,480
I wanted to know where you were.

462
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,480
I wanted to know what you were doing.

463
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,480
But I couldn't find the answer.

464
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,480
You're always my uncle.

465
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,480
Am I still your nephew?

466
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,480
Of course you're my nephew.

467
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,480
You're my nephew.

468
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,480
Why don't you give me the heirloom?

469
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,480
I'll give it to you.

470
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,480
Don't worry.

471
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,480
You called me here

472
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,480
just to give me the Uncle Zhang Guo.

473
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,480
Just to give you the Uncle Zhang Guo.

474
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,480
Then you're not afraid

475
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,480
that I'll find out what tomb I'm going to.

476
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,480
I'm not done yet.

477
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,480
I told you.

478
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,480
You're my nephew.

479
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,480
My nephew.

480
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,480
It's not over yet.

481
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,480
Besides,

482
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,480
the water is so deep

483
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,480
and it's dangerous.

484
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,480
I'm afraid you'll get into trouble because I love you.

485
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,480
Now that you're grown up,

486
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,480
you don't listen to me.

487
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,480
Fine.

488
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,480
You're idle.

489
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,480
What?

490
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,480
Help me?

491
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,480
You want me to help you?

492
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,480
You're still a soldier.

493
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,480
Kid, I'm telling you.

494
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,480
You need to cherish something.

495
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,480
You and your uncle go to the Cloud Sky Palace.

496
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,480
You can rest assured in Uncle Zhang Guo's heart.

497
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,480
Don't want to help Uncle Zhang Guo?

498
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,480
Fine.

499
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,480
Uncle Zhang Guo,

500
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,480
if you want me to go,

501
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,480
I'll go.

502
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,480
Let's go.

503
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,480
Fatty.

504
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,480
Fatty.

505
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,480
You want me to help you?

506
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,480
You're still a soldier.

507
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,480
Kid, I'm telling you.

508
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,480
You need to cherish something.

509
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,480
You and your uncle go to the Cloud Sky Palace.

510
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,480
You can rest assured in Uncle Zhang Guo's heart.

511
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,480
Uncle Zhang Guo.

512
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,480
Uncle Zhang Guo.

513
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,480
It's ready.

514
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,480
Try it.

515
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,480
This wine is soft.

516
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,480
It's very refreshing.

517
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,480
It's like seeing a person.

518
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,480
It's a new product.

519
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,480
Try it.

520
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,480
Uncle Zhang Guo,

521
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,480
you asked me to come today

522
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,480
just for the sake of wine, right?

523
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,480
Yuchen,

524
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,480
I asked you to come to ask you for a favor.

525
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,480
Can you lend me your copper fish?

526
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,480
I know.

527
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,480
It has a great relationship with the Cloud Sky Palace.

528
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,480
You're old.

529
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,480
The copper fish is in my hand.

530
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,480
You're a little bit more mature.

531
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,480
How is it?

532
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,480
Uncle Zhang Guo,

533
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,480
I should teach you like this.

534
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,480
Yes.

535
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,480
I'm teaching you this time

536
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,480
for Wu Xie's sake.

537
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,480
I hope we don't break our relationship.

538
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,480
Don't mention this

539
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,480
in the end.

540
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,480
I know who you're working with.

541
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,480
I also know how true

542
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,480
and false your words were.

543
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,480
It's strange.

544
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,480
We're all cousins.

545
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,480
You and my uncle

546
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,480
have different personalities.

547
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,480
Why are you so different?

548
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,480
Your tone

549
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,480
sounds like a man of two words.

550
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,480
What do you mean?

551
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,480
You're so young.

552
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,480
If your father knew

553
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,480
you were so successful,

554
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,480
you still couldn't trust your uncle.

555
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,480
How could I trust you?

556
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,480
You thief.

557
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,480
You're so mean.

558
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,480
I'm very sad.

559
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,480
Master Hua, the old house is broken.

560
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,480
The security officer has agreed to disappear.

561
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,480
They're trapped by Wu San Xing.

562
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,480
Master Hua, the surveillance cameras have been transferred.

563
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,480
It's been transferred to your computer.

564
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,480
The footage taken by the security camera

565
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,480
in the study corridor 2

566
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,480
is the mysterious A-S.

567
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,480
The security camera

568
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,480
is in the study corridor 2.

569
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,480
The security camera

570
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,480
is in the study corridor 2.

571
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,480
The security camera

572
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,480
is in the study corridor 2.

573
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,480
The security camera

574
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,480
is in the study corridor 2.

575
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,480
The security camera

576
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,480
is in the study corridor 2.

577
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,480
The security camera

578
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,480
is in the study corridor 2.

579
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,480
The security camera

580
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,480
is in the study corridor 2.

581
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,480
The security camera

582
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,480
is in the study corridor 2.

583
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,480
Wu Shi speaks on the phone.

584
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,480
Master Hua asks him

585
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,480
if he can help Wu concerning his thin brother's nature program.

586
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,480
Wu silly,

587
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,480
can you help me now?

588
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,480
I feel think about what to do,

589
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,480
which is the right one and the right one.

590
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,640
Along with the assistance from uncle

591
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,640
no two went to the wrong place.

592
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,480
Wu Shi sent him a to-do list.

593
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,480
He built up a very long list,

594
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,480
which may involve years of FT,

595
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,480
so medios may help him.

596
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,480
He asked me to go to the Sky Palace with him.

597
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,480
You agreed?

598
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,480
No matter what, he's my third uncle.

599
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,480
Wu Xie, if you need me, I can go with you.

600
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,480
It has nothing to do with you.

601
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,480
Okay.

602
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,480
Since you've decided, I support you.

603
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,480
But it's too dangerous for you to go alone.

604
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,480
I'm worried that you'll be in danger.

605
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,480
How about this?

606
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,480
I'll ask Jia Sha to give you a tracker.

607
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,480
You can wear it.

608
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,480
If there's any danger, I'll find you as soon as possible.

609
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,480
Thank you.

610
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,480
Really.

611
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,480
Wu Xie, let's talk.

612
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,480
There's nothing to talk about.

613
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,480
I have something important to do today.

614
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,480
This is very important to you.

615
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,480
I'm sorry.

616
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,480
I'm sorry.

617
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,480
I'm sorry.

618
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,480
I'm sorry.

619
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,480
I'm sorry.

620
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,480
I'm sorry.

621
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,480
I'm sorry.

622
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,480
I'm sorry.

623
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,480
I'm sorry.

624
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,480
What's wrong?

625
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,480
What's the matter?

626
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,480
Wu Xie, don't misunderstand.

627
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,480
I gave you this because I don't believe in Jason.

628
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,480
I don't want to see what happened in the tomb happen again.

629
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,480
Through this, we can communicate with each other.

630
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,480
For example, I can tell you in time what Jason did.

631
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,480
Here.

632
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,480
Here you can shoot a video and then send it in time.

633
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,480
You can take a video of what happened inside the Sky Palace.

634
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,480
If you don't want to take a video, I can't help it.

635
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,480
But in fact, we can't hurt you at all.

636
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,480
Because you've always been on guard against us.

637
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,480
But those you've always believed in,

638
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,480
may not be so reliable.

639
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,480
How can you go to guard against them hurting you?

640
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,480
It's not a bad thing to leave a way for yourself.

641
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,480
I'm sorry.

642
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,480
So you're so good-mouthed.

643
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,480
If you think I'm right,

644
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,480
that's because you've thought about it for a long time.

645
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,480
But you dare not admit it.

646
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,480
You agree with my opinion?

647
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,480
I'll think about it.

648
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,480
Believe it or not,

649
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,480
I'm not here because Mr. Koudelka asked me to.

650
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,480
I'm here on behalf of my opinion.

651
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,480
I hope you can understand.

652
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,480
I understand.

653
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,480
I'm leaving.

654
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,480
I'm leaving.

655
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,480
Come on, eat something.

656
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,480
Drink some water.

657
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,480
Why are you looking at me?

658
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,480
What are you doing?

659
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,480
Thank you.

660
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,480
Why are you thanking me?

661
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,480
You followed me without saying anything

662
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,480
when I said I was coming to Cloud Sky Palace.

663
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,480
Isn't it normal?

664
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,480
What if I come here and there's something good?

665
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,480
Okay, okay, let's be serious.

666
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,480
How can you be so sure that Cloud Sky Palace is on Mount Changbai?

667
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,480
Your third uncle told you?

668
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,480
Third uncle has his purpose.

669
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,480
I don't know what it is.

670
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,480
But I've found this when I went back to Beijing.

671
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,480
There's always a painting on my grandpa's notebook.

672
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,480
Because there's no explanation,

673
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,480
I don't know what he's drawing.

674
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,480
Then I found it by accident.

675
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,480
Isn't this Longmai?

676
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,480
Through the night, through the five meters

677
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,480
I got an answer in the darkness

678
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:41,640
The
