Episode 2

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Grandpa Si just moved.

4
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Grandpa Si.

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Grandpa Si.

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let go of me!

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let go of him!

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Grandpa Si!

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Let go of me!

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Let go of him!

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Let go of me!

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's wet! It's wet!

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Get me a black donkey!

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's wet!

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Get me a donkey!

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Get me a donkey!

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Grandpa Si!

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I got the donkey!

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Get out of here!

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Get out of here!

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Grandpa Si!

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't go over there!

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
If you make a sound, you'll cough!

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You fatso!

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Grandpa Si!

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Grandpa Si!

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's okay!

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's great!

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Grandpa Si!

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Okay, okay.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Don't worry.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm not an easy old man to kill.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's great, Grandpa Si!

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You're okay, Grandpa Si!

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That's great!

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's great!

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What are you looking for, fatso?

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I didn't see the old handsome guy.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Grandpa Si.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Are you feeling better now?

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
He closed his eyes again.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
He has to die.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
He's dead again.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Look, look, look.

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Look.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Grandpa Si.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Listen to me.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You should go out and rest.

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The environment here is really awful.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm afraid you can't handle it.

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What did he say?

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Wu Xie.

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Xiao Ge.

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Why are you here?

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
How normal!

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Stop talking.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Go.

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Where are the others?

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Go.

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll leave him to you.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'll go down first.

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Let's wait for Uncle San.

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Your uncle left us a signal.

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
They should have gone down first.

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Be careful.

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Follow me.

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Grandpa Si.

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Be careful.

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Go.

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Go.

72
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Go.

73
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Is bobby a rock?

74
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The даже difícil

75
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The Peregrine's fifth bow couldn't break through the river.

76
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That's impossible!

77
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That was impossible.

78
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That was impossible.

79
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What aCong deadline!

80
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
whites?

81
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
thought that my brother-in-law looked like a man.

82
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Brother-in-law.

83
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
by which time he would be here?

84
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
repository

85
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's so windy.

86
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Can we still get through?

87
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
This path must have been used to make use of the natural Fireshore Fountain.

88
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
This Fireshore Fountain is very common in the rock layers of the Fireshore.

89
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's very wide and can reach up to a few thousand kilometers.

90
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's like a spider web, it's tightly embedded in the ground.

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I think this rock hole can definitely go all the way to San Sheng Mountain.

92
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That way, the workers can dig all the way from San Sheng Mountain to here.

93
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
If we go down and it gets narrower and narrower,

94
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I think I'll be strong enough.

95
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
This geological structure is usually made of branches.

96
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
If you go not too far, you can reach a bigger gap.

97
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
This is called a underground corridor in geological science.

98
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
This underground corridor is very large.

99
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Some can even create their own ecosystem.

100
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So I think if you go not too far, you can reach a bigger gap.

101
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Because the destruction of this geological structure usually starts from the inside.

102
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Then, if it gets narrower and narrower,

103
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'll be stuck inside and die.

104
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The people inside haven't returned yet.

105
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What are you afraid of? Let's go.

106
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You're right.

107
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The geological structure is very large.

108
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's very narrow.

109
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's very narrow.

110
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's very narrow.

111
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's very narrow.

112
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's very narrow.

113
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's very narrow.

114
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's very narrow.

115
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's very narrow.

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's very narrow.

117
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's very narrow.

118
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's very narrow.

119
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's very narrow.

120
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's very narrow.

121
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's very narrow.

122
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's very narrow.

123
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's very narrow.

124
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's very narrow.

125
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's very narrow.

126
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's very narrow.

127
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's very narrow.

128
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's very narrow.

129
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's very narrow.

130
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's very narrow.

131
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's very narrow.

132
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's very narrow.

133
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's very narrow.

134
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's very narrow.

135
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's very narrow.

136
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's very narrow.

137
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's very narrow.

138
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's very narrow.

139
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's very narrow.

140
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's very narrow.

141
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's very narrow.

142
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's very narrow.

143
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's very narrow.

144
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's very narrow.

145
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's very narrow.

146
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's very narrow.

147
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's very narrow.

148
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's very narrow.

149
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's very narrow.

150
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's very narrow.

151
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's very narrow.

152
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's very narrow.

153
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's very narrow.

154
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's very narrow.

155
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's very narrow.

156
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's very narrow.

157
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's very narrow.

158
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's very narrow.

159
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's very narrow.

160
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's very narrow.

161
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's very narrow.

162
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's very narrow.

163
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Let's go.

164
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
No.

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
We are in the insect cave.

166
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
The creatures on the snow mountain are usually concentrated in the hot springs.

167
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So don't think about going down to the hot springs when you see them.

168
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Some hot springs are even yellow.

169
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But the temperature is still low.

170
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
They are all dead.

171
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
They won't wake up without strong stimulation.

172
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Let's go.

173
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Wait.

174
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What do you mean by strong stimulation?

175
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Don't talk.

176
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The water is boiling.

177
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Turn off the power.

178
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Let's go.

179
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Pan Zi.

180
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Pan Zi, look at that.

181
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Is it bigger than the one we met last time?

182
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
This one is bigger than the one we met last time.

183
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Don't make a sound.

184
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
How come a strong insect's head is so big?

185
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
This insect is considered as a supernatural monster.

186
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Because they can live for a long time.

187
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And when it dies,

188
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
its body will attract a lot of kind.

189
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Be careful when we leave.

190
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Don't step on them.

191
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Oh my god. The insect's protective color is too strong.

192
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
If we don't turn off the flashlight,

193
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
we can't see anything.

194
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
When you step on it, you will have a bunch of them.

195
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That feeling...

196
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Stop talking.

197
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
If you really attract a bunch of insects, what will happen?

198
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Let's go.

199
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Let's go.

200
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Let's go.

201
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Let's go.

202
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Fatty.

203
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I will come early tomorrow.

204
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You don't need to search.

205
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Zhe Ying is always on my team.

206
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
He should be okay.

207
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,400
He can't be the only one, you know?

208
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,200
Xiao Ge.

209
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,600
Did someone else come in before us?

210
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,600
Jason and his team.

211
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,800
And An Ning.

212
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,000
Two people.

213
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,800
They're fast.

214
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,000
But the problem is,

215
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,400
did they follow us?

216
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,600
What happened?

217
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,400
What happened?

218
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,000
I knew Lang Feng was secretly transferring the message.

219
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,400
But I didn't have any evidence, so I didn't tell him.

220
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Then...

221
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,600
Then my third uncle came forward.

222
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,800
He told Jason all our location.

223
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Third uncle killed Lang Feng?

224
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,600
Third uncle's trick.

225
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
What do you mean?

226
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,000
Was my third uncle like that before?

227
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,000
You really don't know your third uncle.

228
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,400
Do you know why people call him third uncle?

229
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,400
You think he's the son of the dog master,

230
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,400
Dao Er Dai?

231
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,000
Back then, Zhang Dahe,

232
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,000
Er Yue Hong, Ban Jie Tie, Shang San Wen, and Duo Wei Fong.

233
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,000
But after they passed away,

234
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,200
what did their descendants come up with?

235
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Except your third uncle, there was no one.

236
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,200
Only Third Uncle came out.

237
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,200
Why?

238
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,400
Because of his tricks.

239
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
But you think you came out to be seen,

240
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
and everyone was so harsh on you,

241
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,600
why did you come out?

242
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,400
Because I'm high-quality, I know how to be polite.

243
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,000
I think my third uncle is not like my old third uncle anymore.

244
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,200
What are you talking about?

245
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,600
Your third uncle is not like your third uncle,

246
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
he can be your second uncle.

247
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,200
Do you have a second uncle?

248
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,200
This scar is bigger than what I remember.

249
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,200
You little kid, what do you know?

250
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,800
Go to sleep.

251
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,200
Go to sleep.

252
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,800
Master Hua,

253
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,800
this is the file that was just collected from their base.

254
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,400
And now there is a batch of cultural relics

255
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,800
that are staying at the Macao dock.

256
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,400
They are going on a ship of the Huo family.

257
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,800
It seems that this time,

258
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,600
we are going to make a lake.

259
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,200
It's all true.

260
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,000
Thank you.

261
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,200
Master Hua,

262
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,000
those people are all controlled.

263
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,600
Send people to search everywhere.

264
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,400
We must find out their hiding place.

265
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,200
We can't let them get away with it.

266
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,400
Xiao Xiao,

267
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,000
later, I will go to the dock as a dog.

268
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,200
You must not come out.

269
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,200
And don't let the buyer see you.

270
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And then,

271
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,000
I will go to the dock as a dog.

272
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,800
Xiao Xiao,

273
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,400
it's not that I don't want to take you,

274
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,000
but because you are a man,

275
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,600
there are too many holes.

276
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,800
Moreover,

277
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,400
such a dangerous thing,

278
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,400
how can I let you go?

279
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,600
Xiao Hua,

280
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,000
this time, I shouldn't be so willful

281
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,600
to let you take me with you.

282
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,000
Stop thinking nonsense.

283
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,200
I know you are because of Grandma Huo.

284
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
And,

285
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,800
I know that you are not going to let me go.

286
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,800
I know that you are not going to let me go.

287
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,800
I know that you are not going to let me go.

288
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
And,

289
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,200
even if you don't say it,

290
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,800
I will take you with me.

291
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,800
Hua,

292
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
it's almost time.

293
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,200
How about this?

294
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,000
After this thing is over,

295
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,400
I will take you to San Lan Xin.

296
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,400
Let's go.

297
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,800
Let's go.

298
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,400
Master Hua.

299
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,800
Brother Dao,

300
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,400
their people have arrived.

301
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,800
Your skills are getting more and more familiar.

302
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,800
Brother Dao,

303
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
what are you doing?

304
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,200
Learning to pee.

305
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,400
Hurry up and come back.

306
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,600
We have to go through the smoke before it gets dark.

307
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,800
I know.

308
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,800
San Lan Xin

309
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,200
Master San,

310
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,000
your street is too secretive.

311
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,000
If I didn't follow your signs,

312
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,800
I wouldn't be able to find Xiao Jian's head.

313
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,000
Now, let me tell you our team.

314
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You...

315
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,800
What?

316
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,600
No, this...

317
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,000
This is the public toilet.

318
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,600
Everyone is here to pee.

319
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
Hurry up and pee.

320
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Why are you here?

321
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,200
How do you know that San Chu is here?

322
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,000
I don't know.

323
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,400
How did he...

324
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,000
Enough, don't make things up.

325
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,800
You go back first.

326
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,200
Let's talk for a while.

327
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,000
Why is he still running away from me?

328
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That...

329
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,000
It's good that you've talked.

330
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
You asked him to bring me here?

331
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,000
He even graduated from your school?

332
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,600
You two are quite happy.

333
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,400
He graduated from school, isn't that...

334
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,400
He's a second-year student.

335
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,600
I know he's a second-year student.

336
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,800
Third Uncle is suspicious of some people and things.

337
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'll have Fatty ask him in secret.

338
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Third Uncle,

339
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,400
you're serious.

340
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,000
Why are you here?

341
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm going to meet Fatty.

342
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,800
You can't get through this, right?

343
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Okay, Third Uncle.

344
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
Let's make everything clear here.

345
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,200
Impudence.

346
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,800
What is this place?

347
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
What is this place?

348
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,200
Are you making fun of me?

349
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Go back now.

350
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,200
Don't let anyone suspect you.

351
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,800
Third Uncle,

352
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,200
why did you leave us all behind and come down here?

353
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,800
That's because of some things.

354
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,600
You have to act first and not lose anything.

355
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,800
Understand, kid?

356
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,200
What's in the Cloud Sky Palace?

357
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,400
Where is the Jiu Long Taishi Pass of King Wan Nu?

358
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,800
What does King Wan Nu have to do with Wang Zang Hai?

359
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Good friend.

360
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Don't be so serious.

361
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,000
Just an emperor

362
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,200
asking a feng shui master to build a forest for himself.

363
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
It's a mutual relationship.

364
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,600
You're wrong.

365
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,400
Did the snake and the fish stay with Wang Zang Hai?

366
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,600
You have to ask Wang Zang Hai about this.

367
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,800
Wang Zang Hai left so many clues in the ancient tombs of the places.

368
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,400
What does he want to say?

369
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,400
You have to ask him about this.

370
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
How would I know?

371
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,000
You won't tell me even if you know.

372
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,000
You won't tell me even if you know.

373
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,800
Junior, junior.

374
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,600
My eldest nephew,

375
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,200
you must not be alone in the future.

376
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,800
In this kind of environment,

377
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,600
being alone means suicide.

378
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,000
You have Fatty and Little Brother by your side.

379
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,400
Oh, right.

380
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,000
And Pan Zi is protecting you.

381
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,400
I'm relieved about that.

382
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,800
You left Pan Zi among us.

383
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,200
What's the point?

384
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,800
That's all I have to say.

385
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,400
Go back.

386
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,000
See you at the Cloud Sky Palace.

387
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,800
You're not my third uncle!

388
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,600
What's wrong with you?

389
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,000
I don't have time to coax you.

390
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:22,800
Go back.

391
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,200
See you at the Cloud Sky Palace.

392
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,600
The scar on my third uncle's head

393
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,400
has been healed long ago.

394
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,800
Not to mention that I can't touch it.

395
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,400
I can't even see it clearly.

396
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,800
What's wrong with you?

397
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,400
You brat.

398
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,200
Put down your gun.

399
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,800
Tell me where the gun came from.

400
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,800
Leave me alone!

401
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,000
Tell me what happened to my third uncle!

402
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,200
You suspect me just because of a scar?

403
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,200
Fine.

404
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,000
Your third uncle and I

405
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,600
have a lot of scars on our bodies.

406
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,800
I'll tell you everything!

407
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,800
No.

408
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,400
No.

409
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,800
No, no, no.

410
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,200
No, no, no!

411
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,400
Who are you?

412
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,600
Who are you?

413
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,600
You lied to me.

414
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,000
Who are you?

415
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,600
Fine.

416
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,400
You said I'm not your third uncle.

417
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,600
Then tell me.

418
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,000
Who am I?

419
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,800
You are

420
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,600
Xie Lian Huan!

421
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,800
Actually,

422
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,200
you weren't even dead

423
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
in the tomb.

424
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
The bodies found by the archaeological team

425
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,600
were not you.

426
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,200
They were the people who attacked you.

427
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,000
The scar on your head

428
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,200
was left by the attack, right?

429
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,800
No.

430
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,600
When you came up from the tomb,

431
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
you found that the people from the archaeological team

432
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,600
were all missing.

433
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,000
Everyone thought you were dead.

434
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,400
So you hid your identity

435
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,000
and investigated in secret

436
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,600
to avenge your death, right?

437
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,800
No.

438
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,600
You look so much like my third uncle.

439
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,200
And you know him so well.

440
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,400
So you used my third uncle's identity

441
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,800
to investigate the death in secret.

442
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,000
No one ever found out about you.

443
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,600
You used his identity, right?

444
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,200
No.

445
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,600
Actually,

446
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,600
before I came to Mount Baishan,

447
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,400
you had a relationship with Fatty.

448
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,800
When we were about to set off

449
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
on the Hangzhou train,

450
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,200
Fatty was in a state of emergency

451
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,600
and deliberately had a fight with an old lady.

452
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,400
He was trying to stall me

453
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,200
and made the police chase us on the train.

454
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,600
It was because of you that I was killed.

455
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,600
You told the police, right?

456
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,800
Fatty.

457
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Kid.

458
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,000
In this world,

459
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,800
there is only one person who won't harm you.

460
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,200
That is me,

461
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,200
your third uncle.

462
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Third uncle.

463
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,400
Think about it.

464
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,000
Since childhood,

465
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,200
who loves you the most?

466
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,600
Who loves you the most?

467
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,000
It's me, your third uncle.

468
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,200
Until today,

469
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,800
no one has ever taught you

470
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,600
the skills you have.

471
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,000
I can teach you.

472
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,000
Now that you've grown up,

473
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,400
you're so stubborn.

474
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,600
You suspect me.

475
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,200
I'm so heartbroken.

476
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,600
Stop.

477
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,800
Come back.

478
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,800
If you leave, I'll shoot.

479
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
I'll really shoot.

480
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
You...

481
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,200
Are you done?

482
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,400
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

483
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,600
I'm serious.

484
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
Your third uncle

485
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,800
is really nice to you.

486
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,200
Even if he doesn't tell you the truth,

487
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,400
he's also protecting you.

488
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,600
Do you know that?

489
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,200
I...

490
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,200
He didn't ask me to do anything to you.

491
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,600
He just asked me

492
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,000
to make some money.

493
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,200
Make some money?

494
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,400
Yes, he knows that my store hasn't opened for a long time.

495
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,600
How did you two get in touch?

496
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,000
There's a communication device.

497
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,200
We two...

498
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,600
Look at that.

499
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,800
Look at this communication device.

500
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,200
This communication device...

501
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,200
I can't tell that you're a double-faced spy.

502
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,400
What?

503
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,600
Move your feet.

504
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,800
What's wrong?

505
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,400
This is a foot.

506
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,600
It's nothing.

507
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,400
It's just a souvenir of Iron Man.

508
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,200
Right? I bought it online.

509
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,800
You're not like this.

510
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,200
I know you're a fan of the Eastern Army.

511
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,000
Don't be a dead enemy of Iron Man.

512
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,200
Just tear this off.

513
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,400
I'm a dead enemy of you right now.

514
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,600
Do you believe me?

515
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,600
It's nothing.

516
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,600
I'm not.

517
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,000
I'm using this to contact Uncle San.

518
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,400
Look. Yes.

519
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,000
It lights up when you turn it on.

520
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,200
That's all.

521
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,200
That's all?

522
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,200
Give it to me.

523
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,600
Give it to me.

524
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,600
Give it to me.

525
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,200
Sir.

526
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,000
We were able to send cargo from Macao.

527
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,000
Someone saw Hu Xiu Xiu as a part.

528
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,000
The granddaughter of the Huo family?

529
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,800
We found that Hu Xiu Xiu left Beijing to Changsha for Xie Yu Quan

530
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,000
and lots of you did together.

531
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,160
As a fact, they have something to do in the cow.

532
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,400
Xie Yuchen, Huo Xiu Xiu.

533
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,000
I suppose the whole family has already got the information.

534
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,960
We will have to test their sincerity.

535
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,960
I see.

536
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,280
You can go now.

537
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,880
Do you still want to ask Mr. Qiu?

538
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,760
No need.

539
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,120
The sender is not in a hurry.

540
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,040
We don't need to be anxious either.

541
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:21,160
Tell them to withdraw from Macao.

542
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,920
They don't need to fight with Xie.

543
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,200
You didn't tell Wu Xie the truth.

544
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,200
You...

545
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,560
You're suddenly trying to make me...

546
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,200
Let me see the report.

547
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,600
This is the locator.

548
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,800
I know who you're in contact with.

549
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,800
I'm not interested in any of this.

550
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:58,200
But if you want to hurt Wu Xie,

551
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,400
you know me.

552
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,200
Pan Pan, you've lost more weight than before.

553
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,600
Watch your feet, San Gu.

554
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,400
Little Third Master, hurry up. I'll wait for you at the door.

555
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,800
Okay.

556
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,400
You're really fast.

557
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,200
I've packed everything for you.

558
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,400
Siha Palace has already set off. You're still not worried?

559
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,200
I'm fine.

560
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,800
Siha Palace

561
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,200
San Gu, look.

562
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,600
Little Third Master, look.

563
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,200
It's so beautiful.

564
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,800
The volcano.

565
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,800
This is the volcano.

566
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,400
Qingqing, look over there.

567
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,000
Wait.

568
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,400
This scene looks spectacular.

569
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,400
So, the Cloud Sky Palace is right at the top of the volcano.

570
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,400
This is the same size as the Qing Huang Ling.

571
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,400
It's so cool.

572
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,400
Hurry up.

573
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,400
Everyone, leave the useless things behind.

574
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,800
Prepare the rope and lighten the wound.

575
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,800
The Cloud Sky Palace

576
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,800
What's that smell?

577
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,000
It stinks.

578
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,400
This is a bad place.

579
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,400
This is a dead pit.

580
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,000
Even birds don't fly here.

581
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,800
Let's get out of here.

582
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,800
Or else, we'll die.

583
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,200
Dead pit?

584
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,000
Yes.

585
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,800
It's the toxic gas that comes out when the volcano erupts.

586
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,400
This is not good.

587
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,000
Let's go.

588
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,400
One by one.

589
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,800
Follow the rope and light the fire.

590
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,800
The Cloud Sky Palace

591
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,600
Stop.

592
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,800
Wait.

593
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,800
We have to stop the toxic gas before we move on.

594
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,200
No, let's go back.

595
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,600
This kind of toxic gas is more likely to spread in high temperatures.

596
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,800
We have to go back and fix it.

597
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,800
Go.

598
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,400
Go back.

599
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,800
Go.

600
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,400
Go.

601
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,400
Is there any other way?

602
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,800
We can't just watch the shadow of the Cloud Sky Palace.

603
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,600
We can't go down there.

604
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,400
Looking at the view from the volcano,

605
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,600
if there's another way, we can only go down the mountain.

606
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,400
There's a volcano in the middle of the mountain.

607
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,600
The surrounding structures won't allow for another way.

608
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,600
The path to the Cloud Sky Palace must be at the volcano.

609
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,000
There can't be another way.

610
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,400
Then we can't go down this path now.

611
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,800
Then... are we going to go down tonight?

612
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,200
You're still in the mood.

613
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,400
Just obey the order and listen to the command.

614
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,400
Hey.

615
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,400
Hey,

616
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,400
are we really going to go?

617
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,600
Hey, what are you doing?

618
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,000
Hurry and get everyone out.

619
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,400
Could it be that we're hallucinating because of the toxic gas?

620
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,800
You saw it too, right?

621
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,800
Take him back.

622
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,600
The temperature is low and the humidity is heavy.

623
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,200
The toxic gas particles are all colliding with the water in the air.

624
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,600
We're not coughing right now.

625
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,400
This means we can go over there now.

626
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,200
Why? Why can't we go over there until tonight?

627
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,800
Could it be that Wang set up a trap again?

628
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,800
No.

629
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,800
I think we have to go over there no matter what.

630
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,200
I think there's only one way.

631
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,600
How about we hurry and go to the Heavenly Palace?

632
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,400
Okay, let's not talk about it anymore.

633
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,400
Get ready and set off right away.

634
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,600
Let's go.

635
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,000
Xia Ge.

636
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:06,000
procure

637
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,200
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it.

638
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,200
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it.

639
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:11,200
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it.

640
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,200
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it.

641
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,200
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it.

642
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,200
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it.

643
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,200
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it.

644
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,200
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it.

645
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,200
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it.

646
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:41,100
SQ5

647
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:08,860
