1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You

3
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,600
Hua Yan

4
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,600
The email address of the post has been found

5
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,200
It's from the Huo family in Beijing

6
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,600
The Huo family?

7
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,600
Hua Yan

8
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,200
Things have to go slowly

9
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,400
But if it goes on like this

10
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,600
I'm afraid you won't be able to stand it

11
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,000
Don't worry, I can handle it

12
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,200
It's time to go to Beijing

13
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Huo Yan

14
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,000
Thank you

15
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,600
Heaven, earth, people, ghosts

16
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,200
The distance between heaven and earth is 84,000 miles

17
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
You, what are you doing?

18
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,600
No, I'm just used to it

19
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,600
I want to test it wherever I go

20
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Tianzhen, stop playing around and eat

21
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
I'm telling you, no matter where you go

22
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
You can't be wronged

23
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,600
You have to be comfortable

24
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Enough, you

25
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Just go out and do what you want

26
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Look at the weather

27
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
It's snowing, it's hard

28
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Tianzhen, what are you thinking?

29
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Tianzhen, what are you thinking?

30
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Shunzi

31
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Do you know if there are any ancient tombs nearby

32
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Or other strange places

33
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,600
No way, there are tombs

34
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,600
I haven't heard of it

35
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Everyone should be careful

36
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
There is a high level of snow mountain in front

37
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
That section of the cliff is often covered by snow

38
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
The goddess of snow mountain is very brilliant

39
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Why is it the goddess of snow mountain again?

40
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
You mean

41
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
We will have strange things like this in the future, right?

42
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Don't be disrespectful to the goddess of snow mountain

43
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
I tell you

44
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
There are many strange things happening in the snow mountain

45
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Maybe they will die at some point

46
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,600
I'll tell you about the people who explored the mountain

47
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Follow up

48
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Don't fall down

49
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Hold on for a while

50
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,600
The head of the island said he was locked up

51
00:05:51,600 --> 00:06:20,600
I don't think I know the direction we are going

52
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,600
The snow is too big

53
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
The map given by the head of the island is too small

54
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
I really can't walk

55
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,600
Don't get trapped here in the end

56
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
Don't talk nonsense

57
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,600
It's because of you

58
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,600
The head of the island was buried by the snow

59
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Brother

60
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Didn't we agree not to mention this?

61
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
Besides, he didn't meet on purpose

62
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Really?

63
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,600
Then what's the point of you kicking him out?

64
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,600
Don't think I don't know

65
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
A love is not enough

66
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
A heartache

67
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,600
You are really good

68
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
You'd better not forget

69
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
Who is the sponsor of this operation?

70
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,600
Stop arguing

71
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,600
We should unite now

72
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,600
This is a place where we may die at any time in the snow mountain

73
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,600
It seems to be the direction to the tree

74
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,600
I'm not sure

75
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
I think so

76
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
Let's try

77
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,600
Let's make a mark

78
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:42,940
We must reach the

79
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,600
The place where the snow mountain is buried

80
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,600
Only those who are not capable will be left here

81
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,600
Treasure and danger are both together

82
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,600
If you are not brave enough, just go back

83
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
What?

84
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,600
Master, I want to tell you

85
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
I told you before

86
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,600
I have something to say

87
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,600
You won't regret what you did

88
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
Do you understand?

89
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Why haven't we arrived yet?

90
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,600
Did you take the wrong way?

91
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
You really took the wrong way

92
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
No

93
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
I know where Shaogang is

94
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
Where? You know it, just go

95
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
No, no, no

96
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
This is not the snow mountain

97
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
How could I not think of it?

98
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
Shaogang is buried

99
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
He is right under our feet

100
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
I said I had been looking for it for a long time

101
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
Why didn't I find it?

102
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,600
What should we do now?

103
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
The horse is gone

104
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
We can't go back just by two legs

105
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Is there a place to live?

106
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
It's so cold

107
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
Are we going to freeze to death here?

108
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,600
There is another hope

109
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
I remember there should be a hot spring nearby

110
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
If we can find the hot spring

111
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
We can last a few more days

112
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
The hot spring is higher than here

113
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
We should be unable to bury it

114
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
We can't find the hot spring there

115
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Then we can only pray for the mountain

116
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
I'll take out the ropes

117
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Everyone, remember on your waist

118
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
One by one, the rope team will fall into the team

119
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Yes, sir

120
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
Shaogang

121
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
Shaogang

122
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Did you call me?

123
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
You heard it

124
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Don't worry

125
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,600
I can save your life even if the worst is over

126
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
Let's go

127
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Shaogang

128
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,600
Shaogang

129
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Shaogang

130
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Shaogang

131
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Shaogang

132
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Shaogang

133
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Shaogang

134
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
Shaogang

135
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
Shaogang

136
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Shaogang

137
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
Shaogang

138
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
Shaogang

139
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
Shaogang

140
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Shunze

141
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
What happened?

142
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
What happened to you?

143
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
I fainted

144
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
from recuperation

145
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,600
What kind of person is this?

146
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
You don't know the way

147
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
We haven't even started

148
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
and you're already unconscious

149
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
What should we do now?

150
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,600
The only one who knows the way is already unconscious.

151
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
We can't wait to die here.

152
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
Let's think of a way.

153
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
How can we think of a way?

154
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,600
My head is like ice.

155
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
According to Shunzi's description,

156
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
this hot spring should be around here.

157
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
How about we split up and look for it?

158
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,600
We can only do this.

159
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,600
How about this?

160
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
The ropes on our bodies are untied.

161
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
We'll follow our own directions.

162
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,600
We'll go to the hot spring.

163
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
We'll go to the hot spring.

164
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
We'll go to the hot spring.

165
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
We'll go to the hot spring.

166
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
We'll go to the hot spring.

167
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
We'll go to the hot spring.

168
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
We'll go to the hot spring.

169
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,600
Look.

170
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,600
Follow your own directions.

171
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,600
Come back when you reach the limit.

172
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
But remember,

173
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,600
don't take the risk.

174
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
If anyone finds the hot spring,

175
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
contact each other with a communication device.

176
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
Everyone should check their own communication device

177
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
to see if it can be used normally.

178
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
Let's go.

179
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,600
Madam.

180
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,600
Boss Xie is in Beijing.

181
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,600
He asked if you had time to see him.

182
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Xie?

183
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
Did Xiuxiu sleep?

184
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
You forgot.

185
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Miss is playing with friends in the suburbs.

186
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,600
She'll be staying at the villa tonight.

187
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,600
Okay.

188
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,600
How about I take her to the guest room first?

189
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
No, no, no.

190
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,600
Let her in.

191
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
Okay.

192
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,600
Please.

193
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
Madam.

194
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
Boss Xie is here.

195
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
Grandma Hua.

196
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
Xie.

197
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
Sit.

198
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
You came to see me in the middle of the night

199
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,600
without any reason.

200
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,600
What's the matter?

201
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
Just tell me.

202
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
Grandma Hua.

203
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,600
I'm sorry to come to see you so late.

204
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,600
I'm sure you know my intentions.

205
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,600
Since you want me to tell you,

206
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,600
I want to know

207
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,600
where you got that photo.

208
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,600
It's just a photo.

209
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,600
I got it when someone took it.

210
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Now I remember

211
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,600
it's not hard to get a photo like this.

212
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
I don't know where you got it from.

213
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,600
But it's a big deal for our Xie family.

214
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,600
I can't believe it just because of a photo.

215
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,600
I didn't expect you to have this attitude.

216
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,600
I watched you grow up.

217
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,600
How could I lie to you with a fake photo?

218
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,600
I'm grateful that you care about my family.

219
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,600
I'll keep that photo.

220
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,600
Sure, keep it.

221
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,600
Are you done?

222
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
It's too late.

223
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
It's too late.

224
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
I'll leave you alone.

225
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,600
Right, you should go.

226
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600
Bye, Grandma Hua.

227
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
Okay, make it clear.

228
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Grandma Hua.

229
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,600
Breathe in.

230
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
Breathe in.

231
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,600
You can't sleep.

232
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,600
Breathe in.

233
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
You don't want to sleep.

234
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
You lack oxygen.

235
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
Breathe slowly.

236
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,600
No.

237
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,600
Breathe in.

238
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
Breathe slowly.

239
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
No, no, no.

240
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,600
You can't sleep.

241
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
You won't wake up if you sleep.

242
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,160
Come here.

243
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,260
Come.

244
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,820
Who? Who are you?

245
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,160
Who are you?

246
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,660
It's me.

247
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,160
Who? Your Third Uncle.

248
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,520
Third...

249
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,520
Third Uncle?

250
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,100
You're tired. Come here.

251
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,900
Come here. Come here. Come to Third Uncle.

252
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
Third Uncle.

253
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,600
Third Uncle.

254
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,600
Third Uncle.

255
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,600
I can't walk anymore.

256
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
Why are you...

257
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,600
I heard that in a low temperature environment,

258
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
people will not only be like this,

259
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
but also like a fantasy.

260
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Fantasy.

261
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,600
You think of Third Uncle as a fantasy?

262
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,600
You're not my Third Uncle.

263
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
You're the one I imagined.

264
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,600
But there's no reason.

265
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,600
Why is the Third Uncle I imagined

266
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,600
wearing a mountaineering suit and a footwear?

267
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Come here. Come to Third Uncle.

268
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,600
You can rest and warm yourself.

269
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,600
Come here.

270
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
Come.

271
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
What's wrong?

272
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,600
Come to your Third Uncle.

273
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,600
You are Xie Lian Huan?

274
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,600
You're willing to owe me your life.

275
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,600
When are you going to pay me back?

276
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,600
No. No.

277
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
No.

278
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,600
No.

279
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,600
No.

280
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
No.

281
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,600
Wait.

282
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,600
What's going on?

283
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Don't move. Don't move.

284
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,600
Wait.

285
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
Stand up.

286
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,600
The snow pit is falling.

287
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,600
Hold on.

288
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,600
Tian Jun, are you okay?

289
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
Where did you fall?

290
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,600
Wait.

291
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,600
What's in the snow?

292
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,600
What's this?

293
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,600
What's this?

294
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,600
Is this a snake or a centipede?

295
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,600
Is this a dead snake?

296
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,600
Keep your voice down.

297
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,600
If it wasn't you, how could I fall here?

298
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,600
The snow is not thick enough.

299
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,600
How could you blame me for falling?

300
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,600
Can you two stop fighting?

301
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,600
Come here. Let's go.

302
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
This is a stone sculpture.

303
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,600
Why are there so many statues?

304
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,600
Is this a centipede or a dragon?

305
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,600
This is more ugly than the one in the ancient palace.

306
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,600
It's broken, so it's placed here.

307
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,600
Don't talk nonsense.

308
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,600
This is a centipede.

309
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,600
It's not a dragon you see.

310
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,600
In the Eastern and Western Dynasties, dragons were all carved like this.

311
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,600
And in ancient China, the shape of a dragon was different.

312
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,600
It had a pig's nose.

313
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,600
That's why it was called a dragon.

314
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,600
But it was an ant.

315
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,600
It was a dragon with a long nose.

316
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,600
It was a dragon with a long nose.

317
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,600
It had a pig's nose.

318
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,600
It looked like a centipede.

319
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,600
The process of the Chinese dragon's evolution

320
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,600
was very long.

321
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
In the beginning, dragons were all made by their mother-in-law.

322
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,600
They were called dragons when they were

323
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,600
just a snake.

324
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,600
Each tribe had their own dragon statues.

325
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,600
The shape of the dragon was also changed by each tribe.

326
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,600
The Chinese culture spread later.

327
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,600
The Chinese culture was integrated.

328
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,600
The Chinese dragon

329
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,600
was integrated with the dragon images of the ethnic tribes.

330
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,600
In the end, it was unified

331
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,600
with the shape of the dragon.

332
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,600
There are two things.

333
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,600
It seems that the Eastern and Western Dynasties

334
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,600
existed a long time ago.

335
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,600
Brother Hua, you know so much.

336
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Tell us about the Eastern and Western Dynasties.

337
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,600
The Eastern and Western Dynasties...

338
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,600
It's worth living.

339
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,600
Grandpa Si.

340
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,600
Put Grandpa Si on it.

341
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,600
This thing, the old man has the most speech power.

342
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,600
Let me let him see.

343
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,600
What I'm going to say is that let's find a place to rest our feet.

344
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
I almost fell down.

345
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,600
What about Grandpa Si?

346
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,600
What happened to him?

347
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,600
Miss Ning, it's getting dark.

348
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,600
We can't go anymore.

349
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,600
It's not that we're afraid of the hard work.

350
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,600
It's too dangerous.

351
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,600
The探路的說,前面發生了大面積的雪崩.

352
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,600
There's a bubble below the snow.

353
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,600
If you stand on it, the snow will break.

354
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,600
It's a small thing to fall and bend your feet.

355
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,600
If we fall into the snow,

356
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,600
we can't get up there.

357
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,600
Or it will cause a chain reaction and a snowstorm.

358
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Then our fun will be great.

359
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,600
If we, the No. 10, disappear,

360
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,600
it will be a matter of seconds.

361
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,600
How long can we catch up with Jason?

362
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,600
If we don't rest,

363
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,600
we can catch up tonight.

364
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,600
But they have to rest in this weather.

365
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
We can only retreat for one day.

366
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,600
Okay.

367
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,600
Let's rest.

368
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,600
Okay.

369
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,600
Let's go.

370
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,600
No need to rush now.

371
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,600
Jason will help us to deal with Wu Sanxing.

372
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,600
Understood.

373
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,600
Come.

374
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,600
Hurry.

375
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,600
Clean up the snow. I want to see it clearly.

376
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,600
Go, go, go. Hurry, hurry.

377
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,600
Come.

378
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,600
Come.

379
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,600
It's really big.

380
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,600
Where did it come from?

381
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,600
There are traces of breaking.

382
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,600
I think

383
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,600
it fell from above.

384
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,600
There are only stones on it.

385
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,600
The dragon's body is not right.

386
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,600
It's not symmetrical.

387
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,600
This is the second dragon's spine.

388
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,600
There should be another stone sculpture.

389
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,600
Such stone sculptures are usually carved on stone doors.

390
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,600
The reason why there are cracks on it is because

391
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,600
I think it's because

392
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,600
there was a snowstorm or an earthquake.

393
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,600
So it fell down and ended up here.

394
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Bullshit.

395
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,600
You always say such things.

396
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,600
What stone door?

397
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,600
This is the stone of the tomb.

398
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,600
Look here.

399
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,600
Don't move.

400
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,600
The dragon's intestine is pulled out.

401
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,600
Uncle San.

402
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,600
When the dragon's body is carved on the tomb,

403
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,600
the crack is pulled out.

404
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,600
This side is facing the inside.

405
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,600
Is it?

406
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,600
One, two, three.

407
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,600
What's wrong?

408
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,600
The dragon's intestine is cut off.

409
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,600
Uncle San, why can't it be pulled out?

410
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,600
You...

411
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,600
Uncle San, I think this guy is going to hang up.

412
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,600
I...

413
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,600
Shun Zi.

414
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,600
Shun Zi.

415
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,600
Shun Zi.

416
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,600
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

417
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,600
I'm in the first class.

418
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,600
Wait a minute.

419
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,600
The further you walk in the snow mountain, the harder it is.

420
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,600
You don't know what you will encounter in the future.

421
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,600
So you should save some things.

422
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,600
Save?

423
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,600
Save what?

424
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,600
You have to save people no matter what.

425
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,600
It's like this.

426
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,600
Shun Zi.

427
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,600
Shun Zi.

428
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,600
Shun Zi.

429
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,600
We have to light some fire to warm Shun Zi up.

430
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,600
Shun Zi, don't sleep.

431
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,600
Don't sleep. If you sleep, you won't wake up.

432
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,600
There are no firewood around here.

433
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,600
Burn the crack.

434
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,600
Burn the crack?

435
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,600
How did you think of that? We have so much equipment here.

436
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,600
If you don't know where to go, tell me how to go to the back road.

437
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,600
If we don't have a guide, I'm afraid we can't go to the back road.

438
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,600
There is no guide.

439
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,600
There is no difference.

440
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,600
He didn't know where the firewood was.

441
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,600
Now he is lost.

442
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,600
He is still half dead.

443
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,600
You tell me, you tell me if we should take him to the back road.

444
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,600
Wolf, what do you mean by that?

445
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,600
Then can we just watch Shun Zi die here?

446
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,600
Then how do you save him?

447
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,600
What are you doing?

448
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,600
I'm still holding the fire.

449
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,600
What are you arguing about?

450
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,600
Brother, this...

451
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,600
Don't let him die for now.

452
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,600
I have something to ask him.

453
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,600
Fatty, help me get the wood from the crack.

454
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,600
It will be used as firewood.

455
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,600
Wait.

456
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,600
Did you not smell anything?

457
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,600
It smells like sulfur.

458
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,600
There is a hot spring here?

459
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,600
Could it be

460
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,600
the hot spring that Shun Zi mentioned?

461
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,600
Look, this guide is quite useful.

462
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,600
Shun Zi, you all go out and look for it.

463
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,600
Wait.

464
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,600
Little brother, sorry to bother you.

465
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,600
I'll go.

466
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Someone has been here.

467
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,600
What is this?

468
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,600
Little brother, what does this mean?

469
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,600
Come and look.

470
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,600
I found some traces here.

471
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,600
It seems that the archaeologist left it here.

472
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,600
Let's go.

473
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,600
Such a hidden place.

474
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,600
Someone has been here before.

475
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,600
Come and look. This is very interesting.

476
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,600
The text is very old.

477
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,600
I haven't finished translating it yet.

478
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,600
But look, someone must have come here before.

479
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,600
This is the text from the book of the war.

480
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,600
What kind of team would use this kind of text?

481
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,600
This is the text from the book of the war.

482
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,600
What kind of team would use this kind of text?

483
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,600
June 6th.

484
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,600
This is the second day

485
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,600
that we entered this hole.

486
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,600
This is the second day that we entered this hole.

487
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,600
We might have already lost some...

488
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,600
Grandpa Si, what's wrong?

489
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,600
These are old bones.

490
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,600
What's there to study?

491
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,600
Let's look for a way out.

492
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,600
Let's go.

493
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,600
What do you know?

494
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,600
What do you know?

495
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,600
Why?

496
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,600
I know you're fine.

497
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,600
Zhao Yu Zheng.

498
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,600
This is a girl's name.

499
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,600
See what she wrote.

500
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,600
No need to see. I know it.

501
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,600
How do you know?

502
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,600
This is their workbook.

503
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,600
The one that is recorded should be this time.

504
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,600
And also,

505
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,600
the carvings just now,

506
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,600
you guys need to take a look again.

507
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,600
What's up?

508
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,600
It's empty.

509
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,600
Empty?

510
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,600
There was no smell just now.

511
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,600
Why is the smell so strong now?

512
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,600
It's empty under the dragon's head.

513
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,600
So the hot spring is behind the dragon's head, right?

514
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,600
There should be another one.

515
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,600
The hot spring should be in the middle.

516
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,600
But the smell of sulfur

517
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,600
came out from this one.

518
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,600
It's hot in here.

519
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,600
It's warm.

520
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,600
No. This angle is too uncomfortable.

521
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,600
I can't see anything.

522
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,600
Lang Feng, you stay outside.

523
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,600
You can take care of anything.

524
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,600
Okay.

525
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,600
Everyone else, get your equipment and go down and have a look.

526
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,600
Okay.

527
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,600
Go.

528
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,600
What's this?

529
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,600
There's more here.

530
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,600
What does it say, Tianzhen?

531
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,600
There's more here.

532
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,600
It looks like Chinese Chinese characters.

533
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,600
I don't know.

534
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,600
It's not Chinese characters.

535
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,600
It looks like Chinese characters.

536
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,600
But it looks like Korean characters.

537
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,600
I can't recognize it either.

538
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,600
It looks like

539
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,600
Chinese characters.

540
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,600
You know what it means.

541
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,600
I'm a god.

542
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,600
I can tell by looking at it.

543
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,600
I'm confused. Let me think about it.

544
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,600
Let's take a photo first.

545
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,600
I'll study it later.

546
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,600
Let's go.

547
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,600
Let's go.

548
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,600
Let's go.

549
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,600
Let's go.

550
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,600
It's 30 degrees here.

551
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,600
It's too hot.

552
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,600
Tianzhen.

553
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,600
That rock is not a coincidence, right?

554
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,600
Let's go.

555
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,600
Let's go.

556
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,600
Look at the mountains and the forests.

557
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,600
Look at the rocks.

558
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,600
This is the quarry they used to build the forest.

559
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,600
The workers found this underground passage during the quarry.

560
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,600
But I don't know why,

561
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,600
they had to seal it with the rock.

562
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,600
I'm telling you, it's getting worse.

563
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,600
The hot spring is not far from here.

564
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,600
We can take a bath,

565
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,600
get some warm water, right?

566
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,600
This is the mouth of the volcano.

567
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,600
The volcano?

568
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,600
Yes.

569
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,840
The entire Changbai Mountain is a volcano in the period of the

570
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,600
end of the world.

571
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,600
It erupted last time in the 18th century.

572
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,600
When it woke up,

573
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,600
did Rongyan come down and we caught a cold?

574
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,600
Yes.

575
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,600
Rongyan came out in a flash.

576
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,600
Then we died very quickly.

577
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,600
What are you doing?

578
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,600
What are you doing?

579
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,600
What are you doing?

580
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,600
Can you stop saying these words?

581
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,600
If you don't want to listen...

582
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,600
You two little rascals,

583
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,600
say something positive.

584
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,600
Little rascals.

585
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,600
It's so narrow in here.

586
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,600
I don't think we can get in through this.

587
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,600
Come on.

588
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,600
Grandpa Si,

589
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,600
why don't you take care of us here?

590
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,600
We'll go in and see the way.

591
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,600
We'll tell you when we get back.

592
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,600
Little rascal,

593
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,600
you're doing this for me?

594
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,600
You're afraid that you'll lose face, right?

595
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,600
But now,

596
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,600
it's not easy for me to climb in at my age.

597
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,600
How about this?

598
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,600
You all go in and see what's inside.

599
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,600
No, what?

600
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,600
Grandpa Si is here alone.

601
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,600
I'm worried.

602
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,600
I'll go with Grandpa Si.

603
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,600
You go.

604
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,600
Fatty, come on.

605
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,600
Let's go.

606
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,600
Let's go.

607
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,600
Let's go.

608
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,600
Let's go.

609
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,600
Let's go.

610
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,600
Let's go.
