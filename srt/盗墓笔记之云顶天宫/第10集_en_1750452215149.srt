I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

27

I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Why are you leaving?

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Isn't the day almost dawn?

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Have you gone out and checked if the snow has stopped yet?

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'll be shooting two more photos.

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Do you know that this kind of snow態

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
usually doesn't see much?

49
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,480
Wait outside

50
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,960
I'll call you in 2 hours

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You are awake

52
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,960
It's hard for you

53
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,100
Xia Ge, I was so tired yesterday and there's a lot to find out.

54
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,260
But I just thought it over very carefully.

55
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,420
I want to ask two questions you guys.

56
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,420
What questions?

57
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,720
Ask two questions to a friend or a friend,

58
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,100
to find out if they are okay with each other

59
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,260
We are her products.

60
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:39,560
Yeah

61
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,360
Why was I sitting here?

62
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,880
It's not like I need someone to look after her.

63
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,320
I didn't even know the door to Feng Mei's house.

64
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,640
What are we going to do now?

65
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,640
No problem.

66
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,640
It's the snake-naked fish that Si Agong got.

67
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,140
It's the same as the photo on the newspaper.

68
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,640
That's strange.

69
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,140
Si Agong was arrested after he came out of the prison.

70
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,640
The Cultural Bureau has been in charge for years.

71
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,640
After Si Agong got out of prison, he set the fire to the Cultural Bureau.

72
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,140
After he got out of prison, Si Agong took the snake-naked fish back.

73
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,140
No, I didn't mean that.

74
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,140
I mean, if there's no problem,

75
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,140
Si Agong was the one who was in Guangxi Sword Palace.

76
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,140
Then why didn't he respond to the little brother?

77
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,140
What did you want?

78
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,140
You forgot.

79
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:42,140
The old Chang Lao in the prison, he saw the little brother's face.

80
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:52,640
Si Agong got arrested and also killed the little brother

81
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,140
and looked exactly the same as the little brother.

82
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,140
So he...

83
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,640
Maybe he was old and he was always on the same page.

84
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,640
So he didn't remember what he looked like.

85
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,640
So he didn't respond to the little brother.

86
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,640
Do you think Si Agong looks like the old man on the page?

87
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,640
Why don't you ask him yourself?

88
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,140
You ask!

89
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,640
Si Agong

90
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,640
is the one who was in the prison.

91
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,640
He was the one who was in the prison.

92
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,640
He was the one who was in the prison.

93
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,640
He was the one who was in the prison.

94
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,640
He was the one who was in the prison.

95
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,640
He was the one who was in the prison.

96
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,640
He was the one who was in the prison.

97
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,640
He was the one who was in the prison.

98
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,640
Si Agong

99
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,640
Si Agong

100
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,640
I didn't expect that this blood would last for three days.

101
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,640
But I've been here for a long time.

102
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,640
If there's no improvement,

103
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,640
maybe we won't be able to get out of here.

104
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,640
People who come out to play won't be like this.

105
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,640
Actually, I have no choice now.

106
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,640
I'll come back when I get back.

107
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,640
I'll share the food.

108
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,640
Everyone has to eat.

109
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,640
It's impossible to go back now.

110
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,640
Let's go.

111
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,640
I'm going to the hospital.

112
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,640
I'm going to the hospital.

113
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,640
I'm going to the hospital.

114
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,640
I'm going to the hospital.

115
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,640
I'm going to the hospital.

116
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,640
I'm going to the hospital.

117
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,640
I'm going to the hospital.

118
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,640
I'm going to the hospital.

119
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,640
I'm going to the hospital.

120
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,640
I'm going to the hospital.

121
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,640
I'm going to the hospital.

122
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,640
I'm going to the hospital.

123
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,640
I'm going to the hospital.

124
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,640
I'm going to the hospital.

125
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,640
I'm going to the hospital.

126
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,640
That mountain.

127
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,640
That mountain in the movie theater.

128
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,640
That's right.

129
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,640
Why didn't I see it?

130
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,640
Master Huo, the computer's data must be in the mountain in 24 hours.

131
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,640
It can't be too late.

132
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,640
Jia Sha, go and check the Huo family.

133
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,640
Huo family?

134
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,640
Help me find out what happened between the old lady and the Qiu Dao Gao.

135
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,640
Be careful to investigate.

136
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,640
Don't leave anything behind.

137
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,640
Master Huo, what level did we find out?

138
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,640
After all, Miss Huo is the granddaughter of the Huo family.

139
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,640
Chang, I'll think of a way to find out.

140
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,640
Miss Huo, you're here.

141
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,640
This is a total of 114 pieces.

142
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,640
What's inside?

143
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,640
I'm just a security guard.

144
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,640
What's the price of the goods?

145
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,640
I guarantee that it's the same.

146
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,640
It's not my business.

147
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,640
How long have you been here?

148
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,640
Seven years.

149
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,640
It's like this.

150
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,640
One year at a time.

151
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,640
Sometimes one year at a time.

152
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,640
Sometimes half a year.

153
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,640
Is it all that every time?

154
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,640
Probably all the time.

155
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640
All go overseas?

156
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,640
Yes.

157
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,640
How many warehouse like this are in the country?

158
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,640
I'm not sure.

159
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,640
Look, if there's nothing wrong, sign it.

160
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,640
Miss Huo, it's all 114 pieces.

161
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,640
You have to wipe it now.

162
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,640
Miss.

163
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,640
Where's Grandma?

164
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,640
She's in the study.

165
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,640
Xiu Xiu, look at this flower.

166
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,640
It's so bright.

167
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,640
Grandma, I went to the warehouse of the exam book.

168
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,640
I... I saw her goods.

169
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,640
So the goods are all right?

170
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,640
Yes, 114 pieces.

171
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,640
Grandma, all the items are in there.

172
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,640
I heard that such a valuable goods

173
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,640
will be available once every year or half a year.

174
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,640
Yes.

175
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,640
I can't imagine how many items

176
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,640
Qiu Dekou got.

177
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
Yes.

178
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,640
Grandma, are we really going to help him

179
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,640
get the goods out?

180
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,640
Why not?

181
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,640
Don't forget, how did the Huo family get up?

182
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,640
Now Qiu Dekou and Wu San Xing

183
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,640
are in a bad mood.

184
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,640
Why not?

185
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,640
They're looking for new partners.

186
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,640
At this time, they've asked many Huo families to help them.

187
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,640
Now, they have a new path to the new.

188
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,640
We're the ones who are leading the whole thing.

189
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,640
As for whether we can continue to work together,

190
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,640
it's very beneficial for the Huo family.

191
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,640
But it's risky.

192
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,640
Besides,

193
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,640
and so many items are gone,

194
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,640
they can't be returned.

195
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,640
I'm not concerned.

196
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,640
Don't forget, the Huo family is a tombstone.

197
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,640
But aunt is a archaeologist.

198
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,640
Oh,

199
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,640
it's hard to get up early.

200
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,640
So, you should hurry up and sell the goods.

201
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,640
There are many things that will happen

202
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,640
when you're in the middle of the night.

203
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,640
Grandma, what did Qiu Dekou ask you to do?

204
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,640
Is that money?

205
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,640
I don't believe it.

206
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,640
You're not like that.

207
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,640
Are you going to make my decision?

208
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,640
Huh?

209
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,640
You...

210
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,640
Don't you want to do it?

211
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,640
You want to do it for others, right?

212
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,640
You can leave.

213
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,640
Grandma.

214
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,640
Then, in this case,

215
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,640
you don't need to interfere in the Huo family's affairs.

216
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,640
Grandma.

217
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,640
All right.

218
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,640
I'll give you the final choice.

219
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
I'll sit.

220
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
Xiao Hua.

221
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,640
I have something to ask you.

222
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,640
Look over there.

223
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,640
The mountains are so clear.

224
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,640
The snow is always falling.

225
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,640
And the mountains are so steep.

226
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,640
This is a very rare and old dragon.

227
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,640
From the water,

228
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,640
it's like a mountain.

229
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,640
It's like a mountain.

230
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,640
It's like a mountain.

231
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,640
It's like a mountain.

232
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,640
It's like a mountain.

233
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,640
The three-headed dragon.

234
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,640
From the water,

235
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,640
it's like a group of dragons.

236
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,640
See?

237
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,640
The three-headed dragon

238
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,640
is very suitable for making a group.

239
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,640
If it's the Eastern and the Southern Shands,

240
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,640
the three-headed dragon

241
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,640
is very suitable for making a group.

242
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,640
Then the two dragon on both sides

243
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,640
should be the queen

244
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,640
and the guarding dragon.

245
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,640
Three-headed dragon?

246
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,640
There's still a target like that?

247
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,640
For example,

248
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,640
the three-headed dragon

249
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,480
the three-seater valley of the Mangshan War,

250
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,080
the three-seater valley of the three-seater valley,

251
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,580
the three-seater valley on the same mountain road,

252
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,260
the valley on the other side

253
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,120
has a one-mile-long channel in the middle of the tunnel.

254
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,360
It's just that

255
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,700
when the Khaogu team found out,

256
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,320
they saw him.

257
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,760
Khaogu team couldn't be sure

258
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,200
whether those channels really existed

259
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,760
or just a positive situation.

260
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,860
What else do you have to say?

261
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,100
Also,

262
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,180
the three-seater dragon is very unique.

263
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,000
The three dragons have to be connected.

264
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,440
Otherwise, the three dragons fly separately,

265
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,080
and the dragon will be in the air without a direction.

266
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,080
The people here will kill each other

267
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,980
if they are left behind.

268
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,980
So, if there is a trail of the three dragons,

269
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,880
there must be a tunnel in the middle of the tunnel,

270
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,120
right, three dragons?

271
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,580
Hey,

272
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,320
if my brother says so,

273
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,620
you can be at ease.

274
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,400
Okay.

275
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,900
Okay.

276
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,200
Let's go.

277
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,000
Keep your fire!

278
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,740
Yes, sir.

279
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,480
Go!

280
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,620
Fire!

281
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,440
Mr. Si,

282
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,040
have some water.

283
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,040
Have a rest.

284
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,040
Mr. Si,

285
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,640
you can have some.

286
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,040
I've seen the painting of the Cloud Sky Palace.

287
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,240
It's a very red building.

288
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,440
Although we know that

289
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,440
the Eastern and Southern countries

290
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,040
have not only existed for more than 70 years,

291
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,840
but the number of people

292
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,840
left by the later generations

293
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,840
is also very small.

294
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,240
And it's all hidden in the mountains.

295
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,840
How could such a big human being

296
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,240
build such a big forest?

297
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,040
You brat,

298
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,240
you're here to make a scene, aren't you?

299
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,440
If you don't even have this little push-pull,

300
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,640
are you still a grandson of the Wulao Dog?

301
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,040
Mr. Si,

302
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,440
I'm just a guess.

303
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,440
It's not necessarily right.

304
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,040
I want to hear your opinion, Mr. Si.

305
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,040
I think

306
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,440
the Cloud Sky Palace

307
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,040
was originally existed.

308
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,840
It's not built by the Eastern and Southern countries.

309
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,640
It's just that the Wulao Dog

310
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,840
thinks this place is good,

311
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,840
so he took it as his own tomb.

312
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,440
But if it is so,

313
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,640
the problem will come again.

314
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,440
Who built this Cloud Sky Palace?

315
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,640
You'll know when you get there.

316
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,840
Why are you so anxious?

317
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,240
Mr. Si,

318
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,040
this Snake-Demon-Snow-Cat

319
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,640
is a key to the key.

320
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,640
What exactly did you get from him?

321
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,640
Could it be related to the Cloud Sky Palace?

322
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,640
There's nothing more to say.

323
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,640
In the stone tower

324
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,240
I entered in the Wulao Dog,

325
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,640
except for some broken objects,

326
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,840
there's nothing else.

327
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,040
There's not even one valuable item.

328
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,240
It's just a 8-spin treasure.

329
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,840
It's in the treasure box,

330
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,240
and the Snake-Demon-Snow-Cat.

331
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,840
Oh.

332
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,640
So this process is...

333
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,640
smooth?

334
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,840
What do you mean?

335
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,440
No,

336
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,640
it's not like

337
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,360
the treasure box is full of

338
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,640
valuable items.

339
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,440
Then this stone tower...

340
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,840
If the stone tower is in the valley,

341
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,640
and you want to go down, it's difficult.

342
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,040
It's a natural barrier.

343
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,440
Mr. Si,

344
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,240
why don't you put the stone tower

345
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,840
in the same place as the Snake-Demon-Snow-Cat?

346
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,240
And then...

347
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,640
What will be the clue

348
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,440
that you've neglected?

349
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,640
You can't stand it, old man.

350
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,840
No, no, no.

351
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,040
No, no.

352
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,640
You're so bold.

353
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,040
This is

354
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,440
quite similar to the Wulao Dog.

355
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,640
The Wulao Dog.

356
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,440
How was it?

357
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,240
He didn't say it.

358
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,840
And...

359
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,040
I feel like he's trying to escape.

360
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,440
It's like he doesn't know the process of thinking.

361
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,040
But he doesn't want to lie to me.

362
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,640
Maybe when we reach the Cloud Sky Palace,

363
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,840
these secrets will be revealed.

364
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,840
Let's go.

365
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,040
Let's go.

366
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,840
Shun Zi.

367
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,440
I can't sleep.

368
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,840
I'll call you back.

369
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,040
I'll do it.

370
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,040
Go back to sleep.

371
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,440
No need.

372
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,440
I've already taken your money.

373
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,640
If you can't do it,

374
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,640
that's too much.

375
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,840
Okay.

376
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,440
What did you do before?

377
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,040
I took the herbs.

378
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,840
I took the medicine.

379
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,840
Just like my dad.

380
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,040
I followed him from the neighborhood

381
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,040
and ran around the mountain.

382
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,840
He's familiar with the snow.

383
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,040
They all call me Alang Cai.

384
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,640
Alang Cai?

385
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,840
He's Xue Shan's son.

386
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,640
By the way, Mr. Wu.

387
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,840
What are you guys doing on the mountain?

388
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,840
Can you tell me?

389
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,640
Actually, even if I don't tell you,

390
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,640
you can guess it, right?

391
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,840
I'll just ask.

392
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,840
Don't worry.

393
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,840
When you take us to the place,

394
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,840
I'll make sure you come back safely.

395
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,240
By the way,

396
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,240
they told me that

397
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,840
the herbs on the mountain

398
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,840
are very expensive.

399
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,240
Compared to the rare herbs on the mountain,

400
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,240
why don't you keep on using them?

401
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,240
I'm not a professional.

402
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,240
I rarely take guests to the mountain.

403
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,640
I wouldn't go that far.

404
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,440
Usually, I'll just go around the girl's lake.

405
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,240
This is the first time I've brought someone here.

406
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,440
Don't joke with me.

407
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,440
Really?

408
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,440
I'm not lying.

409
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,840
Let me tell you the truth.

410
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,240
No one will bring you here.

411
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,240
If I don't bring you here,

412
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,640
you can only come here yourself.

413
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,040
That's too dangerous.

414
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,840
If I didn't use the herbs,

415
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,240
we would have died long ago.

416
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,240
It's a miracle that we can get here without any trouble.

417
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,240
But don't worry.

418
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,640
I've never brought anyone here.

419
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,040
But I often go to the snow mountain.

420
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,440
I'm not familiar with it.

421
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,440
You're not familiar with this place.

422
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,640
You have to bring us here.

423
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,440
Do you really need that much money?

424
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,840
Actually, I don't.

425
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,440
It's mainly because of my dad.

426
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,440
My dad was also a group of guests.

427
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,040
And the route they took was similar to yours.

428
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,640
But then, they didn't come back.

429
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,240
I remember that the tourists were also in this season.

430
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,840
They were also not allowed to go to the mountain.

431
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,240
So when I saw you,

432
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,640
I decided to bring you here.

433
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,640
Maybe this idea is very childish.

434
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,840
I think you'll know what happened to my dad.

435
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,840
So you asked me why we came here?

436
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,240
You never understood.

437
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,440
A person who knows his father is always in the snow mountain.

438
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,840
But you can't see his feelings forever.

439
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,840
By the way, Mr. Wu.

440
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,040
I think you're different from others.

441
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,440
Don't tell anyone.

442
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,840
I'm afraid they have some concerns.

443
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,040
Especially that little girl.

444
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,440
She's not a good girl.

445
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,840
She's a good girl.

446
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,240
She's a good girl.

447
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,640
Especially that one named Lang Feng.

448
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,640
What are you doing?

449
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,640
Hurry up!

450
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,640
Hurry up!

451
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,000
Okay.

452
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,040
Old man,

453
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,240
aren't these the old tomes

454
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,040
Hard Qitun.

455
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,480
This place is full ofrains.

456
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,500
So?

457
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,620
Three running,

458
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,240
you said it right?

459
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,740
This here must have someone to fish out for it!

460
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,240
Let's go.

461
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,240
I don't want to go out in the woods

462
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,480
With you, I'll be done

463
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,240
Here is the��

464
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,520
Music

465
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,780
Master's family.

466
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,840
It's just someone with him.

467
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,020
I wonder whether it was him or her?

468
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,020
We can put everything back together.

469
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,760
Okay, we are so rented.

470
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,420
Indeed.

471
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,220
But if we cooperate

472
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,680
We won't be able to stay with them.

473
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,560
Didn't before air loud enough

474
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,860
that we promised you not to let them know

475
00:26:56,060 --> 00:27:01,060
that we don't wanna leave you anymore

476
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:06,060
Don't be so hard on me.

477
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:11,060
I'm more than capable of making you pay for what you've done.

478
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,060
Right.

479
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,060
You're capable of doing this, right?

480
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:17,060
I'll do such a big thing for you.

481
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,060
But you...

482
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:22,060
You're a family member.

483
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,060
What do you think?

484
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:27,060
I don't want Huo's family to be a dog.

485
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,060
Huo's family?

486
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,060
Huo's family?

487
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,060
When will you be a master?

488
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:37,060
Grandma, didn't you say you'd hand over the Huo's family to me?

489
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,060
I don't want a master who's controlled by the Qiu De Kou.

490
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,060
I'm not dead yet.

491
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,060
You want to be a master?

492
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,060
What do you think, grandma?

493
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:48,060
Working with the Qiu De Kou will only make the Huo family sick.

494
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:51,060
We've spent all our efforts in vain.

495
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,060
We're going back to the beginning, grandma.

496
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,060
Is it that old?

497
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,060
Are you really going to be so stupid?

498
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:01,060
How dare you!

499
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,060
Get lost!

500
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:07,060
Get lost! Get lost!

501
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,060
Get lost!

502
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:03,060
This is a small step for a fat man.

503
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:07,060
But for Mo Jin Xiao Wei,

504
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:11,060
this is a big step for him.

505
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,060
He's got it all.

506
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,180
Not there yet!

507
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,220
No wonder仁差说

508
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,060
in a dirty actingです场白一跳

509
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,060
it's Nevins idea.

510
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,060
The coasts are completely dry,

511
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,060
与外力 雪飘

512
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,060
mist has pl onto the untold road.

513
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,060
It's too dry!

514
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,220
Hit the roof, man.

515
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,160
Where is Shan'er?

516
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,780
Yep, I'm here

517
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,720
You too, go in before the襍'er

518
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,400
And bring us out

519
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,880
What's that legendary message?

520
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,920
The Great Wang mountain in here

521
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,560
...and the three sisters in front

522
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,360
Back then in honghuang

523
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,540
It was a birch tree

524
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,860
About when the wind got us

525
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,620
I used ashaw to come outside

526
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,040
And turned into a irregular tree

527
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,300
As Yan said

528
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:02,300
I heard from the smoke that the scenery on the mountain is very different

529
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,300
For example, on our small mountain

530
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,300
you can see the Great Sheng Mountain and the Three Holy Mountains at the same time

531
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,300
But on the Great Sheng Mountain

532
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,300
You can't see the Small Sheng Mountain, you can only see the Three Holy Mountains

533
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,300
The strangest thing is, on the Three Holy Mountains

534
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,300
you can only see the Great Sheng Mountain

535
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:21,300
You can also see the sky-high wind that is opposite to the Three Holy Mountains

536
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,300
The sky-high wind is more dangerous than the Three Holy Mountains

537
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,300
and it is often caused by the fog

538
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,300
On the boat, there is a heaven-high sky-high wind

539
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,300
It is the path of the people and the fairy

540
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,300
If the weather is good

541
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,300
you can also see the bright light of the rainbow

542
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,300
No, it's not right

543
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,300
Isn't the cloud-high sky-high wind supposed to be on the Three Holy Mountains?

544
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,300
Why did it run away again?

545
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,300
I know this

546
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,300
Before I came here, I was also especially investigated

547
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,300
I guess it was because of the construction of the sky-high wind

548
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,300
Because the sky-high wind and the snow-covered cliff

549
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,300
So it formed a sea-high building

550
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,300
And look, in the mountains

551
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,300
there is no big fog

552
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,300
and it formed a wood-covered tree

553
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,300
So after the Sea-high Snow Tower was put in

554
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,300
it seemed like the sky-high wind was on the sky-high wind

555
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:07,300
Isn't the Sea-high Snow Tower only in the desert and the lake?

556
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:11,300
It is indeed a great sight to see the Sea-high Snow Tower in the snow-covered mountain

557
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:15,300
I guess it has something to do with the terrain and the dragon-mountain

558
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,300
Moreover, in this natural conservation

559
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,300
nothing strange happens

560
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,300
The Sea-high Snow Tower is a very beautiful and beautiful place

561
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,300
It is a very beautiful place

562
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,300
