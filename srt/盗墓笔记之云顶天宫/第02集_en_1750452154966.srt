1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The End

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Episode 1

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Episode 1

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 2

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 3

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 4

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 6

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 6

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Episode 7

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What are you looking for?

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Isn't this the spot?

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Just put it here.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,400
Our defeat can't take the average player away.

40
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:54,920
Run!

41
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,840
Run!

42
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,220
OMG

43
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,600
Uncle

44
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,560
What's you doing

45
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,580
This kind of space

46
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,060
could have bigger seats

47
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,460
even it's just four legs

48
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,380
this time

49
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,100
Don't mention it

50
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,160
Dum laughing

51
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,320
Come here

52
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,840
I saw a black eye.

53
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,440
Really.

54
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,560
I just took a look.

55
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,280
I went there immediately.

56
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,440
This person is interesting.

57
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,640
You should tell the police.

58
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,840
What's going on?

59
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,480
The people who came in

60
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,120
took the 8-inch treasure.

61
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,440
They didn't start the heavy traps.

62
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,920
So they didn't find a way down there.

63
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,080
I guess there must be a document down there.

64
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,960
Where are we going?

65
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,560
Keep going.

66
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,720
Why do you know which one?

67
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,200
We can't cut down the stone.

68
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,240
And we can try it in the next month.

69
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,320
What do you think the passage is different?

70
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,680
The passage is different.

71
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,480
What else?

72
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,120
Wrong.

73
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,240
The four passageways on your side

74
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,600
are the same.

75
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,640
And I think

76
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,720
if you enter the 10-inch treasure,

77
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,440
you can't get out.

78
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,480
I heard from Uncle San.

79
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,480
This is the treasure

80
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,760
that the person who designed the tomb left.

81
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,320
It's to cover the real tomb

82
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,520
and design it.

83
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,560
No, what you mean is

84
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,320
you're the one who made the right decision.

85
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,200
Why?

86
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,120
Because this passage

87
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,800
has a deeper color.

88
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,520
What is that?

89
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,520
A tide?

90
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,760
A water source?

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,600
Let's go.

92
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,200
Maybe we can go through the main room.

93
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,960
What are you doing?

94
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,720
What's the point?

95
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,760
You can't fight with me

96
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,720
without a single foot.

97
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,440
You're so small.

98
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,800
No, I...

99
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
It has nothing to do with the tomb.

100
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,400
Well...

101
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,120
Leave it.

102
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,440
We are the ones holding the gun and trying to back off the revolutionכלion.

103
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,360
Maried to Kas normal.

104
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,720
I am sick now.

105
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,280
There is something behind me.

106
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,280
Why did you say that?

107
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,280
I don't know why I didn't see this tower before.

108
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,280
But the Wang Sang Hai changed it.

109
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,280
Is it because it's hidden in the same place?

110
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,280
You said there's no way to hide it.

111
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,280
Can't you just keep quiet for a while?

112
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,280
No, you said there's something behind it.

113
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,280
I have to see it.

114
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,280
I said it's black eye.

115
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,280
You're poisonous.

116
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,280
No, I might be black eye.

117
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,280
What's that sound?

118
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,280
It sounds like a water pipe.

119
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,280
We should be close to the water source.

120
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,280
Why don't I hear the sound of a water pipe?

121
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,280
Fatty, this tunnel is down there.

122
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,280
It must be the place where the stone tower is deeper.

123
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,280
I think the two tunnels are down there.

124
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,280
Let's go.

125
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,280
It's dead.

126
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,280
What's going on?

127
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,280
You're the one who's been there.

128
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,280
Have we been here before?

129
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,280
No, someone's holding the stone tower.

130
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,280
There's an enemy in the tunnel.

131
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,280
There's someone else besides us.

132
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,280
What are you doing?

133
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,280
I'm going to blow up the wall.

134
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,280
I'm not going to use the bomb.

135
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
I don't need it.

136
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,280
You're crazy.

137
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,280
If someone really holds the stone tower,

138
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,280
it means he's more familiar with this place than we are.

139
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,280
We should just blow up the wall.

140
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,280
It's too fast.

141
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,280
When did you get so violent?

142
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,280
You're actually your uncle.

143
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,280
Calm down.

144
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,280
What if he's still here?

145
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,280
He won't.

146
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,280
You're so childish.

147
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,280
You're so stupid.

148
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,280
You're so stupid.

149
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,280
You're so stupid.

150
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,280
You're really like my uncle.

151
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,280
You're so stupid.

152
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,280
You're so stupid.

153
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,280
You're still here?

154
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,280
Thank you.

155
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,280
What's this?

156
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
It's a rabbit,

157
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,280
a deer,

158
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,280
a cow,

159
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,280
and a huge king of the sea.

160
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,280
It's for our fishing.

161
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,280
So this is the whole thing?

162
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,280
It must be a big fish.

163
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,280
No, I don't think so.

164
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,280
What was that?

165
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,280
It's a big fish.

166
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,280
A big fish.

167
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,280
A big fish.

168
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,280
It's a big fish.

169
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,280
A big fish.

170
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,280
A big fish.

171
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,280
A big fish.

172
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,280
A big fish,

173
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,280
a big fish.

174
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,480
I'll catch the fish.

175
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,560
What's the matter?

176
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,280
Fatty, climb down!

177
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,840
Why should I climb down?

178
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,120
Why haven't you cut it?

179
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,240
Don't you remember?

180
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,040
Don't...

181
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,380
What's the matter again?

182
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,520
What could it be?

183
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,160
Fatty.

184
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,160
struggling back...

185
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,640
Why?

186
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,840
Come.

187
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,320
Don't come over!

188
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,720
Don't let me in!

189
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,320
Fatty!

190
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,320
Don't come over!

191
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,720
Don't let me in!

192
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,080
Don't!

193
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
Where am I?

194
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
Let's go.

195
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,840
Who am I?

196
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
Let's go.

197
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,840
Fatty.

198
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,840
Fatty, are you okay?

199
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Are you okay?

200
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,840
Are you okay?

201
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,840
Don't...

202
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,840
Don't be mad.

203
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,840
You got a bad feeling about the bag.

204
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
If you stay in the air,

205
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,840
the濃-dark will bite you.

206
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,840
You're so stupid.

207
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,840
I was bitten by a sheep.

208
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,840
I got bitten by a car.

209
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,840
You're okay.

210
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,840
You're laughing.

211
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,840
You're laughing.

212
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,840
Anyway,

213
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,840
if you get a bad feeling about the bag,

214
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,840
you need to be careful.

215
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,840
Don't catch it.

216
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,840
Look at me.

217
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,840
Look at me.

218
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,840
Look at me.

219
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
Come on.

220
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,840
Shake it.

221
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,840
No need.

222
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
No need.

223
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
No need.

224
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,840
Shake it.

225
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,840
Are you okay?

226
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,840
You got a bad feeling?

227
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
No.

228
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,840
I asked you to shake it

229
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,840
and put it on your wound.

230
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,840
Then what are you talking about?

231
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,840
How could I know you're so stupid?

232
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
You're so stupid.

233
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,840
I'll just put it on my wound.

234
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,840
I've made it clear.

235
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,840
Pan Zi is looking for you.

236
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,840
In other words,

237
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,840
he's looking for the same fish you have.

238
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,840
Who is he helping?

239
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,840
Qiu Dekou.

240
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,840
He also told me one thing.

241
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,840
There's a agent in China

242
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,840
who often helps some foreign businessmen

243
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,840
and businessmen.

244
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,840
It's convenient.

245
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,840
Recently, there's a dog named Jason.

246
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,840
He's usually out of his agent.

247
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,840
This Jason has something to do with that person.

248
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,840
Where are they?

249
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,840
I think they've entered the

250
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,840
business.

251
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,840
Pan Zi is following us.

252
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
He won't be in trouble.

253
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,840
Master Hu,

254
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,840
there are too many people

255
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,840
who have the same fish in their hands.

256
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,840
They have

257
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,840
the same purpose and the same future.

258
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,840
I'm worried

259
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,840
that with the same fish's clue,

260
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,840
I might be too stupid

261
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,840
to find your novel.

262
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,840
I can't find the same fish

263
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,840
because of my novel.

264
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,840
I'm not only looking for the same fish

265
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,840
for my novel.

266
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,840
You're helping Wu Xia and Xiao San

267
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,840
to find Wu San Xing?

268
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
Master Hu,

269
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,840
I know you're serious.

270
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,840
But in this situation,

271
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,840
your good will make him

272
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,840
see more things he doesn't want to see.

273
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
Just turn him over.

274
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,840
I'm willing to do it.

275
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
No matter if he hates me or not,

276
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,840
I have to help him.

277
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,840
I can't see him

278
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,840
getting deeper and deeper in danger.

279
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
Help me find that Hong Bian Fu

280
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,840
and let him give me some news.

281
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,840
Okay.

282
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,840
I'll go get it.

283
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
You miss me?

284
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,840
Are we still good friends?

285
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,840
You just leave me alone.

286
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,840
I have to go down.

287
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,840
And I see

288
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,840
your brain is broken,

289
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,840
so I can't go down together.

290
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,840
I've already

291
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,840
drawn the part

292
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,840
that you've been caught.

293
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,840
You can't believe it.

294
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,840
Okay,

295
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
you can go down together.

296
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,840
Make sure you're okay.

297
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,840
Otherwise,

298
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,840
I'll be in trouble.

299
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,840
I'm not responsible.

300
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,840
You're just a knife.

301
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,840
You'll regret it

302
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,840
when you lose your mind.

303
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,840
I'll go get it.

304
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,840
Tianzhen,

305
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,840
is this really for me?

306
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,840
For me?

307
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,840
Yes.

308
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,840
But I think

309
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,840
I'm a little bit...

310
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,840
Why are you laughing?

311
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,840
But you're very considerate.

312
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,840
I'm not afraid

313
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,840
of those things

314
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,840
that you've done for me.

315
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,840
Let's go.

316
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,840
It's hard to see.

317
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,840
What do you mean?

318
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,840
Why are you here?

319
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,840
What's going on?

320
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,840
Come here.

321
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,840
Come here.

322
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,840
Didn't you

323
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,840
open the gun?

324
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,840
The gun is really active.

325
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,840
It will have a seal.

326
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,840
We can do it again.

327
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,840
You're so stupid.

328
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,840
Come.

329
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,840
No way.

330
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,840
It's okay.

331
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,840
It's okay.

332
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,840
Why?

333
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,840
Because you're the one

334
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,840
who did it for me.

335
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,840
I'm just a thief.

336
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,840
Look, he wants to swim.

337
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,840
Run!

338
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,840
Run!

339
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,840
Run!

340
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,840
Run!

341
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,840
Run!

342
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,840
Fatty!

343
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,840
Fatty!

344
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,840
Fatty!

345
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,840
Don't hide!

346
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,840
Fatty is coming out!

347
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,840
Fatty!

348
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,840
Fatty!

349
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,840
Fatty!

350
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,840
Fatty!

351
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,840
Fatty!

352
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,840
Fatty!

353
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,840
Fatty!

354
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,840
Fatty!

355
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,840
Fatty!

356
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,840
Fatty!

357
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,840
Fatty!

358
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,840
Fatty!

359
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,840
Fatty!

360
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,840
Fatty is coming out.

361
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,840
It's the first mile of water.

362
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,840
Why did you come in?

363
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,840
It's a bee.

364
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,840
It's a bee.

365
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,840
It's gone.

366
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,840
It's gone.

367
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,840
Why am I so stubborn?

368
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,840
Did I just lie on the bone?

369
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,840
Look at yourself.

370
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,840
It's full of honey.

371
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,840
It's full of honey.

372
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,840
It's full of honey.

373
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,840
It's full of honey.

374
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,840
It's full of honey.

375
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,840
It's full of honey.

376
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,840
It's full of honey.

377
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,840
Just don't look.

378
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,840
It's time to go.

379
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,840
Don't touch it.

380
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,840
There's another map here.

381
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,840
Is this all the way up?

382
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,840
Look.

383
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,840
There's nothing else.

384
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,840
If there's nothing else,

385
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,840
let's go up.

386
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,840
I don't want to be caught by bees.

387
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,840
You're so bitter, Fatty.

388
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,840
It's okay.

389
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,840
What?

390
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,840
I don't know.

391
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,840
What is it?

392
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,840
Is it a plant?

393
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,840
Fatty,

394
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,840
it's impossible to have a plant in this world.

395
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,840
Yes.

396
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,840
We've never seen a plant so fast.

397
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,840
Let's go.

398
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,840
Run, run, run.

399
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,840
Run, run.

400
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,840
Run.

401
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,840
Hurry up.

402
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,840
Wait, wait.

403
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,840
Hurry up.

404
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,840
Fatty, run.

405
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,840
Fatty.

406
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,840
Run this way.

407
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,840
Fatty, this way.

408
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,840
Run, run, run.

409
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,840
Wait.

410
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,840
This door is locked.

411
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,840
Why is it locked?

412
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,840
Wait.

413
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,840
Wait.

414
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,840
Wait.

415
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,840
Wait.

416
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,840
Wait.

417
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,840
Are you really hurt?

418
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,840
I've never been so sensitive.

419
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,840
What kind of place is this?

420
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,840
Is this a monster?

421
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,840
If I don't hurt him,

422
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,840
I'll be a monster.

423
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,840
Fatty,

424
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,840
there are so many sea lions.

425
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,840
Why don't they have a head?

426
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,840
Who said they don't have a head?

427
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,840
Dog head, cow head,

428
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,840
human head,

429
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,840
sheep head,

430
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,840
cow head.

431
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,840
We've entered a place

432
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,840
where monsters are in fact.

433
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,840
This whole place is a big stone hall.

434
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,840
Where are so many monsters?

435
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,840
Really.

436
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,840
Stop.

437
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,840
Xiao Ge.

438
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,840
Jiu Xing.

439
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,840
You don't know

440
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,840
how much we miss you.

441
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,840
Xiao Ge,

442
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,840
what is this?

443
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,840
Why is it so disgusting?

444
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,840
It's a pervert.

445
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,840
A kind of poison

446
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,840
that is in the bone.

447
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,840
It's the poison that's in the bone.

448
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,840
So the reason why

449
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,840
you're moving here

450
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,840
is because of the bone on the top?

451
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,840
Yes.

452
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,840
When the creature was alive,

453
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,840
it was in the flesh.

454
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,840
When the creature was dead,

455
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,840
they entered the surface.

456
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,840
Now they can smell

457
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,840
the new body.

458
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,840
They can touch them.

459
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,840
They need to find a new master.

460
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,840
Master and you...

461
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,840
A month ago...

462
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,840
No.

463
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,840
The bug is gone.

464
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,840
It's burnt.

465
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,840
Hurry.

466
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,840
Yes.

467
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,840
Master.

468
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,840
Come here.

469
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,840
Hurry.

470
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,840
Get out of here.

471
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,840
Okay.

472
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,840
Hurry.

473
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,840
Xiao Ge.

474
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,840
Xiao Ge.

475
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,840
Xiao Ge.

476
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,840
Master.

477
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,840
Xiao Ge.

478
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,840
Xiao Ge.

479
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,840
What are you doing here?

480
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,840
I'm going to kill you.

481
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,840
I'm afraid of you.

482
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,840
You know.

483
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,840
I'm afraid of you.

484
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,840
What is she talking about?

485
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,840
It's a good thing

486
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,840
that you're alive.

487
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,840
You're a good person.

488
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,840
You know what?

489
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,840
You're a good person.

490
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,840
You're a good person.

491
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,840
You're a good person.

492
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,840
You're a good person.

493
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,840
Xiao Ge.

494
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,840
Protect Tian Jun.

495
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,840
Fatty.

496
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,840
Fatty.

497
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,840
Come here.

498
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,840
Come on.

499
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,840
Come on.

500
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,840
Hurry.

501
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,840
Be careful.

502
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,840
They're inside.

503
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,840
Go inside.

504
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,840
Thank you.

505
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,840
Thank you for saving our master.

506
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,840
I'm the leader of this place.

507
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,840
Damao.

508
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,840
Leave your friends to us.

509
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,840
We can cure them.

510
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,840
When can our friends wake up?

511
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,840
The poison is special.

512
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,840
But we have antidote.

513
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,840
It's just that

514
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,840
the yellow wind has taken too much.

515
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,840
It's been a few days.

516
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,840
Where is the priest who came with us?

517
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,840
He stayed underground for too long.

518
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,840
His eyes are broken.

519
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,840
We're in the hospital.

520
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,840
We're asking you

521
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,840
what you're doing here.

522
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,840
We're here to pick up the wind.

523
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,840
We saw the building there.

524
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,840
We couldn't control our curiosity.

525
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,840
So we wanted to go down there.

526
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,840
But we didn't expect...

527
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,840
Anyway, thank you.

528
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,840
Thank you for saving our master.

529
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,840
Rest well.

530
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,840
He'll be back soon.

531
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,840
If you don't want to find him,

532
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,840
you'll never find him.

533
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,840
He's only interested

534
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,840
in his own interests.

535
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,840
Who wants me to go to the Xijin Palace?

536
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,840
If you really want to know

537
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,840
the secret behind the Wusan Star,

538
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,840
you must go to the Palace.

539
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,840
I'll go to the Palace.

540
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,840
You're so stupid.

541
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,840
Qian Shi,

542
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,840
don't go there.

543
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,840
I'm afraid I'll be in trouble.

544
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,840
Qian Shi.

545
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,840
Fatty.

546
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,840
Qian Shi.

547
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,840
Qian Shi.

548
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,840
Xiaoxiao,

549
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,840
you know their language.

550
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,840
Ask them what's going on.

551
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,840
Fatty is making a loud noise now.

552
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,840
It's okay.

553
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,840
Her voice

554
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,840
is not a voice that can be heard.

555
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,840
It's for the sake of the painting.

556
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,840
The loud noise is more beneficial.

557
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,840
Don't be greedy.

558
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,840
Xiaoxiao,

559
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,840
you know a lot.

560
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,840
And I feel like

561
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,840
you've lived with them.

562
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,840
You know their language.

563
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,840
Have you learned it?

564
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,840
I don't know.

565
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,840
I can tell it naturally.

566
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,840
I can't remember

567
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,840
anything else.

568
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,840
Xiaokai,

569
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,840
I'm so drunk.

570
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,840
The treatment is over.

571
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,840
Elder is asleep.

572
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,840
Keep your eyes open.

573
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,840
Thank you.

574
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,840
Don't thank us anymore.

575
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,840
We didn't do anything.

576
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,840
You don't know.

577
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,840
He's been missing for more than 40 years.

578
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,840
A lot of bad things happened

579
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,840
in the village that year.

580
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,840
No one was looking for Elder's whereabouts.

581
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,840
I didn't expect him to be alive.

582
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,840
I'm sorry.

583
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,840
Elder Kua Xiong disappeared.

584
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,840
He and this stone peach fell.

585
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,840
It's the same year that Snake Eye was stolen by the Taoist.

586
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,840
There must be something

587
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,840
between these words.

588
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,840
Wu Xie,

589
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,840
it's not just a common stone.

590
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,840
The underground palace

591
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,840
has been rebuilt by a lot of people.

592
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,840
There are many unknown mechanisms.

593
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,840
It's dangerous to continue walking.

594
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,840
When the fat man is recovered,

595
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,840
you can go back.

596
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,840
What are you looking for?

597
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,840
I'll help you.

598
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,840
Tell me who came here.

599
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,840
I just said

600
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,840
there's something more important

601
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,840
than Snake Eye Tong Yu.

602
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,840
I don't know what it is.

603
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,840
But Xiao Ge,

604
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,840
the underground palace is

605
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,840
especially like a person's handkerchief.

606
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,840
Plus the connection between Snake Eye Tong Yu

607
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,840
and me and Wang Pangzi

608
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,840
were also recommended in the underground palace.

609
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,840
This stone tower must be

610
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,840
connected to Wang Zang Hai.

611
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,840
Elder must know

612
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,840
what happened that year.

613
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,840
Why didn't you stop me?

614
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:53,160
To stop such門

615
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,160
Although you just woke up, you are still very weak.

616
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,160
If you have any questions, can you ask me again after the ceremony?

617
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,160
But...

618
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,160
Thank you.

619
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,160
Fatty?

620
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,160
You're awake?

621
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,160
How are you feeling?

622
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,160
Feeling unwell?

623
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,160
Feeling good.

624
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,160
Tianzhen.

625
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:32,160
You were hit on the butt.

626
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,160
You must tell me that the medicine on my butt was from you.

627
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,160
It wasn't me.

628
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,160
Then it was from Xiaoge.

629
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:46,160
Xiaoge, really, I'm very grateful.

630
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,160
Thank you.

631
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,160
It was me?

632
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,160
It's like this. You were seriously bitten by a poison.

633
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:00,160
If you didn't get rid of it in time, the wound would have been infected.

634
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,160
Please try your best.

635
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,160
No, no, no. I didn't blame you.

636
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,160
I'm grateful to you.

637
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,160
Except for my mom, no one has ever seen me...

638
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,160
I'm very grateful to you.

639
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,160
You're awake.

640
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,160
I'll get you some food.

641
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,160
You need to eat more.

642
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,160
Don't bother. I really don't need it.

643
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,160
It's okay. Have a good rest.

644
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,160
You...

645
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,160
Except for my mom, no one has ever seen me...

646
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,160
Don't laugh.

647
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,160
What's going on?

648
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,160
What's going on?

649
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,160
You were bitten by a poison.

650
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,160
Then the poison was infected.

651
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,160
Then the woman was hit on the butt.

652
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,160
Hey, I didn't say that.

653
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,160
I'm talking about you.

654
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,160
You...you...you...you...you...

655
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,160
You...you...you...you...

656
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,160
You...you...you...

657
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,160
What the hell is he?

658
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,160
And what you're looking for, what are you looking for?

659
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,160
Stop.

660
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,160
I don't know what you're talking about.

661
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,160
Don't ask me.

662
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,160
All the answers are on that old man.

663
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,160
Let's find out.

664
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,160
I asked him.

665
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,160
He just woke up.

666
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,160
To thank us for saving him,

667
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,160
he wanted to take a long-term banquet to pay us.

668
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,160
We need to wait until the banquet is over.

669
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,160
I...

670
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,160
I...

671
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,160
I...

672
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,160
I...

673
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,160
I...

674
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,160
I...

675
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,160
I...

676
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,160
I...

677
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,160
I...

678
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,160
I...

679
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,160
I...

680
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,160
I...

681
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,160
I...

682
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,160
I...

683
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,160
I...

684
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,160
I...

685
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,160
I...

686
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,160
I...

687
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,160
I...

688
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,160
I...

689
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,160
I...

690
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,160

691
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,160

692
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,160

693
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,160

This wine is...

770
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,160
Salty,

771
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,160
If I were you, I wouldn't come.

772
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:05,160
I've also tried to convince myself that I didn't succeed.

773
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,160
But there are some things that don't necessarily have to be a result.

774
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,160
Xiao Ge, you know the truth.

775
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,160
But you can't do it the same way.

776
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,160
Because we're different.

777
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,160
There's nothing different.

778
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,160
You guys are all fine.

779
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,160
You're all in the same boat.

780
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:39,160
But Xiao Ge, you're not a third uncle like him.

781
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,160
Fatty is right.

782
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,160
You're not Wu San Xing's opponent.

783
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,160
You shouldn't stop him.

784
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,160
Should I say it or not?

785
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,160
He's my third uncle.

786
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,160
Wu Xian, I don't mean it.

787
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,160
If you really want to go, I'll be with you.

788
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,160
Okay.

789
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,160
Let's talk about it.

790
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,160
It's getting late.

791
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,160
We'll meet the elder tomorrow morning.

792
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,160
Have a good rest.

793
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,160
I'm tired.

794
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,160
Hit it!

795
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,160
Hit it!

796
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,160
Hit it!

797
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,160
Hit it!

798
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,160
Hit it!

799
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,160
Hit it!

800
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,160
Hit it!

801
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,160
Hit it!

802
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,160
Hit it!

803
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,160
Hit it!

804
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,160
Hit it!

805
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,160
Hit it!

806
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,160
Hit it!

807
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,160
Hit it!

808
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,160
Third uncle.

809
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,160
Why are you here?

810
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,160
I came from the back.

811
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,160
No one saw me.

812
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,160
I'm afraid you'll run away.

813
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,160
Understand?

814
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,160
What's the matter?

815
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:30,160
That kid who helped the kid to get into the palace.

816
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,160
He's investigating Xie Yuchen's case.

817
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,160
I think it's not easy.

818
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,160
Xie Yuchen helped him to investigate your case.

819
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,160
If these two things are connected,

820
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,160
I'm afraid he won't be able to do it.

821
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,160
Pan Zi.

822
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,160
Don't worry about me.

823
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,160
I've said it many times.

824
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,160
Just keep an eye on that kid.

825
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,160
Don't let him die.

826
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,160
It's none of your business.

827
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,160
Understand?

828
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,160
Yes.

829
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,160
Pan Zi, it's been so many years.

830
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,160
We live in the streets every day.

831
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,160
Sometimes, we think that we can only live in this way.

832
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,160
So one day,

833
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,160
I'll be in some kind of accident.

834
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,160
Thank you for taking care of me.

835
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,160
And also,

836
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,160
taking care of the kid without shoes.

837
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,160
That's the only thing in the Wu Family.

838
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,160
What are you talking about?

839
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,160
You're really dying.

840
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,160
Okay, Pan Zi.

841
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,160
Pan Zi.

842
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,160
I'm telling you.

843
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,160
Don't forget that

844
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,160
you take care of Sanye.

845
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,160
Don't worry.

846
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:42,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

847
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:58,160
時光的風 心臟抵折 盛開燦爛的花 彼止的指向 起風 飛向

848
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:22,340
愛的風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風 飛向 起風
