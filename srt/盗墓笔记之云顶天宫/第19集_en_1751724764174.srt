Episode 15

3
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,000
Who is it?

4
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,400
Pan Zi?

5
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,800
Little Third Master?

6
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,320
Little Third Master, I finally found you!

7
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,080
Little Third Master, are you okay?

8
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,200
I'm fine, I'm fine.

9
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,880
Little Third Master, I'm sorry.

10
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,040
It's all my fault.

11
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,760
I'm sorry, Little Third Master.

12
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,520
I didn't take good care of you.

13
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,880
It's good that you found me.

14
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,520
It's good that you found me.

15
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,880
I always feel like I'm being surrounded and being locked up.

16
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,960
Shun Zi,

17
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,000
tell me more about it.

18
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,760
When Third Master told you this,

19
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,680
what happened?

20
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,880
If not,

21
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,360
this one sentence is too much.

22
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,000
I don't know where to start.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,640
About a month ago,

24
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,320
I took a group of guests to the mountain.

25
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,840
They weren't as good as you.

26
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,080
They were just walking around,

27
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,040
looking at snowy mountains.

28
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,760
Third Master was among them.

29
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,120
Later, when it was late at night,

30
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,480
he suddenly called me out.

31
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,600
He was so mysterious.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,160
Then he told me

33
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,360
that he wanted me to wait for a person

34
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,160
called Wu Xie at this time,

35
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,560
and then take them to the mountain.

36
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,160
He said that as long as I took you to him,

37
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,440
he would give me a lot of money.

38
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,880
That is, the words he said to me

39
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,040
at that time.

40
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:33,880
Oh, right.

41
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,840
He also emphasized that

42
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,280
as long as it's you, you'll understand.

43
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,920
Shun Zi,

44
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,560
he really said that.

45
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,160
As long as it's you, you'll understand.

46
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,640
We don't understand.

47
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,200
Why is that?

48
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,800
I wish it was you.

49
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,480
Tian Zhen,

50
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,480
think about it.

51
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,400
Think about it.

52
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,560
What is different about you from us?

53
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,800
What's different?

54
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,840
You're greedy for money, I'm not.

55
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,320
You're greedy for money, I'm not either.

56
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,720
Shun Zi,

57
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,480
why did you tell me about this

58
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,040
after we separated from my father?

59
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm not stupid.

60
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,240
When I saw you,

61
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,200
I thought you people had something going on.

62
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,240
It should be that two different people

63
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,040
were mixed together.

64
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,360
I didn't know what they were doing at that time,

65
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,920
so I had to pretend to be stupid.

66
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,600
After all, I took the third master's deposit.

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,360
In case something goes wrong,

68
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,920
it won't be good to delay your business.

69
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,280
Then you're pretty accurate.

70
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,160
Why do I feel it's not that simple?

71
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,600
Why do I feel

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,480
you seem to be the third master?

73
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,400
Do you have any other news?

74
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,120
There are many ancient legends in this mountain.

75
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,040
We've encountered many strange things.

76
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,400
Every year, there are many people

77
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,960
who are going to the mountain for various purposes.

78
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,240
You don't know, do you?

79
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,680
You know a little bit.

80
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,560
So,

81
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,360
when I saw you guys going to the mountain,

82
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,240
I guess what you were doing.

83
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,160
If it weren't for the third master's order,

84
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,840
when there was a snowstorm in the mountain,

85
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,560
I wouldn't let you go any further.

86
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,080
Another spy.

87
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,200
Brother Peng,

88
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,480
I'm a real man.

89
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,480
I won't lie.

90
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,680
The amount of money the third master promised me

91
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,080
is enough for me to live for two lifetimes.

92
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,400
So, no matter what,

93
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,880
I have to bring you guys to him.

94
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,040
You guys should think about

95
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,480
what that sentence means.

96
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,480
Only I can understand this sentence.

97
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,880
You guys can't understand it.

98
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,640
It means that

99
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,000
it's definitely not his handwriting.

100
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,640
This sentence is...

101
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,720
It's the writing of this character.

102
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,040
The writing of this character.

103
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,520
This is the dialect of Hangzhou.

104
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,800
Your third uncle's trick is good.

105
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,480
It's the message of Hangzhou dialect.

106
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,960
The place where the black and white master died.

107
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,240
How do you say it?

108
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,680
The place where the black and white master died.

109
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,640
Right?

110
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,680
What you said is so strange.

111
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,560
I don't understand Hangzhou dialect.

112
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,240
But the place where the black and white master died.

113
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,360
It's like what you said.

114
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,520
It's our job.

115
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,480
We just heard the black and white master

116
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,760
and went to Fengshui.

117
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,880
We can't think of anything else.

118
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,120
Right, Pan Zi.

119
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,240
You've been in Hangzhou for so many years.

120
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,320
Why didn't you think of it?

121
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,720
I'm not smart.

122
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,280
If I'm smart,

123
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,360
do you think third master

124
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,880
would still do such a dangerous thing?

125
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,120
I don't understand anything about third master.

126
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,480
All right.

127
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,160
Don't worry.

128
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,320
Third master is old.

129
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,200
He's very tough.

130
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,280
Even if something happens,

131
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,560
he won't wait until now.

132
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,520
We just have to take care of ourselves.

133
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,200
Now we're being led by your third uncle.

134
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,480
He can give us this clue.

135
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,080
It means he knows more than we do.

136
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,480
The black and white master died.

137
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,200
This is not what he usually says.

138
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,160
It sounds more like a play in a ancient book.

139
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,320
I suspect

140
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,080
my third uncle went to Xisha

141
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,800
to get the information there.

142
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,760
And Ning's destination

143
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,640
is not the bottom of the sea,

144
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,720
but the sky.

145
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,160
Will Ning go alone in the bottom of the sea

146
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,680
and get the key information

147
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,520
from the sky

148
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,200
just like your third uncle?

149
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,040
No way.

150
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,480
If he can get the key information,

151
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,880
it will take...

152
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,360
You...

153
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,000
Throw it away.

154
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,640
I've already thrown it away.

155
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,360
I'm serious.

156
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,800
Let's go.

157
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,240
You...

158
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,720
Boss.

159
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,680
What's going on?

160
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,960
How did you get here?

161
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,440
How long did it take?

162
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,440
We've been walking here for a day.

163
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,040
How is this road so long?

164
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,320
Boss,

165
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,680
I feel something's wrong.

166
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,240
We might have been hit by

167
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,400
some kind of trap or formation.

168
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,160
There's no way it's this long.

169
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,960
We can't waste our energy anymore.

170
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,800
Find a way to get out of here.

171
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
I'll go with you.

172
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800
You go with me.

173
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
I'll go with you.

174
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,800
I'll go with you.

175
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,880
You find someone to check the road.

176
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,440
The rest of you, rest here.

177
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,160
Yes.

178
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,880
Let's go.

179
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,960
Why did he sleep for so long?

180
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,280
Unwrap his clothes.

181
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
What should we do?

182
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
What should we do?

183
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Hold him.

184
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,800
Let's go.

185
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,480
Can't we follow the water flowy?

186
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,760
If the water's running out,

187
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,760
what should we do?

188
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,800
Why does this

189
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,840
lead to another harsh ravine?

190
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,000
Why are we feeling so nervous?

191
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,680
Can't we drive through here?

192
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,160
Why would it not be possible?

193
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,280
This was not made by you.

194
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,800
I was so worried.

195
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,680
Despite 2015,

196
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,960
I felt a feeling ofст月

197
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,320
Yes,

198
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,800
you were?

199
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,040
Don't push it.

200
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,960
Take some break and shut up.

201
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,400
Haven't you been awake for too long?

202
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,440
There might be a way.

203
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,880
We can see another way.

204
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,600
I'll hide it.

205
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
It's not that it's all water.

206
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,000
Could it be that the craftsmen back then were all

207
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
stupid and could swim?

208
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
There's a mark here.

209
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,600
I remember now.

210
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Tianzhen, where have we seen this mark?

211
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Oh my god.

212
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,600
There's something like a eagle here.

213
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,600
I remember now.

214
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,600
We saw this mark in the underwater tomb.

215
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
I was still guessing

216
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
that this mark could be left by Third Uncle

217
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,600
or the archaeological team.

218
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
I've been following Third Master for 10 years.

219
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
This big and small hole has collapsed a lot.

220
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,600
I've never seen Third Master leave this mark.

221
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,600
Moreover,

222
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,600
this mark can't be left by Third Master.

223
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,600
Who else is there?

224
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Anyway, no matter what, this path should be right.

225
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Someone has already entered this cave.

226
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
The entrance to the underground palace should be right below here.

227
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,600
The problem now is

228
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,600
if we should go there now.

229
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
What's wrong?

230
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Where's Xiao Ge?

231
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Xiao Ge!

232
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Isn't he the one who came to Wei Ying to go to Wudong?

233
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
No need to explain to us.

234
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,600
But the key is

235
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,600
that we must come back

236
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600
at this dangerous moment.

237
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,600
No, but we have so many people.

238
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Is that Xiao Ge?

239
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,600
Then he...

240
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,600
Are you okay?

241
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,600
God bless you.

242
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,600
When I come back,

243
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,600
I'll give you a big red envelope.

244
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,600
You still have God?

245
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Who?

246
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,600
Cao Cao.

247
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Tianzhen, look.

248
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
The footprints are slanted.

249
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
Oh my god.

250
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
How many people came before us?

251
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Hurry up.

252
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,600
Hurry up.

253
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,600
Hurry up.

254
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,600
There must be more than a thousand bottles.

255
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,600
You put so much wine in the grave.

256
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:44,340
This king of the

257
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,700
All this wine has a sp印ed thread...

258
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,900
and has been какой an oil.

259
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,480
It's this way already.

260
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,700
G solution

261
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,700
You think too much about current- passedness.

262
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,140
T lang zil

263
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,140
Look.

264
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,640
They don't even want to give the ginger.

265
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,560
A few days ago.

266
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,060
This temperature identify for theSevilla.

267
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,060
We've used several cooking methods...

268
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,220
to test the scenes.

269
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:22,860
But none of them are JUDGE,

270
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,060
sci indie and control...

271
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,300
and occupies the temperature我们在您的…

272
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,300
i3.

273
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,120
This temperature or theeeeee3 means temperature,

274
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,380
of course,

275
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,140
is a superior standard of test.

276
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,920
We set the average temperature on 0 degrees to identify...

277
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,120
the temperature.

278
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,760
This makes S不LT and S is called S2.

279
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,380
S3 actually course.

280
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,380
You know, the wine is not only good for your health,

281
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,380
but also for your health.

282
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,380
If you dig a lot of wine in the ancient tomb of Henan,

283
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,380
you will find a lot of wine

284
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,380
that has been in the tomb for three thousand years.

285
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,380
You will not know how much wine

286
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,380
it has been drinking.

287
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,380
Fatty.

288
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,380
What?

289
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,380
Are you crazy?

290
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,380
You dare to eat the things in the tomb?

291
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,380
You will die if you don't eat them.

292
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,380
It's okay.

293
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,380
I am just hungry.

294
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,380
It's a snake.

295
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,380
What are you doing?

296
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,380
You two take a look.

297
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,380
What's inside?

298
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,380
Dead child.

299
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,380
What dead child?

300
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,380
This third master told me

301
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,380
that this is the monkey that has not yet become a shape.

302
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,380
The wine he made is called monkey head burn.

303
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,380
I don't know if I can live a long life after drinking it.

304
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:38,380
But the effect of the sheep is definitely there.

305
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,380
Fatty.

306
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,380
How about you try it?

307
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,380
Luckily, the traitor has something to remind you.

308
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,380
How about I let you drink first before kicking the bucket?

309
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,380
You are so thin.

310
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,380
Han Yelin.

311
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,380
But it's no use for me to drink.

312
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,380
Then how about you drink now?

313
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,380
I am done.

314
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,380
I am leaving.

315
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,380
Where are you going?

316
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,380
This way.

317
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,380
Someone left a mark for us.

318
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,380
When did you lead the way?

319
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,380
Go to the back.

320
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,380
What a rare guest.

321
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,380
You came to me

322
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:47,380
to ask for something?

323
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,380
I have never dealt with Uncle Hai before.

324
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,380
I almost missed a master of the art.

325
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,380
What are you talking about?

326
00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:01,380
I only have some old books, old paintings, old newspapers.

327
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,380
And this old watch.

328
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,380
They are all old.

329
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,380
Old newspapers, old paintings, old newspapers.

330
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,380
And this old watch.

331
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,380
They are all worthless things.

332
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,380
Compared to the business of Mr. Hua,

333
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:18,380
how can you talk about the master of the art?

334
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,380
Uncle Hai is making fun of me.

335
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,380
He can make the final product like Uncle Hai.

336
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,380
He can't even recognize the museum.

337
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,380
In the past,

338
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,380
he must have been called a great artist.

339
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,380
I think except Uncle Hai,

340
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:42,380
no one knows how many relics

341
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,380
were taken away.

342
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,380
It's just a small fight.

343
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,380
It's not that big of a deal.

344
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,380
By the way,

345
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,380
you came this time,

346
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,380
so you don't know, right?

347
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,380
This matter

348
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,380
is still under Wu Sanxing's control.

349
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,380
Mr. Hua,

350
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,380
actually, there are some things

351
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,380
you shouldn't ask me.

352
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,380
The businessmen

353
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,380
should have their own professional skills.

354
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,380
Am I right?

355
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,380
In the Northeast, too?

356
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,380
Okay.

357
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,380
Good boy.

358
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,380
You are indeed the descendant of Mr. Xie.

359
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,380
I don't know

360
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,380
where you got this information.

361
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,380
But I'll tell you.

362
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,380
What you want,

363
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,380
you go find someone

364
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,380
who is closer to you.

365
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,380
He knows more.

366
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,380
You should go find him.

367
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,380
Boss,

368
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,380
it's the same as before.

369
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,380
We can't go to the bottom.

370
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,380
The smoke can't reach the bottom.

371
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,380
We didn't use signal bullets.

372
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,380
It's all wooden structures.

373
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,380
I'm afraid of burning.

374
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,380
Still no signal.

375
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,380
It's the Imperial Tomb.

376
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,380
There must be some masters

377
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,380
who have set up a powerful formation.

378
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,380
But we don't know that.

379
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,380
Master Sanxing.

380
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,380
Master Sanxing.

381
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,380
Master Sanxing.

382
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,380
You are awake.

383
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,380
Master Sanxing.

384
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,380
I'm glad you are awake.

385
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,380
How do you feel?

386
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,380
I have some painkillers.

387
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,380
Thank you.

388
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,380
I'm sorry.

389
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,380
I'm sorry.

390
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,380
I'm sorry.

391
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,380
I'm sorry.

392
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,380
I'm sorry.

393
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,380
I'm sorry.

394
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,380
I'm sorry.

395
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,380
I'm sorry.

396
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,380
I'm sorry.

397
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,380
I'm sorry.

398
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,380
I'm sorry.

399
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,380
I'm sorry.

400
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,380
I'm sorry.

401
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,380
I'm sorry.

402
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,380
I'm sorry.

403
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,380
I'm sorry.

404
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,380
I'm sorry.

405
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,380
I'm sorry.

406
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,380
I'm sorry.

407
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,380
I'm sorry.

408
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,380
I'm sorry.

409
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,380
I'm sorry.

410
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,380
I'm sorry.

411
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,380
I'm sorry.

412
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,380
I'm sorry.

413
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,380
I'm sorry.

414
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,380
I'm sorry.

415
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,380
I'm sorry.

416
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,380
I'm sorry.

417
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,380
I'm sorry.

418
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,380
I'm sorry.

419
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,380
I'm sorry.

420
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,380
I'm sorry.

421
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,380
I'm sorry.

422
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,380
I'm sorry.

423
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,380
I'm sorry.

424
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,380
I'm sorry.

425
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,380
I'm sorry.

426
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,380
I'm sorry.

427
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,380
I'm sorry.

428
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,380
I'm sorry.

429
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,380
I'm sorry.

430
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,380
I'm sorry.

431
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,380
I'm sorry.

432
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,380
I'm sorry.

433
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,380
I'm sorry.

434
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,380
I'm sorry.

435
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,380
I'm sorry.

436
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,380
I'm sorry.

437
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,380
I'm sorry.

438
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,380
I'm sorry.

439
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,380
I'm sorry.

440
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,380
I'm sorry.

441
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,380
I'm sorry.

442
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,380
I'm sorry.

443
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,380
I'm sorry.

444
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,380
I'm sorry.

445
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,380
I'm sorry.

446
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:59,740
Come on.

447
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,740
The ghosts often appear in the desert.

448
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,740
But it's not dangerous.

449
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,740
Let's go.

450
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,740
What is this? Is this a door?

451
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,740
This is not a door.

452
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,740
If you can't open it, it's not a door.

453
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,740
This is a piece of rock.

454
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,740
It's made of big pieces of stone.

455
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,740
This is a piece of rock.

456
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,740
It's made of big pieces of stone.

457
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,740
Then it's sealed with copper water.

458
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,740
It's frozen into a whole.

459
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,740
It looks like a door.

460
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,740
It seems that this path is quite important.

461
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,740
If we follow those signs and go down,

462
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,740
we can get to the center of the underground palace.

463
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:14,740
And look at this hole.

464
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,740
No matter who it is, it may have entered.

465
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,740
Fatty, be careful.

466
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,740
What's inside?

467
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,740
It's a path.

468
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,740
There's a stone.

469
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:45,200
It seems that this

470
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
is a safe place.

471
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
Don't talk nonsense.

472
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200
There are three locks in your house.

473
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
There are at least three pieces of stone.

474
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,200
This is called the three thousand worlds.

475
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,200
Do you understand?

476
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
Do you remember that my house has three locks?

477
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
Who knows how many locks you have?

478
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,660
How many locks do you have?

479
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,660
I'm sorry.

480
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,660
I'm sorry.

481
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,660
I'm sorry.

482
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,660
I'm sorry.

483
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,660
I'm sorry.

484
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,660
I'm sorry.

485
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,660
I'm sorry.

486
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,660
I'm sorry.

487
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,660
I'm sorry.

488
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,660
I'm sorry.

489
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,660
I'm sorry.

490
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,660
I'm sorry.

491
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,660
I'm sorry.

492
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,660
I'm sorry.

493
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,660
I'm sorry.

494
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,660
I'm sorry.

495
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,660
I'm sorry.

496
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,660
I'm sorry.

497
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,660
I'm sorry.

498
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,660
I'm sorry.

499
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,660
I'm sorry.

500
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,660
I'm sorry.

501
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,660
I'm sorry.

502
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,660
I'm sorry.

503
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,660
I'm sorry.

504
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,660
I'm sorry.

505
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,660
I'm sorry.

506
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,660
I'm sorry.

507
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,660
I'm sorry.

508
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,120
This must be the main road.

509
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,120
It's straight to the main road of the fruit shop.

510
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,120
The entire mid-line of the underground palace.

511
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
Otherwise,

512
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,120
there's no reason for it to be so gorgeous.

513
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,120
Then come over and take a look.

514
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,120
See if there are any previous signs.

515
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,120
Let's go.

516
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:50,120
There's a symbol here.

517
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,120
Isn't this the thunderbolt of the探學界?

518
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:55,580
Let's just follow this sign and go.

519
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,580
Right?

520
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,580
I'm telling you, this must be a little guy.

521
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,580
Although he's missing,

522
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,580
he's always thinking about us.

523
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,580
Let's go.

524
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,580
Wait a minute.

525
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:06,580
This symbol is completely different from the previous two symbols.

526
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,580
Look at these symbols.

527
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,580
Although they are all made up of letters,

528
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,580
but they don't make any sense when they are put together.

529
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,580
It doesn't look like French or German.

530
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,580
At first, I thought it was just a simple sign.

531
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,580
It's like a simple pattern.

532
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,040
It just tells us that we can go this way.

533
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,040
That's all.

534
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,040
But that symbol itself won't change.

535
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,040
Look.

536
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,040
But now the symbol has changed.

537
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,040
So it means it must have other meanings.

538
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,040
While it's pointing at us,

539
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,040
it also wants to tell us some other information.

540
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,040
For example,

541
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,040
the two symbols we saw before,

542
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,040
they are safe to walk on.

543
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:47,040
But now this symbol is different.

544
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:51,040
So it means that it's dangerous to go in this direction.

545
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,500
So we're not going to leave?

546
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,500
Little Third Master,

547
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,500
you're the only one who can speak foreign languages.

548
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,500
Take a good look.

549
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,500
You can't translate the whole sentence.

550
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,500
What do you mean by making up some words?

551
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,500
But it's not a word.

552
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,500
It can't be translated.

553
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,500
I think we should think about who left it.

554
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,500
What's the purpose of leaving it?

555
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,500
If it's not Little Brother, who could it be?

556
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,500
If it's Little Brother,

557
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,500
then it's not a good idea.

558
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,960
If it's Little Brother,

559
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,960
then at least it should be in a way that we can understand.

560
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,960
Then it's Ning and the others.

561
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,960
Their internal code.

562
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,960
They're doing their own thing here,

563
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,960
and then they make a mark here.

564
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,960
I don't think this symbol means it's dangerous.

565
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,960
We need to know if it's dangerous before we go.

566
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,960
It's not possible to make a mark after we go.

567
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,960
It's not scientific.

568
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,960
I understand.

569
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,960
This symbol is carved by the person when he entered the tomb.

570
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,960
It means he went in this direction.

571
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,420
This is called tracking language.

572
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,420
What is it?

573
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,420
When I was training in Vietnam,

574
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,420
I learned to track knowledge and language.

575
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,420
Simply put,

576
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,420
if a person is lost in the jungle,

577
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:05,420
he must carve some symbols and markings on his way.

578
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,420
When the rescue team arrives,

579
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,420
they will know his situation through the symbols and markings.

580
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,420
These symbols and markings are usually very regular.

581
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,420
For example, when there is enough food,

582
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,420
it's a symbol.

583
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,420
When there is little food, it's a symbol.

584
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,880
When someone is in danger, it's another symbol.

585
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,880
When it's more dangerous,

586
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,880
the rescue team can raise the rescue standard according to the symbol.

587
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,880
This was invented by the Vietnamese in Vietnam.

588
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,880
Okay, you've learned it.

589
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,880
Then you should translate it.

590
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,880
The question is...

591
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,880
Qi Qian!

592
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,880
Qi Qian!

593
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,880
How did this thing get there?

594
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,880
Shunzi!

595
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,880
Shunzi!

596
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,880
Will he change into the fox spirit again?

597
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,880
Hey!

598
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,880
I thought you were going to change again.

599
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,880
What's wrong with you?

600
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,880
I could hear your voice and movements clearly just now.

601
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,880
But I just couldn't move it.

602
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,880
There's only one sound in my head that's bothering me.

603
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,880
I want to wake up.

604
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,880
But I just couldn't do it.

605
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,880
Until he hit me.

606
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,880
What does it sound like to disturb you?

607
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,880
I...

608
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,340
I just couldn't do it.

609
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,340
But my intuition tells me it's very dangerous now.

610
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,340
Let's leave quickly.

611
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,340
If anything happens,

612
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,340
you won't have a chance to stay here.

613
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,340
Hurry up, let's go.

614
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,340
Then we need to figure out this symbol first.

615
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,340
Pan Zi, haven't you learned it?

616
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,340
Hurry up and translate it.

617
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,340
This symbol is different from what I've learned.

618
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,340
I've never seen such a symbol.

619
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,340
But the change in this symbol...

620
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,340
does it mean that person is out of control?

621
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,340
No, if it's like this,

622
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,800
then the person who left the symbol is out of control.

623
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,800
Then we're just busy walking around like this.

624
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,800
According to me,

625
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,800
we're just chatting here for a long time.

626
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,800
It's useless.

627
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,800
Because this symbol is not for us.

628
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,800
According to me,

629
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,800
we should just walk our own way.

630
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,800
It's just a path. What's the big deal?

631
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,800
You should have said it earlier.

632
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,800
We don't have to waste time on this symbol.

633
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,800
Hurry up and go.

634
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,800
We need to be careful.

635
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,800
There might be a mechanism to leave and turn the board.

636
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,260
Let's go.

637
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,260
Let me tell you, we still have a long way to go.

638
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,260
Even if there's a mechanism,

639
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,260
they will destroy it first.

640
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,260
Let's go.

641
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,260
Oh my goodness.

642
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,260
My grandma.

643
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,260
What did I say?

644
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,260
What did I say?

645
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,260
What did I say?

646
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,260
The broken national treasury of Nansong,

647
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,260
the national treasury of Nuzhen,

648
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,260
is ruined now.

649
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,260
Oh my goodness.

650
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,260
I'm so thirsty.

651
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,260
I feel so comfortable.

652
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,260
Shun Zi, what are you looking at?

653
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,260
Shun Zi.

654
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,260
What else can be fresh?

655
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,260
Shun Zi.

656
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,260
Shun Zi.

657
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,260
I say,

658
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,260
these people have been dead for a long time.

659
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,260
Are they our peers?

660
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,260
Judging from their clothes,

661
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,260
they are the most popular in the 80s and 90s.

662
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,260
Do you think these people are the ones who picked up the medicine

663
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,260
or the hunters?

664
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,260
Impossible.

665
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,260
We are professional,

666
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,260
and we are here.

667
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,720
How could those wild fish get here?

668
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,720
Impossible.

669
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,720
Be careful.

670
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,720
Shanghai watch.

671
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,720
Old style.

672
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,180
This woman has a long history.

673
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,180
This watch, even if it was the mayor's level,

674
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,180
it was hard to have such a watch.

675
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,180
If she disappeared,

676
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,180
it would have been a big deal.

677
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,180
Shun Zi,

678
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,180
at that time,

679
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,180
did you have a very shocking disappearance?

680
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,180
Shun Zi.

681
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,180
Shun Zi, I'm talking to you.

682
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,180
Shun Zi.

683
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,180
Shun Zi.

684
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,180
Shun Zi.

685
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,180
Dad.

686
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,180
Dad.

687
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,180
Sir.

688
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,180
Thank you.

689
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,180
You're welcome.

690
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,180
I hope you don't tell Qiu Decao

691
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,180
about my awakening.

692
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,180
I can guarantee you the third time,

693
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,180
but I can't guarantee you the fourth time.

694
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,180
I'm sorry.

695
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,180
I'm sorry.

696
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,640
I'm sorry.

697
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,640
Qiu Decao didn't tell you

698
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,640
what he was going to do

699
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,640
when he met the sky?

700
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,640
Just like you.

701
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,640
Not the same.

702
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,640
How old is Qiu Decao?

703
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,640
Do you know his body?

704
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,640
What do you want to say?

705
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,640
I want you to think about it.

706
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,640
A person at such an old age

707
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,640
can run, can jump,

708
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,640
can climb snow mountains.

709
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,100
Of course.

710
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,100
You won't believe

711
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,100
if you don't see it.

712
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,100
When it comes out,

713
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,100
you can observe it.

714
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,100
When some people were born,

715
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,100
they were kissed by God.

716
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,100
They have a talent that surpasses ordinary people.

717
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,100
His is not God.

718
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,100
It's a devil.

719
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,100
A devil in the tomb.

720
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,100
I'm sorry.

721
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,100
I'm sorry.

722
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,100
You stay here

723
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,100
until it's over.

724
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,100
You're not allowed to go out.

725
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,100
Why did you do that?

726
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,100
Are you afraid

727
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,560
of Qiu Decao's plan?

728
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,560
I can solve it with him.

729
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,560
Grandma, people say you're a heroine.

730
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,560
Are you afraid?

731
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,560
What did you do

732
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,560
with Qiu Decao?

733
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,560
How did he convince you?

734
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,560
Why did you give up the truth?

735
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,560
You didn't investigate it.

736
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,560
He's too naive.

737
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,560
Why?

738
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,560
Give me money.

739
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,020
Give me money.

740
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,020
Give me money.

741
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,020
Give me money.

742
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,020
You're a good person.

743
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,020
You're a good person.

744
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,020
God has a lot of good things for you.

745
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,020
I'm not going to let you go.

746
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,020
Let us bring you here.

747
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,020
To find your father.

748
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:43,020
So,

749
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,020
don't bother about his hair.

750
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,020
When you're done, you won't have any left.

751
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,020
Thank you.

752
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,020
Shunzi,

753
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,020
take care.

754
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,020
I always feel that

755
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,020
the people who appeared here

756
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:11,020
are a bit strange.

757
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,020
What's so strange about that?

758
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,020
Look,

759
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,020
Shunzi's father didn't say anything.

760
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,020
It's their guide.

761
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,020
What about the rest of them?

762
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:29,020
They also had to enter here

763
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,020
when they were about to leave.

764
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,020
That means they're not ordinary tourists.

765
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,020
Isn't that strange?

766
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,020
These things

767
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,020
can't prove

768
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,020
their identities.

769
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,020
These things

770
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,020
can't prove their identities.

771
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:07,020
They don't even have an ID.

772
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,020
But all of these things

773
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,020
you stole,

774
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,020
they can definitely go out.

775
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,020
Then why can't they go out?

776
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,020
Don't you think it's strange?

777
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,020
Anyway,

778
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,020
they were able to go out.

779
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,020
They should die on the way out.

780
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,020
But they're just sitting here.

781
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,020
Sitting here is like...

782
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,020
Waiting for death.

783
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,020
Are they reluctant

784
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,020
to give up these treasures?

785
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,020
Don't talk nonsense.

786
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:37,020
Did you notice

787
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,020
one thing missing?

788
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,020
What's missing?

789
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:43,020
Food. Look.

790
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,020
They ate it all.

791
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,020
They didn't die by accident.

792
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,020
They were just sitting here.

793
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,020
They were just sitting there.

794
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,020
They were just sitting there.

795
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,020
They were just sitting there.

796
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,020
They were just sitting there.

797
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,020
They were just sitting there.

798
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,020
They were just sitting there.

799
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,020
They were just sitting there.

800
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,020
They were just sitting there.

801
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,020
They were just sitting there.

802
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,020
They were just sitting there.

803
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,020
They were just sitting there.

804
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,020
They were just sitting there.

805
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:29,020
They were just sitting there.

806
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,020
The mark of a thousand years

807
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,020
is engraved in the sky.

808
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:36,020
The lonely

809
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,020
Following the clouds, following the wind,

810
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:50,020
I've forgotten how to resist the wind.

811
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:53,020
I've passed through the night,

812
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:57,020
I've found the answer in the darkness.

813
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,020
The call of time hadi

814
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:20,900
with
