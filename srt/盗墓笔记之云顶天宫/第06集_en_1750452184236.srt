1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

8
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,580
The Go Fighting

9
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,740
Episode 35

10
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,740
Ah!

11
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,740
Ah!

12
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:50,740
Ah!

13
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,740
Ah!

14
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,740
Ah!

15
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,740
Fatty!

16
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,740
Ah!

17
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,740
I can't hold it anymore!

18
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,740
Ah!

19
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,740
Ah!

20
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,740
Ah!

21
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,740
Thank you, sir.

22
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,740
You guys are so greedy.

23
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,740
You even want to dig the bottom of the palace's wine cellar?

24
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:52,740
I think Wu San Xing's head must have been kicked by a donkey.

25
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,740
No, I don't know if he was kicked by a donkey or not.

26
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,740
But Fatty was so drunk that he couldn't even lift his head.

27
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,740
Didn't you feel that way?

28
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,740
You two were both in the same boat.

29
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,740
Wu San Xing was in Hangzhou and was kicked by a donkey.

30
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,740
And you were kicked by a donkey in Shanghai.

31
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,740
Right?

32
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,740
Sir, it's none of our business.

33
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,740
That man was sent by Jason.

34
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,740
Why did that yellow-haired monkey bring you here?

35
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,740
Because Wu San Xing blocked his way.

36
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,740
So that monkey wanted to take you with him and talk to Wu San Xing.

37
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,740
What is he thinking? How do I know?

38
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,740
I don't know them as well as you do.

39
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,740
Right, sir?

40
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,740
Little bastard, don't play with me.

41
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,740
No, he didn't.

42
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,740
I mean, sir, don't play with us.

43
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,740
We're too young to be your backup.

44
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,740
So we need you to be more considerate.

45
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,740
Right?

46
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,740
Forget it.

47
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,740
How much more do you know about this guy?

48
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,740
Yes, yes.

49
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,740
I'll tell you the truth.

50
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,740
The place we're going to go to is not the same.

51
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:05,740
So Wu San Xing wanted me to tell you the truth.

52
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:13,740
I can say that the place we're going to go to is not the same as the one in the modern world.

53
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,740
No, sir.

54
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,740
We're too young to be your backup.

55
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,740
We've seen it before.

56
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,740
We've seen the fox in the imperial palace.

57
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,740
What did you just say?

58
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,740
What did he say?

59
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,740
Sir, what did you just say?

60
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,740
The Grand Master of Jiu Long and the Emperor of Dong Xia?

61
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,740
Didn't Wu San Xing tell you?

62
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,740
No, we knew that we were here for the Cloud Sky Palace.

63
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,740
I don't care if you're Cloud Sky or Sky Palace.

64
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:51,740
What I want to say is that the Emperor of Dong Xia is buried in the Cloud Sky Palace.

65
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,740
Sir, what does the Grand Master of Jiu Long mean?

66
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,740
Who is the Emperor of Dong Xia?

67
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,740
If you're not afraid, you can't just go back.

68
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,740
No.

69
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,740
You're still so weak.

70
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,740
You're so embarrassing.

71
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,740
You're so embarrassing.

72
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,740
Why did you just fall into the palace?

73
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,740
Why are you so useless?

74
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,740
You're almost done.

75
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,740
You still treat me like a fool.

76
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,740
Do you know who he is?

77
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,740
Really?

78
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,740
A fool?

79
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,740
No, no, no.

80
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,740
Call me a fool.

81
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,740
I'll call you a fool.

82
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,740
Call me a fool.

83
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,740
Hurry up.

84
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,740
Look, Grand Master.

85
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,740
The Grand Master of Jiu Long is ready to give it all.

86
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,740
He brought all the disciples and the people.

87
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,740
Is there any secret deal with that red hat?

88
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,740
It's hard to say.

89
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,740
Did the Emperor of Dong Xia's Emperor and the Emperor of Cloud Sky Palace

90
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,740
live in the same place?

91
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,740
I don't know.

92
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,740
But Wang San Hai always likes to change people's mind.

93
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,740
It's possible that the Emperor of Dong Xia and the Emperor of Cloud Sky Palace

94
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,740
live in the same place.

95
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,740
Otherwise, in Changbai Mountain,

96
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,740
there are two red-tailed bones.

97
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,740
It's too small.

98
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,740
If that's the case,

99
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,740
we don't know the clues that Grand Master knows.

100
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,740
Now, the people who are in the streets of the city

101
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,740
are gone.

102
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,740
We were supposed to bring the equipment there.

103
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,740
Don't think about it now.

104
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,740
If we know what's going on,

105
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,740
we have to follow them.

106
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,740
It's too cruel.

107
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,740
It's okay.

108
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,740
Changbai Mountain is so big.

109
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,740
It's not easy to define the location of the Cloud Sky Palace

110
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,740
in one go.

111
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,740
According to the route before the third uncle,

112
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,740
we were supposed to go to the second white river,

113
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,740
a small village called Lizi Gou.

114
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,740
Since we're going there,

115
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,740
maybe the location of the Cloud Sky Palace

116
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,740
is nearby.

117
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,740
But according to your speculation,

118
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,740
you know that the clues are more than you.

119
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,740
I don't know.

120
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,740
We can't go to Lizi Gou today.

121
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,740
Let's do this.

122
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,740
Let's go to the village nearby

123
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,740
and collect the plates.

124
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,740
I hope we can get something.

125
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,740
If that's the case,

126
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,740
we can only follow the fourth uncle first.

127
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,740
He Shang, look.

128
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,740
We've prepared enough for this time.

129
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,740
There are a few.

130
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,740
Do you need help?

131
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,740
What's the big deal?

132
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,740
No need.

133
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,740
What's your name?

134
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,740
Hello, I'm Ye Cheng.

135
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,740
Hello.

136
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,740
This is Huahe Town.

137
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,740
Huahe.

138
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,740
Nice to meet you.

139
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,740
This is Wang Feng.

140
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,740
Feng.

141
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,740
You're Wang Fatty, right?

142
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,740
A famous fat man in the fourth uncle.

143
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,740
No.

144
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,740
I heard that you've been to Dao Valley

145
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,740
for a lot of things.

146
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,740
Tell me about it.

147
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,740
You can call me Fatty.

148
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,740
If you want to call me Dao,

149
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,740
I've been to several places.

150
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,740
But you're not that good.

151
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,740
You're with the fourth uncle.

152
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,740
That's the Cloud Sky Palace.

153
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,740
Right?

154
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,740
What's wrong?

155
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,740
Look, it's getting cold.

156
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,740
Our body is too weak.

157
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,740
It's not good to come here.

158
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,740
I just bled on my clothes.

159
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,740
Are you sure you don't need help?

160
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,740
No, no, no.

161
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,740
Brother, it's late.

162
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,740
We're going in.

163
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,740
The third uncle has orders.

164
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,740
Then we'll find a room

165
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,740
and a few rooms.

166
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,740
Drink some.

167
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,740
Be quiet.

168
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,740
Sorry, I'm late.

169
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,740
You're busy.

170
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,740
You're busy.

171
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,740
Master, put down the house.

172
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,740
It's the second floor.

173
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,740
Don't go in.

174
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,740
Aren't we going in together?

175
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,740
He doesn't want us to follow him.

176
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,740
He's right.

177
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,740
He said the fourth uncle has an arrangement.

178
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,740
He said he'll go back later.

179
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,740
Where can we go at such a big place?

180
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,740
Tianzhen, I'm telling you.

181
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,740
Look at the dog.

182
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,740
It's a suburb.

183
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,740
It's so scary.

184
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,740
Do you believe it?

185
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,740
Go in the mountains.

186
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,740
If you stay like this,

187
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,740
you'll get sick.

188
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,740
You're right.

189
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,740
Who's that?

190
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,740
Who's that?

191
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,740
The one who installed the pressure on the boat.

192
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,740
Wu Xie, I'm looking for you.

193
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,740
Do you want to see the map of the Cloud Sky Palace?

194
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,740
Map?

195
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,740
What map?

196
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,740
I don't know what you're talking about.

197
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,740
I think we shouldn't waste our time.

198
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,740
Wu San Xing has left.

199
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,740
I don't have time to call you.

200
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,740
Don't let me kill you.

201
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,740
I'm not with you.

202
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,740
Don't let me say it again.

203
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,740
Otherwise...

204
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,740
What do you mean?

205
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,740
Is this the attitude of the boat?

206
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,740
Don't say we don't have it.

207
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,740
Even if we do,

208
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,740
we can't show you.

209
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,740
We're all waiting here.

210
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,740
Why don't you wait for his uncle to go down the mountain?

211
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,740
If he's in a good mood,

212
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,740
I can show you the treasures.

213
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,740
Okay?

214
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,740
What do you want?

215
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,740
Jason.

216
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,740
What do you want?

217
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,740
You know what you're saying.

218
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,740
I hope you won't make me feel uncomfortable.

219
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,740
Ning,

220
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,740
did Qiu De Kou ask you to stop me?

221
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,740
I came here to protect Wu Xie's safety.

222
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,740
After all, his project has the least experience.

223
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,740
And I'm afraid that some people

224
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,740
will be careless to break our plan.

225
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,740
You...

226
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,740
Master Si,

227
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,740
it seems that we don't need to go out.

228
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,740
It's not like we're on the same path.

229
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,740
Look at that guy.

230
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,740
He's got a lot of guys.

231
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,740
I don't know if they can come over.

232
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,740
It's better not to say anything.

233
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,740
If you don't want to,

234
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,740
just tell the master.

235
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,740
Let's go.

236
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,740
Good.

237
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,740
Very good.

238
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,740
The guy you brought.

239
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,740
Let's go.

240
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,740
Master Si,

241
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,740
you're drinking tea at this hour?

242
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,740
Are you still sleeping?

243
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,740
Let's go together.

244
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,740
No, no.

245
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,740
Let's go upstairs.

246
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,740
Let's play cards together.

247
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,740
Let's call Jin Huan.

248
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,740
Okay.

249
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,740
Okay.

250
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,740
Who are you?

251
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,740
I'll call you later.

252
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,740
Okay.

253
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,740
Okay.

254
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,740
Okay.

255
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,740
Okay.

256
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,740
Okay.

257
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,740
Okay.

258
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,740
Okay.

259
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,740
Okay.

260
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,740
Okay.

261
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,740
Okay.

262
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,740
I'll call you later.

263
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,740
Okay.

264
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,740
Sir, the train station is in chaos.

265
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,740
Two of Jason's will be arrested

266
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,740
for impersonation of police.

267
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,740
The rest are wrapped.

268
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,740
Okay.

269
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,740
Don't worry about them.

270
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,740
Keep your eyes on Wu Xie.

271
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,740
Without Wu Sanxing,

272
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,740
he's the only one with the location

273
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,740
of the Cloud Sky Palace.

274
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,740
We need him to guide us.

275
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,740
I understand.

276
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,740
But I worry that Chen Pi-A-Si

277
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,740
will take the chance to mutiny.

278
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,740
I'm afraid that Wu Xie can't handle it.

279
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,740
Wu Sanxing is the one who called for Chen Pi-A-Si.

280
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,740
It's clear that Wu Xie will not be harmed

281
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,740
by Chen Pi-A-Si.

282
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,740
Are you sure?

283
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,740
But I worry Wu Sanxing looks...

284
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,740
Wu Xie doesn't seem to trust him as much anymore.

285
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,740
It's true that Wu Sanxing is getting harder to read.

286
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,740
Fine.

287
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,740
I will send someone to meet you

288
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,740
at the Chang Bai Mountain.

289
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,740
Stay with Wu Xie for now.

290
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,740
Once I'm finished with things at hand,

291
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,740
I will go there as well.

292
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,740
Sir, the climate on the mountain is treacherous.

293
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,740
We might be trapped here for some days.

294
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,740
You should stay at the foot of the mountain.

295
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,740
It's too dangerous and too harsh up here.

296
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,740
Don't worry.

297
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,740
I know what I'm doing.

298
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,740
How is it, boss?

299
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,740
Any wine?

300
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,740
Pomegranate, plum syrup, chili,

301
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,740
and chocolate.

302
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,740
And some cornstarch.

303
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,740
Thank you.

304
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,740
Why is there something else?

305
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,740
It's made from a shoe.

306
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,740
It's not only for the West. It's also warm.

307
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,740
You're so understanding that you're so useless.

308
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,740
Fine. Thank you.

309
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,740
Let's go.

310
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,740
Uncle Dachan, thank you for your help.

311
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,740
Here, 5,000 yuan.

312
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,740
Okay, okay. It's all my fault.

313
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,740
If you want to find that statue,

314
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,740
I've asked you about it.

315
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,740
It's in our village. It's called Shunzi.

316
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,740
Chao Xianzuo is willing to take this painting.

317
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,740
Is he familiar with the situation on the mountain?

318
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,740
His father is the old hunter and the mountain hunter in our village.

319
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,740
He followed his father around the mountain when he was young.

320
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,740
It's not that no one is more familiar with the situation on the mountain.

321
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,740
But now, this sister is on the mountain.

322
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,740
Only he can carry this young man.

323
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,740
How about this? Take me to his house and have a look.

324
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,740
Okay, okay. I'll go too.

325
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,740
Okay, let's go together.

326
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,740
Okay.

327
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,740
Here, let's go.

328
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,740
This way.

329
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,740
Don't run.

330
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,740
I can't find it.

331
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,740
Choose it.

332
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,740
Choose it.

333
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,740
Okay.

334
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,740
Okay.

335
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,740
Okay.

336
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,740
Okay.

337
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,740
Okay.

338
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,740
Okay.

339
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,740
Okay.

340
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,740
Okay.

341
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,740
Okay.

342
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,740
Okay.

343
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,740
Don't run.

344
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,740
Okay.

345
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,740
Okay, Hongzi.

346
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,740
Is this dog okay?

347
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,740
It's okay.

348
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,740
Shunzi.

349
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,740
Shunzi.

350
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,740
Shunzi.

351
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:45,280
I have to go.

352
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,140
Elder Jing.

353
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,780
I brought you a pair of 180iths dresses.

354
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,980
Sit here for a while.

355
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,580
Shunzi might be in the backyard.

356
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,420
I'll go and call him.

357
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,060
Okay.

358
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,700
Wait a minute.

359
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,300
Where's the toilet?

360
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:04,940
Follow me.

361
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,580
Okay.

362
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,900
Uncle Daxan.

363
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,540
Shunzi.

364
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,500
Uncle Daxan.

365
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,940
These two are here to see you as a leader.

366
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,700
This is Brother Wu.

367
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,220
This is Brother Hua.

368
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,900
You guys talk.

369
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,220
You guys talk.

370
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,140
I'm sorry just now.

371
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,020
It's okay.

372
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,940
I'm sorry.

373
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,740
I'm sorry.

374
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,500
I'm sorry.

375
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,340
I'm sorry.

376
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,980
Let me take a photo with my dad.

377
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,580
There's a lot of people going to the snow mountain.

378
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,740
The wind is blowing.

379
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,100
It's hard to take the road.

380
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,580
And there's nothing good to see on the mountain.

381
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,780
The wind is not strong.

382
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,620
It's windy.

383
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,780
We'll go to Changbai Mountain later.

384
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,380
We'll go to Zhu Feng.

385
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,180
Right.

386
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,580
Brother.

387
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,940
You're not going to the mountain?

388
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,780
I can go there.

389
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,580
But I have to say it in advance.

390
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,420
After the snow mountain,

391
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,620
everything must be heard.

392
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,620
I said I can go.

393
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,820
I said I must go.

394
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,380
You can't come here with your temper.

395
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,340
You must.

396
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,940
We're just going to have fun.

397
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,940
We can't kill each other, right?

398
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,940
Okay.

399
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,540
Let me see your equipment later.

400
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,580
Is there anything missing?

401
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,500
You can't go while it's two days.

402
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,300
Hurry up.

403
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:16,940
Well.

404
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,380
Why can't you go?

405
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,220
You're the only one who can go to the snow mountain.

406
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,540
We can't wait two more days.

407
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,140
It's too late to wait two more days.

408
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,540
Actually,

409
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,100
you should have looked for other ideas before.

410
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,700
Now it's the winter break of the snow mountain.

411
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,180
They won't go back to the mountain.

412
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,420
I've been in charge of this for two days.

413
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,060
My dad said

414
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,980
it's the day the snow mountain girl is angry.

415
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,260
We can't go to the mountain.

416
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:39,860
No.

417
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,980
We'll stay with her forever.

418
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,380
You're a crazy man.

419
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,380
You can't go.

420
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,500
Brother.

421
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,740
There will be strong snowstorm these days.

422
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,740
Brother.

423
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,860
What do you mean?

424
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,460
We must go back immediately.

425
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,660
The storm is coming.

426
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,660
We all have to stay at home.

427
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,500
You little brother.

428
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,820
You know there's storm.

429
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,220
You're wearing so much.

430
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,380
Listen.

431
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,460
When you go out,

432
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,340
you have to go out to the ice.

433
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,420
Uncle Daxian.

434
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,100
It's okay.

435
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:13,980
Don't worry about him.

436
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,420
When will the storm stop?

437
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,620
When can we go to the mountain?

438
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,300
Ask Shunzi.

439
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,620
He knows better than me.

440
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,620
Shunzi.

441
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,220
At least we can't go tonight.

442
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,740
We have to see the situation later.

443
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,660
We'll just go as long as we don't get any fog.

444
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,500
Be careful.

445
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,180
Uncle Daxian.

446
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,860
The storm here is really so serious.

447
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,060
If the weather is not good,

448
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,820
we'll be trapped here forever.

449
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,140
Of course.

450
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,980
Look at the weather.

451
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,740
The storm this time

452
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,620
is probably the most serious this year.

453
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,780
It's okay.

454
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,740
It's okay, Hong.

455
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,260
It's okay.

456
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,940
It's so serious last time.

457
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,340
It's still his dad's fault

458
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,300
for wearing that coat.

459
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,060
It's okay, uncle Daxian.

460
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,140
It's been so long.

461
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,700
My dad took a team of people

462
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,700
to the mountain with him that year.

463
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,620
He had a lot of snow.

464
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,980
Then he got snow on the mountain.

465
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,100
But the epidemic never came back.

466
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,220
I didn't expect

467
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,140
that it would be so many years.

468
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,580
I still remember

469
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,220
that year when the storm stopped,

470
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,940
we didn't care about it.

471
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,300
Then dad saw the mountain was still foggy.

472
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,420
He didn't think it was right.

473
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,740
Now I understand.

474
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,700
The fog and the power

475
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,820
may be the snow goddess

476
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,980
who changed dad's warning again and again.

477
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,580
So if the situation is wrong these days,

478
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,620
I'd rather wait two more days

479
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,340
and not take you to the mountain.

480
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,420
Okay.

481
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,420
Let's go.

482
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,380
Let's go.

483
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,380
Be careful.

484
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,700
The G document has dropped to this spot.

485
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,380
He was hiding on the mountain at home

486
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:29,100
although it had just been mentioned in the news.

487
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,780
Why is it so dark?

488
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,580
What's going on?

489
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,660
That's the hangout.

490
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,660
It's normal here,

491
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,780
because of the snow.

492
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,700
Let's go.

493
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,420
I was just about to go find you guys.

494
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,500
Why are you so slow?

495
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,620
You're making me hungry.

496
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,980
Isn't this the island?

497
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,260
Why did you find him?

498
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,380
Hurry up, you're starving.

499
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,620
Bro,

500
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,740
we're from the village.

501
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,500
The chicken and the chicken are made from the Hong Kong style.

502
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,300
Really?

503
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,100
Not bad.

504
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,260
Shunzi, you...

505
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,820
I haven't tasted such a good Dongbei flavor for a long time.

506
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,580
It's really good.

507
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,300
You can just eat the home-cooked dishes I made.

508
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,900
Uncle Daxian,

509
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,900
your wine is not bad either.

510
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,940
Come again.

511
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:23,940
It's too much.

512
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,740
Just a moment.

513
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,020
Li,

514
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,180
are you going out?

515
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,500
You're going to come without paying for the wind.

516
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,220
Uncle Daxian,

517
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,300
don't ask.

518
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,700
I can't stop when the boss decides to go up the mountain.

519
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,820
You're so stupid.

520
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,500
You're going to die for a few money.

521
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,820
Old man,

522
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,420
have you seen Meijin?

523
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,060
He took so much money from us.

524
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,500
He should have killed us.

525
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,180
Jason,

526
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,780
I owe you to listen to local people.

527
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,980
You know danger is not a clever way to go out.

528
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,060
Boss,

529
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,820
how can you listen to me when you're on the mountain?

530
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,900
If you can't keep walking,

531
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,660
you must return back.

532
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,420
How can you talk so much nonsense?

533
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,540
My people are waiting outside.

534
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,660
Go.

535
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,660
This is a good wine.

536
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:10,980
Li.

537
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,220
You have to share the food.

538
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,420
You're giving it to someone.

539
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,060
That's for the dog.

540
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,940
You can't say that.

541
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,860
They're always in the yard,

542
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,500
and they don't have to pay for the meal.

543
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,980
They don't have to pay.

544
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,940
There's not much to eat for the next meal.

545
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,540
Sir, the Blizzard is here.

546
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,420
Our people are not willing to risk their lives.

547
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,580
And there are rumors of life-threatening conditions.

548
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:50,660
I think we should stay put to avoid unnecessary loss.

549
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,700
But you said Jason insisted to set out,

550
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,980
and he's already left.

551
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,780
Indeed, I couldn't stop him.

552
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,900
Go find him.

553
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,180
Make sure he's within our sight.

554
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,180
This shouldn't be difficult for you, okay?

555
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,500
Understood, sir.

556
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,340
Hurry up.

557
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,220
Hurry up and pack up.

558
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,300
Brothers, hurry up.

559
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:14,780
Okay.

560
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,740
One more.

561
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:16,540
One more.

562
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,460
One more check.

563
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,180
One more.

564
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:18,820
Here.

565
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,300
One more.

566
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:19,940
One more.

567
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:21,820
Are you not going to bring them?

568
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,540
Sir,

569
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,140
don't pack up these brothers.

570
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,740
They might come back later.

571
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,860
And it's too late if they don't leave.

572
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,180
Why are you so anxious?

573
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,900
My men are professional warriors.

574
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,340
They can handle any situation.

575
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,980
Just take your way.

576
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,060
No, sir.

577
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,180
We can't let go of these accounts in the woods.

578
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,500
Just take a few.

579
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,820
There's a small house in the field.

580
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,620
We can leave it here temporarily.

581
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,540
Okay.

582
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,220
Move.

583
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,620
Coming.

584
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,380
Take some of the rest of the accounts.

585
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,540
The rest stay in the original place.

586
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,460
Let's go.

587
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,260
Yes, sir.

588
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,740
Actually,

589
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,420
no one is so nervous.

590
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,420
Maybe it's not that dangerous.

591
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,940
It's said that the wind is terrible.

592
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,100
But the worst thing is that

593
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,860
the mountain is not known to be a monster.

594
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,980
The people in our village

595
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,220
died in a strange way.

596
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,300
When they were found,

597
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,140
the bodies were all in one piece.

598
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,980
It's like being bitten by a wolf.

599
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,380
It's a piece of mud on the ground.

600
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,340
It's broken.

601
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,260
It's broken.

602
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:39,820
It's broken.

603
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,940
It's so heavy.

604
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,180
Isn't it the wolf in the mountain?

605
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:43,980
Or something else?

606
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,700
It's hungry.

607
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,580
There are wild beasts on the mountain.

608
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,980
But the wild beasts in winter are so thin.

609
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:54,140
They will never let go of those organs.

610
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,340
They love to eat.

611
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,780
You pretend to be a ghost.

612
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,660
Why don't you say you're human?

613
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,460
No way.

614
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,900
How can you be so perverted?

615
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,940
That's hard to say.

616
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,740
It's hard to predict.

617
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:14,900
Come on.

618
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,060
Are we going to

619
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,340
hold the ghost contest now?

620
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,380
Who's next? Come on.

621
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,380
Me.

622
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,820
I'm going to talk about

623
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,380
the famous things in the northern part of the country.

624
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,620
Let me tell you.

625
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,900
Do you want me to join you?

626
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,900
You come.

627
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,700
Come on.

628
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,180
Sit here.

629
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:31,900
Uncle.

630
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,140
You sit next to us.

631
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:33,740
In this situation,

632
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,300
we should stay safe.

633
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,980
It's foggy.

634
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,020
Everyone,

635
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,980
don't go out tonight.

636
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,980
Is there anything you want to do?

637
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,980
I have to go tonight.

638
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,380
San Ye needs me.

639
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,580
You should be careful.

640
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,380
Make Zhang Qilin pay more attention.

641
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,380
My stomach hurts.

642
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,380
Go to the rest room.

643
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,380
I'll go with you.

644
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,380
Come on. Have a drink.

645
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,980
Miss, you're going out too?

646
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,980
You're a girl.

647
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,980
You can't leave.

648
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,980
It's too dangerous.

649
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:23,980
Listen to me.

650
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,980
Miss.

651
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:26,980
Mother.

652
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,980
It's snowing on Mount Changbai.

653
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,980
I thought you were smart.

654
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,980
Miss.

655
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,980
Miss.

656
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,980
Forget it, Uncle.

657
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,980
He doesn't need our money.

658
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,980
Does he have a real life?

659
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,980
Today is the day.

660
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,980
Today is the day.

661
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,980
40 yuan for the scissors.

662
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,980
40 plus 40.

663
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,980
Tell me.

664
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,980
Today.

665
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,980
Don't be so shameless.

666
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,980
Get up.

667
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:23,980
You're right.

668
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,980
Don't be so shameless.

669
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,980
Just like Ning was hit by a car when she left.

670
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,980
Is that okay?

671
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,980
She's a good girl.

672
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,980
Then, Ning saved us.

673
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,980
Just to pay back the money.

674
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,980
Yes.

675
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,980
And,

676
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,980
Is Ning's body really that good?

677
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,980
Is she rich in blood?

678
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:47,980
She's not familiar with the terrain.

679
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,980
Then, she's just a white-haired girl.

680
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,980
I'm just a normal person.

681
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,980
I always feel that something will happen.

682
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,980
Listen, you'd better be like this.

683
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,980
Don't go out if you're done.

684
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,980
Don't do those stupid things.

685
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,980
Don't forget that we have a big business.

686
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,980
Do you understand?

687
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,980
Don't go out.

688
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,980
Do you understand?

689
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,980
I know.

690
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,980
I'm not going to sleep.

691
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,980
Xiao Ge.

692
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,980
Go play the gold digger.

693
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,980
Xiao Ge is tired.

694
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,980
Let her rest.

695
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,980
She won't play the gold digger.

696
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,980
What's she doing?

697
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,980
She won't?

698
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,980
She won't?

699
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,980
Forget it.

700
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,980
Go to sleep.

701
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,980
Forget it.

702
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,980
Turn around.

703
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,980
No signal.

704
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,980
When you have signal, turn around.

705
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,980
When you have signal,

706
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,980
I'll have the money.

707
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,980
I'm sorry.

708
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,980
I'm sorry.

709
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:04,980
I'm sorry.

710
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,980
I'm sorry.

711
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,980
I'm sorry.

712
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,000
Out of bother.

713
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,980
Get up, Uncle Cams.

714
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:07,980
Nothing.

715
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,980
I forgot to teach you before.

716
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:12,980
This bottle.

717
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,980
It didn't fit that much!

718
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,980
Uncle Cams,

719
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,980
where were you at?

720
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,980
In the summit.

721
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,980
Did you just come here?

722
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,980
Any news?

723
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,980
Did you write your name?

724
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,980
average

725
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,980
I was deprived of the huge amount of money.

726
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,980
Uncle Cams,

727
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,980
can you please tell me

728
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,980
if you want it.

729
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,780
How do you usually

730
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,140
distinguish mountains from wild animals?

731
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,740
If we go up the mountain in winter,

732
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,340
what do we need to be careful of?

733
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,540
Look.

734
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,900
Be careful of the roots of grass.

735
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,300
This is different from this.

736
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,980
And the footprints.

737
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,300
The difference in the difference.

738
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,300
You have to observe these carefully.

739
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,500
The road to the mountain in winter

740
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,980
can't be fast.

741
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,380
The snow is thick.

742
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,380
It's hard to bear the weight of the snow.

743
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,540
And you have to

744
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,820
mark the right direction.

745
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,260
Mark.

746
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,660
As long as you are right,

747
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,060
you will be able to keep it.

748
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,980
The snow is thick.

749
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,980
It's hard to bear the weight of the snow.

750
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,980
It's hard to bear the weight of the snow.

00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,980
What kind of enemies do you have?

767
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,980
Can the Huo family cooperate with you?

768
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,980
I have a secret about the Wusan Star.

769
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,980
Is this enough to share?

770
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,980
Okay.

771
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,980

Su.

773
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,980
Master Chinese.

774
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,980
You are not feeling comfortable.

775
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,980
Alright, let's have some tea.

776
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:47,980
Master Chinese, you are so yourself.

777
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,980
The Xie family can't do their own thing.

778
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,980
If you want to help Master San find the Wusan Star.

779
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,980
Chief.

780
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,980
I will help him.

781
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,980
Don't worry.

782
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,980
I can hold on.

783

Master, this...

785
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:29,980
Go and find out who is dancing at this time.

00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,980
Okay. I will go right away.

787
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,980
Don't worry.

788
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,980
He is coming in from the inside.

789
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:02,980
Run!

790
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,980

Come back!

799
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:48,980
Don't hurt me!

800
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,980
Don't hurt me!

801
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,980
Don't hurt me!

802
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,980
Don't hurt me!

803
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,980
What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?

804
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,980
I'll kill you!

805
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,980
I'm sorry. I can't go any further.

806
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,980
I'm sorry. I'm wrong.

807
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,980
Don't be afraid. Come back!

808
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,980
Come back!

809
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,980
Come back!

810
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,980
Come back!

811
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,980
Come back!

812
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,980
Come back!

813
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,980
The body is buried.

814
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,980
Yes.

815
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,980
Go and check the body.

816
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,980
Be careful of the traces.

817
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:46,980
Yes.

818
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,980
Come back!

819
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:19,980
Don't stay here.

820
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:20,980
Let's go.

821
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:21,980
Yes.

822
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,980
The shadow of the sky is reflected in the sky.

823
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,980
The silent wind.

824
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,980
Following the clouds and the wind.

825
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,980
The road is forgotten.

826
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,980
How to answer?

827
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:40,980
