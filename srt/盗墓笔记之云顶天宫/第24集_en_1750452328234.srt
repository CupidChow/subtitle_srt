1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm not sure.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not sure.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm not sure.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm not sure.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not sure.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm not sure.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not sure.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm not sure.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm not sure.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm not sure.

18
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not sure.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm not sure.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm not sure.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not sure.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Ahhhh!

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You cannot make your lifeшь

24
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,720
Finally red

25
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,140
You made me hereC

26
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,440
I thank you

27
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,840
Kill!

28
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,940
Zhang Ming Dan, don't be ridiculous!

29
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,640
Who...

30
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,640
Don't shoot!

31
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,440
These blinds are blind.

32
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,640
They can't see us

33
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,840
under such strong light.

34
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,440
But they are sensitive to sound.

35
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,440
Fatty!

36
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,040
Kill!

37
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,640
Kill!

38
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,640
Fatty!

39
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,440
What are you doing?

40
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,440
Eat more!

41
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,640
Coming!

42
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,040
Thank you!

43
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,640
Fatty!

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,240
Fatty!

45
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
We don't have Zhang Ming Dan anymore!

46
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,240
Fatty!

47
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,640
Take Mr. San away first.

48
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,640
Thank you for the mask.

49
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,440
You can't escape from the trap.

50
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,640
You can't escape from them.

51
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,440
You can't escape from them.

52
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,240
Don't worry about me.

53
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,240
I'll go save Fatty.

54
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:36,840
No!

55
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,640
Mr. San, take Mr. San away.

56
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,640
I'll go save Fatty.

57
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,240
Fatty!

58
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,840
I'll go save them.

59
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,040
I won't be in trouble.

60
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,240
Fatty,

61
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,040
I'll leave San Shu to you.

62
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,240
We'll wait outside.

63
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,840
Take the mask for Mr. San.

64
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,440
Mr. San, let's go.

65
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,840
Fatty!

66
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,840
Fatty!

67
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:13,880
Fatty!

68
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,840
To my friends,

69
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,240
I try to protect you.

70
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,120
Come on.

71
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,800
Come on.

72
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,400
Come on.

73
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,200
Come on.

74
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,520
Get up.

75
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,400
Don't touch me.

76
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,920
Don't touch me.

77
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,760
I won't.

78
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,320
Don't touch me.

79
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,080
Don't touch me.

80
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,040
Let go of me.

81
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,520
Let go of me.

82
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,240
Stand up.

83
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,720
Come here.

84
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,640
Let go of me.

85
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,800
Don't touch me.

86
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,480
Hurry up.

87
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,400
Come here.

88
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,400
You...

89
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,640
Are you all right?

90
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,320
I'm fine.

91
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:04,840
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,480
I'm not going to kill you.

93
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,400
You...

94
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
Stop it.

95
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,440
I have a big business.

96
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,840
It's him.

97
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,320
Do you know why I want to take you away?

98
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,280
I can understand your spirit.

99
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,520
Your inner mind is full of

100
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,920
your own unknown physical strength.

101
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,240
You touched me.

102
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,840
I hope that in the future,

103
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,360
you can never really

104
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,680
think of anyone else.

105
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,840
Cover theacas to the right.

106
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,560
Forest.

107
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,600
Let's keep looking for him.

108
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
Keep going.

109
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,280
I'm...

110
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,800
shutting to his car.

111
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,600
John.

112
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,840
Look out for him.

113
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,520
Don't touch me.

114
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,480
Does your mind

115
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,280
take my voice away?

116
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,520
I'm against it.

117
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,320
Don't touch me.

118
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,760
Can you hear me?

119
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,600
Don't touch me.

120
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
What are you doing?

121
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Don't die!

122
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
Go!

123
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Is this rumors?

124
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
Why is it so big?

125
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,600
I'm going to kill you!

126
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Tianzhen.

127
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,600
He's a little familiar.

128
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
Who is this?

129
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
It's Heidi Moore.

130
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
She's a female.

131
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
She's a man of her own.

132
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
What is he doing?

133
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
I don't know.

134
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
What's wrong?

135
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
I don't want to go in.

136
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
Stop him!

137
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
The commander said

138
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
the door to the hell would be closed.

139
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
The night fire will burn the hell

140
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
and the whole sky.

141
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
When it's open, the machine will start.

142
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
The whole hell will be burned.

143
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
No one can escape.

144
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,600
No, we can't fight with so many monsters.

145
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Let's find another big guy.

146
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,600
I'll give you a discount.

147
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
They're coming.

148
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,600
What are you doing?

149
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Hit him!

150
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Go!

151
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
Go!

152
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Go!

153
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Go!

154
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Go!

155
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
Ke?

156
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,600
15 minutes before theズ and lightning!

157
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,600
And he's alive now?!

158
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Ke?

159
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
I'll get it.

160
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,600
Uncle San, uncle San is waiting for you inside.

161
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Let's go.

162
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,600
Uncle San, uncle San, uncle San is here.

163
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Uncle San, uncle San, how are you?

164
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,600
Don't worry, I'm not that easy to die.

165
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:13,600
Uncle San, uncle San, your injury...

166
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Your son is a new generation.

167
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,600
He's not like the owner of the Wu Family.

168
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,600
My grandpa's coffin can't be pressed.

169
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,600
Uncle San, uncle San, uncle San.

170
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:40,600
Uncle San, actually, you know all these things, right?

171
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,600
This time, you're right.

172
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Without an old shop, this thing can't be done.

173
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,600
Uncle San, you finally have the courage to tell me the truth.

174
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,600
Maybe it depends on the mood.

175
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,600
Uncle San, uncle San, all of them are real.

176
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:13,600
In that team, I found many things were wrong.

177
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,600
But I couldn't find out who I was.

178
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,600
I just walked a step and looked at it.

179
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,600
Later, we arrived at the bottom of the sea.

180
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,600
We were injured by the mysterious man's black hands.

181
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,600
Lian Huan, are you all right?

182
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,600
I'm fine.

183
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,600
Xia Ru is really cruel.

184
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:54,600
He must be the one in the crew who's hiding behind our back.

185
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
Is he still here?

186
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,600
When we fought, he was still here.

187
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,800
Is he still here?

188
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,000
When we fought just now,

189
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,640
he should be here.

190
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,000
He should be here.

191
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,360
Who is he?

192
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,280
What does he want?

193
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,360
No matter what he wants,

194
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,680
he always wants to kill me.

195
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,560
If I die,

196
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,600
what benefits will there be

197
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,040
between him and his people?

198
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,840
You're dead.

199
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,720
I don't know if it's good for them.

200
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,480
But you're dead.

201
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,920
I'll have to be blackened out.

202
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,840
Uncle San.

203
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,240
Uncle San.

204
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,760
So you wanted to kill Xie Lian Huan.

205
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,800
And then you two used Wu San Xing's identity

206
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,760
to confuse their dark side, right?

207
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,800
I'm sure

208
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,080
we can't get rid of

209
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,240
the nine-point test.

210
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,640
We found another force behind him.

211
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,600
But we couldn't deal with

212
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,080
this force.

213
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,320
So we joined forces

214
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,720
and found many secrets.

215
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,600
In the ancient tomb,

216
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,000
they had their own shadow.

217
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,760
We also found

218
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,720
a red thread behind it,

219
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,720
called alpha.

220
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,960
Alpha?

221
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,960
Later,

222
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,080
we found

223
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,800
their evil plan.

224
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,840
Uncle San.

225
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,040
Their primary aim

226
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,320
is no impossible.

227
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,680
Their primary aim

228
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,640
is longevity.

229
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,080
You...

230
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,080
Okay.

231
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,080
Great!

232
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,080
My friends!

233
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,080
It's so great, friends!

234
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,080
We've achieved our goal

235
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,080
and finally reached the last step.

236
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:35,080
We can work together to create a long-term secret.

237
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,080
We've overcome all kinds of difficulties

238
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,080
and finally reached the great stage.

239
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,080
I'm so sorry.

240
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,080
So I want to share with you

241
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,080
the long-term secret.

242
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,080
You're crazy.

243
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,080
You're so heartless.

244
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,080
I thought

245
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,080
those who pursue their life

246
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,080
were crazy.

247
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,080
But the secret in the ancient house

248
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,080
made me realize where this madness came from.

249
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,080
I've done many experiments

250
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,080
and most of them failed.

251
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,080
So I left a mark

252
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,080
on the history book.

253
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,080
There's another story that's ridiculous.

254
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,080
But some of them have been successfully solved.

255
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,080
But because of the time-consuming expedition,

256
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,080
we've been ignored.

257
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,080
Those experiments

258
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,080
might have been able to use

259
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,080
the power of the birds and insects

260
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,080
to change the human body,

261
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,080
but they failed.

262
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,080
They might have used

263
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,080
the secret universe and the parking lot.

264
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,080
They might have been destroyed

265
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,080
when they didn't prove it.

266
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,080
Who are you?

267
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,080
Who are you?

268
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,080
I... Who are you?

269
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,080
Look.

270
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,080
I'm sure you're not well.

271
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,080
You're all thin.

272
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,080
I've collected a lot of information

273
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,080
about the fortune of the rich.

274
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,080
I've found some tricks

275
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,080
and found some clues

276
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,080
that I can use

277
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,080
to help other people

278
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,080
who are not rich.

279
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,080
I even have a friend

280
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,080
who is more than me.

281
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,080
Look.

282
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,080
I even have

283
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,080
the fortune of the rich.

284
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,080
I've got more than others

285
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,080
after all these years.

286
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,080
There's another possibility.

287
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,080
You've put all those things

288
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,080
in your body

289
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,080
and it's possible

290
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,080
to become a monster.

291
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,080
What are you afraid of?

292
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,080
If I become a monster,

293
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,080
you should know

294
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,080
who you are.

295
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,080
You're not a normal person.

296
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,080
I'm using it in my body.

297
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,080
It's the result

298
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,080
that I've collected

299
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,080
from all kinds of information.

300
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,080
It's not complete.

301
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,080
And it will have

302
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,080
some bad consequences.

303
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,080
I want to get the real one.

304
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,080
The long-term fortune

305
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,080
and the secret

306
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,080
are now

307
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,080
in front of me.

308
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,080
Right behind this mountain.

309
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,080
Let go of him.

310
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,080
Fatty.

311
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,080
You see?

312
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,080
If you betray me,

313
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,080
you'll be the same as him.

314
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,080
No one can stop me.

315
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,080
If you were willing

316
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,080
to join the group with me,

317
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,080
I would be very happy

318
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,080
to see our strength

319
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,080
grow.

320
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,080
Everything in the future

321
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,080
is not a chance.

322
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:14,080
Mr. Wu San and Mr. Wang.

323
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,080
You've worked with me.

324
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,080
You know I'm a human being.

325
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,080
I won't be able to take you down.

326
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,080
You're all the same.

327
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,080
You're a big man.

328
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,080
I'll tell you again.

329
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,080
Let him go.

330
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,080
Mr. Zhi.

331
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,080
I'm willing to

332
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,080
join the group with you.

333
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,080
I'll let you go.

334
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,080
Look.

335
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,080
My injury is not a problem.

336
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,080
You can tie me up.

337
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,080
It's okay.

338
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,080
But I have a condition.

339
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,080
If you don't agree,

340
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,080
you won't get what you want.

341
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,080
Wu San Xing.

342
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,080
If you want to join the group,

343
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,080
tell me.

344
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,080
It's simple.

345
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,080
I understand.

346
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,080
Why did you marry Wu Xie?

347
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,080
After this,

348
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,080
I hope you can prove to me

349
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,080
that you're a man of your word.

350
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,080
I don't want to be a burden to you.

351
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,080
Second,

352
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,080
Alfa took my stuff.

353
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,080
I hope you can take it back.

354
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,080
Third,

355
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,080
that's the most important thing.

356
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,080
My nephew,

357
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,080
Wu Xie's blood,

358
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,080
is a power.

359
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,080
I have a power, too.

360
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,080
Okay.

361
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,080
Wu San Xing.

362
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,080
Your greed makes me feel very safe.

363
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,080
Maybe it's only with you

364
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,080
that I can succeed.

365
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,080
Wu Xie, you said...

366
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,080
Third,

367
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,080
I didn't hear you wrong.

368
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,080
You really don't want Wu Xie's life.

369
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,080
You don't want your nephew's life.

370
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,080
Mr. Wang,

371
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,080
you're so good at acting.

372
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,080
At the last moment,

373
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,080
you're so good at acting.

374
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,080
I admire you.

375
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,080
But now,

376
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,080
you're in the right place.

377
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,080
How can you let your nephew die?

378
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,080
Let me tell you again.

379
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,080
Let me go.

380
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,080
I don't care what happens.

381
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,080
I can't betray my brother anymore.

382
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,080
Even if I die,

383
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,080
I'll die with him.

384
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,080
It's a pity.

385
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,080
I hope you won't regret it.

386
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,080
I hope you can get out alive.

387
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,080
Third,

388
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,080
you lied to me.

389
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,080
What is it for?

390
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,080
What do I have to do?

391
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,080
Wu Xie,

392
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,080
you're not the most honest person in the world.

393
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,080
You're right.

394
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,080
I'm not fit to be.

395
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,080
You're young and wise.

396
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,080
You're smart and smart.

397
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,080
You're also very wise.

398
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,080
As long as you join me,

399
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,080
we can achieve a perfect success.

400
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,080
It's a win-win for us.

401
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,080
Now, tie Mr. Wang up.

402
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,080
And let your subordinates push out of this coffin.

403
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,080
Or I won't be at ease.

404
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,080
Of course,

405
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,080
I know that you're smart.

406
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,080
So,

407
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,080
we promise to meet again.

408
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,080
We'll go in now.

409
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,080
Then you'd better be careful.

410
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,080
That road is not easy to walk.

411
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,080
Little thief,

412
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,080
I'll teach you one last lesson.

413
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:15,080
The key is to not be afraid of death.

414
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,080
Push out!

415
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,080
Push out!

416
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,080
Okay.

417
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,080
Push out!

418
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,080
Push out!

419
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,080
Push out!

420
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,080
Push out!

421
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,080
Push out!

422
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,080
Push out!

423
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,080
Push out!

424
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,080
Little thief!

425
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,080
Push out!

426
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,080
Stop!

427
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,080
Xia Zeyu,

428
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,080
you're in trouble.

429
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,080
I'm so sorry.

430
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,080
How are you?

431
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,080
Xia Zeyu.

432
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,080
Pan Zi,

433
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,080
why are you here?

434
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,080
Where's Uncle San?

435
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,080
He asked me to protect you.

436
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,080
It's too dangerous.

437
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,080
Let's go.

438
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,080
No, no.

439
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,080
You go find Uncle San.

440
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,080
I and Fatty are left.

441
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,080
We're still looking for Xiao Ge.

442
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,080
I'm looking for him.

443
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,080
Hurry up.

444
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,080
We're still looking for him.

445
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,080
You go.

446
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,080
Little thief,

447
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,080
you asked me to go.

448
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,080
I'll go.

449
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,080
Don't come back.

450
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,080
You and I are here.

451
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,080
You don't need to be afraid.

452
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,080
Little thief,

453
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,080
you're in trouble.

454
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,080
You're in trouble.

455
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,080
You're in trouble.

456
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,080
You're in trouble.

457
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,080
You're in trouble.

458
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,080
You're in trouble.

459
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,080
You're in trouble.

460
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,080
You're in trouble.

461
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,080
You're in trouble.

462
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,080
You're in trouble.

463
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,080
You're in trouble.

464
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,080
You're in trouble.

465
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,080
You're in trouble.

466
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,080
You're in trouble.

467
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,080
You're in trouble.

468
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,080
You're in trouble.

469
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,080
You're in trouble.

470
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,080
You're in trouble.

471
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,080
You're in trouble.

472
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,080
You're in trouble.

473
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,080
You're in trouble.

474
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,080
You're in trouble.

475
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,080
You're in trouble.

476
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,080
You're in trouble.

477
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,080
You're about to get into this交易.

478
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,080
How many of you think that?

479
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,640
Well,

480
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,640
This time you can stop giving us a statement.

481
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,640
We also expressed our very peace.

482
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,640
You have the ability to let me go?

483
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,640
Silly Ying Zhao, what kind of man are you?

484
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,640
So, I'll ask you again.

485
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,640
Are you sure you want to hand Huo Xiu Xiu over to us?

486
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,640
Why are you still calling?

487
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,640
You want to have Yang Wei?

488
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,640
I think Huo family has already known my purpose.

489
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,640
This time I will surely get the longevity tree.

490
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,640
But there is not enough longevity.

491
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,640
I don't want to wait until I come out of the Cloud Sky Palace.

492
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,640
The outside is already full of clouds and colors.

493
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,640
Without me, I will be born.

494
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,640
Huo Xian Gu, I will help you.

495
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,640
Do you want me to help you deal with Xie Yuchen?

496
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,640
Not only him, but also Gong Si and Wu San Xing.

497
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,640
You have a lot of enemies.

498
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,640
It's no use to have a single person's longevity.

499
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,640
Huo Xian Gu, we are old friends.

500
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,640
Old friends work together, work together.

501
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,640
I'm not interested.

502
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,640
People don't talk about peace.

503
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,640
This is my last step.

504
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,640
No matter how much you want, there is no good place.

505
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,640
People will live too long.

506
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,640
The future will be clear.

507
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,640
Only after you get the longevity tree can you meet the person you want to meet.

508
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,640
Who will Huo Ling be?

509
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,640
I'm sure you already know.

510
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,640
I can tell you that those documents are also available in Gong Si.

511
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,640
But not more than me.

512
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,640
I'm not sure what the result of the test result will be.

513
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,640
But no matter who they will be,

514
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,640
you should know that they don't need me.

515
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,640
Chen Siye, are you okay?

516
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:50,640
Xie Yuchen, you don't know me anymore.

517
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,640
Xie Yuchen.

518
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,640
Hey, how are you?

519
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,640
You're not feeling well?

520
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,640
I'm fine.

521
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,640
I'm fine.

522
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,640
Don't worry.

523
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,640
I'll be fine.

524
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,640
I'm fine.

525
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,640
I'll be fine.

526
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,640
Don't worry.

527
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,640
I'm fine.

528
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,640
I'm fine.

529
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,640
I'm fine.

530
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,640
Don't worry.

531
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,640
I'm fine.

532
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,640
I'm fine.

533
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,640
The test result was a failure.

534
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,640
I didn't get any good results.

535
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:17,640
I've contacted the police before I went to the mountain.

536
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,640
Good job, Tianzhen.

537
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,640
Don't run away.

538
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,640
Where is Xiao Ge now?

539
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,640
I don't know.

540
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,640
What's in here?

541
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,640
I don't know.

542
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,640
It's finally over.

543
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,640
It's finally over.

544
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,640
Uncle, what's going on?

545
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,640
To stop their operation,

546
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,640
Wu San and I have been in the hell for years.

547
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,640
It's late.

548
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,640
I'm tired.

549
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,640
I just want to sleep.

550
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,640
I don't want to wear a mask.

551
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,640
I just want to sleep.

552
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,640
Xiao Ge?

553
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,640
Xiao Ge.

554
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,640
Why are you still here?

555
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,640
I'm sorry to bother you.

556
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,640
Xiao Ge, are you okay?

557
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,640
Are you headache again?

558
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,640
You should leave here.

559
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,640
The things in the door

560
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,640
are not what you can handle.

561
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,640
What is it?

562
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,640
Xiao Ge!

563
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,640
Xiao Ge!

564
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,640
Xiao Ge!

565
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,640
Xiao Ge!

566
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,640
I'm sorry.
