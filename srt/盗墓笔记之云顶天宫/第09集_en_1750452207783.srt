00:00:30,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:30,000
sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:18,140
I think.

5
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,140
This place is too narrow.

6
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,140
I'm telling you,

7
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,140
I'm wearing a few thousand yuan of this pile of shit.

8
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,140
Then I'll have to scratch the flowers.

9
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,140
Today's trend is to break the hole and flow.

10
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,140
I don't understand this thing in the fashion circle.

11
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:36,140
This hole, this place, is too natural.

12
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,140
It's so natural.

13
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,140
It's so natural.

14
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,140
I'm so happy.

15
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,140
I'm so happy.

16
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,140
I'm so happy.

17
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,140
It's so natural.

18
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,140
But the temperature here is getting higher.

19
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,140
I'm a little bit too excited.

20
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,140
I think it's a little bit.

21
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,140
Fatty,

22
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,140
why don't we take two more clothes?

23
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,140
No, I think there's a problem with the air quality here.

24
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,140
We're too busy to come in.

25
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,140
Why don't we withdraw first?

26
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,140
No problem.

27
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,140
It's a pity that we're going back now.

28
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,140
And according to such a situation,

29
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,140
we'll be more uncomfortable if we keep going.

30
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,140
Fatty,

31
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,140
keep going.

32
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,140
We'll take two more steps forward.

33
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,140
If we don't get to the bottom,

34
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,140
we'll go back.

35
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,140
Adjust your breathing.

36
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,140
Let's go.

37
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,140
Xiao Ke?

38
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,140
What's wrong?

39
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,140
What's wrong?

40
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,140
Nothing.

41
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,140
It's okay. Let's go.

42
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,140
Fatty,

43
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,140
do you think I'm still here?

44
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,140
What's wrong? You've lost yourself.

45
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,140
You think I'm not here?

46
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,140
You're alone.

47
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,140
Are you talking about money?

48
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,140
Are you crazy?

49
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,140
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,140
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,140
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,140
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,140
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,140
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,140
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,140
I'm sorry.

57
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,140
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,140
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,140
I'm sorry.

60
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,140
I'm sorry.

61
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,140
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,140
I'm sorry.

63
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,140
Oh, my God.

64
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,140
There's still a mural here.

65
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,140
It looks like we're not the first batch of people here.

66
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,140
I don't know if that Feng Xi has already

67
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,140
talked about it when they came here.

68
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,140
This mural is like a scene from the fairy fairy's time.

69
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,140
The entrance here is also full of lanterns and stones.

70
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,140
There's also mural here.

71
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,140
What is this place?

72
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,140
What is this place?

73
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,140
Anyway, to Fatty, this is the Qinghua Chi.

74
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,140
Isn't it?

75
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,140
It's a hot spring, a hot spring,

76
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,140
and a bathhouse.

77
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,140
Who's going to shower?

78
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,140
Wash and brush.

79
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,140
Wash and brush.

80
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,140
Wash and brush.

81
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,140
Wash and brush.

82
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,140
Fatty,

83
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,140
there seems to be a deep hole here.

84
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,140
There's also a wind blowing out from inside.

85
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,140
I don't know where it's going to flow.

86
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,140
It doesn't matter where it's going to flow.

87
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,140
No matter how deep it is, we don't need to explore it anymore.

88
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,140
We just need to find a place

89
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,140
that's warm and snowy.

90
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,140
I think this place is pretty good.

91
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,140
What do you think, Xiao Ge?

92
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,140
Oh, right.

93
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,140
This place is a bit higher in the Pm2.5.

94
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,140
There's no problem with the rest.

95
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,140
I think we should call them down.

96
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,140
Xiao Ge.

97
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,140
Did you feel anything wrong when you were climbing in there?

98
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,140
Is there a problem?

99
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,140
I don't know.

100
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,140
I might have a lack of reaction from the highland.

101
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,140
I feel like I'm in a illusion.

102
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,140
Actually, when we were up there,

103
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,140
before Fatty fell down,

104
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,140
when we saw the message of the archaeological team,

105
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,140
I felt like I was in a illusion.

106
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,140
Are you sure?

107
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,140
I might have been too tired.

108
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,140
I'll just take a break.

109
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,140
Don't worry.

110
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,140
Hurry and call them in.

111
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,140
If they keep moving out,

112
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,140
they'll be frozen into ice.

113
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,140
Be careful, Xiao Ge.

114
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,140
Come on, sit down.

115
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,140
What's wrong?

116
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,140
Old Wang Wen is eating again.

117
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,140
He's eating again?

118
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,140
Yes.

119
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,140
I was just climbing in there.

120
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,140
I suddenly fell asleep for a few seconds.

121
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,140
I had a dream.

122
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,140
Oh, my God.

123
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,140
Listen, don't play with it.

124
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,140
Be careful when you come down.

125
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,140
But it's good.

126
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:21,140
You've dreamed up all the places in the Cloud Sky Palace.

127
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,140
We're here to save our lives.

128
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,140
Okay, go to bed.

129
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,140
Wait for them to come down and eat something.

130
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,140
I'm going to bed.

131
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,140
There's someone outside.

132
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,140
Here.

133
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,140
How did it happen?

134
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,140
We didn't fall down.

135
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,140
We were on the lookout.

136
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,140
We were on the lookout.

137
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,140
We fell down when we were on the lookout.

138
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,140
We fell down when we were on the lookout.

139
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,140
We were lucky.

140
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,140
We were on the rock.

141
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,140
We finally got out.

142
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,140
But most of the equipment was lost.

143
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,140
So they're not saved?

144
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,140
You can stay here until dawn.

145
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,140
After dawn, I'll give you some equipment.

146
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,140
You can go down the mountain.

147
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,140
I want to talk to your boss.

148
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,140
I want to talk to Qiu De.

149
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,140
Miss Ning, you can't make a decision for him.

150
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,140
But I can decide who can use my equipment.

151
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,140
Who can't.

152
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,140
Of course.

153
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,140
But when Qiu De knows,

154
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,140
he'll be very unhappy.

155
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,140
He can't know.

156
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,140
The whole team disappeared under the snow.

157
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,140
Maybe it'll be summer next year.

158
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,140
Or in a few decades,

159
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,140
people will find out.

160
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,140
If what Qiu De said is true,

161
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,140
I'll shoot now.

162
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,140
But you're different.

163
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,140
I'm a grown-up.

164
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,140
I'm the same as him.

165
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,140
Here.

166
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,140
Here you go.

167
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,140
Thanks.

168
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,140
Master Sa, have some water.

169
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,140
I'll drink it.

170
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,140
It's still cold.

171
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,140
I don't know if he can make it through.

172
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,140
You've been trying your best.

173
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,140
It depends on whether he's dead or not.

174
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,140
If he's dead,

175
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,140
it's our fault.

176
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,140
He's a innocent person.

177
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,140
He was involved in the fight.

178
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,140
Sometimes I hate your kind of kindness.

179
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,140
Xuan Zi.

180
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,140
Come in.

181
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,140
Come in.

182
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,140
Xuan Zi.

183
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,140
Come and drink some water.

184
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,140
Okay?

185
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,140
Xuan Zi.

186
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,140
Xuan Zi.

187
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,140
You can't die.

188
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,140
Okay.

189
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,140
He saved me.

190
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,140
Okay.

191
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,140
Okay.

192
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,140
It's a natural formation.

193
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,140
The cave is so narrow.

194
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,140
Why did you draw the mural here?

195
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,140
It's weird.

196
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,140
In the case of a mural

197
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,140
in such a special place,

198
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,140
he should be trying to convey

199
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,140
some information.

200
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,140
But look.

201
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,140
He drew a lot of

202
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,140
beautiful women and

203
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,140
martial arts.

204
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,140
It's not a common thing.

205
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,140
Don't say that.

206
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,140
The beauty is really good.

207
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,140
The front and the back are perfect.

208
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,140
But no matter how you look at it,

209
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,140
it's not true.

210
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,140
Oh my god.

211
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,140
Can you stop using your hands to dig?

212
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,140
Can you stop being so insensitive?

213
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,140
Fatty.

214
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,140
Although it's not valuable,

215
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,140
but you're a fairy.

216
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,140
Don't ruin it.

217
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,140
You pervert.

218
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,140
No.

219
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,140
Look at this.

220
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,140
It's not a layer.

221
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,140
I think it's not that simple.

222
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,140
In my opinion,

223
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,140
it's impossible to draw

224
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,140
such a beautiful woman

225
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,140
without these mural.

226
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,140
But what is it for?

227
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,140
Someone is coming.

228
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,140
Who?

229
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,140
Who is it?

230
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,140
Who is it?

231
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,140
Who is it?

232
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,140
Who is it?

233
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,140
Who is it?

234
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,140
Who is it?

235
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,140
Who is it?

236
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,140
Who is it?

237
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,140
Who is it?

238
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,140
Master Sa.

239
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,140
Pan Zi.

240
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,140
Master Sa.

241
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,140
It's you.

242
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,140
Pan Zi, how can you find this place?

243
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,140
Why can't he find this place?

244
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,140
He is the man that Master Sa likes the most.

245
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,140
I

246
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,140
went out with the painting that Master Sa

247
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,140
gave me.

248
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,140
I wanted to talk to you,

249
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,140
but I fainted.

250
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,140
I didn't expect to meet you here.

251
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,140
Master Sa's painting?

252
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,140
Yes.

253
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,140
Why didn't I hear

254
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,140
that Wu San Xing

255
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,140
has such a map?

256
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,140
Master Chen.

257
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,140
Even if it's a cooperation between the two parties,

258
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,140
it's not necessarily

259
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,140
the two parties' signature is the same.

260
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,140
You should have

261
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,140
taken out some sincerity

262
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,140
because you told us

263
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,140
that the other party's signature

264
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,140
was lost.

265
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,140
We are all so stupid.

266
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,140
You are so good.

267
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,140
Wu San Xing is a good example.

268
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,140
These are not my ideas.

269
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,140
You always say

270
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,140
that I trust you.

271
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,140
Besides, I don't believe

272
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,140
that you have

273
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,140
Wu San Xing

274
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,140
who is a little bit dangerous.

275
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,140
Master Chen,

276
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,140
if you don't believe me,

277
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,140
I will take you to see

278
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,140
what is the real

279
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,140
secret of the real Wenquan Pavilion.

280
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,140
Master Sa,

281
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,140
just think about Pan Zi.

282
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,140
Pan Zi won't harm me.

283
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,140
We will go with him.

284
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,140
Please don't worry.

285
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,140
Master Sa,

286
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,140
I will take you to see

287
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,140
what is the secret of the real Wenquan Pavilion.

288
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,140
Master Sa,

289
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,140
I will take you to see

290
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,140
what is the secret of the real Wenquan Pavilion.

291
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,140
What is that sound?

292
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,140
I don't know.

293
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,140
Where is Shunzi?

294
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,140
What is that sound?

295
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,140
Shunzi.

296
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,140
Shunzi.

297
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,140
Did you leave with them?

298
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,140
You saw it?

299
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,140
Where is he?

300
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,140
What is that sound?

301
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,140
What is going on?

302
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,140
He is poisoned.

303
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,140
Watch out.

304
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,140
Why is the fox gone?

305
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,140
It's gone.

306
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,140
What happened to Shunzi?

307
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,140
Did he get bitten by the fox?

308
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,140
Why isn't he coming up?

309
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,140
Something happened here.

310
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,140
Something happened suddenly.

311
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,140
He is poisoned by the fox.

312
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,140
What are you doing?

313
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,140
I tell you,

314
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,140
I have never met such a thing.

315
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,140
How can I do that?

316
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,140
And,

317
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,140
if Master Chen knows

318
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,140
Shunzi's secret,

319
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,140
he will kill him.

320
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,140
Wenquan,

321
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,140
can you see the poison?

322
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,140
Xiao Ge, are you sure?

323
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,140
How do you know?

324
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,140
The Wenquan here

325
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,140
is the same.

326
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,140
Alright.

327
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,140
Anyway,

328
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,140
we have to leave now.

329
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,140
Master Si,

330
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,140
we can't let them wait for too long.

331
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,140
The matter is solved.

332
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,140
What were you doing?

333
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,140
There is a secret.

334
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,140
Well,

335
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,140
Master Chen,

336
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,140
Zhou Wenquan is upstairs.

337
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,140
Let's hurry up and leave.

338
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,140
Otherwise, it's too late.

339
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,140
This way.

340
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,140
Xiao Ge.

341
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,140
Master Si, please.

342
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,140
Let's go.

343
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,140
Master Si, be careful.

344
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,140
Master,

345
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,140
the result is out.

346
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,140
Those photos

347
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,140
were taken by some foreigners

348
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,140
at the Hiding Museum.

349
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,140
It is said that

350
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,140
it was the Hiding Museum

351
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,140
that held the World Cup.

352
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,140
Master San also participated.

353
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,140
Do you have any more detailed information?

354
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,140
I want to know

355
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,140
what happened

356
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,140
down there.

357
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,140
Qiu Decao's secret

358
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,140
is very strict.

359
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,140
If we have to investigate it,

360
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,140
I'm afraid...

361
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,140
I don't care.

362
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,140
Just get through

363
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,140
the Xie family's

364
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,140
and contact the Hiding Museum.

365
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,140
I must find out

366
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,140
the truth about the incident.

367
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,140
Be careful.

368
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,140
Follow me.

369
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,140
Master.

370
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,140
So, the real Wenquan Inn

371
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,140
is in this place.

372
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,140
Fatty.

373
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,140
It must be

374
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,140
the Wenquan Inn

375
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,140
that Shun Zi said.

376
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,140
The old man was so smart.

377
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,140
He was so stubborn

378
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,140
and even made the test team up.

379
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,140
Fatty.

380
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,140
You are so stubborn.

381
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,140
I'm telling you.

382
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,140
I'm not even digging it.

383
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,140
Show it to Fatty.

384
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,140
Do you have two layers?

385
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,140
Two layers?

386
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,140
Oh, my God.

387
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,140
I thought it was weird.

388
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,140
The whole style of the painting

389
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,140
is different.

390
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,140
It must be a problem.

391
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,140
Someone must have

392
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,140
painted a layer

393
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,140
on the original painting.

394
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,140
Then the air-conditioning

395
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,140
of the outside layer

396
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,140
was added to the painting.

397
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,140
Then the air-conditioning

398
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,140
was added to the painting.

399
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,140
It was too long.

400
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,140
Naturally, it was removed.

401
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,140
The inside layer was added.

402
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,140
Then the time was long enough.

403
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,140
The inside layer was also removed.

404
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,140
But these are all not important.

405
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,140
The important thing is

406
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,140
Fatty,

407
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,140
you have a sharp eye.

408
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,140
How did you know?

409
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,140
Fatty, this pair of eyes

410
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,140
are not normal.

411
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,140
I'll give you a discount.

412
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,140
Thank you.

413
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,140
There seems to be

414
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,140
some unfinished works

415
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,140
on the upper layer.

416
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,140
What do you mean?

417
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,140
The painting after the bed

418
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,140
often has a special

419
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,140
light on it.

420
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,140
It's like a goldfish

421
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,140
who can protect the painting.

422
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,140
This painting

423
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,140
won't be so easy to

424
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,140
fade and fall.

425
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,140
Then this may be

426
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,140
the previous bed.

427
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,140
Plus, this place

428
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,140
is hot and humid.

429
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,140
It also affects

430
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,140
the protection of the painting.

431
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,140
Why are you looking at me?

432
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,140
No.

433
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,140
It's hard for you

434
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,140
to say such a reasonable thing.

435
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,140
Just like that.

436
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,140
Don't think I don't know

437
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,140
your beauty is also very strong.

438
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,140
Can a soul be beautiful?

439
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,140
Yes, yes.

440
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,140
The carriage on the cloud

441
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,140
and these people's clothes.

442
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,140
Fatty,

443
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,140
Little brother,

444
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,140
do you remember

445
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,140
the clothes we saw

446
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,140
at the painting on the bottom of the sea?

447
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,140
This is also related to the sky.

448
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,140
Little brother,

449
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,140
I heard they have been

450
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,140
keeping the clouds on the sky.

451
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,140
Is it right?

452
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,140
Fine.

453
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,140
You go help them.

454
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,140
Let's go.

455
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,140
Thank you, Kuan Dai.

456
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,140
Please take care

457
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,140
of the future journey.

458
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,140
Tang Dao,

459
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,140
take her to rest.

460
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,140
Take care of our supplies

461
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,140
so that

462
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,140
no one else

463
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,140
can harm you.

464
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,140
I understand.

465
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,140
Don't worry.

466
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,140
Sir,

467
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,140
we got our own logistic channel.

468
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,140
Why are we collaborating

469
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,140
with Jason at all?

470
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,140
Name.

471
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,140
I have a bench

472
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,140
of cargo ready to send out.

473
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,140
I need a new road

474
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,140
and new team.

475
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,140
In fact,

476
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,140
Jason's plan

477
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,140
is quite reasonable.

478
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,140
Just send some

479
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,140
to keep an eye on him.

480
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,140
If he plays any games,

481
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,140
let's say they might encounter

482
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,140
a small snow slide.

483
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,140
If he doesn't behave,

484
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,140
don't worry.

485
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,140
If he cooperates,

486
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,140
he could even take a peek

487
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,140
at the palace secret.

488
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,140
We can talk about it

489
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,140
when I'm there.

490
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,140
Sir,

491
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,140
the weather is unpredictable

492
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,140
on the moment.

493
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,140
It's not a good time.

494
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,140
Sir,

495
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,140
I don't recommend you to come.

496
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,140
It's too dangerous.

497
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,140
If you want to monitor the situation,

498
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,140
I could report

499
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,140
or via video streaming.

500
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,140
It's too dangerous here.

501
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,140
No,

502
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,140
I have to see with my own eyes

503
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,140
the secret of the Cloud Sky Palace

504
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,140
is very dear to me.

505
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,140
It's like a long lost love of mine.

506
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,140
North Sea is on the sub-table.

507
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,140
You have to understand

508
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,140
the desperate yearning of a Nordman.

509
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,140
Do you sleep so early

510
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,140
every day?

511
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,140
I'm sure

512
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,140
there are many things

513
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,140
that are hidden from you.

514
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,140
In this world,

515
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,140
what's the hardest thing?

516
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,140
The heart of a person.

517
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,140
I can only say so much to you.

518
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,140
Look,

519
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,140
that is very possible.

520
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,140
It's the battle

521
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,140
of the East-East countries.

522
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,140
Look,

523
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,060
those who wear the

524
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,140
leather and the sea armor

525
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,140
should be the Mongolian army.

526
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,140
And the Mongolian army

527
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,140
is far more than the East-East army.

528
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,140
This is a serious battle.

529
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,140
The East-East countries use women's soldiers.

530
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,140
Isn't the king's country natural?

531
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,140
I just crossed your eyes

532
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,140
and exposed my ignorance.

533
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,140
Look,

534
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,140
these faces of the East-East countries

535
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,140
are so beautiful.

536
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,140
Actually,

537
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,140
this is very special.

538
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,140
According to the records on the history,

539
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,140
the people of the East-East

540
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,140
have been talking about it.

541
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,140
This country

542
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,140
doesn't have an old man.

543
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,140
And the records of the later North-East people,

544
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,140
even if they die,

545
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,140
they will still keep the youth.

546
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,140
Isn't that strange?

547
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,140
Can they

548
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,140
be old?

549
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,140
This mural

550
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,140
is a story of two parts.

551
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,140
But it's very complete

552
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,140
with the two parts.

553
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,140
It's just...

554
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,140
It's just beautiful.

555
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,140
Look,

556
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,140
the battles here

557
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,140
are very fierce.

558
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,140
The first and third.

559
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,140
But in the end,

560
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,140
they are too few.

561
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,140
They were killed by Mongolians.

562
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,140
The battle has finally become

563
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,140
a massacre.

564
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:35,140
The painting is really artistic.

565
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,140
We don't understand

566
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,140
what you said.

567
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,140
It's all very confusing.

568
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,140
Right, Yan Zhen?

569
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,140
It's really a mystery.

570
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,140
Don't be so formal.

571
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,140
I'm interested in this part of history.

572
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,140
You'll know

573
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,140
more about the books.

574
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,140
We don't have the same books.

575
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,140
So what?

576
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,140
What else do you have?

577
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,140
Tell me about the East-East countries.

578
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,140
Well...

579
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,140
The East-East

580
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,140
was a regime

581
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,140
that was suddenly

582
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,140
established

583
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,140
by the women

584
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,140
in the time of

585
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,140
Jilin and Heilongjiang.

586
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,140
According to the history,

587
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,140
they had a relationship

588
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,140
with women.

589
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,140
Even the text

590
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,140
was the same.

591
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,140
Then Mongolians

592
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,140
went around the North and the North.

593
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,140
They killed them.

594
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,140
In the whole history,

595
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,140
they existed for 70 years.

596
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,140
So some historians

597
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,140
thought that

598
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,140
they were a big part of the tribe.

599
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,140
Because from the population,

600
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,140
politics,

601
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,140
and the territory,

602
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,140
they were the top of the nation.

603
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,140
Mr. Si,

604
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,140
didn't you say

605
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,140
we were going to look for

606
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,140
the tomb of the East-East emperor?

607
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,140
But the East-East

608
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,140
only existed for 70 years.

609
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,140
There weren't many people.

610
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,140
And from the mural,

611
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,140
the clothing,

612
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,140
the architecture,

613
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,140
and the production

614
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,140
were not high.

615
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,140
How could they

616
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,140
have the ability

617
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,140
to see such a tomb?

618
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,140
Even if they had the ability,

619
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,140
they didn't have time.

620
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,140
Right.

621
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,140
The tomb of the ancient people

622
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,140
was divided into levels.

623
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,140
Mr. Si,

624
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,140
how big is the tomb you mentioned?

625
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,140
I just heard you say

626
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,140
the clothing of the East-East.

627
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,140
Have you ever seen it

628
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,140
on other mural?

629
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,140
The mural is described

630
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,140
by a group of women

631
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,140
wearing such clothing

632
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,140
on the snowy mountain.

633
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,140
The end is

634
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,140
a palace with a service area.

635
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,140
Have you ever thought about

636
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,140
whether the so-called

637
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,140
Cloud Sky Palace

638
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,140
would be the same place

639
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,140
as the East-East imperial forest?

640
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,140
We've thought about it.

641
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,140
But didn't Mr. Hua say

642
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,140
the East-East destroyed the country

643
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,140
and the Yuan Dynasty was the first one?

644
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,140
And the Cloud Sky Palace

645
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,140
is the structure of Wang Zang Hai.

646
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,140
It's been

647
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,140
missing for decades

648
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,140
and even hundreds of years.

649
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,140
You've got it.

650
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,140
I've checked the information.

651
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,140
From the record,

652
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,140
I found some clues.

653
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,140
Actually, the East-East

654
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,140
didn't have any evidence.

655
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,140
It's very likely

656
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,140
that they've entered

657
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,140
the mountain part of the forest.

658
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,140
I've studied the high-level quality.

659
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,140
When the Ming Dynasty was in the early days,

660
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,140
there were some officials

661
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,140
from the imperial court

662
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,140
who saw some of the clothing

663
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,140
on the mountain.

664
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,140
I believe

665
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,140
those were the people

666
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,140
who didn't have evidence.

667
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,140
Yes.

668
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,140
And

669
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,140
we have more direct information

670
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,140
to prove.

671
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,140
I think

672
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,140
that's all.

673
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,140
What's that?

674
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,380
Take it and have a look.

675
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,380
Is this a real goods?

676
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,380
Is this a real goods?

677
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,940
The one in Guangxi Jin'er Palace

678
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,620
is really in his hands.

679
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,380
Look, give it to Si A Gong.

680
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,420
Don't ruin it.

681
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,700
This kind of copper fish is a dragon's form.

682
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,220
It was obtained by our Si A Gong

683
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,660
in the time of the Little River.

684
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,260
I believe that the people who make this copper fish

685
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,020
must know this Dong Xia Gu.

686
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,300
And it's even more special.

687
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,140
Through this copper fish,

688
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,380
it hides a very secret secret.

689
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,620
Si A Gong.

690
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,380
Look.

691
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,980
The secret is on the copper fish's scales.

692
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,460
It has 47 female needles.

693
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,540
It's amazing.

694
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,580
There are such a miracle and such a memory.

695
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,420
When I first saw it,

696
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,180
I almost lost my lower part.

697
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,580
What's on it?

698
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,100
I can't figure out the data on it.

699
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,860
But I'm the one who made this copper fish.

700
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,900
But I believe that the people who made this copper fish

701
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,060
want to record the secret of Dong Xia Gu.

702
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,820
The record on it is that

703
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,740
after the battle between Dong Xia and Mongolians,

704
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:36,860
some people retreated to the border with the capital.

705
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,460
They lived there for a long time.

706
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,340
If I can find the right data,

707
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,660
I can reveal the truth of this period.

708
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,300
Si A Gong.

709
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,580
I'll know in a third.

710
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,100
Just a bit earlier.

711
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:56,540
The card name is also on the bill.

712
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,460
I already had it.

713
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,180
But your uncle took it.

714
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,260
Si A Gong, you're so generous.

715
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:09,580
You know it's們 that will leave 계ッchic.

716
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,620
Your uncle was exchangeé 2 wooden pieces for eachёл.

717
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,500
Besides, he even took 3 relative capturing powers.

718
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,500
and exchange them as a price for the stock.

719
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,500
And she promised me that

720
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,500
after she broke the information

721
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,500
she would give it to me.

722
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,500
I'm not ashamed of it.

723
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,500
But now,

724
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,500
there's no more news.

725
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,500
Zhou Xiao San, your uncle sent you

726
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,500
to find the Cloud Sky Palace.

727
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,500
I think she has already broken the information

728
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,500
on this copper fish.

729
00:32:45,500 --> 00:33:02,500
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten.

730
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,500
Sir, did I live in Jiala for the third time?

731
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,500
I didn't send you outside.

732
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,500
It means that she didn't want to hide anything from you.

733
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,500
And we are in a mess now.

734
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,500
We can only rely on ourselves if we can't contact her.

735
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,500
Besides, if you didn't tell me

736
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,500
that we don't know what's going on

737
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,500
between the Cloud Sky Palace and the Eastern Xia Palace,

738
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,500
I don't know.

739
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:28,500
Wu San Xing is a secret trick.

740
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,500
I'm afraid he will take it out on you this time.

741
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,500
He will also break your finger.

742
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,500
That guy...

743
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,500
Who said that?

744
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,500
I'm not the same as my uncle.

745
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,500
If it wasn't for him,

746
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,500
I would have split up with him.

747
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,500
He even broke my finger.

748
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,500
He is wrong.

749
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,500
Okay, let's break it up.

750
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,500
Let's find out the clues about the Cloud Sky Palace.

751
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,500
Okay?

752
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,500
Sir.

753
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,500
What?

754
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,500
Do you think that the Phoenix behind this is...

755
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,500
How about I blow it up?

756
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,500
Why do you want to blow it up?

757
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,500
You really don't want to let me know your name?

758
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,500
Do you want to blow up this Phoenix?

759
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,500
Yes.

760
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,500
I don't want to.

761
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,500
Why?

762
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,500
I don't want to.

763
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,500
I don't want to.

764
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,500
I don't want to.

765
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,500
I don't want to.

766
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,500
I don't want to.

767
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,500
Why?

768
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,500
Do you know why it's called a cannon?

769
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Let me tell you.

770
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,500
If there is a place that can't be passed,

771
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,500
it will be blown up.

772
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,500
It's not blown up.

773
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,500
And the firepower that this guy has,

774
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,500
it's not bad.

775
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,500
Let's lower it a bit.

776
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,500
That's great.

777
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,500
Then we might have a bigger chance of winning.

778
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,500
But I mean that

779
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,500
there is no way that the Phoenix behind this is possible.

780
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,500
Why?

781
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
It's a natural ice layer structure.

782
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,500
There are many mechanical structures on it.

783
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,500
There is no passage behind this Phoenix.

784
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,500
There is no extra control.

785
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,500
According to the thickness of the layer here

786
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,500
and the air flow,

787
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,500
I don't think there is a passage behind this Phoenix.

788
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,500
That's great, Wu Xian.

789
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,500
How did you get these knowledge?

790
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,500
I studied architecture in college.

791
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,500
Why are you so stubborn?

792
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,500
If you don't want to, let's go back.

793
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,500
There is no meaning in this.

794
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,500
Really.

795
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,500
I'm afraid that something will happen.

796
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,500
Why are you here?

797
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,500
Shun Zi, are you all right?

798
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,500
I'm much better.

799
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,500
It might be the operation of the snow mountain.

800
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,500
I've been here since I woke up.

801
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,500
So I came out to take a walk.

802
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,500
I'm afraid that you might encounter danger.

803
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,500
That's great.

804
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,500
How did you know this place?

805
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,500
This is the hot spring I mentioned before.

806
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,500
Very few people know about it.

807
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,500
My father told me about it.

808
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,500
Come here.

809
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,500
Let's go.

810
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,500
Look, we found it in the Shilong Gate.

811
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,500
Let's see if your father brought the archaeological team.

812
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,500
Zhao Yuzheng?

813
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,500
I didn't think so.

814
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,500
They were following us very early.

815
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,500
Shun Zi, did your father tell you

816
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,500
where the archaeological team was?

817
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,500
No, I was still young.

818
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,500
He wouldn't tell me about it.

819
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,500
Didn't you come to Mount Dong?

820
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,500
Shun Zi, we're here.

821
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,500
You should say what you should say.

822
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,500
You know what you should say.

823
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,500
Let's go.

824
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,500
Let's go.

825
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,500
Let's go back.

826
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,500
Let's go.

827
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,500
Don't be busy.

828
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,500
Shun Zi.

829
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,500
Don't you want to know the reason?

830
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,500
Open his palm and see what it is.

831
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,500
Tong Yu?

832
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,500
Come on.

833
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,500
Come on.

834
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,500
Don't be impulsive.

835
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,500
Ask the main reason first.

836
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,500
Yes, ask it clearly.

837
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,500
Shun Zi.

838
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,500
Shun Zi, what's going on?

839
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,500
Uncle, this...

840
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,500
He's not clear now.

841
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,500
Wen Quan has suppressed him for a while.

842
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,500
Now the poison in his body has infected the spirit.

843
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,500
Then we can only see him.

844
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,500
Why?

845
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,500
After he was bitten by fox,

846
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,500
he couldn't clean his wound in time.

847
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,500
The blood in his nose was also infected with the spirit.

848
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,500
It caused the central nerve to be in a mess.

849
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,500
So he was the one who was attacked by me?

850
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,500
Brother, I didn't mean that.

851
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,500
He said Shun Zi was the one who stole your snake-meat Tong Yu.

852
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,500
As long as he's not in the body, it's fine.

853
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,500
Shun Zi.

854
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,500
Shun Zi.

855
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,500
Shun Zi.

856
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,500
Tell me, what happened just now?

857
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,500
I don't know.

858
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:44,500
I just know that the thing was very suspicious.

859
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:48,500
Then I kept on believing it.

860
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,500
I don't know what happened next.

861
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,500
Fine.

862
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,500
Now the spirit is in trouble.

863
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,500
It's even more serious.

864
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,500
Wu Xie, I've told you.

865
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,500
Don't waste resources on those meaningless people.

866
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,500
You can't say that.

867
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,500
If you don't have him,

868
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,500
we can't get here safely.

869
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,500
He's just a fool, you know?

870
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,500
It's good to have a hot spring.

871
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,500
It's everywhere.

872
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,500
Who knows how long he'll last?

873
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,500
Do we have that much time to delay?

874
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,500
Two days.

875
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,500
He's not seriously poisoned.

876
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,500
At least two days.

877
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,500
How do you know?

878
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:27,500
How do I feel that you're familiar with this place?

879
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,500
I knew it.

880
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,500
I knew it.

881
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,500
If there's another time,

882
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,500
you're not going to be in the way.

883
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,500
Are you okay?

884
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,500
This is the last sentence

885
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,500
of the female detective on the same fish.

886
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,500
It's very interesting.

887
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,500
What is it?

888
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,500
Actually, the last sentence

889
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,500
is not very clear.

890
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,500
Mainly because of the data.

891
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,500
If we can find the last part,

892
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,500
I can break this sentence.

893
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,500
Don't make that up.

894
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,500
It's true.

895
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,500
We're all ten generations.

896
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,500
We're all human beings.

897
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,500
We're all human beings.

898
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,500
We're all human beings.

899
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,500
We're all human beings.

900
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,500
We're all human beings.

901
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,500
We'll know when we get back.

902
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,500
One thousand and twenty-two.

903
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,500
Do you know what it is?

904
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,500
Do you know the ratio?

905
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,500
Actually, I've been thinking.

906
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,500
Why did the person who drew the mural

907
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,500
draw these mural here?

908
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,500
And also added a layer of the same.

909
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,500
I think

910
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,500
they wanted to draw the mural here

911
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,500
and then cut the whole stone

912
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,500
and move it to the museum.

913
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,500
Or

914
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,500
they really just

915
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,500
don't care about it.

916
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,500
Do you know that?

917
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,500
We're all here to make it up.

918
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,500
Really.

919
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,500
It's okay to draw something.

920
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,500
It's of no use.

921
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,500
You've only found the mural.

922
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,500
He doesn't know

923
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,500
why he's drawing here.

924
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,500
Do you know that?

925
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,500
You have a talent.

926
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,500
No.

927
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,500
You can always

928
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,500
think of

929
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,500
those complicated things

930
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,500
very easily.

931
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,500
You can't get it

932
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,500
in your whole life.

933
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,500
Yes.

934
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,500
Let's stop talking.

935
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,500
Let's go back to the Dragon Pond to rest.

936
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,500
Yes.

937
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,500
I'm almost tired.

938
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,500
Mr. Wang.

939
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,500
Come.

940
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,500
Shunzi.

941
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,500
You guys go back first.

942
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,500
I'll put Shunzi in the warm-up.

943
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,500
I'll detoxify her.

944
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,500
Wow.

945
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,500
The wind is blowing.

946
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,500
The sun is shining.

947
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,500
The flowers are blooming.

948
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,500
The direction of the return is going to the wind.

949
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,500
The direction of the return is going to the wind.
