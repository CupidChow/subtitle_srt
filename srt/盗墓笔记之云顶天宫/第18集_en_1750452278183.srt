Episode 1

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What?

3
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,500
What's wrong?

4
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,300
Mr. Sanye,

5
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,500
go and jump!

6
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,500
I'll cover you!

7
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,500
Hurry!

8
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,500
Mr. Sanye,

9
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,500
I'm almost dead!

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,500
Go and jump!

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,500
Hurry!

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,500
Hurry!

13
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,500
Hurry!

14
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,500
Go and get the painting.

15
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,500
Let him come to Hangzhou.

16
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,500
Mr. Sanye!

17
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,500
Hurry and give me a painting!

18
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,500
Mr. Sanye!

19
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,500
Mr. Sanye, I'm bleeding!

20
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,500
You know that, Mr. Sanye!

21
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,500
Wait! Wait!

22
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,500
I'm bleeding!

23
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,500
Mr. Sanye!

24
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,500
Mr. Sanye, I'm going to jump!

25
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Mr. Sanye!

26
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm going to save you!

27
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Mr. Sanye!

28
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You can't go down!

29
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You can't let me go!

30
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Mr. Sanye, I'm sorry, Mr. Sanye!

31
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Sanye!

32
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Sanye!

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Mr. Sanye, you can't go down!

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Mr. Sanye!

35
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Mr. Sanye,

36
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Mr. Sanye,

37
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
you must know where Mr. Sanye is!

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You told me about him!

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I don't know!

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Mr. Sanye told me

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
to bring that painting to Wu Xie.

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He said that Wu Xie would bring us to him.

43
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'll find him.

44
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Mr. Sanye!

45
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,500
Mr. Sanye!

46
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Mr. Sanye.

47
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Where are we going?

48
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Mr. Sanye.

49
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I guess we're not in the right way.

50
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,720
Uncle I'm okay,but I don't feel...

51
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,540
You're supposed to have viewers of the TV program,

52
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,780
but it seems that you are more considerate,

53
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,740
sir.

54
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,800
Hello old man,

55
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,600
Hurry up!

56
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,660
I will die.

57
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,400
Hold on!

58
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,140
Hold on.

59
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,000
Hurry!

60
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,840
I'm feeling!

61
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,240
재우빈.

62
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,120
Let's go!

63
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,360
Won't you save me?

64
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
Go!

65
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
Master.

66
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
Master.

67
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
Master.

68
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
Come here and help.

69
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,800
Master. Master.

70
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
Master.

71
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
Master.

72
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
Master.

73
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
Master.

74
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
Master.

75
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
Why are you here?

76
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,800
We have to leave here.

77
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,800
Have you thought about what you said?

78
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
Xuan Wu is a real brother.

79
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,800
In this world, there is no such place.

80
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,800
If someone is buried in such place,

81
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,800
his past and death, and many things happen to him,

82
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,800
it will be strange.

83
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,800
This is the worst flood in the world.

84
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
It is all gathered together.

85
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,800
Of course, this is the same as the legendary flood.

86
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,800
The same as the nine dragon petals.

87
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,800
Besides, this is the East Xia Forest.

88
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,800
How can the flood be worse in the place where the emperor is buried?

89
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
The flood is for people.

90
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
If Wan Nuwang is not human,

91
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
how can Wan Nuwang not be human?

92
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,800
When we came here, we saw the map, the painting,

93
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,800
and the snake-and-soul-tree of Chenpin A4.

94
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Wan Nuwang is not human.

95
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
The information on the snake-and-tree is not accurate.

96
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,800
If we can get all the snake-and-tree,

97
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
we might be able to figure it out.

98
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,800
But, if you say it again,

99
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,800
I will tell you how to do it.

100
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
If you can tell me this,

101
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,800
it is possible that if you tell me this,

102
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,800
I will not understand the people outside.

103
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
That is to say,

104
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,800
we can't understand it in a word.

105
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,800
So, you can only understand the words of the third uncle.

106
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,800
This is the way to communicate with each other.

107
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
I don't know.

108
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,800
I don't understand.

109
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,800
Don't worry. Take your time.

110
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Little brother,

111
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
let's go back and check.

112
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,800
Let's go.

113
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,800
Let's go.

114
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,800
The blood is still there.

115
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,800
I don't know where they are.

116
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,800
Wan Nuwang.

117
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,800
These people are all the people he has been waiting for.

118
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
They are all the people he has been waiting for.

119
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,800
They are all the people he has been waiting for.

120
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
They are all the people he has been waiting for.

121
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
They are all the people he has been waiting for.

122
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
They are all the people he has been waiting for.

123
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
They are all the people he has been waiting for.

124
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,800
They are all the people he has been waiting for.

125
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
They are all the people he has been waiting for.

126
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
They are all the people he has been waiting for.

127
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
They are all the people he has been waiting for.

128
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
They are all the people he has been waiting for.

129
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,800
They are all the people he has been waiting for.

130
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,800
They are all the people he has been waiting for.

131
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,800
They are all the people he has been waiting for.

132
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
They are all the people he has been waiting for.

133
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
They are all the people he has been waiting for.

134
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
He contrat Kalau Huayi down.

135
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
He Floyd Nan not so quick as she was to him.

136
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:24,800
What does he have to do with

137
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,800
Be careful.

138
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,800
Enter.

139
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,800
As soon as your log is happening,

140
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,800
Think about it.

141
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,880
Who loves you the most? It's me, your uncle.

142
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,280
You go first. You go with me.

143
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,600
Be careful.

144
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,240
Who just saw the gun?

145
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:55,880
Me.

146
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,520
Me?

147
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,280
Me.

148
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,280
You three stay here.

149
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,600
Go away.

150
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,960
Why?

151
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,680
Hurry up.

152
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,880
Okay.

153
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,720
It's not my idea. It's your uncle's idea.

154
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,720
Uncle?

155
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,040
It's uncle's idea.

156
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,800
Don't ask so much.

157
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,920
I'll take you to see your uncle.

158
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,120
Ask yourself.

159
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,720
Ge'er.

160
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,200
Shunzi really separated us on purpose?

161
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,000
He pretended to be a man.

162
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,400
No one cares about him.

163
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,120
He can secretly tell me what happened.

164
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,400
Why did he separate us?

165
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,120
Good.

166
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,280
Then, why did uncle...

167
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,600
control Shunzi's life with you?

168
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,440
Wasn't he told by His Majesty that he is his own man?

169
00:17:42,360 --> 00:18:00,320
Did he keep us because he

170
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,360
No.

171
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:12,860
Excuse me.

172
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,360
Did you see this?

173
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:19,280
Well?

174
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:20,680
Excuse me.

175
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:22,740
Hello.

176
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:27,680
What's the matter?..

177
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,120
They٦l arrive.

178
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,460
Pleaseッ

179
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,800
Don't forget that you will be Miss Maya

180
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,900
I'll work carefully

181
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,060
No problem

182
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,960
Alright

183
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,480
Miss Maya

184
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,480
We'll do as we're told.

185
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,980
We'll have to hurry back to Changsha.

186
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,980
We'll have to attend the meeting.

187
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,480
We've already told Miss Xiu Xiu about it.

188
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,980
She said she understood.

189
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,980
And the last thing is about the photo of Heidi Mu.

190
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,980
We've blackened Qiu Dekou's database.

191
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,980
We've confirmed that the photo is real.

192
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,980
Jia Sha.

193
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,980
My Lord.

194
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,980
Do you think I'm too stubborn sometimes?

195
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,360
Have a look.

196
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,040
Jacob Hเอ Tam.

197
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,080
There's ?!

198
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,780
Father.

199
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,220
Yes this is therose forest.

200
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,340
Your Highness,

201
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:08,740
is this purpose for the

202
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:21,300
Inf complexities of packets?

203
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,380
That's right.

204
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,860
I feel like Qiu Deq has great confidence in his own work.

205
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,500
Let's go.

206
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,780
inj ..

207
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,460
Nothing.

208
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,440
Mikoy...

209
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,240
Where are we going to?

210
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,600
I dare either to see you in my life, marks or items.

211
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,400
H bonus!

212
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,320
Do not waste my living your phones coming.

213
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,600
No, you can't.

214
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,720
I don't want you to have a problem.

215
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,520
Go to my family now.

216
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,760
Don't say that, don't you?

217
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,240
Fine, I will go to the세요, you know.

218
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,840
Be hide there.

219
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,800
I told uncle Datum!

220
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,480
Be be, I said it all the time.

221
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,920
Don't speak.

222
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,920
The bookshelves are also open.

223
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,920
Let's go.

224
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,920
The bookshelves are open.

225
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,920
Master, this is the diary of the late Wu Jiaxiao.

226
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,920
He's the one who wrote the diary.

227
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,920
He doesn't have many people to imitate.

228
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,920
Master Wu Jiaxiao also wrote the diary in his grave.

229
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,920
Master, this must be the bookshelves' circle.

230
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,920
Master, this is the diary of the late Wu Jiaxiao.

231
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,920
The company of Xie Yu Chengnan decided to take off to the northeast.

232
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,920
They should be meeting Wu Xie Sun.

233
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,920
Very well.

234
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,920
Although, still no words from Ning.

235
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,920
She'll get in contact if she's alive.

236
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,920
We have to leave now.

237
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,920
Master, this is the diary of the late Wu Jiaxiao.

238
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,920
Master, this is the diary of the late Wu Jiaxiao.

239
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,920
Master, this is the diary of the late Wu Jiaxiao.

240
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,920
Master, this is the diary of the late Wu Jiaxiao.

241
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,920
Master, this is the diary of the late Wu Jiaxiao.

242
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,920
Master, this is the diary of the late Wu Jiaxiao.

243
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,920
Master, this is the diary of the late Wu Jiaxiao.

244
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,920
Master, this is the diary of the late Wu Jiaxiao.

245
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,920
Master, this is the diary of the late Wu Jiaxiao.

246
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,920
Master, this is the diary of the late Wu Jiaxiao.

247
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,920
Master, this is the diary of the late Wu Jiaxiao.

248
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,920
Master.

249
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,920
Get some rest.

250
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,700
Don't touch a single muscle.

251
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,700
Don't sleep until the main body is Studio.

252
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,320
Don't worry, Boss.

253
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,020
Let us have a'mозможно day.

254
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:10,620
Haha.

255
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,160
Watch the restaurant.

256
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,200
A pep.

257
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,200
What is this place?

258
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
This is the underground building.

259
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,200
This building is probably the place where the Celestial Palace was built.

260
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,200
It can only be hidden for now.

261
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,200
Besides, we don't have much food.

262
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,200
Brother Xia.

263
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,200
Brother Xia.

264
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,200
Brother Xia.

265
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,200
Then why do we have to look for those people?

266
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,200
Is there any shelter?

267
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,200
Hurry up.

268
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
Luckily, we were lucky.

269
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,200
After we fell down,

270
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,200
those people came back.

271
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,200
Don't worry.

272
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,200
We'll take care of it.

273
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,200
Let's replenish our energy first.

274
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,200
Hurry up and rest.

275
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,200
Don't be afraid.

276
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,200
Those people are hiding here.

277
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,200
They'll escape.

278
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,200
Don't think about it.

279
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
Hurry up and rest.

280
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,200
We still have a long way to go.

281
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,200
Brother Xia.

282
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,200
Luckily, I met you.

283
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,200
Otherwise,

284
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,200
I don't know how long I'll have to bear it.

285
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,200
Where are the others?

286
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,200
The others...

287
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,200
They're all gone.

288
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,200
Where are the fat people?

289
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,200
They won't follow you.

290
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,200
Brother Xia.

291
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,200
Why is this bridge still broken?

292
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,200
Brother Xia.

293
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,200
SHUSHER

294
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,200
In the name of bullet,

295
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,200
T jest 14

296
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,200
Go.

297
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,200
What do I do?

298
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,200
T!

299
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,200
That's enough.

300
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,200
Don't hurry.

301
00:29:41,200 --> 00:30:11,160
Ther WILda

302
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,200
Geng, what's wrong?

303
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,200
Do you feel better?

304
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,200
I wonder if those people will come again.

305
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,200
I don't think so.

306
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,200
The wind is blowing here.

307
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,200
Geng, we've been waiting for you.

308
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,200
It's not a big deal.

309
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,200
Geng, what's wrong?

310
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,200
Geng, what's wrong?

311
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,200
Geng, what's wrong?

312
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,200
Geng, what's wrong?

313
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,200
Geng, what's wrong?

314
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
Geng, what's wrong?

315
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,200
I think you have a little life.

316
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,200
I was brought down by that big bird.

317
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,200
I don't want to come back to you.

318
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,200
I can't be with you.

319
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,200
I'm still a king.

320
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,200
You're a fat man.

321
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,200
Didn't I tell you?

322
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,200
What's wrong with you?

323
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,200
You...

324
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,200
Stop it.

325
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,200
What?

326
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,200
Right?

327
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,200
You're a fat man.

328
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
I'm ashamed of you, right?

329
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,200
Come on, Geng.

330
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,200
Eat something.

331
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,200
Look, Geng, I'm telling you.

332
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,200
This is the internal conflict of the people.

333
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,200
It's not a conflict against me.

334
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,200
Okay.

335
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,200
We'll go to the meeting tomorrow.

336
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,200
We can't go without a wound.

337
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,200
We can't go without a purpose.

338
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,200
Listen to Geng.

339
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,200
Get up.

340
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,200
I'm going to sleep.

341
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,200
You're a fat man.

342
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,200
Geng, look at him.

343
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,200
He's...

344
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,200
He's a fat man.

345
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,200
Look at him.

346
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,200
I'm not a man anyway.

347
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,200
I'm a king.

348
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,200
I'm not a man.

349
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,200
I'm a fat man.

350
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,200
I'm a man.

351
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,200
How tired am I?

352
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,200
I have to bear all the things

353
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,200
that I have to do with your family.

354
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,200
I'm not a man.

355
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,200
I'm a man.

356
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,200
I'm a man.

357
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,200
I'm a man.

358
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,200
Come here.

359
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,200
Come here.

360
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,200
Come here.

361
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,200
Young Master.

362
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,200
The things inside

363
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,200
are the names that we can leave on the bones.

364
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,200
It's not a thief.

365
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,200
It's the bones' names.

366
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,200
No matter how much we talk,

367
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,200
we can't change our birth.

368
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,200
Third Uncle.

369
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,200
What time is it?

370
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,200
We still hope to study life.

371
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,200
We should change your mind.

372
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,200
Look at your boss.

373
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,200
He's a local engineer.

374
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,200
He's a very kind man.

375
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,200
He's respected by many people.

376
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,200
How can he be so useless?

377
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,200
You're still my boss.

378
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,200
You're still my boss.

379
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,200
I'm still your boss.

380
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,200
I'm a good man anyway.

381
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,200
If you're not willing to do anything,

382
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,200
I'll take the chopsticks.

383
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,200
Lian Huan.

384
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,200
Lian Huan.

385
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,200
Lian Huan.

386
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,200
Third Uncle.

387
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,200
Third Uncle.

388
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,200
Third Uncle.

389
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,200
Third Uncle.

390
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,200
Who is it?

391
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
Come out now!

392
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,200
Who is it?

393
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,200
Come out!

394
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,200
Third Uncle.

395
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,200
Why did you hurt me?

396
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,200
Why did you hurt me?

397
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,200
You want my life, I'll take you as my brother.

398
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,200
What should I do?

399
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,200
I can only live one.

400
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,200
Who are you?

401
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,200
Who is it?

402
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,200
Who is it?

403
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,200
Who is it?

404
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,200
What's wrong?

405
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,200
What's wrong?

406
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,200
You're the only one who can understand what Third Uncle said.

407
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,200
This is the special way of communication between you two.

408
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,200
Sister.

409
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,200
Sister.

410
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,600
You've made a dream again?

411
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,200
I don't know.

412
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,200
What does this mean when you knows?

413
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,200
Well...

414
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,200
Sister, what does it mean?

415
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,200
Wait till I put a word back.

416
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,920
things, and rules out Lage old man.

417
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,100
Nothing in between

418
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,600
How about a cold?

419
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:53,800
Neither colds, no Untilど

420
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,100
I don't have a door anymore to catch it

421
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,620
Quick!

422
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,600
I'm unable to sleep

423
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,340
Can't sleep, you'll pass out

424
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,340
There is a long road ahead.

425
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,340
I'm telling you, you bastard.

426
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:16,340
If it weren't for the bird that got me from above,

427
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,340
I wouldn't have followed you.

428
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:03,940
Leave.

429
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:06,940
Leave.

430
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,100
Leave.

431
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:08,860
Leave.

432
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,180
Between the flames,

433
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,140
we'll be locked.

434
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,100
Do you wanna go Vijay?

435
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:14,940
No.

436
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,340
I'm done.

437
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:28,940
Mum,

438
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:31,340
that's the flames.

439
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,340
This is the carriage of the Prince of Yinzhang.

440
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,340
It is usually used to escort the King of the Emperor

441
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,340
or to escort the troops.

442
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,340
But, Brother Xiang,

443
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,340
this kind of Prince of Pei Zang only appears in the underground palace

444
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,340
or in the Pei Zang pit.

445
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,340
How could they appear here?

446
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,340
It's a mess.

447
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,340
It's a big trick.

448
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,340
If the King of Wan Dong lives here and sees this mess,

449
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,340
his men will be killed by the superiors.

450
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,340
I don't know if you can understand

451
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,340
what they are doing here.

452
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,340
Tianzhen,

453
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,340
this is the carriage of the Prince of Pei Zang.

454
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,340
Don't touch it.

455
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,340
These things are so strange.

456
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,340
Maybe there is something wrong with it.

457
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,340
They can still survive.

458
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,340
The stone caveman.

459
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,340
These people are probably in the river for a long time.

460
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:29,340
They are not in a good mood.

461
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,340
They are also being sucked into the water

462
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,340
because of the long time.

463
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,340
What is that?

464
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,340
The general is in a bad mood.

465
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,340
He is in a bad mood.

466
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,340
I don't think so.

467
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,340
Have you seen the garbage?

468
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,340
Have you noticed that

469
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:47,340
all the people are in the same direction.

470
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,340
They are like the army of the army.

471
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,340
They are all in the direction of the King of Wan Dong.

472
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,340
They are all the substitute goods of the Huo people.

473
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,340
They are all the substitute goods of the Huo people.

474
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,340
The King of Wan Dong.

475
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,340
The King of Wan Dong.

476
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:27,340
The King of Wan Dong.

477
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,340
The King of Wan Dong.

478
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:27,340
The King of Wan Dong.
