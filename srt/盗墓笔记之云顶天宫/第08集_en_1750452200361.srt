1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm going to try to do it.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm going to try to do it.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm going to try to do it.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to try to do it.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm going to try to do it.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm going to try to do it.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm going to try to do it.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm going to try to do it.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to try to do it.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm going to try to do it.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm going to try to do it.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm going to try to do it.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm going to try to do it.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm going to try to do it.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm going to try to do it.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm going to try to do it.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm going to try to do it.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm going to try to do it.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going to try to do it.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm going to try to do it.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm going to try to do it.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm going to try to do it.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm going to try to do it.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm going to try to do it.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm going to try to do it.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm going to try to do it.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm going to try to do it.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm going to try to do it.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm going to try to do it.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm going to try to do it.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm going to try to do it.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm going to try to do it.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm going to try to do it.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm going to try to do it.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm going to try to do it.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm going to try to do it.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm going to try to do it.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm going to try to do it.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm going to try to do it.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm going to try to do it.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm going to try to do it.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
XD

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
XD

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
XD

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
XD

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
lever right over there?

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,840
I haven't look through Za ohun

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I haven't look through Za ohun

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,840
there's no way I didn't watch that.

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm afraid I can't stop you from being so weak.

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Don't worry. I can handle it.

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's time to go to Beijing.

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Here.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Thank you.

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Heaven, earth, people, ghosts.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The world is so far away, 84,000 miles.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What are you doing?

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Nothing. I'm just used to it.

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I can go anywhere and try it.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Tianzhen, don't waste food.

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm telling you, no matter where you are,

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
you can't be wronged by the fat man.

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You have to be comfortable no matter what.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Okay, you.

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You can go out and get the pork.

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Look at the weather.

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's so hot.

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's so hot.

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Tianzhen, what are you thinking?

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Nothing.

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Shunzi.

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Do you know if there are any ancient tomb nearby

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
or other strange places?

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
No way. There are still tomb.

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I've never heard of it.

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Everyone must be careful.

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
There's a high layer of snow in front.

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The layer of snow is often changed.

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Snowy goddess is very experienced.

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Why is it snowy goddess again?

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You mean we'll have

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
strange things in the future?

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Don't be so hard on Snowy goddess.

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm telling you, there are many weird things

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
happening on Snowy mountain.

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's not dead at all.

92
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Let me tell you about

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
the people who were in the cave.

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Follow me.

95
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Don't fall.

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Hang on for a while.

97
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The one in the front is the one in the cave.

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Shunzi.

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I... I don't think I know

100
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
the direction of our way in the front.

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's too big.

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Is the map for you accurate?

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I really can't walk anymore.

104
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm so sleepy here.

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Stop talking nonsense.

106
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's because of you.

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
The map is covered with snow.

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Brother, we've agreed

109
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
to stop talking about this.

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Besides, he didn't mean to do it on purpose.

111
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Really?

112
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Then how do you drive him away?

113
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Don't think I don't know.

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
A long-distance love.

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
A new system.

116
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You guys are really good.

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You'd better not forget

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
who the pig is this time.

119
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Stop arguing.

120
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We should unite now.

121
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
This is a place

122
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
that can be killed

123
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
at any time on Snowy mountain.

124
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It seems that the number of people

125
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
is decreasing.

126
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm not sure either.

127
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I think so.

128
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Let's try.

129
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes.

130
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Let's make a good mark.

131
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
We must reach the firework

132
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
before dark.

133
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
We hope that we're right.

134
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Let's go.

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,600
It's a corner.

136
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,200
It's not an lone little friend of yours.

137
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,340
I turned to the Anh enduring

138
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:15,240
while we practiced

139
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,240
Master, I want to tell you something.

140
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,240
I told you before.

141
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,240
I'm just talking.

142
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,240
I don't regret what Fatty did.

143
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
Do you understand?

144
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,240
Master.

145
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,240
Master.

146
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,240
Master.

147
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,240
Wait.

148
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,240
Why haven't you arrived yet?

149
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,240
Did you take the wrong way?

150
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,240
You really took the wrong way?

151
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
No.

152
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,240
I know where Shao Gang is.

153
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,240
Where? You know it. Hurry up.

154
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,240
No, no, no.

155
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
It's not a snowy road.

156
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,240
I didn't expect it.

157
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,240
Shao Gang is hiding.

158
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,240
He's under our feet.

159
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,240
I told you I didn't find him for a long time.

160
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
What should we do now?

161
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,240
The horse is gone.

162
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,240
We can't go back.

163
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,240
There's no place to live.

164
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,240
It's so cold.

165
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,240
Should we freeze to death?

166
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,240
I have another hope.

167
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,240
I remember there should be a hot spring nearby.

168
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,240
If we can find it,

169
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,240
we can take a few more days.

170
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,240
The hot spring is higher than here.

171
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,240
We can't find it.

172
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
If we can't find it,

173
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,240
we can only take the mountain.

174
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
I'll take the rope out.

175
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
Remember to keep one rope on your waist.

176
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,240
You have to keep one rope on your waist.

177
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,240
I'll take the rope out.

178
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
Shao Gang.

179
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,240
Shao Gang.

180
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,240
You called me?

181
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,240
Did you hear me?

182
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,240
Don't worry.

183
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,240
I can take your life

184
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,240
even in the worst situation.

185
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,240
Let's go.

186
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,240
Shun Zi.

187
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,240
What's wrong?

188
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,240
Are you dead?

189
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,240
You're in danger.

190
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,240
Don't go back.

191
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,240
What are you talking about?

192
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,240
You don't know Lu Bu Shu.

193
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,240
We haven't got on the bike yet.

194
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,240
What should we do now?

195
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,240
We only know Lu Bu Shu.

196
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,240
We can't get on the bike now.

197
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,240
We can't wait here to die.

198
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,240
Let's think of a way.

199
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,240
What do you mean?

200
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,240
I'm thinking...

201
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,240
I'm thinking my brain is frozen like a frozen rock.

202
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,240
According to Shun Zi's description,

203
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,240
this hot spring should be near us.

204
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,240
Why don't we split up and look for it?

205
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,240
We can only do that.

206
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,240
How about this?

207
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,240
Don't take the rope out of your body.

208
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,240
Go in the direction of each person.

209
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,240
If you're in a hurry, come back.

210
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,240
But don't risk your life.

211
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,240
If you find it,

212
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,240
contact the communication system.

213
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,240
Everyone check their communication system.

214
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,240
See if it's possible to use it.

215
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,240
Let's go.

216
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,240
Madam.

217
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,240
Thank you for coming to Beijing.

218
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,240
I want to see you.

219
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,240
Thank you.

220
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,240
Did you sleep well?

221
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,240
Don't forget.

222
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,240
Miss is playing with her friends.

223
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,240
She'll stay in her villa tonight.

224
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,240
Okay.

225
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,240
How about I take her to the guest room?

226
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,240
No, no, no.

227
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,240
Let her in.

228
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,240
Okay.

229
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,240
Please.

230
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,240
Madam.

231
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,240
Thank you for coming.

232
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,240
Mrs. Hua.

233
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,240
Thank you.

234
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,240
Sit down.

235
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,240
You're not in the third room.

236
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,240
You came to me in the middle of the night.

237
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,240
Is there anything else?

238
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,240
Just tell me.

239
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,240
Mrs. Hua.

240
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,240
I'm sorry to see you so late.

241
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,240
You must know my intentions.

242
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,240
Since you asked me to tell you,

243
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,240
I want to know

244
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,240
where did you get that photo?

245
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,240
It's a photo.

246
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,240
I got it when someone took it.

247
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,240
Now,

248
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,240
it's not a difficult thing to get a photo like this.

249
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,240
I don't know where you got it.

250
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,240
But it's about our family.

251
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,240
I can't believe it's just a photo

252
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,240
that's unknown.

253
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,240
I didn't expect you to have this attitude.

254
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,240
Yes, yes.

255
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,240
I saw you grow up.

256
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,240
How could I use a fake photo

257
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,240
to trick you?

258
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,240
I'm grateful

259
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,240
for your concern about my family.

260
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,240
I'll keep that photo.

261
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,240
Sure.

262
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,240
Keep it.

263
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,240
I'm done.

264
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,240
It's late.

265
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240
I won't disturb you.

266
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,240
Yes, you should go.

267
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,240
Good.

268
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,240
I'll make it clear.

269
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,240
I'll see you later.

270
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,240
No, no.

271
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,240
You can't sleep.

272
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,240
No, you can't.

273
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,240
You're weak.

274
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,240
Take a deep breath.

275
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,240
No.

276
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,240
No, no, no.

277
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,240
You can't sleep.

278
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,240
You can't get up after you sleep.

279
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,240
Who are you?

280
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,240
Who are you?

281
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,240
Who are you?

282
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,240
Who are you?

283
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,240
It's me.

284
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,240
Who is your uncle?

285
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,240
Uncle...

286
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,240
Uncle...

287
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,240
You're tired.

288
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,240
Come here.

289
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,240
Come here.

290
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,240
Come here.

291
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,240
Come here.

292
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,240
Uncle...

293
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
Uncle...

294
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,240
I can't walk.

295
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,240
Why are you...

296
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,240
I heard that

297
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,240
people in low temperature

298
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,240
are not only weak,

299
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,240
but also want to be healthy.

300
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,240
Healthy...

301
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,240
You've changed your uncle.

302
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,240
You're not my uncle.

303
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,240
I thought you were.

304
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,240
But there's no reason.

305
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,240
Why did I change my uncle

306
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,240
and wear a pair of shoes?

307
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,240
Come here.

308
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,240
Come to the village.

309
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,240
You can be warm and warm.

310
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,240
Come here.

311
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,240
Come here.

312
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,240
Come here.

313
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,240
Come here.

314
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,240
What's wrong?

315
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,240
Why are you here?

316
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,240
You are Xie...

317
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,240
Xie Lian Huan?

318
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,240
Wu San Xing asked me to kill you.

319
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,240
When are you going to return?

320
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,240
No...

321
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,240
No...

322
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,240
No...

323
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,240
No...

324
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,240
No...

325
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,240
No...

326
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,240
No...

327
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,240
No...

328
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,240
Come here.

329
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,240
Come here.

330
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,240
What's wrong?

331
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,240
Don't move.

332
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,240
Don't move.

333
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,240
Wait.

334
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,240
Stand up.

335
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,240
The blood is boiling.

336
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,240
Hold on.

337
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,240
Be careful.

338
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,240
Tianzhen, are you okay?

339
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,240
Where did you fall?

340
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,240
Wait.

341
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,240
What's on the blood?

342
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,240
What's this?

343
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,240
What's this?

344
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,240
Is it a stone or a harem?

345
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,240
It's alive.

346
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,240
Don't be so serious.

347
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,240
Can I fall here?

348
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,240
The blood is not thick enough.

349
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,240
He can blame me.

350
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,240
You can't fight.

351
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,240
Be careful.

352
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,240
Let's go.

353
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,240
This stone is a harem.

354
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,240
Why are there so many holes?

355
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,240
Is it a harem or a harem?

356
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,240
It's much harder than the harem.

357
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,240
It's broken.

358
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,240
You don't know how to talk nonsense?

359
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,240
This is a harem.

360
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,240
It's not a harem.

361
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,240
The harem was broken in the winter.

362
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,240
And in ancient China,

363
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,240
the harem was like this.

364
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,240
It has a pig's nose.

365
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,240
It's like this.

366
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,240
It's like this.

367
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,240
It's like this.

368
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,240
It's like this.

369
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,240
It has a pig's nose.

370
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,240
It looks like a harem.

371
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,240
The process of changing the harem in China

372
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,240
is actually very long.

373
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,240
At the beginning,

374
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,240
the harem was all in the shape of a Buddha.

375
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,240
It was called a harem on a snake head.

376
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,240
Each tribe has its own harem.

377
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,240
The form is also different

378
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,240
with each tribe.

379
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,240
Later, the Chinese culture spread.

380
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,240
The culture became a big fusion.

381
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,240
The Chinese harem

382
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,240
started to merge with the harem

383
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,240
with the ethnic groups.

384
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,240
In the end, it became

385
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,240
the image of our Panlong.

386
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,240
It's a bit different.

387
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,240
It seems that the winter harem

388
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,240
is quite early.

389
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,240
Brother Hua,

390
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,240
you know so well.

391
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,240
Tell us about the winter harem.

392
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,240
The winter harem is all about the business.

393
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,240
The harem?

394
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,240
The harem is on top of the harem?

395
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,240
This night,

396
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,240
the old man has the most rumors.

397
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,240
I'll let him talk to you.

398
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,240
What I'm about to say is,

399
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,240
let's find a place to rest.

400
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,240
I almost didn't brush my teeth.

401
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,240
My butt is cold.

402
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,240
What should we do with the harem?

403
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,240
What's wrong with him?

404
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,240
Miss Ning,

405
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,240
it's dark.

406
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,240
We can't leave anymore.

407
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,240
It's not that we're afraid of the pain.

408
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,240
It's too dangerous.

409
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:42,480
The

410
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,240
snow is falling.

411
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,240
It's a small thing.

412
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,240
If we fall into the snow pit,

413
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,240
we can't get up.

414
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,240
Or we can't get up.

415
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,240
If we fall into the snow pit,

416
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,240
and then fall into the snow pit,

417
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,240
our fun will be over.

418
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,240
If we disappear,

419
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,240
we'll be in a few seconds.

420
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,240
How long can we stay up?

421
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,240
If we don't,

422
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,240
we'll be in a hurry tonight.

423
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,240
But they have to rest on this day.

424
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,240
We'll have to stay up all night.

425
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,240
Okay.

426
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,240
Chenyin, rest.

427
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,240
Okay.

428
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,240
Rest!

429
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,240
Ning,

430
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,240
what is the status?

431
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,240
Sir, sorry.

432
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,240
Many mysteries

433
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,240
have occurred recently.

434
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,240
There's no good explanation.

435
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,240
I didn't get a chance to report.

436
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,240
Now I split from Wu Xie's team.

437
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,240
But I'm keeping in contact with him.

438
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,240
Jason's team will be with us in one day's time.

439
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,240
Good.

440
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,240
Very good.

441
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,240
There's no need to rush now.

442
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,240
Jason will help us to deal with Wu Sanxi.

443
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,240
Understood.

444
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,240
Come on.

445
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,240
Hurry up.

446
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,240
Clean up the snow pit.

447
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,240
I want to see it clearly.

448
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,240
Go, go, go.

449
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,240
Come on.

450
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,240
Come on.

451
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,240
Come on.

452
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,240
It's a big piece.

453
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,240
Where did it come from?

454
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,240
There's a broken mark on it.

455
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,240
I think it fell from the top.

456
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,240
There's only a stone on it.

457
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,240
The shape of the dragon is wrong.

458
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,240
It's not right.

459
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,240
This is a dragon's tail.

460
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,240
There should be another stone.

461
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,240
The stone is usually carved on the stone door.

462
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,240
Two sides are different.

463
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,240
The reason for this is that...

464
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,240
I think it's because

465
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,240
there was a snow storm or earthquake.

466
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,240
So it fell down and hit it here.

467
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,240
Nonsense.

468
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,240
What kind of stone is this?

469
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,240
It's a wooden stone.

470
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,240
Look here.

471
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,240
Don't move.

472
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,240
You pulled out the dragon's tail.

473
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,240
No.

474
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,240
This is the horse's tail that was pulled out

475
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,240
when it was covered in wood.

476
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,240
This is the one inside.

477
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,240
Really?

478
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,240
One, two, three.

479
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,240
What's wrong?

480
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,240
The dragon is broken.

481
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,240
Why can't you pull it out?

482
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,240
I think this guy is going to hang up.

483
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,240
I...

484
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,240
Shunzi.

485
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,240
Shunzi.

486
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,240
Shunzi.

487
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,240
Shunzi.

488
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,240
People are like this.

489
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,240
Why didn't you say it earlier?

490
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,240
Where's the clothes?

491
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,240
Wait a minute.

492
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,240
You said that the path is more difficult

493
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,240
in this snow mountain.

494
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,240
You don't know what to do in the future.

495
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,240
So you have to save some things.

496
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,240
Save what?

497
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,240
You have to save people in the business.

498
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,240
You're already like this.

499
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,240
Shunzi.

500
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,240
Shunzi.

501
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,240
We have to put some fire on it.

502
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,240
It's going to be warm for Shunzi.

503
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,240
Shunzi, don't sleep.

504
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,240
Don't sleep.

505
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,240
Don't sleep.

506
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,240
You can't wake up when you fall asleep.

507
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,240
There's no fire around.

508
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,240
Burn the clay.

509
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,240
Burn the clay?

510
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,240
What are you thinking?

511
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,240
There are so many equipment here.

512
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,240
If there's no clay,

513
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,240
how can we go the other way?

514
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,240
If there's no road,

515
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,240
I'm afraid the path will be more difficult to go.

516
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,240
There's no difference between the road and the road.

517
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,240
He didn't know where the tomb is.

518
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,240
Now the wind is more difficult to go.

519
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,240
He's still alive.

520
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,240
Tell me.

521
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,240
Tell me if he's a thief.

522
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,240
Langfeng, what do you mean?

523
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,240
Can we just look at him

524
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,240
and see if he's dead?

525
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,240
How can you save him?

526
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,240
What are you doing?

527
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,240
You're the one who changed the oil.

528
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,240
I'm still holding it.

529
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,240
Why are you arguing?

530
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,240
Take a look.

531
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,240
It's a deal.

532
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,240
This...

533
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,240
Don't let him die for now.

534
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,240
I have something to ask him.

535
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,240
Fatty, help me to take out the wooden wooden sticks.

536
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,240
I'll take them out later.

537
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,240
Wait.

538
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,240
Didn't you smell anything?

539
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,240
It smells like a dragon's nest.

540
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,240
Dragon's nest?

541
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,240
There's a hot spring here?

542
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,240
Is it the hot spring that Shunzi said?

543
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,240
Look, this headband is quite useful.

544
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,240
Shunzi.

545
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,240
You all go out and look for it.

546
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,240
Wait.

547
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,240
Xiaoge, thank you.

548
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,240
Someone's been here.

549
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,240
Xiaoge.

550
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,240
What do you mean?

551
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,240
Come over here.

552
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,240
I found some traces.

553
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,240
It seems that the one in front left the test room.

554
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,240
There's a lot of people here.

555
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,240
Someone came down here first.

556
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,240
Come over here.

557
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,240
It's interesting.

558
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,240
The text is very old.

559
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,240
I haven't translated it yet.

560
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,240
But look.

561
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,240
Someone must have come here first.

562
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
This is the text on the book of the Emperor of the War.

563
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,240
What kind of team will use this text?

564
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,240
June 60.

565
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,240
This is the second day that we got into this hole.

566
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,240
We may have been able to lose our minds.

567
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,240
We may have been able to lose some...

568
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,240
What's wrong, Mr. Sa?

569
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,240
It's all old.

570
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,240
What good research?

571
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,240
Let's find a way out.

572
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,240
What do you know?

573
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,240
Why?

574
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,240
I know you're fine.

575
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,240
Zhao Yuzheng.

576
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,240
It's a girl's name.

577
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,240
What did she write?

578
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,240
No need to read it.

579
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,240
I know.

580
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,240
How do you know?

581
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,240
This is their work notebook.

582
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,240
The one that records it should be this time.

583
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,240
And you need to read the poem you just wrote.

584
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,240
It's empty.

585
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,240
It's not smelly.

586
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,240
Why is the smell of the sulfur so strong?

587
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,240
It's empty under the dragon head.

588
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,240
So the dragon head is behind the dragon head?

589
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,240
Yes.

590
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,240
So the dragon head is behind the hot spring?

591
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,240
There should be another place under it.

592
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,240
The hot spring should be inside.

593
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,240
But the smell of the sulfur...

594
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,240
...is indeed coming from this place.

595
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,240
Oh, it's so hot inside.

596
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,240
It's very warm.

597
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,240
No, it's too hard to take care of.

598
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,240
Langfeng, you stay out there.

599
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,240
You can take care of anything.

600
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,240
Okay.

601
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,240
Take the other people to the equipment.

602
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,240
No need to read it.

603
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,240
What's the character?

604
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,240
There are more.

605
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,240
What's written here?

606
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,240
There are more.

607
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:47,240
Sorry for many reasons.

608
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,240
It looks like a Chinese Chinese person with a hadi.

609
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,240
But it looks a bit like a Chinese sort of a....

610
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,240
I can't even recognize it.

611
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,240
It seems like a lady Built C skateboard.

612
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,240
Oh you know what it means?

613
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,240
When I looked at it it almost rose up aAmerica

614
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,240
I needed some good smart then you asked me to think about it with that matter.

615
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:08,740
Let's cover it up.

616
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,740
We'll study it later, okay?

617
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,740
Let's go.

618
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:23,040
Sh мо

619
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,040
That's it.

620
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,040
There are thirty degrees in this place.

621
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,040
It's too hot.

622
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,040
Tianzhen,

623
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,040
that seal shouldn't be an accident, right?

624
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,040
The opening of the cave is just a piece of wood.

625
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,040
Look at all these stones.

626
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,040
They were used to build the wood.

627
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,040
They were used to build the stone.

628
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,040
The workers found this tunnel in the process of building the stone.

629
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,040
But they didn't know what to do.

630
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,040
They had to seal it with a seal.

631
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,040
I'm telling you, the smell is getting stronger.

632
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,040
It's not far from here.

633
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,040
We'll just soak the wood in the morning.

634
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,040
And make a warm bath.

635
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,040
Right?

636
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,040
This is the fire mountain.

637
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,040
Fire Mountain?

638
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,040
Yes.

639
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,040
The whole Changbai Mountain is a fire mountain.

640
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:30,040
It was in the 18th century.

641
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,040
Then it woke up.

642
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,040
When Rongyan came down,

643
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,040
we were so angry.

644
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,040
Yes.

645
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,040
When Rongyan came out,

646
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,040
we were so happy.

647
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,040
What are you doing?

648
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,040
What are you doing?

649
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,040
What are you doing?

650
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,040
Can you stop saying the whole thing?

651
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,040
No.

652
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,040
You two are so impulsive.

653
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,040
You are so impulsive.

654
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,040
It's so narrow in here.

655
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:10,040
I think we can't get in.

656
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,040
Master Si,

657
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,040
why don't you help us take a picture here?

658
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,040
We'll go in and talk to you.

659
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,040
They'll tell you when they come back.

660
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,040
Little brat,

661
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,040
you come here.

662
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,040
You're afraid that Master Si will lose his face, right?

663
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,040
But now,

664
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:32,040
it's not easy to get in with my age and physical strength.

665
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,040
I'm afraid that I'll lose my face.

666
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,040
I'm afraid that I'll lose my face.

667
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,040
It's not easy to get in with physical strength.

668
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,040
Then you two go in and see

669
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,040
what's inside.

670
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,040
No,

671
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,040
Master Si is here alone.

672
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,040
I'm worried.

673
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,040
I'll go with him.

674
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,040
You two go.

675
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,040
Fatty,

676
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,040
come.

677
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,040
Go.

678
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,040
Go.

679
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,040
The shadow of the past year

680
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,040
is reflected in the empty sky.

681
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,040
The silent spring breeze.

682
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,040
Following the clouds, following the wind,

683
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,040
the road is light, the weather is sunny,

684
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,040
how can I get up?

685
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,040
Passing through the night,

686
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,040
passing through the fog,

687
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,040
you are in the darkness,

688
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,040
you have the answer.

689
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,040
The time is passing,

690
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,040
the wind is blowing,

691
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,040
the flowers are blooming,

692
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,040
the branches are falling,

693
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,040
the wind is blowing,

694
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,040
the rain is falling,

695
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,040
the wind is blowing,

696
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,040
the road is light,

697
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,040
the weather is sunny,

698
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,040
how can I get up?

699
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,040
Passing through the night,

700
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,040
passing through the fog,

701
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,040
you are in the darkness,

702
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,040
you have the answer.

703
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,040
The time is passing,

704
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,040
the wind is blowing,

705
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,040
the flowers are blooming,

706
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,040
the branches are falling,

707
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:11,040
the wind is blowing,
