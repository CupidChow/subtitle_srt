1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not sure if we can get the key.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not sure if I can get it.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I am not sure if I can get the key.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The key is still stored.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm worried that the key may be a key issue.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I didn't expect to notice this.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
How about anywhere between here and there.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Uncle San.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Don't look into my business.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'll save you.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Uncle San.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
After you leave,

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm not your uncle.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Otherwise, you'll die like this.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Okay.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Go to hell.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Uncle San.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Uncle San.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
After sending our Seni Scientistsней to discuss the secretach,

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,260
Wu Cl сообщ ed new a working Cartel

35
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,000
found out that...

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
he's higher than any other Chinese literature.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
On Guizhou览物村 Zhang Jun Fah Mu,

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
he hasn't stopped the jamaisite cartel

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
for reaching out to the expertise.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,300
However, Uncle San dead

41
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,500
blackmailed Wu Hive.

42
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,300
Nicknamed Wu Hive,

43
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,000
team search for someone saved him.

44
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,000
After visiting the branch,

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Wu Hive must go again

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,500
find out the truth

47
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,060
your

48
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,040
we have

49
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,700
never had a ح tief

50
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,220
Clouds like that

51
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,420
Why we can't let this happen

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,840
Even if It is hard to achieve,

53
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,240
there are two lines that matter.

54
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,320
It is the end,

55
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,960
both you and you.

56
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,480
Thank you.

57
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,180
Uncle San, uncle San, save me, save me.

58
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,160
Isn't that enough for your friends?

59
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,340
They will die if you don't do that.

60
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,760
Life and telling the truth are more important to you.

61
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,940
Uncle San, with all of my people,

62
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,280
so many people's lives will be rolled into pieces.

63
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,220
You can't just leave like that.

64
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,920
I want to leave, but what?

65
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:07,960
Can anyone stopped me?

66
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,960
I'm warning you,

67
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,960
stop it.

68
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,960
Don't put yourself in there.

69
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,960
It's not worth it.

70
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,960
Uncle San, it's not worth it.

71
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,960
Uncle San, Uncle San!

72
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,960
What's not worth it?

73
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,960
What's worth in your eyes?

74
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,960
Uncle San!

75
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,960
Doctor!

76
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,960
Doctor!

77
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,960
He has restored his reaction and ability to the outside world.

78
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,960
Once the situation is stable,

79
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,960
we can start to treat him more actively.

80
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,960
Thank you for your help.

81
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,960
It's been two months.

82
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,960
You're welcome.

83
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,960
Episode 1

84
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,960
How was it?

85
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,960
Two months.

86
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,960
Tianzhen finally reacted today.

87
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,960
No one would have thought that

88
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,960
Uncle San could do such a thing.

89
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,960
After all, you were all in the wood.

90
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,960
Xiao Xiao,

91
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,960
stop talking.

92
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,960
We haven't investigated the situation yet.

93
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,960
It's possible that it's a misunderstanding.

94
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,960
It's impossible that it's a misunderstanding.

95
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,960
Episode 1

96
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,960
Episode 2

97
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Episode 3

98
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,960
I want to know your secret.

99
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,960
I'm going to this place.

100
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,960
Episode 4

101
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,960
Episode 5

102
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,960
What are you doing?

103
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,960
What is this place?

104
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,960
Yours.

105
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,960
The same fish.

106
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,960
Who are you?

107
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Who gave you this?

108
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,960
Are you going to the hospital to find me?

109
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,960
Episode 6

110
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,960
I found this when I was in the fight.

111
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,960
You found Uncle San again?

112
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,960
He's awake.

113
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,960
Wu Xie.

114
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,960
How is he?

115
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,960
Wait.

116
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,960
I'll call a doctor for you.

117
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,960
No need.

118
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,960
I'm fine.

119
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,960
If you need anything,

120
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
call the doctor.

121
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
Wait.

122
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,960
I said no need.

123
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,960
Why don't you tell us?

124
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,960
I'm busy with my own business.

125
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,960
What's your business?

126
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,960
Aren't we friends?

127
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,960
We're friends.

128
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,960
It's okay.

129
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,960
I'm going to the hospital today.

130
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,960
You can do your own business.

131
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,960
No, that's not good.

132
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,960
You haven't recovered yet.

133
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,960
How can you go to the hospital?

134
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,960
No, Tian Zhen.

135
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,960
I know you're anxious to find Uncle San.

136
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,960
But we can help you.

137
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,960
What do you know?

138
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,960
I've stayed in the hospital alone for a long time.

139
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,960
I just want to go home.

140
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,960
You...

141
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,960
You should go back to your place.

142
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,960
Go back.

143
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,960
No, Tian Zhen.

144
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,960
You don't have to do this.

145
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,960
Wu Xie.

146
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,960
Since the beginning of Guizhou,

147
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,960
Fatty has been looking at you here.

148
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,960
You haven't been home yet.

149
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,960
You're so much like her.

150
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,960
Isn't that right?

151
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,960
We can understand your feelings.

152
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,960
But you're a man.

153
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,960
Wu San Xing is your uncle.

154
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
He's a famous person.

155
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,960
He doesn't care about our lives.

156
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,960
He's throwing us in the woods

157
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,960
to work with the American cultural relics.

158
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,960
No matter what the reason is,

159
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,960
he has his own problems.

160
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
You're my friends.

161
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,960
But you're not me.

162
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,960
Maybe my uncle is a bad guy.

163
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,960
He's also my uncle.

164
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,960
No matter what,

165
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,960
I can't let go of him.

166
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,960
Let's see how he goes on.

167
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,960
I owe you a lot.

168
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,960
I don't want to owe you more.

169
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,960
I'm okay alone.

170
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,960
I'm sorry.

171
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,960
I want to know your uncle's secret.

172
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,960
I'll go to this address.

173
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
Wu San Xing!

174
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,960
Open the door!

175
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,960
Wu San Xing!

176
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,960
What do you mean?

177
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,960
Wu San Xing!

178
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
Open the door!

179
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,960
Uncle San Xing.

180
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,960
Did you see it?

181
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,960
What did you see?

182
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,960
Is it this?

183
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,960
Or this?

184
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,960
Uncle San Xing.

185
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,960
You...

186
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,960
Uncle.

187
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,960
You...

188
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,960
How did you know?

189
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
Wu San Xing...

190
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,960
killed me.

191
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,960
I'm sorry.

192
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,960
Anyone here?

193
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,960
Yes.

194
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,960
Why are you here?

195
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,960
Uncle Hai?

196
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,960
I'm Qi Ling Xie.

197
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,960
I have the most valuable thing.

198
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,960
Can you do it?

199
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,960
I'm not polite.

200
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,960
If you need anything,

201
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,960
just ask me.

202
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,960
Where's my uncle?

203
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,960
I really don't know.

204
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
Uncle Hai.

205
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,960
The newspaper's official name is Guangxi.

206
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,960
Jing Er Palace is in Guangxi.

207
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,960
There's no other information

208
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,960
in the whole country.

209
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,960
And I can't find the exact location

210
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,960
on the map.

211
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,960
But Uncle Hai,

212
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,960
you must know where it is.

213
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,960
Jing Er Palace

214
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,960
is a common saying in your city.

215
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,960
According to the North,

216
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,960
it's called Yin Yang Su.

217
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,960
It's like this house.

218
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,960
Under this house,

219
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,960
there's a very similar house.

220
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,960
If you dig it out,

221
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,960
you'll find

222
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,960
they're completely opposite.

223
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,960
Uncle.

224
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,960
Uncle.

225
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,960
Uncle Hai,

226
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,960
what does this stone tower

227
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,960
have to do with me?

228
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,960
This stone tower

229
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,960
is Jing Er Palace.

230
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,960
Jing Er Palace

231
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,960
found a snake-meat-tong-yu.

232
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,960
You tell me,

233
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,960
what does it have to do with him?

234
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,960
As long as I go there,

235
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,960
I can find that thing

236
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,960
and I can see my uncle.

237
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,960
Right?

238
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,960
Go.

239
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,960
Go, Mr. Honore over.

240
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,960
Hurry.

241
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,960
Uncle.

242
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,960
How could you do this to Xie Lian Huan?

243
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,960
You...

244
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,960
Come.

245
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
So fast.

246
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,960
You still have to wait for your uncle, right?

247
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,960
Uncle, you're not a fool.

248
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,960
Let's go.

249
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,960
I'll take you to eat fried liver.

250
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,960
You're so funny.

251
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,960
Uncle.

252
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
I'll always believe you.

253
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,960
Mr. Honore.

254
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,960
The body is new to the toxin

255
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,960
in the Asian tomb.

256
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,960
It must contain some special substance

257
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,960
which alters the telomere

258
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,960
in the DNA

259
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,960
to prolong the deterioration.

260
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
And this is the exact formula

261
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,960
that's injected in Wuxi, right?

262
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
Yes.

263
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,960
With higher concentration.

264
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,960
Now, everybody out.

265
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,960
Finally.

266
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,960
Finally.

267
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,960
Nice.

268
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,960
Any progress on the research?

269
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,960
So far nothing.

270
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,960
The coarse has started to deteriorage.

271
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,960
This is taking too long.

272
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,960
You are totally waste of space.

273
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,240
I know, my apologies.

274
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,680
I take the book of the responsibility.

275
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,520
On the other hand, be intentional or not.

276
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,840
Wu Sanxin filed to warm us in advance.

277
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,560
He's losing our trust.

278
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,680
Wu Sanxin did it, he was asked.

279
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,720
So you should worry about your next move.

280
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,280
The company will not tolerate any more missteps on your part.

281
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,280
Okay.

282
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,080
Sir, why didn't you share our experiment results?

283
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,280
Why should I share my research on immortality with others?

284
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,560
What happened?

285
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,760
What's going on?

286
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,080
Uncle Sanxin, why didn't you save me?

287
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,080
Uncle Sanxin, save me.

288
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,080
Uncle Sanxin, uncle Sanxin.

289
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,080
Uncle Sanxin.

290
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,080
Uncle Sanxin.

291
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,080
Uncle Sanxin.

292
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,080
How did you become like this?

293
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,080
How did you become like this?

294
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,080
You disappointed me.

295
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:16,080
Uncle Sanxin, what's the truth?

296
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,080
What's the truth?

297
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,080
What's the truth?

298
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,080
What's the truth?

299
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,080
What's the truth?

300
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,080
Hello.

301
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,080
Mr. Wu, today is your day of reporting the progress.

302
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,080
I'm not in the progress yet.

303
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,080
You're not in the progress of the exam either.

304
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,080
I think we should consider another batch of people.

305
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,080
Don't compare me with that useless person.

306
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,080
He's useless.

307
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,080
You need to prove that you're not.

308
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,080
I hope you can think about it.

309
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,080
How much money you've earned from me these years.

310
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,080
Let me ask you.

311
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,080
Why did you look for me?

312
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,080
Why did you look for me?

313
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,080
Because of the professional?

314
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,080
Right.

315
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,080
You're not me, you're not good.

316
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,080
I'm not you.

317
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,080
I'm just a good person.

318
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,080
Understand?

319
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,080
Then tell me.

320
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,080
Why did you keep delaying us to the progress of Yun Jin Palace?

321
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,080
Is it because of your precious nephew?

322
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,080
Don't be so angry, okay?

323
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,080
I can let him die once.

324
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,080
I can also let him die once again.

325
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,080
Please trust me.

326
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,080
I'll make sure he appears in Yun Jin Palace.

327
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,080
I promise.

328
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,080
Wang Jiaming.

329
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,080
You're chasing after my bones.

330
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,080
You're so lazy.

331
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,080
I'll do it.

332
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,080
What's wrong with you?

333
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,080
I'll do it.

334
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,080
I'll do it.

335
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,080
I'll do it.

336
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,080
I'll do it.

337
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,080
I'll do it.

338
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,080
I'll do it.

339
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,080
Master Huo, I'll do it.

340
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,080
I didn't do anything.

341
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,080
I'm just a coward.

342
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,080
Please forgive me.

343
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,080
Who sent you here?

344
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,080
Tell me.

345
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,080
No one sent me here.

346
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,080
I heard there's a late lord in there.

347
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,080
We must go down and see.

348
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,080
Either tell the truth or

349
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,080
leave the stolen things.

350
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,080
Master Huo,

351
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,080
they asked me to do it.

352
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,080
But I don't know what they're doing.

353
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,080
We have a meeting to contact.

354
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,080
I'll leave them to the underground.

355
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,080
I'll give you all the information.

356
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,080
What did he ask you to steal?

357
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,080
Snake.

358
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,080
Snake didn't steal the fish.

359
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,080
Master Huo.

360
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,080
What's the relationship between you and my uncle?

361
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,080
You want to know the secret behind Wu San Xing?

362
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,080
Don't chase him all day.

363
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,080
Find an unknowing answer.

364
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,080
You can look for it yourself.

365
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,080
I'll do it.

366
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,080
I'll do it.

367
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,080
I'll do it.

368
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,080
I'll do it.

369
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,080
I'll do it.

370
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,080
I'll do it.

371
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,080
I'll do it.

372
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,080
I'll do it.

373
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,080
I'll do it.

374
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,080
I'll do it.

375
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,080
I'll do it.

376
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,080
I'll do it.

377
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,080
Kid,

378
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,080
if you really want to know the secret behind Wu San Xing,

379
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,080
you must go to the underground.

380
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,080
I'll do it.

381
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,080
I'll do it.

382
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,080
I'll do it.

383
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,080
I'll do it.

384
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,080
I'll do it.

385
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,080
I'll do it.

386
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,080
Get up.

387
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,080
Hurry up.

388
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,080
What are you doing?

389
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,080
Hurry up.

390
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,080
I got him.

391
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,080
No, no, no.

392
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,080
Wait.

393
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,080
Get me a fire!

394
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,080
Fire!

395
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,080
Wait.

396
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,080
You stay still.

397
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,080
It's burning.

398
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,080
Burn it.

399
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,080
Hurry up.

400
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,080
Burn it.

401
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,080
Burn it.

402
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,080
Fire.

403
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,080
He's here.

404
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,080
How can I save you?

405
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,080
Don't follow me.

406
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,080
Tian Tian,

407
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,080
wait for me.

408
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,080
Tian Tian,

409
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,080
I came on the way

410
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,080
and saw a car.

411
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,080
It was full of food and drinks.

412
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,080
I thought it was a gang.

413
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,080
If we were hiding in the woods like before,

414
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,080
it would be a bad thing.

415
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,080
And,

416
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:09,080
I picked up a GPS on the way.

417
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,080
If the ghost hits the wall and loses it,

418
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,080
it won't know how to die.

419
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,080
That's not a problem for a bad ghost.

420
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,080
Thank you.

421
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,080
I've never told you.

422
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,080
Don't bother me.

423
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,080
I told you.

424
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,080
I don't care about you.

425
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,080
You don't care about me.

426
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,080
Do you know

427
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,080
you're such a...

428
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,080
mortal?

429
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,080
You know you're a very hurt person.

430
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,080
I was also a person before you.

431
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,080
I didn't want to be a man.

432
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,080
But I told you,

433
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,080
after you got married,

434
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,080
you took the red book,

435
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,080
and we signed it.

436
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,080
Stop.

437
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,080
Don't joke with me.

438
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,080
I'm not interested.

439
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,080
Let's have a normal conversation.

440
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,080
We've had so much fun.

441
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,080
We're friends now.

442
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,080
We have to keep going forward.

443
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,080
Don't talk to me.

444
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,080
I really don't want to talk.

445
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,080
No, you...

446
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,080
Tian Tian,

447
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,080
there's something to eat.

448
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,080
It's him.

449
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,080
The things in the front.

450
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,080
Yes.

451
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,080
Don't you have to sit down?

452
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,080
This is not a bet.

453
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,080
You don't have to sit down.

454
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,080
I'm not going to eat.

455
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,080
I'm not going to eat.

456
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,080
I'm not going to eat.

457
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,080
I'm not going to eat.

458
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,080
I'm not going to eat.

459
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,080
I'm not going to eat.

460
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,080
I'm not going to eat.

461
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,080
I'm not going to eat.

462
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,080
I'm not going to eat.

463
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,080
I'm not going to eat.

464
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,080
I'm not going to eat.

465
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,080
I'm not going to eat.

466
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,080
I'm not going to eat.

467
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,080
I'm not going to eat.

468
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,080
I'm not going to eat.

469
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,080
I'm not going to eat.

470
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,080
What's up?

471
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,080
You're having a dream again.

472
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,080
You're still not used to

473
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,080
being a part of my life.

474
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,080
But you can't get over this, right?

475
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,080
Don't know where to cut a piece of paper,

476
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,080
and then you'll run to Guangxi alone.

477
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,080
You're not afraid of being caught by others?

478
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,080
I know it's a trap.

479
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,080
But I don't know who did it.

480
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,480
I guess...

481
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,880
...Bazhang is the one who can be caught.

482
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,680
You know he's the one who's going to jump in.

483
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,680
You're too easy to trust others.

484
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,880
I don't trust the one who can be caught.

485
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,080
But I do.

486
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,680
As long as I see the thing that's related to the snake and the snake,

487
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,480
I can definitely see my uncle.

488
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,280
And I'm always on the line in the secret room.

489
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,080
I'd rather come here and hide.

490
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,480
Tianzhen!

491
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,680
You liar!

492
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,880
You abandoned me for a reason!

493
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,280
Wait!

494
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,880
Sir, sending someone at this sensitive time.

495
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,280
Alpha is obviously spying on us.

496
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,480
Nen.

497
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,480
He's nothing but a pounce and ear because of their insecurity.

498
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,480
Instead of treating him as a spy,

499
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,480
we'd rather treat him as a friend.

500
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,480
He might even be of use for us.

501
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,480
Please make him feel at home.

502
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,480
Sir, they've already arrived.

503
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,480
I'm sorry.

504
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,480
I'm sorry.

505
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,480
I'm sorry.

506
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,480
I'm sorry.

507
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,480
I'm sorry.

508
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,480
I'm sorry.

509
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,480
I'm sorry.

510
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,480
I'm sorry.

511
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,480
I'm sorry.

512
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,480
I'm sorry.

513
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,480
I'm sorry.

514
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,480
I'm sorry.

515
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,480
I'm sorry.

516
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,480
I'm sorry.

517
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,480
I'm sorry.

518
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,480
Sir!

519
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,480
You're doing it.

520
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,480
I told you we'd come together.

521
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,480
What's wrong with you?

522
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,480
You're so good at studying.

523
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,480
We can stand on the ground now.

524
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,480
Didn't we climb here before?

525
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,480
The stone tower is under you.

526
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,480
You're standing on the rock now.

527
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,480
You know that.

528
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,480
The stone tower on the ground is broken.

529
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,480
The stone tower is too heavy to hold it together.

530
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,480
The rock and the mountain are formed by the back of the stone.

531
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,480
That's the position you're standing on.

532
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,480
It's like a three-story house.

533
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,480
What's wrong?

534
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,480
Why are you so complicated?

535
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,480
You're so messy.

536
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,480
You don't even know where to go.

537
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,480
Why is it so deep?

538
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,480
I'll tell you if I can remember.

539
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,480
There are most of the local temple襟 crypts outside China.

540
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:53,400
The temple top-down tower symbolizes the capital

541
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,080
So you mean, according to your memory,

542
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:00,400
we can make a route that goes without him?

543
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,520
Yes.

544
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,400
You're not sick at all.

545
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,000
Fatty.

546
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,120
Don't push me back.

547
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,600
I'm your uncle.

548
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,800
I'll go back.

549
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,200
Floating pond?

550
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,320
If the Jimmie Ta치

551
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,240
sees the piece of mud around,

552
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,680
she will get challenged here.

553
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,500
See that?

554
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,980
It's軟 and it is scared to death to the brim.

555
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,220
立功

556
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,720
输

557
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,360
於這坑

558
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,360
If you just leave it alone...

559
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,240
You're enlarged again.

560
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,840
I suggest you think about something else.

561
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,800
I've decided.

562
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,080
I understand...

563
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,560
I have no choice.

564
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,320
Let's fight again.

565
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,920
What else is there?

566
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,440
Notaret,

567
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,600
do you have your Water King?

568
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,320
Count Lama's chest?

569
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,760
I still have a lot of annoying things.

570
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,760
That's right.

571
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,760
The original Eight-Sixth-Sixth-Sixth-Sixth-Sixth is the Snake-Face-Face-Face.

572
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,760
China's Great Wubo is everywhere.

573
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,760
In the vast sea.

574
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,760
All the places that are the Snake-Face-Face-Face are limited to the Cloud Sky Palace.

575
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,760
I don't know what's the connection between the Stone Tower and the Cloud Sky Palace.

576
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:53,760
Seven Star Palace, West Desert Ocean, Guizhou, Miyu Village, and here, eight-stores can't fight.

577
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,760
What rule does he have?

578
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,760
Why is he doing this?

579
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,760
Maybe the secret of the Cloud Sky Palace is not as simple as we thought.

580
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,760
Of course not.

581
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,760
It's impossible that it's the Great Africa's first.

582
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,760
He's doing it to make the Stone Tower and the Stone Tower.

583
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,760
By the way, look. Here's the secret.

584
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,760
Why is the place so neat?

585
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,760
It's so neat to die here.

586
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,760
Fatty, these corpses were moved by people after death.

587
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,760
Who moved them?

588
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,760
The stone statue was taken down.

589
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,760
Come on.

590
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,760
It's okay.

591
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,900
Stop!

592
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,160
Let me see your excited desire!

593
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,280
Theicularly killing parts of the most elderly people

594
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,080
What item?

595
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,800
How is it here?

596
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,840
I'm not sure if this is the item that actually came from..."

597
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,860
Master!

598
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,080
This is the Ji Chong Cat!

599
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:11,320
It is the end of Ni�� Island,

600
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,480
Unfortunately, it wasn't filled with tea before.

601
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,680
We'd better be careful.

602
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,480
What if something is not on it?

603
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,680
But look at her eyes.

604
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,680
What's so strong?

605
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,680
She's going to break my eyes.

606
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,680
This is the old Ba Chongbao Han's treasure box.

607
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,080
What's this?

608
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,120
Golden Necklace,

609
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,480
Big Thread Embroidery,

610
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,880
Red Glacier,

611
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,080
Crayon-Crayon,

612
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,280
Tiger's Eye,

613
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,480
White Shark's Tail,

614
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,480
and the last one is...

615
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,680
Snake's Body.

616
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,680
Get up.

617
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,680
The Ba Chongbao Han is all here.

618
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,680
Let's go to the bottom, okay?

619
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,480
Where did the heavy-weight machine gun go?

620
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,880
What are you looking for?

621
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,080
Isn't this on?

622
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,080
It's here.

623
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,080
