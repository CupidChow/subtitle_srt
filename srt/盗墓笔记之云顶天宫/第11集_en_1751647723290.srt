00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 16

2
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We just received the news.

3
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We have a batch of goods that have been robbed.

4
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The route that we're taking is the one that Jetson gave us.

5
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Is there something wrong with the route?

6
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
No.

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It seems that the Jetson's men are searching for the goods.

8
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What did Sir say?

9
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
This is so hard.

10
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What happened?

11
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What do you think will happen?

12
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
There's something wrong with the route.

13
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We're partners now.

14
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Don't hide anything from me.

15
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We can solve it together.

16
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Of course, we're partners.

17
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
If something goes wrong with the route,

18
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
you have a way to find out.

19
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Don't worry. It's okay.

20
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Sir, here.

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Boss Jetson, we have to hurry up.

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's getting dark.

23
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's hard to walk on the dark road.

24
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We can't even camp here.

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We have to find a flat place overnight.

26
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Besides, there might be a storm tonight.

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Sir, look.

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The treasure is right under our feet.

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But I can't go down.

30
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Wait a minute.

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You guys go down first.

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
See what's down there.

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Then make a plan.

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
No.

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's been snowing for thousands of years.

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The snow will turn into ice after a long time.

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
There are ice layers formed by ice and soil.

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The ice layer is like mixed soil.

39
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Our shovels can't go in.

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Do you think the grave will be down there?

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I think it's possible.

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But we can't go down the Luoyang shovel.

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Even if there's something down there, we can't find it.

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
No.

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The snow is too heavy.

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
We don't have explosives.

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I have a few friends who have been in the Daxingan Forest.

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
They regularly go up the snow mountain to clear the snow.

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
As long as one of the bubbles can blow all the snow,

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
it's very easy.

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
They seem to have used the firecrackers to blow it up.

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
As long as we clear the snow,

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
it will be clear below.

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It will be convenient to find something else.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Guys.

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
We really have explosives.

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes.

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Then take it out.

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Explosives?

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Look back.

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Behind.

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
This place.

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You put the firecrackers.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Fatty, give me a snow bag.

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
We'll buy it all.

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Suicide?

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Changbai Mountain is a tourist attraction.

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
They also go up the snow regularly.

69
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't think it's a big problem.

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
If we don't clear the snow,

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
we can go back early.

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's a big deal to dig up the stuff in the snow on the snow mountain.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The Tibetan snow mountain is looking for the mountaineering team who fell into the disaster.

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He did the same.

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
He has no other good way.

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You know what?

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
If we don't clear the snow after the master's calculation,

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
the hole can't be made.

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So as I said, we have to be careful.

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
No.

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I disagree.

82
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The risk of the cat is too high.

83
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
If I were to say,

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'd rather spend more time using the shovel to shovel.

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
No.

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
When will it be shoveled?

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You two don't have to think about it.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
We are professional people.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Lao Fang, shine.

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I think Fatty's idea is good.

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Actually, before I came here,

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I had already thought of a similar situation.

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So I was prepared.

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I tell you,

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
with my professional level,

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I can control the power of the explosive.

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And I guarantee that the sound will not be too loud.

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Actually, sometimes,

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
there is a very small vibration under the ice.

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Then we can achieve the goal.

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Lao Feng,

102
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
you are like putting a bomb in tofu.

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If you want to blow up a hole in tofu,

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
it's not visible on the surface.

105
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
This is a surprise.

106
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
When I was a miner,

107
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I put more than 10,000 bombs in it.

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I think this is not difficult for me.

109
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Wu Xie, I tell you,

110
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
you can't see it.

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Although our Lao Feng is usually quiet,

112
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
he started to put the bombs

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
when he was 14 years old.

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
He put it for 20 years.

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
In 20 years,

116
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
he blew up 10,000 mountains.

117
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Then this craft was helped by our old man.

118
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
He has led our industry for only one year.

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
In just one year,

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
he won the title of cannon god.

121
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Cannon god is you.

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Long live the great name.

123
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
No, no, no.

124
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What cannon god?

125
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's just a nickname given by the people in the industry.

126
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Fatty, do you know where the cannon god is?

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I don't know.

128
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Naive.

129
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's really going to explode.

130
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Little architect,

131
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
what kind of explosive does he use?

132
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Is it okay?

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The kind of explosive he uses

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
is specifically used to drill holes

135
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
to destroy the wall of the wall.

136
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The power is equivalent to a dozen cannons.

137
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And he re-adjusted the explosives inside.

138
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The power should be smaller than before.

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I heard that some old provinces

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
can use this kind of special mine

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
to blow up a hole

142
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
that can only be passed through by people on any wall.

143
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I don't think there's any problem.

144
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Boss, you can't blow it up.

145
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's going to explode.

146
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Go away.

147
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's really going to explode.

148
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Boss, you can't.

149
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You...

150
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Come back.

151
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Why are you hitting him?

152
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's really bad to follow us.

153
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
How do we deal with this guy?

154
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You don't have to worry about it.

155
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You do your own thing.

156
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He can still be used when he goes back.

157
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
If you can't, bring him to the cemetery.

158
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
When he comes out, give him more money.

159
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's okay to make a lot of adjustments.

160
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's very good to have a good sense of control.

161
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Just that he's not dead if he's dizzy.

162
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Don't worry.

163
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You...

164
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Everyone, back up.

165
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Go after that rock.

166
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Let's go.

167
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Lao Fang, come on.

168
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Let's go.

169
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's over.

170
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's over.

171
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
There's no sound at all.

172
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's really powerful.

173
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's amazing.

174
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Wait a minute.

175
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Wait a minute.

176
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Wait a minute.

177
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Don't panic.

178
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Don't talk.

179
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Don't panic.

180
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The blood is very thin.

181
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Even if there's a blood clot,

182
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
it's a small area of the body.

183
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Don't worry.

184
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
As long as you don't get hit by the blood,

185
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
you'll be fine.

186
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Try not to talk.

187
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Impossible.

188
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I've already calculated the amount.

189
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm sorry.

190
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Fatty, be careful.

192
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm sorry.

193
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I...

194
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Tianzhen!

195
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Tianzhen!

196
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
The blood is coming.

197
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Everyone, back up.

198
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Hurry.

199
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Hurry.

200
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Hurry.

201
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Hurry.

202
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Hurry.

203
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Back up.

204
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Hurry.

205
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Hurry.

206
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Hurry.

207
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Hurry.

208
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Hurry.

209
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Hurry.

210
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Hurry.

211
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Hurry.

212
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Xue Feng, come in.

213
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Hurry.

214
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
There's a blood flow.

215
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Hurry.

216
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You...

217
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You...

218
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Are you okay?

219
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'm fine.

220
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I...

221
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm fine.

222
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm fine.

223
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Stop talking.

224
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Take a rest.

225
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Let me tell you.

226
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
We're really lucky.

227
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's just a small area of the body.

228
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Blood is coming.

229
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Otherwise, we'll have to play it safe.

230
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Oh my god.

231
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Look at him.

232
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Let me tell you.

233
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You're lucky too.

234
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You don't know anything.

235
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You'll get over it later.

236
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Someone will carry you.

237
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Let me tell you.

238
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Go down the mountain and buy lottery tickets.

239
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Do you hear me?

240
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You little bastard.

241
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Keep your voice down.

242
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You want to kill us all.

243
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Why are we missing someone?

244
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You're here.

245
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Who are you missing?

246
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
No.

247
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Pan Zi.

248
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Pan Zi.

249
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Oh my god.

250
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
He won't...

251
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
He won't be knocked down by a snowstorm, will he?

252
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Impossible.

253
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Impossible.

254
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Pan Zi is in such good shape.

255
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
He must...

256
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
He's gone.

257
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
He won't.

258
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
What?

259
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
After you're safe, Pan Zi has left too.

260
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Why?

261
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Why don't you call him?

262
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Why should I call him?

263
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Why should I be lazy?

264
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I have no reason to be lazy.

265
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
He's been here all the way.

266
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Why did he leave when he was in the right place?

267
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Maybe he wants to send a message to Third Uncle.

268
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
After the disaster, it's a river of hope.

269
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It feels like this area has been refurbished.

270
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Tianzhen.

271
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Look at this.

272
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It's a river of hope.

273
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It's a river of hope.

274
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's a river of hope.

275
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's a river of hope.

276
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's a river of hope.

277
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Look at the sun shining on the snow mountain.

278
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Does it look like it's going to light up the snow mountain?

279
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Fatty.

280
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Do you think the scenery we're seeing right now is very familiar?

281
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
No.

282
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
What's wrong?

283
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Little guy.

284
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Fatty, do you remember?

285
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
We've seen a painting.

286
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
The scenery inside is exactly like this.

287
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
The painting of the bottom of the sea.

288
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yes, yes, yes.

289
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Little guy, you should remember too.

290
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Brother, what are you talking about?

291
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What painting of the bottom of the sea?

292
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Tell us about it.

293
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Long story short,

294
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
we went down an island before and there was a painting there.

295
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
The picture above and the scenery we're seeing now are almost the same.

296
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The only difference is that the red in the picture is flame.

297
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I was still wondering what could light up the whole mountain.

298
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
But now I know that the red in the picture is the remains of the sunset.

299
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You're getting more and more like it.

300
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Really.

301
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
The remains of the sunset are in the sky above the clouds.

302
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You're right.

303
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
The treasure is indeed right under our feet.

304
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
But we have to think of other ways to get in.

305
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
No, Tianzhen.

306
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I think we should think about our safety first.

307
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Let's go back and get ready to come back.

308
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
We've traveled a long way and finally got here.

309
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
If we get back to the mansion now, we'll be in trouble.

310
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
We just have to think of other ways to get in.

311
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
But seeing the snowy mountains...

312
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
One more time.

313
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Another time?

314
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Grandpa Si, are you sure?

315
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
This time, you have to adjust the amount of the explosive.

316
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
If there's any more mistakes, don't go back.

317
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
The amount of the explosive I used last time was indeed a bit too much.

318
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
This time, I've already reduced the amount.

319
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And I've increased the number.

320
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I've put six pipes in this slope.

321
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Six pipes of about one meter.

322
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I think we can open a hole of less than four meters.

323
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Everyone, lean against the wall.

324
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Fix your position.

325
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Grandpa Si.

326
00:22:32,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Oh my god.

327
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Oh my god.

328
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
This must be five or six meters thick.

329
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
What's in here?

330
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
A few tens of thousands of years ago, the location of Mount Changbai was still a mess.

331
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It's because the bottom of the bamboo fire mountain erupted in the sea.

332
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
There's something so big under it.

333
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Could it be the remains of the old marine house?

334
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
That's not right.

335
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
The mountain was already there before the ice mountain formed.

336
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
If it was an animal, it would have turned into a fossil.

337
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Could it be a Kunlun fetus?

338
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
What is a Kunlun fetus?

339
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
He Sha.

340
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Kunlun fetus is a kind of natural-born creature.

341
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It's located at the source of the Dragon Pulse.

342
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It's where the spiritual energy of the Heaven and Earth is located.

343
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Usually, it's in rock, ice, and trees.

344
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It forms something like a baby.

345
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
This thing is called a geological fetus.

346
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
But in reality, it has no body and is still waiting for a test.

347
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Sounds pretty strange.

348
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
But this fetus doesn't look like a human, right?

349
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Kunlun fetus is a natural-born fetus.

350
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
It's a natural-born fetus.

351
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Isn't Sun Wukong a human too?

352
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
If you put it that way,

353
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
if this is a Kunlun fetus, then the spirit must be below it.

354
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Let's not talk about it. Let's go.

355
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
No.

356
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
If this is a natural-born treasure, Kunlun fetus,

357
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
how could it be just a burial ground?

358
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
How good is the wind and snow of the San Sheng Mountain located in the sky?

359
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It can't be worse than Kunlun fetus, right?

360
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
No, no. I don't think we should think that way.

361
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
If this Kunlun fetus is fake,

362
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
it was designed, it was built by humans.

363
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
It's a symbolic technique.

364
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
They deliberately made the burial ground into a baby.

365
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
What we see now is just the shadow of the burial ground.

366
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
That's exactly what I'm wondering.

367
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It's said that there's no better wind and snow than Kunlun fetus.

368
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
But Kunlun fetus appearing here,

369
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
it must be problematic.

370
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Could it be that he changed the way San Chuan walks?

371
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Old man, I think we should open the entrance.

372
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Let's not waste time here. Let's go down.

373
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Fatty, I agree with you this time.

374
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Wait a minute. If we go down,

375
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
what if we see a real Kunlun fetus instead of a burial ground?

376
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
If it's a real Kunlun fetus, then it's a divine skill.

377
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
It's worth a look.

378
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Hey, you guys.

379
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
How does it look?

380
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Anyway, no matter what this Kunlun fetus is,

381
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
at least it's complete now.

382
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It means that there's no collapse.

383
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And look at that far away.

384
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It seems to be a few huge pillars.

385
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
If I'm not wrong,

386
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
it should be used to support the ice cover at the bottom of our feet.

387
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
This ice wall should not be directly pressed on the building.

388
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
If it's pressed directly on the building,

389
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
there will be a collapse and the building will break.

390
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
So the ice wall should have a curve.

391
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
This curve will form a natural ice dome.

392
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
It's on the slope, protecting the building below.

393
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Just like the roof of our tomb,

394
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
this wall is made of ice.

395
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
So I think we should go down

396
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
along those wooden pillars

397
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
and we can reach the building.

398
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Fatty, I really admire you.

399
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
No, no, no.

400
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Indeed, the way you said is right.

401
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Let's try it.

402
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Did you find him?

403
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Yes, sir.

404
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
The night bar in the west.

405
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
How much longer?

406
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Eight or nine minutes.

407
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Hurry up.

408
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Cheers.

409
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
A glass of orange juice.

410
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Okay.

411
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
When is the time to order?

412
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I'm telling you, it's a very tender one.

413
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Really?

414
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Yes.

415
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I can lie to you.

416
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Is it reliable?

417
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Yes.

418
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Let's go.

419
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Let's go.

420
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
The most important problem we are facing now

421
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
is the position we are in now.

422
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
It's on the top of this abyss.

423
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
From here to below,

424
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
the Kunlun Pagoda is more than 100 meters away.

425
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And the height of the mountain is more than 100 meters.

426
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
It's a very high place.

427
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
It's a very high place.

428
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
It's a very high place.

429
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
It's a very high place.

430
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
It's a very high place.

431
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It's a very high place.

432
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
It's a very high place.

433
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
The mountain is more than 100 meters away from us.

434
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And it's 20 meters away from us.

435
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
We have enough length to survive.

436
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
But we can't get past the last 20 meters.

437
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Can't Xiao Ge do it?

438
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
He's not a superman who can violate physical law.

439
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
He really can't?

440
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You are a bunch of useless people.

441
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Grandpa San, aren't we too excited?

442
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
We haven't seen such a big town.

443
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
You have experience.

444
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
What do you think we should do?

445
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
We won't leave the Qizong.

446
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
We'll be careful.

447
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
How about this?

448
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
We'll go down alone first.

449
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
We'll go down to the wooden beams of these ice-cold walls.

450
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Then we'll follow the beams to the top of the cave.

451
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Then we'll use ropes to go down to the wooden beams of the buildings that are empty.

452
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Grandpa, you have a way.

453
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Tianzhen, can you do it?

454
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Each wooden pillar below is more than 100 meters long.

455
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It's definitely not the length of a single wooden beam.

456
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
It's made up of several wooden beams.

457
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
It's not a problem to bear the pressure of such a structure.

458
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
The key is whether it can withstand the pull.

459
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
If there's a collapse,

460
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
a wooden beam will hit other wooden beams.

461
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
It will cause a chain reaction and the whole ice-cold wall will collapse.

462
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
This is too risky.

463
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
It's a risk.

464
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
If you can calculate it before I come,

465
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I'll also give you a secret calculation.

466
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
This is the sign of our good fortune.

467
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
We'll be lucky to have a good fortune.

468
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It's not a big deal.

469
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
It's not windy enough.

470
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Wu Xie, do you have any other way?

471
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I'll do it.

472
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Little guy.

473
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
See? It's still our little guy.

474
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Wu Xie.

475
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Wu Xie.

476
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Wu Xie.

477
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Wu Xie.

478
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
My buddy just got caught.

479
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Be careful. There's someone up there.

480
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Let's go.

481
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Wu Xie.

482
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
What are you doing, little girl?

483
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Why are you following us so late?

484
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
What do you want?

485
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I'm sorry. I just came out and didn't know the way.

486
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Little girl, you don't look right.

487
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
No. I just came out and saw you guys staring at me.

488
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
What did you hear just now?

489
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Nothing.

490
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I really didn't hear anything.

491
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Don't grab my bag.

492
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Hello. Have you seen this girl?

493
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Look again. Have you seen her?

494
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
No.

495
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Tell me.

496
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Where?

497
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Over there.

498
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Wu Xie.

499
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Wu Xie.

500
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Shun Zi.

501
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Wu Xie.

502
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Wu Xie.

503
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
This is not a good thing.

504
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Look at the style of the village.

505
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
And the way this place looks.

506
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
This is obviously the style of the Han people.

507
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Don't forget. This is the Pei Zang Ling of the Eastern Xia State.

508
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
The Pei Zang Ling of the Eastern Xia State is actually the style of the Han people.

509
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
This means that this is Wang Zang Hai's hand.

510
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
No matter where he goes to report the project,

511
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
he will never escape his own nation and era of limitation.

512
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Wu Xie.

513
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Wu Xie.

514
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Wu Xie.

515
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Wu Xie.

516
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Wu Xie.

517
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Wu Xie.

518
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Wu Xie.

519
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Wu Xie.

520
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Wu Xie.

521
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Wu Xie.

522
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Wu Xie.

523
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Wu Xie.

524
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Wu Xie.

525
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Wu Xie.

526
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Wu Xie.

527
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Wu Xie.

528
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Wu Xie.

529
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Wu Xie.

530
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Wu Xie.

531
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
This tomb looks so mysterious.

532
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
There must be something good here.

533
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Let's go take a look.

534
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Look.

535
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Oh, it's Halloween.

536
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
He had a game just now.

537
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,900
So he never told me the

538
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,700
complete story.

539
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:10,640
But now he never الله

540
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,500
the best.

541
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,320
Please excuse me,

542
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,740
but there was an event

543
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,400
we can do soon in this place.

544
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,740
I'll go there first.

545
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:30,340
Come on!

546
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:33,200
Jumpsuit

547
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,820
Get closer!

548
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:42,840
атыado

549
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,160
so I might find you safely,

550
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,120
but I don't actually know much about this area.

551
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,860
Let me just show you some good stuff though.

552
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,600
It said,

553
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,120
affairs need no ur给我,

554
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,440
Let's just keep the conversation there.

555
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,120
You and your western occasions.

556
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,120
We can't use our equipment.

557
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,400
We have to retreat.

558
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,280
Is this door too tight?

559
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,400
No, wait.

560
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,120
Wait.

561
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,000
Forget it.

562
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,120
No.

563
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,400
Little guy.

564
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,080
You'd better come and see if there are any traps.

565
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,040
You can't talk.

566
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,560
Follow me.

567
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,600
Don't talk.

568
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,560
Don't worry.

569
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,160
I and Tianzhen will follow you.

570
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,640
Thank you for watching.

571
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,640
Grandfather.

572
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,040
Let's go.

573
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:43,600
The wind is blowing in the wind, the lonely wind

574
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,600
I chase the clouds and the wind

575
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,600
I've forgotten how to answer myself

576
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:03,600
I pass through the night and I find the answer in the darkness

577
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,600
The wind blows in the wind, the lonely wind

578
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,600
The flowers are blooming

579
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:20,600
The wind blows in the wind, the lonely wind

580
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:39,600
I chase the clouds and the wind

581
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:43,600
I've forgotten how to answer myself

582
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:50,600
I pass through the night and I find the answer in the darkness

583
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:54,600
The wind blows in the wind, the lonely wind

584
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,600
The flowers are blooming

585
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:06,600
The wind blows in the wind, the lonely wind

586
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,600
Thanks for watching!
