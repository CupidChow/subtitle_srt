1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm not sure.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not sure.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm not sure.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm not sure.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not sure.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm not sure.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not sure.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm not sure.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm not sure.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm not sure.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not sure.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm not sure.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not sure.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm not sure.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm not sure.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm not sure.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm not sure.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm not sure.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm not sure.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's quite low.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'll wait.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm not sure.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,080
I can't hear any music, except hathatskit-

31
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,100
What's happening?

32
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,260
It's not a nice place to come here.

33
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,880
It shouldn't be too many cineces.

34
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,880
No way.

35
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,160
It is just a place with green light.

36
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,160
The hot water builds may melt that's it!

37
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,360
You can't even take care of the place.

38
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,560
What do you think about the lights?

39
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,440
You just need to turn them on one by one.

40
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,560
What?

41
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,960
I'm not hungry. Let's go.

42
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,960
Aunt Zhong.

43
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,120
Aunt Zhong,

44
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:21,960
Excuse me.

45
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,320
Where do you think you went?

46
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,640
There's no need for a clue.

47
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,200
Wei Ling,

48
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,640
can you leave me alone?

49
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,240
Zhang Hao,

50
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,680
I suggest that you tell me important news.

51
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,760
I don't have the money to be here.

52
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,120
I am not here to sorrow you down.

53
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,160
I said, I said, I said!

54
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,160
Say it!

55
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,660
Little girl, you're still here with me to eat tiger's tail?

56
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,660
You're still a little bit slow!

57
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,160
Hurry up!

58
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,160
Little girl, chase them!

59
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,160
Don't touch them!

60
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,160
Little brother, they know a lot about the cultural relics. We must chase them!

61
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,160
Xiu Xiu, don't worry about this.

62
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,160
You're a girl. What if I didn't come and you had something to do?

63
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,160
Little girl, you're still here with me to eat tiger's tail?

64
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,160
You're still a little bit slow!

65
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,160
Little girl, you're still a little bit slow!

66
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,160
You're still a little bit slow!

67
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,160
Little girl, you're still a little bit slow!

68
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,160
You're still a little bit slow!

69
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,160
Little girl, you're still a little bit slow!

70
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,160
Little girl, you're still a little bit slow!

71
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,160
Little girl, you're still a little bit slow!

72
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,160
Little girl, you're still a little bit slow!

73
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,160
Little girl, you're still a little bit slow!

74
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,160
Little girl, you're still a little bit slow!

75
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,160
Little girl, you're still a little bit slow!

76
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,160
Little girl, you're still a little bit slow!

77
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,160
Little girl, you're still a little bit slow!

78
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,160
Little girl, you're still a little bit slow!

79
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,160
Little girl, you're still a little bit slow!

80
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,160
Little girl, you're still a little bit slow!

81
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,160
Little girl, you're still a little bit slow!

82
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,160
Little girl, you're still a little bit slow!

83
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,160
Little girl, you're still a little bit slow!

84
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,160
Little girl, you're still a little bit slow!

85
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,160
Little girl, you're still a little bit slow!

86
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,160
Little girl, you're still a little bit slow!

87
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,160
Little girl, you're still a little bit slow!

88
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,160
Little girl, you're still a little bit slow!

89
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,160
Little girl, you're still a little bit slow!

90
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,160
Little girl, you're still a little bit slow!

91
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,160
Missed door Creepy

92
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,460
She flies with the wind!

93
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,460
Hey, let's just chat in peace.

94
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,900
We just have to live according to the relationship.

95
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,360
I think everyone will have lost their information

96
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,760
You can do it alone.

97
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,360
We have to listen to the little brother.

98
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,360
Not so serious.

99
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,960
Everyone, take a look carefully.

100
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,560
This should be the fourth branch.

101
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,760
The possibility of the mechanism is very small.

102
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,160
And it's been sealed for so long.

103
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,160
Even if there's a mechanism, it can't be used.

104
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,360
You're not listening to the little brother in here.

105
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,960
You're looking for a way to kill him.

106
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,960
Don't be so surprised. Don't shoot me.

107
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,960
You can do it.

108
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,360
Sh monitoring

109
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,160
10 minutes later

110
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,160
Why are you doing that again?

111
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,160
Isn't it getting cold?

112
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,360
Look at me, so swollen.

113
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,360
This is not the right way to move.

114
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,360
I have to take care of you for two months.

115
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,360
I'm already dead.

116
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,360
This temperature...

117
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
No one can resist it.

118
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,360
Yes.

119
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
This is just the right time.

120
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,360
It's been a long time.

121
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,360
I'm sure we can't resist it.

122
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,360
Here.

123
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,360
Drink some water.

124
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,360
What's that?

125
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
No sound.

126
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
Sagao,

127
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,360
are you too cold?

128
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,360
Or you could come over and get some fire.

129
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,360
I heard it too.

130
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,360
Since I was born,

131
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,360
I've been feeling much better.

132
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,360
FOR featuring

133
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,360
It's nighttime already.

134
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,260
The memories on that day

135
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,000
Theż At Long Space

136
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,520
TheLaotessen

137
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,600
Anhigning

138
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,360
The later

139
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,920
Rise!

140
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,320
When you're done,

141
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,400
bring me the cigarettes.

142
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,600
I'm out ofiring liquor stock.

143
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,000
Greetings.

144
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,360
Listen carefully.

145
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,360
Where did the sound come from?

146
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,160
That's two April line!

147
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,200
Protect me.

148
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,000
Don't destroy too hotly.

149
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:23,300
Totally م

150
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,300
and the same color.

151
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,300
And the clouds and objects in the hall are all made of this base.

152
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,300
The temperature is high during the day.

153
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,300
These base will release white clouds.

154
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,300
When the temperature is low,

155
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,300
these clouds will be re-combined into the ground.

156
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,300
When the temperature rises again in the day,

157
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,300
these clouds will come out again.

158
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,300
If you keep on looking for the past,

159
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,300
you will become a unique natural air in the hall.

160
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,300
You didn't see it, Wu Xian.

161
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,300
You are so good at it.

162
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,300
You are a cultural person.

163
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,300
That's the principle.

164
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,300
This kind of building

165
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,300
can only be seen on this cold snow mountain.

166
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,300
I think

167
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,300
this ancient Chinese

168
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,300
must be the first part.

169
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,300
Then how can we not live and die?

170
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,300
Come.

171
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,300
How about...

172
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,300
Master Sa, it's too cold.

173
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,300
How about we go out first?

174
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,300
We can prepare the qiqiu and come back.

175
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,300
I'm fine.

176
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,300
If you young people

177
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,300
don't even have the same old head as me,

178
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,300
I think we should just go back to the mansion.

179
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,300
We are in a lot of trouble now.

180
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,300
We don't know what's going on

181
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,300
on the snow mountain.

182
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,300
Let's hang on for a bit longer.

183
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,300
My feet and face are all cold.

184
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,300
I'm almost out of blood.

185
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,300
Let's go.

186
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,300
Let's go.

187
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,300
Xiao Xiao, what's going on today?

188
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,300
Do you know how dangerous

189
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,300
today is?

190
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,300
Is this something you can handle?

191
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,300
This is the reputation of the official and the household.

192
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,300
If grandma really gets involved in

193
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,300
the sale of cultural goods,

194
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,300
I hope I'm the first one to know the truth.

195
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,300
The things about cultural goods

196
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,300
and the rules of the old wine door

197
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,300
will never be ignored.

198
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,300
Maybe you misunderstood your grandma.

199
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,300
Maybe grandma Huo was deceived by someone.

200
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,300
But if...

201
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,300
I hope

202
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,300
you can accept the courage of the truth.

203
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,300
Xiao Hua,

204
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,300
I always thought that

205
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,300
I was not afraid of the nature of the earth

206
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,300
and I would definitely accept this.

207
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,300
I know that grandma sent you this picture.

208
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,300
I know you've been very busy recently.

209
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,300
Actually, I didn't want to bother you.

210
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,300
Xiao Xiao,

211
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,300
let me say this again.

212
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,300
I'm your brother.

213
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,300
You can't handle this alone.

214
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,300
So,

215
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,300
leave it to me.

216
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,300
Okay?

217
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,300
Xiao Hua,

218
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,300
you're always so calm.

219
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,300
Xiao Xiao,

220
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,300
we all have to buy the goods for our loved ones.

221
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,300
Wu Xie wants to buy the goods for her uncle.

222
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,300
It's known that in this life,

223
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,300
you have to go to Yunting Palace.

224
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,300
You have to buy the goods for grandma Huo.

225
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,300
Even if the risk is great,

226
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,300
you have to find out the truth.

227
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,300
And I

228
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,300
also have to keep the person who buys the goods.

229
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,300
Jia Sha.

230
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,300
Master Hua.

231
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,300
Just follow this line carefully.

232
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,300
There must be a shop.

233
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,300
Don't worry.

234
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,300
We have to put a long line.

235
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,300
Don't worry.

236
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,300
Okay.

237
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,300
It turns out that it's so close.

238
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,300
I was afraid that I almost died here.

239
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,300
I'm sorry.

240
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,300
I'm sorry.

241
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,300
I'm sorry.

242
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,300
I'm sorry.

243
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,300
I'm sorry.

244
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,300
I'm sorry.

245
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,300
I'm sorry.

246
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,300
I'm sorry.

247
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,300
I'm sorry.

248
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,300
I'm sorry.

249
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,300
I'm sorry.

250
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,300
I'm sorry.

251
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,300
I'm sorry.

252
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,300
I'm sorry.

253
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,300
I'm sorry.

254
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,300
I'm sorry.

255
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,300
I'm sorry.

256
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,300
I'm sorry.

257
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,300
I'm sorry.

258
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,300
I'm sorry.

259
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,300
I'm sorry.

260
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,300
I'm sorry.

261
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,300
I'm sorry.

262
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,300
I'm sorry.

263
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,300
I'm sorry.

264
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,300
I'm sorry.

265
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,300
I'm sorry.

266
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,300
I'm sorry.

267
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,300
I'm sorry.

268
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,300
I'm sorry.

269
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,300
Let's go.

270
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:59,300
I'm not sure if I can get the other one.

271
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:04,300
I'll try to get the other one.

272
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:09,300
I'll try to get the other one.

273
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:14,300
I'll try to get the other one.

274
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:19,300
I'll try to get the other one.

275
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:25,300
I'll try to get the other one.

276
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,300
It's so beautiful.

277
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,300
If we didn't come here,

278
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,300
who would have known that there's such a place under the mountain?

279
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,300
I said fat.

280
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,300
Even if there's no mechanism, we must protect our tomb.

281
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,300
If you ask Fatty to open a soup shop,

282
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,300
it's not a big deal.

283
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,300
Don't worry.

284
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,300
Look.

285
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,300
Look at this.

286
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,300
Brother Hua, what's this?

287
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,300
Isn't this the tomb's portrait?

288
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,300
How come it's this?

289
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,300
Brother Hua, what's this?

290
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,300
Isn't this the tomb's portrait?

291
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,300
How come it's this?

292
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,300
The Long River Sky in the East and the Middle Ages?

293
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,300
This is their main god.

294
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,300
This god is so beautiful.

295
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,300
He's a big horse king.

296
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,300
How can you be so good?

297
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,300
Isn't this in his territory?

298
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,300
Aren't you afraid of getting the reward?

299
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,300
What are you afraid of?

300
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,300
The Long River Sky is a invisible thing.

301
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:52,300
It represents the infinite power.

302
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,300
It's a kind of universe.

303
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,300
How can it be like a horse king?

304
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,300
Okay.

305
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,300
I know a lot.

306
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,300
We usually analyze it in the sky.

307
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,300
I can't think of anything.

308
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,300
Tianzhen,

309
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,300
tell me.

310
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,300
This thing looks like a god of evil in the sea and the ground.

311
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,300
I saw it when I was watching the exhibition in Shanghai.

312
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,300
Their gods look like this.

313
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,300
They look like a big bug.

314
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,300
Right?

315
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,300
You can talk later.

316
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,300
Right.

317
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,300
The Tongyu Mountain is a record.

318
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,300
The Long River King is the portrait of the Long River King.

319
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,300
Is it the portrait of the Long River King?

320
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,300
The Long River King is a king.

321
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,300
If I could know,

322
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,300
I'd be happy to know the other two things on the Tongyu Mountain.

323
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,300
Let's see.

324
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,300
Let them know that you have Tongyu Mountain.

325
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,300
It's not a good thing.

326
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,300
Okay.

327
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,300
Fatty,

328
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,300
it's warm here.

329
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,300
Tianzhen.

330
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,300
Be careful.

331
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,300
I know.

332
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,300
Look.

333
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,300
It's bronze.

334
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,300
According to the document,

335
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,300
there's nothing like this in all the works.

336
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,300
I think the Eighth City is the owner of the tomb.

337
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,300
Personally.

338
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,300
If this big bug is really the owner of the people in the East,

339
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,300
then these bronze monkeys must be his guardian.

340
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,300
The horse king is a monkey.

341
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,300
It's so rare.

342
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:01,300
Maybe it's related to the legend of the land with a very local feature.

343
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,300
We are not the people of the court.

344
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,300
We can't prove it.

345
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,300
But why is it bronze again?

346
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,300
The iron ring has been very developed by tomorrow.

347
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,300
Xiaoge, it's bronze again.

348
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,300
It's bronze.

349
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,300
It's not common.

350
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,300
It's not common.

351
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,300
In general,

352
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,300
the distance used by the priests will be long and long.

353
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,300
There will be a warm room, a room, a seat, and a temple.

354
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,300
But look at this.

355
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,300
There's no even the simplest piece of equipment.

356
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,300
After all, it's a minority of people.

357
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,300
Maybe there's no such thing.

358
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,300
Don't talk nonsense.

359
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,300
Where are you going?

360
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,300
You are my mother.

361
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,300
You always keep me busy.

362
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,300
Fatty.

363
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,300
Fatty.

364
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,300
What's wrong?

365
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,300
You can't go.

366
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,300
What's going on?

367
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,300
It's dawn.

368
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,300
There's nothing in the hall.

369
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,300
There must be a lot of dangerous things.

370
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,300
I'm going to find them.

371
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,300
How about this?

372
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,300
I'll put on my rope.

373
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,300
You guys carry me.

374
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,300
I'll go in and see.

375
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,300
If there's anything good,

376
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,300
you guys can count it as a technical bone.

377
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,300
How about 10% for you?

378
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,300
Fatty, I'm the most annoying.

379
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,300
If you want to go crazy,

380
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,300
you can go out and go crazy inside yourself.

381
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,300
You can go out and go crazy inside yourself.

382
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,300
I'll put on my rope.

383
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,300
We'll pull the rope.

384
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,300
You'll be on your leg when we pull it back.

385
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,300
Let's keep looking for you.

386
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,300
Wait.

387
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,300
You want to go in and go in yourself?

388
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,300
All right.

389
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,300
I'll help you organize it.

390
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,300
I won't betray the organization before I find out the truth.

391
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,300
You can't betray me even if you find out the truth.

392
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,300
All right.

393
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,300
I'll listen to you.

394
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,300
Look at him.

395
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,300
Have you seen this?

396
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,300
This book was sold to the auctioneer

397
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,300
and sold to the 4 billion-dollar coin.

398
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,300
Hey, think about it.

399
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,300
You moved back from such a big door.

400
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,300
Those were all noisy.

401
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,300
Now the shareholders' trading market

402
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,300
has surpassed 20 million already.

403
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,300
The top door has the most than 40 million.

404
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,300
I still don't understand.

405
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,300
It's impossible to get 40 million to 2 billion.

406
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,300
We're all waiting for you to buy the door.

407
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,300
The person who works in the next life

408
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,300
is the one who earns money at home.

409
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,300
You'll cry in the next life.

410
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,300
I think you're really a good person.

411
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,300
Wu Xie, let me go.

412
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,300
Don't hurt yourself.

413
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,300
Come on.

414
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,300
You didn't drink at all.

415
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,300
He Shang.

416
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,300
You said that the jade door is pretty.

417
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,300
If I blow it up...

418
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,300
Blow it up?

419
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,300
Are you crazy?

420
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,300
This is a tattoo.

421
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,300
Then I won't do it.

422
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,300
Hey, think about it.

423
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,300
Why did you open the door?

424
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,300
Isn't this the box?

425
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,300
Fatty,

426
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,300
you said you put your fat bones

427
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,300
on your head.

428
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,300
Did we think about it long ago?

429
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,300
I don't know.

430
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,300
I don't know.

431
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,300
I thought about it.

432
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,300
Did we think about it long ago?

433
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,300
Listen to me.

434
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,300
I'm mad at you.

435
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,300
I told you I thought about it.

436
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,300
What if the switch is not on?

437
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,300
Fatty,

438
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,300
what did you say?

439
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,300
Say it again.

440
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,300
I said the switch is not on.

441
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,300
The switch is not on?

442
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,300
Yes.

443
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,300
We found the photo.

444
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,300
Maybe the way to open the door

445
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,300
is not on the door.

446
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,300
Everyone, think about it.

447
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,300
See if there's any switch.

448
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,300
Why are you standing there?

449
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,300
Go.

450
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,300
Old man, prepare the bowl.

451
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,300
My little clingy mouth.

452
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,300
I另外 have再见.

453
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,140
Go away

454
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,140
Just hide away.

455
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,140
No.

456
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,420
He...

457
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,480
This is an oil color freak.

458
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,740
This is what theれてil standard looks like.

459
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,300
It's getting hot.

460
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,300
Oh, my god. I didn't see it just now.

461
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,300
What kind of treasure is this?

462
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,300
What kind of treasure is this?

463
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,300
This is a 9-star map.

464
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,300
The pattern is not complete yet.

465
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,300
We...we have to find the remaining four maps.

466
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:43,300
Then you just dig four parts of the four parts of the four groups, right?

467
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,300
I didn't get them just now. I have to work on them now.

468
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,300
Good job, Fatty.

469
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,300
Looks like Han Le can keep your head clean.

470
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,300
No, I can't get them down.

471
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,300
I think we should find a new map.

472
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,300
No way.

473
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,300
What we can do is to find these four parts.

474
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,300
The patterns on these are all in series.

475
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,300
But how can we get them down now?

476
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,300
I'm not sure if I can get them down.

477
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,300
I think I can get them down.

478
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,300
I think I can get them down.

479
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,300
I think I can get them down.

480
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,300
I think I can get them down.

481
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,300
I think I can get them down.

482
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,300
I think I can get them down.

483
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,300
I think I can get them down.

484
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,300
I think I can get them down.

485
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,300
I think I can get them down.

486
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,300
I think I can get them down.

487
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,300
I think I can get them down.

488
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,300
I think I can get them down.

489
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,300
I think I can get them down.

490
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,300
I think I can get them down.

491
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,300
I think I can get them down.

492
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,300
I think I can get them down.

493
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,300
I think I can get them down.

494
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,300
I think I can get them down.

495
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,300
I think I can get them down.

496
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,300
I think I can get them down.

497
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,300
I think I can get them down.

498
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,300
I think I can get them down.

499
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,300
I think I can get them down.

500
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,300
I think I can get them down.

501
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,300
I think I can get them down.

502
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,300
I think I can get them down.

503
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,300
I think I can get them down.

504
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,300
I think I can get them down.

505
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,300
I think I can get them down.

506
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,300
I think I can get them down.

507
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,300
I think I can get them down.

508
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,300
I think I can get them down.

509
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,300
I think I can get them down.

510
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,300
I think I can get them down.

511
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,300
I think I can get them down.

512
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,300
I think I can get them down.

513
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,300
I think I can get them down.

514
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,300
I think I can get them down.

515
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,300
I think I can get them down.

516
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,300
I think I can get them down.

517
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,300
I think I can get them down.

518
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,300
I don't know if that's normal.

519
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,300
Okay.

520
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,300
Hey, there.

521
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,300
Just one move.

522
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,300
I think somethings wrong.

523
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,300
Don't talk nonsense.

524
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,300
Don't talk nonsense.

525
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,300
You're right.

526
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,300
Bro

527
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,400
You're not getting them up.

528
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,300
I don't believe it. I also believe it.

529
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,980
I got something. I got it, too.

530
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,980
Come, look.

531
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,980
What do you mean? I'm telling you.

532
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,980
It's Wu Xin's.

533
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,980
You can take it.

534
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,980
Look, they're related.

535
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,980
Then, then, then, then,

536
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,980
you move this.

537
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:07,980
Oh, no.

538
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,980
You guys go get the other ones.

539
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,980
This should have a rule.

540
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,980
This is a circular map.

541
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,980
We must put in a new map

542
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,980
so that we can move it again.

543
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,980
This position can't be placed anywhere.

544
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,980
Every time we put in the map,

545
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,980
we'll decide the difficulty of our future map.

546
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,980
Open the door, you fool.

547
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,980
Are you done?

548
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:50,980
Wu Xin, no.

549
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,980
You move.

550
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,980
I got it.

551
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,980
I got it.

552
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,980
Look.

553
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,980
Come.

554
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,980
It's a circular map.

555
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,980
It should be simple.

556
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,980
It's okay.

557
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,980
You just try it.

558
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,980
Try it.

559
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,980
Try it.

560
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:30,980
Don't worry.

561
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,980
Well,

562
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,980
we can't mess things up, right?

563
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,980
What if we're wrong?

564
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,980
What if there are other mechanisms?

565
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,980
The worst result is that

566
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,980
the door is closed.

567
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,980
We can't go out.

568
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,980
Or else...

569
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,980
Fatty,

570
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,980
you and Lang Feng

571
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,980
will go to the private library

572
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,980
to see if there are other clues.

573
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,980
Lang Feng.

574
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,980
Stop.

575
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,980
Let's put it down first.

576
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,980
Take this.

577
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,980
Fatty,

578
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:49,980
are you mad?

579
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,980
You can't just keep it secret.

580
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,980
This is a painting.

581
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,980
This kind of hard work and material

582
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,980
can sculpt such a beautiful painting.

583
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:01,980
It's really not easy.

584
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,980
And I've seen all those paintings.

585
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:06,980
Every painting is different.

586
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,980
It has to be spent for several decades.

587
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,980
These are all art products.

588
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,980
It's really a great thing.

589
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,980
I can't bring it out.

590
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,980
Let everyone watch it.

591
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,980
This is simple.

592
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,980
Can you do this?

593
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,980
First, we blow up the mountain.

594
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,980
Then we put out the entire underground palace.

595
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,980
Then we find the machine and move it up.

596
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,980
I think you're really good at blowing up the monsters.

597
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:36,980
You destroyed the sky for these pillars.

598
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,980
It's not worth it.

599
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,980
My style is simple.

600
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,980
It seems that the above painting

601
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,980
is a legend of our local people.

602
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,980
I think it's a bit of a influence.

603
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,980
There was a man who used to lead soldiers

604
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,980
to fight outside.

605
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,980
He waited for many years for his husband to come back.

606
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,980
In the end, the man was regretful

607
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,980
and often went to Changbai Mountain.

608
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,980
In order to make his husband come,

609
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,980
he changed into a snow mountain

610
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,980
to protect his wife.

611
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,980
You're talking about

612
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,980
the story of the king of the Wannu?

613
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,980
Get up.

614
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,980
Get up.

615
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,980
Tianzhen.

616
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,980
Tianzhen.

617
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,980
I've already sent you a picture.

618
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,980
The pillar should be

619
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,980
the wife of the king of Wannu.

620
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,980
So he is the snow mountain goddess.

621
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,980
You can take a look.

622
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,980
It's too cold.

623
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,980
You should eat something.

624
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,980
Snow mountain goddess?

625
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,980
Is this the gift of the snow mountain goddess?

626
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,980
Is it related to the painting?

627
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,980
I don't know about it.

628
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,980
Go on.

629
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,980
Your Highness.

630
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,980
Why is this picture

631
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,980
like I've seen it before?

632
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,980
Really?

633
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:55,980
It's like I put it in the island before.

634
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,980
Your Highness, think about it.

635
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,980
Where did you see it?

636
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,980
Your Highness.

637
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,980
Your Highness.

638
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,980
Think about it.

639
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,980
I'm old.

640
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,980
I'm not smart.

641
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,980
Your Highness.

642
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,980
What's this?

643
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,980
It's written in the rice paper.

644
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,980
So according to the drawing,

645
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,980
