1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,640
Bullying this old woman took about 30SNK

2
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,580
Fatso

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I can't hold on anymore!

4
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Thank you, Grandpa Si.

5
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You guys still want to go and dig up the Emperor's Jiu Long Tai Shi Guan?

6
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I think Wu San Xing's head is probably kicked by a donkey.

7
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
No, I don't know if his third uncle was kicked by a donkey.

8
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But he's been in the mud for so long, and he's been hit a lot.

9
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Really?

10
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I don't know.

11
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I just know that he's been hit by a donkey.

12
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I don't know if he's been hit by a donkey.

13
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't know. But he's been in the mud for so long, and he's been hit a lot.

14
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You caught him!

15
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You two are in the same boat.

16
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Wu San Xing woke up Lei Zi in Hangzhou.

17
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You woke up Lei Zi in Shanghai.

18
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Right?

19
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Grandpa Si, it's none of our business.

20
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Jason sent those people.

21
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Why did that yellow-skinned monkey hit you?

22
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Because Wu San Xing blocked his way.

23
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So?

24
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That monkey wants to catch you and negotiate with Wu San Xing.

25
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
How did he think of that? How do I know?

26
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I don't know them as well as you do.

27
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Right, Grandpa Si?

28
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Little bunny, don't play with me.

29
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
No, no, he didn't.

30
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I say, old man, don't play with us.

31
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You're older than me.

32
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So we have to let you remind us more.

33
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Right?

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Forget it.

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He knows some rules.

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Right, right.

37
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'll tell you a few.

38
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The place we're going to is extraordinary.

39
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So Wu San Xing came to me

40
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
to remind you of something.

41
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I can say this.

42
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The place we're going to,

43
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
in this world,

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
except me,

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
no one else can go.

46
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
No, Grandpa Si.

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
We're just a small group.

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
We've seen a lot of things.

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You know?

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
We've seen the bathhouse in the Great Imperial.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
This...

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What did you say?

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What did he say?

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Grandpa Si, what did you say?

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The Tai Shi Guan and the Emperor of the East and the West.

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Wu San Xing didn't tell you?

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
No, we just know we're here to see the sky.

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I don't care about the sky.

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What Wu San Xing and I are going to do

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
is to dig the Emperor's tomb

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
and bury the Tai Shi Guan.

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Grandpa Si, what is the Tai Shi Guan?

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Who is the Emperor of the East and the West?

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
If you don't have the guts,

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
you can't get through.

66
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
No.

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You...

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You...

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You're a bloodbath and you're still in the ditch.

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Shame on you.

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Shame on you.

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You're so shameful.

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Why are you in the ditch?

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You...

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Why are you so slow?

76
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You're almost there.

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You're still in front of Grandpa Si.

78
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Do you know who he is?

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Really?

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Grandpa Si.

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Don't.

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Call Grandpa Si.

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Hurry up.

84
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Grandpa Si, look.

85
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Grandpa Si is well prepared.

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
He brought his disciples and subordinates.

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Could he have a deal with that red hat?

88
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's hard to say.

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
He said the Emperor's tomb

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
is the same place as the Sky Palace.

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I don't know.

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But Wang Zang Hai always likes to change people's tomb.

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's possible that the Emperor's tomb

94
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
is the same place as the Sky Palace.

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Otherwise, there are two possible

96
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
tombstones on Mount Changbai.

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's too small.

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
If so,

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
we may not know the clues

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
that Grandpa Si knows.

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Now, no one on the street

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
of Dunhua knows about Uncle Hai.

103
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
We were there to get the equipment.

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Don't think about it now.

105
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
If we knew what happened,

106
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
we had to follow them.

107
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's too cruel.

108
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's okay.

109
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Mount Changbai is so big.

110
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's not easy to position

111
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
the direction of the Sky Palace.

112
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
According to the route before Uncle Hai,

113
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
we were going to the village of Lizi Gou,

114
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
the second white river.

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
If we go there,

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
maybe the direction of the Sky Palace is near there.

117
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
According to your speculation,

118
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Uncle Hai knows more clues than you do.

119
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Lizi Gou can't go there today.

120
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
How about this?

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
We'll go to the nearby village.

122
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
We hope to get something.

123
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
If so,

124
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
we have to follow Grandpa Si.

125
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Sir, look.

126
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You've prepared enough for this time.

127
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Do you need any help?

128
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
No, thanks.

129
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What's your name?

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Hello, I'm Ye Cheng.

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
This is Mr. Hua.

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
This is Wang Feng.

133
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Are you Wang Fatty?

134
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The famous Fatty in the city of Si Jiu?

135
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,820
I heard you've been to many big

136
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,820
jie. What's exciting? Tell me.

137
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,820
You can call me Fatty.

138
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,820
I've been to some big jie.

139
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,820
But you're not as good as me.

140
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,820
You're following Grandpa Si.

141
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,820
Right?

142
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,820
What's wrong?

143
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,820
You're cold.

144
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,820
We're too weak.

145
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,820
I'm too cold to come here.

146
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,820
I just got wet in my clothes.

147
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,820
Are you sure you don't need help?

148
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,820
No, no.

149
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,820
Sir, it's late.

150
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,820
We're going in. Grandpa Si has something to tell us.

151
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,820
We'll find some time to drink and have a drink.

152
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,820
How about it?

153
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,820
Sorry to keep you waiting.

154
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,820
You guys get back to your work.

155
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,820
Sir, put the stuff down.

156
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,820
Put it on the second floor.

157
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,820
Don't go in.

158
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,820
Why not?

159
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,820
He doesn't want us to follow him.

160
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,820
He said Grandpa Si has plans.

161
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,820
He said we can go later.

162
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,820
Where else can we go?

163
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,820
I'm telling you.

164
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,820
He's so stupid.

165
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,820
He'll be scared to death.

166
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,820
Do you believe it?

167
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,820
Let's go in.

168
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,820
If we stay here, we'll be sick.

169
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,820
You're right.

170
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,820
Who is it?

171
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,820
Who is this?

172
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,820
He's wearing a combat vest.

173
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:37,000
He's dressed like a

174
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
Wu Xie, I was just looking for you.

175
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,820
Can you show me the map of the sky?

176
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,820
Map?

177
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,820
What map?

178
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
I don't know what you're talking about.

179
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,820
I think we shouldn't waste our time.

180
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,820
Wu San Xing has left.

181
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,820
I don't have time to waste with you guys.

182
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,820
Don't make me repeat myself.

183
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,820
Otherwise...

184
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,820
What? Is this a borrowed attitude?

185
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,820
Even if we have it, we can't let you see it.

186
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,820
We're all waiting here.

187
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,820
Why don't you wait for his uncle to leave?

188
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,820
When he's in a good mood,

189
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,820
he'll let you see the treasures.

190
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,820
What are you doing?

191
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,820
What are you doing?

192
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,820
You know what he means.

193
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,820
I hope you won't make things difficult for me.

194
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,820
An Ning, did Qiu De Ka

195
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,820
ask you to stop me?

196
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,820
I came to protect Wu Xie.

197
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
After all, he has the least experience.

198
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,820
And I'm afraid

199
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,820
some people with bad intentions

200
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,820
will ruin our plan.

201
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,820
You!

202
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,820
Mr. Si, it seems

203
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,820
we don't have to show up.

204
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,820
He's not going to be like us.

205
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,820
Look at those guys.

206
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,820
They brought a lot of people.

207
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,820
I don't know if they can handle it.

208
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,820
I hope nothing goes wrong.

209
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,820
If you don't want to,

210
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,820
tell him yourself.

211
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,820
Let's go!

212
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,820
Okay,

213
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,820
that's great.

214
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,820
This is the man you brought.

215
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,820
Let's go.

216
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,820
Let's go.

217
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,820
Mr. Si, you're drinking tea so little.

218
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,820
Are you going to sleep?

219
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,820
Let's go together.

220
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,820
No, no, no.

221
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
We're going upstairs.

222
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,820
We can play cards together.

223
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,820
We can get gold.

224
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,820
Okay, who's going to play?

225
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,820
I'll call you later.

226
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,820
Okay, okay.

227
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,820
Keep your eyes on Wu Xie.

228
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,820
Without Wu Sanxing,

229
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,820
he's the only one with the location

230
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,820
of the Cloud Sky Palace.

231
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,820
We need him

232
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,820
to guide us.

233
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,820
I understand, but I worry that

234
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,820
Chen Pi'er Si will take the chance to mutiny.

235
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,820
I'm afraid that

236
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
Wu Xie can't handle it.

237
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,820
Wu Sanxing is the one who called for

238
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,820
Chen Pi'er Si. It's clear that

239
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,820
Wu Xie will not be harmed

240
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,820
by Chen Pi'er Si.

241
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,820
Are you sure?

242
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,820
But I worry Wu Sanxing looks...

243
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,820
Wu Xie doesn't seem

244
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,820
to trust him as much anymore.

245
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,820
It's true that

246
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,820
Wu Sanxing is getting harder to read.

247
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,820
Fine.

248
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,820
I will send someone to meet you

249
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,820
at the Changbai Mountain.

250
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,820
Stay with Wu Xie for now.

251
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,820
Once I'm finished with things at hand,

252
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,820
I will go there as well.

253
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,820
Sir, the climate on the mountain

254
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,820
is treacherous. We might be trapped

255
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,820
here for some days.

256
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,820
You should stay at the foot of the mountain.

257
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,820
It's too dangerous and too harsh up here.

258
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,820
Don't worry.

259
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,820
I know what I'm doing.

260
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,820
How is it, boss? Is there any wine?

261
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,820
Is there?

262
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,820
There are rope, coal,

263
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,820
chili,

264
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
and chocolate.

265
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
And sanitary pads.

266
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,820
Thank you.

267
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,820
What else?

268
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,820
That thing is for shoe store.

269
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,820
It's not only for sweat, but also for keeping warm.

270
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,820
You are too much.

271
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,820
Thank you.

272
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,820
Uncle,

273
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,820
thank you for your help.

274
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,820
I'll pay you 5,000 yuan.

275
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,820
It's my pleasure.

276
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,820
I've asked the guide you're looking for.

277
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,820
He's from our village.

278
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,820
His name is Shunzi.

279
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,820
He's Korean. He's willing to take this job.

280
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,820
Is he familiar with the mountain?

281
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,820
His father is

282
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,820
a hunter in our village.

283
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,820
He's been running around the mountain with his father since he was a kid.

284
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,820
Not everyone is

285
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,820
more familiar with the mountain than him.

286
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,820
But only he can handle the current situation.

287
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,820
How about this?

288
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,820
Take me to his house.

289
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,820
Okay. I'll go with you.

290
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,820
Okay.

291
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,820
Okay.

292
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,820
Okay.

293
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,320
Hey.

294
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,820
Don't run. Be careful.

295
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,420
Enough.

296
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,420
Enough, Hong.

297
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,420
Stop barking.

298
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,420
Is the dog okay?

299
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,320
It's okay.

300
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,820
Come on. Be careful.

301
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,620
Shunzi.

302
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,720
Shunzi.

303
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,820
Why isn't he here?

304
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,320
Old Jin.

305
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,820
I'm here to pass the message.

306
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,020
This is Shunzi's father.

307
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,520
He hasn't come down since he came up the mountain.

308
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,020
How about this?

309
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,120
You guys sit here for a while.

310
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,120
Shunzi might be in the backyard.

311
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,020
I'll go find him.

312
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,620
Okay.

313
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,220
Okay.

314
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:53,820
Okay.

315
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,420
Okay.

316
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,020
Okay.

317
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,620
Okay.

318
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,220
Okay.

319
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:56,820
Okay.

320
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,420
Okay.

321
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,020
Okay.

322
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,620
Okay.

323
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,220
Okay.

324
00:16:59,320 --> 00:16:59,820
Okay.

325
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,420
Okay.

326
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:00,920
Okay.

327
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,520
Okay.

328
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,120
Okay.

329
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:02,720
Hey.

330
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,620
Wait a minute.

331
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,320
Where's the toilet?

332
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:04,920
Follow me.

333
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:05,520
Okay.

334
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,420
Uncle Dashan.

335
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,220
Shunzi.

336
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,320
Uncle Dashan.

337
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,320
These two are here to find you as the head of the village.

338
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,920
This is Brother Wu.

339
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,520
This is Brother Hua.

340
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,120
You guys talk.

341
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,920
You guys talk.

342
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,520
I'm sorry about earlier.

343
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,720
It's okay.

344
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,720
I'm like my father.

345
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,920
I'm not like my father.

346
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,120
I'm like my father.

347
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,320
I'm like my father.

348
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,520
I'm like my father.

349
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,620
I'm like my father.

350
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,220
It's rare for people to go to Snow Mountain now.

351
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,320
The wind blows the snow.

352
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,820
It's hard to recognize the road on the mountain.

353
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,220
And there's nothing to see on the mountain now.

354
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,220
The wind is always there.

355
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,420
When we go to Mount Changbai,

356
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,020
we plan to go to the wind.

357
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,820
Yeah.

358
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,220
Brother.

359
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,620
Have you ever been to Snow Mountain?

360
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,420
I can go to any of the wind here.

361
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,520
But I said in advance.

362
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,520
After entering the Snow Zone,

363
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,620
you have to listen to me.

364
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,720
I can only go if I say so.

365
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,820
I have to stop if I say so.

366
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,320
You can't let your temper come.

367
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,320
It's necessary.

368
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,920
We are just having fun.

369
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,520
We can't risk our lives, right?

370
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,720
Okay.

371
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,520
I'll check your equipment later.

372
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,520
Is there anything missing?

373
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,520
You can't go these two days.

374
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,320
Hurry up and make up for it.

375
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,320
Why can't you go either?

376
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,120
Didn't you say you're the only one who can go to Snow Mountain?

377
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,520
We can't wait two more days.

378
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,020
It's too late to wait two more days.

379
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,520
Actually,

380
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,920
you should have looked for other ways before you came.

381
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,620
It's the winter vacation of Snow Mountain.

382
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,020
They won't go up the mountain at all.

383
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,820
I can only wait for these two days.

384
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,520
My father said

385
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,920
it's the day when the Goddess of Snow Mountain gets angry.

386
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,020
We can't go up the mountain.

387
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,820
Otherwise, we will never be able to go.

388
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,420
You are a fan of the sword.

389
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,220
You can't go in.

390
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,520
Brother.

391
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,620
There will be a strong stormy snow these days.

392
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,520
Brother.

393
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,620
What do you mean?

394
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,120
We must go back immediately.

395
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,320
The stormy snow is here.

396
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,420
All of us must stay at home.

397
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,320
You little brother.

398
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,620
You know there is a stormy snow,

399
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,920
but you still wear so little.

400
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,120
Let me tell you.

401
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,620
When you go out,

402
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
you will freeze to ice.

403
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,220
Uncle Dashan.

404
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:12,920
It's okay.

405
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,920
Don't worry about him.

406
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,120
When will the stormy snow stop?

407
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,620
When can we go up the mountain?

408
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,820
Ask Shun Zi.

409
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,320
He knows better than me.

410
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,320
Shun Zi.

411
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,920
At least tonight is not small.

412
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,320
We will have to see the situation later.

413
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,120
As long as there is no fog.

414
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,120
Be careful.

415
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,720
Uncle Dashan.

416
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,220
Is the stormy snow here really that severe?

417
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,620
If the sky is not clear,

418
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,220
we will be trapped here.

419
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,420
Of course.

420
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,820
Look at the weather.

421
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,820
The stormy snow this time

422
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,020
is probably the most severe this year.

423
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,220
It's okay.

424
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,620
Enough, Hong.

425
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,420
Enough.

426
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,220
Last time was so severe.

427
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,620
It's still the same as the roast goose his father brought.

428
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,620
It's okay, Uncle Dashan.

429
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,920
It's been a long time.

430
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,720
That year, my father took a team of archaeologists to the mountain.

431
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,920
At that time, there was a huge storm.

432
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,120
Later, there was a snowstorm in the mountain.

433
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,120
A group of people never came back.

434
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,520
I didn't expect that

435
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,120
so many years had passed.

436
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,720
I still remember that

437
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,520
that year, the stormy snow made the village stop powering.

438
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,120
At that time, no one cared.

439
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,720
Later, my father saw fog in the mountain.

440
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,920
He felt something was wrong.

441
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,920
Now I understand.

442
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,120
The power outage and fog

443
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,620
may be the snow goddess warning my father again and again.

444
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,620
So, if things go wrong these two days,

445
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,820
I'd rather wait for two more days

446
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,020
than take you on an adventure.

447
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,620
Okay.

448
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,820
Let's go.

449
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,620
Let's go.

450
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,820
Be careful.

451
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,120
The Snow Goddess

452
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,620
Why is it so dark?

453
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,820
What's going on?

454
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,420
It's power outage.

455
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,320
It's normal that the snowstorm is coming.

456
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,720
Let's go.

457
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,120
I was just about to go to you.

458
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,320
Why did you take so long?

459
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,520
I'm starving.

460
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,720
Aren't we looking for Hong Kong?

461
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,120
Why did you bring him here?

462
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,120
Come on, I'm starving.

463
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,320
Brother, we're all friends.

464
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,120
The chicken and mushroom legs are well-done.

465
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:06,920
Really?

466
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,120
Not bad.

467
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,720
Shunzi, this is...

468
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,520
I haven't tasted such a good Northeast flavor for a long time.

469
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,720
It's great.

470
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,920
It's homemade food.

471
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,120
You can eat it if you like.

472
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,320
Uncle Dashan,

473
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,320
your wine is good.

474
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,520
Give me some more.

475
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,720
You're too much.

476
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,920
Wait a minute.

477
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,720
A'Li, are you going out?

478
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,120
The snowstorm is coming.

479
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,720
Uncle Dashan, don't ask.

480
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,120
The boss decided to go up the mountain.

481
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,320
I have to listen.

482
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,520
You're stupid.

483
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,120
You don't even want to live for a few bucks.

484
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,120
Old man, have you seen a dollar?

485
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,520
This guy took so much money from us.

486
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,120
He should have died for us.

487
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,920
Jason,

488
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,120
I advise you to listen to the locals.

489
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,720
It's not a smart thing to go out when you know it's dangerous.

490
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,920
Bosses,

491
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,720
you have to listen to me when you go up the mountain.

492
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,720
If you can't go on, you have to go back.

493
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,120
You're talking nonsense.

494
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,320
My people are waiting outside.

495
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,720
Go.

496
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,920
Good wine and good food should be eaten by people.

497
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,720
If you give it to someone, it's for the dog.

498
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,520
You can't say that.

499
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,820
They're living in a strange place outside.

500
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,420
Besides, a meal is not a big deal.

501
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,820
It's not a big deal.

502
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,820
There won't be so many people to eat the next meal.

503
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,420
Sir, the blizzard is here.

504
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,220
Our people are not willing to risk their lives.

505
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,220
And there are rumors of life threatening conditions.

506
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:50,620
I think we should stay put to avoid unnecessary loss.

507
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,820
But you said Jason insisted to sit out and he's already left.

508
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,820
Indeed, I couldn't stop him.

509
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,820
Go find him.

510
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,020
Make sure he's within our sight.

511
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:03,020
This shouldn't be difficult for you, okay?

512
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,420
Understood, sir.

513
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,020
Hurry up.

514
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,220
Hurry up and pack up.

515
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,220
Brothers, hurry up.

516
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:14,820
Okay.

517
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:15,820
One more person.

518
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,320
Check again.

519
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,120
Be careful.

520
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,120
Come on.

521
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:21,920
Aren't you too late?

522
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,120
Sir, don't pack up these brothers.

523
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,520
They might come back later.

524
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,720
And it's too late if we don't leave now.

525
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,120
Why are you so nervous?

526
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,720
My men are professional warriors.

527
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,120
They can handle any emergency.

528
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,920
Just stay on your way.

529
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:37,920
No, sir.

530
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,120
We can't sleep in the woods.

531
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,320
Just stay a few.

532
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,920
There are abandoned hunting huts on the way.

533
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,520
We can stay here for now.

534
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,320
Okay.

535
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,120
Go away.

536
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,320
Come on.

537
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,120
Take away the huts.

538
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,320
The rest stay here.

539
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,320
We'll set off now.

540
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,520
Yes, sir.

541
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
Actually, we don't have to be so nervous.

542
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,520
Maybe it's not that dangerous.

543
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,120
They say the storm is scary.

544
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,720
But the most terrifying thing is the unknown monster on the mountain.

545
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,520
When the people of our village went up the mountain,

546
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,520
some of them died for no reason.

547
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,720
When they were discovered,

548
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,320
the corpses were all together.

549
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,320
It's like they were bitten by a big snake.

550
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,520
It's all red and yellow on the ground.

551
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,920
The intestines are all broken.

552
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,920
They break easily.

553
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,120
It's a strong taste.

554
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,120
Are the wolves in the mountain hungry or something?

555
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,620
There are beasts on the mountain.

556
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,020
But the beasts eat the food in winter.

557
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,820
They will never let go of those dead animals.

558
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,420
They love to eat.

559
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,820
You're pretending to be a god.

560
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,820
Why didn't you say it's human-made?

561
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,820
Impossible.

562
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,020
How can you be so perverted?

563
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,820
That's hard to say.

564
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,020
It's hard to predict people's mind.

565
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,520
Are we talking about the Ghost Festival now?

566
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,320
Who's next?

567
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:11,920
Come on.

568
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,720
Me.

569
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,520
I'll talk about the bloodthirsty people in the Panjiayuan.

570
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,720
I'm telling you.

571
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,120
Do you want me to join you?

572
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,120
Come on.

573
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:20,920
Come on.

574
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:21,720
Sit here.

575
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,320
Master.

576
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,320
You sit next to us.

577
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,320
In this situation,

578
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,120
it's safer for everyone to stay.

579
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,120
You're here.

580
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,120
I'm here.

581
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,120
I'm here.

582
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,120
I'm here.

583
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,120
I'm here.

584
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,320
I'm here.

585
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,320
I'm here.

586
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,320
I'm here.

587
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,220
I'm here.

588
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,620
You're in the house?

589
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,820
No one is allowed to go out tonight.

590
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,020
Do you know what will happen?

591
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,820
I have to leave tonight.

592
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,220
Master San needs me.

593
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,420
You have to be careful.

594
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,220
Let Zhang Qilin be more careful.

595
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,220
I have a stomachache.

596
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,020
I need to use the restroom.

597
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,220
Excuse me.

598
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,020
Come on.

599
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,020
Have a drink.

600
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,220
Miss.

601
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,620
Are you going out too?

602
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,620
You're a queen.

603
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,220
You can't leave.

604
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,620
It's too dangerous.

605
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,620
Be good.

606
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,620
Miss.

607
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,820
Mother.

608
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,420
It's snowing heavily in the mountains.

609
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,820
I thought you were smart.

610
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,020
Miss.

611
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:41,820
Miss.

612
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,020
Forget it, Master San.

613
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,220
I don't think he needs to worry about us.

614
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,220
He's a skilled person, right?

615
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,420
A man of the world is free.

616
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,220
A man of the world is free.

617
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:12,220
40 yuan minus 40 yuan.

618
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,020
You lost, right?

619
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,420
Today...

620
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,020
I'm telling you, don't show off.

621
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,020
Get out of the way.

622
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,220
You're so...

623
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:29,220
Don't show off like An Ning was hit by a car when she went out.

624
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,020
Okay?

625
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,620
She's good at it.

626
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,020
But An Ning saved us.

627
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,120
Just treat it as a favor.

628
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,320
Right.

629
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,320
And do you think An Ning is that good?

630
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,120
She has no experience in snow.

631
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,320
She's not familiar with the terrain.

632
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,320
She'll die in vain if she goes out.

633
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,520
I'm just a normal humanitarian.

634
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,720
I always feel she'll be in trouble.

635
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,120
I'm telling you, you'd better do this.

636
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,020
Don't go out if you're a human.

637
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:09,020
Don't do those things that will save you.

638
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:12,420
Don't forget we have a big deal to do.

639
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,220
Don't go out.

640
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,220
Do you hear me?

641
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,420
I know.

642
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,020
I'm going to sleep.

643
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:23,620
Little boy.

644
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,860
Let's play the game of

645
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,220
I'm tired.

646
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,420
Let him have a good rest.

647
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,620
He doesn't know how to play.

648
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,420
Why do you ask him?

649
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,320
He doesn't know how to play?

650
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,320
Forget it.

651
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,320
Let's sleep.

652
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,720
You lost.

653
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,520
Transfer the money.

654
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,720
No signal.

655
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,320
Transfer the money when you have signal.

656
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,720
When you have signal,

657
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,520
I'll have zero money.

658
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,320
I...

659
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,920
Closely to the probabilities.

660
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:27,820
Finally,ו

661
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,940
Finally,

662
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,940
I forgot to ask you before.

663
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,940
How do you distinguish between the animals on the mountain?

664
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:39,940
If we go up the mountain in winter, what should we pay attention to?

665
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,940
Look.

666
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,940
You should pay attention to the grass roots.

667
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,940
This is different from this.

668
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,940
And the footprints.

669
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,940
The distribution of the feces.

670
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,940
You should observe these carefully.

671
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,940
This is also different.

672
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,940
When you go up the mountain in winter, you should not walk fast.

673
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,940
You should be careful not to get hurt.

674
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:08,940
And you should mark the path.

675
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,940
Mark?

676
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:13,940
As long as the direction is correct, you will get something.

677
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,940
The path is marked.

678
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,940
The path is marked.

679
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,940
The path is marked.

680
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,940
The path is marked.

681
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,940
The path is marked.

682
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,940
The path is marked.

683
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,940
The path is marked.

684
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,940
The path is marked.

685
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,940
The path is marked.

686
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,940
The path is marked.

687
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,940
The path is marked.

688
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,940
The path is marked.

689
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,940
The path is marked.

690
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,940
The path is marked.

691
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,940
The path is marked.

692
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,940
The path is marked.

693
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,940
The path is marked.

694
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,940
What secrets do you have?

695
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,940
that allowed the Huo family to work with you.

696
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,940
I have a secret about Wu Sanxing.

697
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:16,940
Is this enough?

698
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:23,940
Okay, I'll do as you say.

699
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:41,940
Master Hua, coffee is not good for your health.

700
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,940
I'll change it for you. Let's drink tea later.

701
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,940
Master Hua, you're too hard.

702
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,940
You can't even take care of yourself.

703
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,940
You even helped Master San to wake up Wu San.

704
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,940
Jia Sha.

705
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:02,940
I can't help Wu Xie at this time. Who else can help him?

706
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,940
Don't worry. I can handle it.

707
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,940
Okay.

708
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,940
Master Hua, this...

709
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:20,940
Find out who is the one who is trying to provoke me.

710
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,940
Okay, I'll go right now.

711
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,940
Come on.

712
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,940
It's a monster!

713
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:07,940
It's getting closer and closer to us!

714
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,940
Run! Run! Run!

715
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,940
Come back! Come back!

716
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:19,940
Come back! Come back!

717
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,940
It's a monster!

718
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,940
It's a monster!

719
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,940
It's a monster!

720
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,940
It's a monster!

721
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,940
What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?

722
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,940
I'll beat you to death!

723
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,940
Sorry, I can't walk on my own anymore!

724
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,940
Please don't be angry! I'm sorry! I was wrong!

725
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,940
Don't run! Come back! Come back!

726
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,940
Come back!

727
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:12,940
Come back! Come back!

728
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,940
Come back!

729
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,940
Bury the body in the old place!

730
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,940
Yes!

731
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,940
Go and check the body.

732
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,940
Be careful not to leave any traces.

733
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,940
Yes!

734
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,940
Come back!

735
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,940
We can't stay here for long. Let's split up and leave.

736
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,940
Yes!

737
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,940
The dark corner is bustling, the wind and snow are heavy.

738
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,940
Where to go and where to go?

739
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:21,940
The mark of the past is cast in the hole.

740
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,640
The lonely

741
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,940
is left behind.

742
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,940
I chase the clouds and the wind.

743
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:38,940
I've been on my way, but I've forgotten how to reach the four seasons.

744
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:45,940
I've been through the night and the dark has given me answers.

745
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:52,940
The wind and snow of time hide the flowers blooming and blooming.

746
00:40:52,940 --> 00:41:02,940
The mark of the past is cast in the hole.

747
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,940
I chase the clouds and the wind.

748
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:15,940
I've been on my way, but I've forgotten how to reach the four seasons.

749
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:21,940
I've been through the night and the dark has given me answers.

750
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:29,940
The wind and snow of time hide the flowers blooming and blooming.

751
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,940
The mark of the past is cast in the hole.

752
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:39,940
The wind and snow of time hide the flowers blooming and blooming.

753
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:48,940
The mark of the past is cast in the hole.

754
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:12,940
The wind and snow of time hide the flowers blooming and blooming.
