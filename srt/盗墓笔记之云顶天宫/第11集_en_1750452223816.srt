1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm not sure.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not sure.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm not sure.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm not sure.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not sure.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm not sure.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not sure.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm not sure.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm not sure.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm not sure.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm not sure.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm not sure.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not sure.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm not sure.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 8

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Day 9

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I just received a message.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We have a group of goods. The way is the route to Jie Zeng.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Is there any problem with Lu Xian?

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
No.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It seems that the spy is under the bridge.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We're looking for the Huo family.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What do you mean?

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What's wrong?

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What do you think is wrong?

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Lu Xian has a problem.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
We're partners now.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
If there's any problem, don't hide it from me.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We can solve it together.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Of course, partners.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
If Lu Xian has a problem,

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
you can't know it.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Don't worry. It's okay.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Lu Xian.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Master.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Come.

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Boss Ji, we have to hurry.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's dark.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's hard to walk in the dark.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We can't take a walk here.

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We have to find a flat place.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's possible to get wind on the mountain.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Master, what do you think?

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The treasure is under the bridge.

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But I can't go down.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Wait a minute.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You go down first.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
See what's underneath.

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Then you can make a plan.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
No.

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's been snowing for thousands of years.

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's been snowing for a long time.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's ice.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's frozen and formed ice.

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Ice is like a mud.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We can't get into the mountain.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Do you think the treasure is frozen?

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I think it's possible.

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But we can't get into the mountain.

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Even if there's something down there,

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
we can't find it.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But the snow is too heavy.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
We don't have any medicine.

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I have friends in the county.

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
They are going to the snow mountain.

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
As long as there's a bubble,

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
the snow can be covered.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's possible to save.

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
They seem to be using the air bubbles.

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
As long as the snow is cleared,

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
it's easy to find what's underneath.

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Boss Ji.

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Boss Ji.

81
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
We really have medicine.

82
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
We really do.

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yes.

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Where do we get it?

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Here?

86
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Look up there.

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Here.

88
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Here.

89
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You can put the bubble.

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
There's a bubble.

91
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We can buy it.

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
We can kill it.

93
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The Changmei people are very touristy.

94
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
They also know how to clear the snow.

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't think it's a big problem.

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
If we don't clear the snow,

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
we can go back in the morning.

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
If we want to hide something in the snow,

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
it's a big problem.

100
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The land of the mountain is in the mountainous mountain.

101
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's not a good idea.

102
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You know what?

103
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Even if the old man clears the snow,

104
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and doesn't clear the snow,

105
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
the fight won't continue.

106
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So it's like what I said.

107
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We must tear the two sides.

108
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's a mess.

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
No.

110
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I don't agree.

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The risk of the bubble is too big.

112
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
If I say it,

113
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'd rather spend more time using the shovel.

114
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
No.

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
When will we have to use the shovel?

116
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You two don't have to be so silent.

117
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
We are experts in this matter.

118
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Old Fang, please show us your skills.

119
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I think the way of the fat man is good.

120
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Actually, I've thought about it before.

121
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We'll meet similar situations.

122
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So I've prepared.

123
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I tell you.

124
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
With my professional level,

125
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I can control the power of the explosives.

126
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And I promise

127
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
the sound won't be too loud.

128
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Sometimes,

129
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
there's a very small vibration

130
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
under the ice layer.

131
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
That's the goal.

132
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Old Fang,

133
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
you're like a fish

134
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
playing bubbles in the tofu.

135
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If you want to blow an animal in the tofu,

136
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
you can't see it on the surface.

137
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
This is a surprise.

138
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
When I was in the mine,

139
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I didn't have more than 10,000 bubbles.

140
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I think it's not difficult for me.

141
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Wu Xie,

142
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm telling you.

143
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You can't tell, right?

144
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Although our Lang Feng

145
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
is usually very good at speaking,

146
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
he started to play bubbles

147
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
when he was 14.

148
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
He put in 20 years.

149
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Within 20 years,

150
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
he got 10,000 bubbles.

151
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And then,

152
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
he got the honor

153
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
of being the master of our company

154
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
for only one year.

155
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
He got the nickname

156
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
of a god

157
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
in just one year.

158
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You're the one who made the name of a god.

159
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You're very famous.

160
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
No, no, no.

161
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What kind of god is a god?

162
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's just that the people in the night

163
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
are just playing bubbles.

164
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
They're just giving him a nickname.

165
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Fatty,

166
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
do you know where the god is?

167
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I don't know.

168
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
God.

169
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
This... this is it.

170
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Jiayou.

171
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Jiayou.

172
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
XiaETian.

173
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What bodywork does he use?

174
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Is it OK?

175
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The type he uses

176
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I think it's okay.

177
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Boss, you can't fight.

178
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
This will bleed.

179
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
This will really bleed.

180
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Boss, don't...

181
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Come back.

182
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
How did you hit him?

183
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I didn't expect that we were so miserable.

184
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
How do we deal with this?

185
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You don't have to worry. You did your job.

186
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We can use this when he goes back.

187
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
If it doesn't work, bring him to the tombstone.

188
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Thank him for everything.

189
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's okay. He's very good at fighting.

190
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
He's just dizzy and not dead.

191
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Don't worry.

192
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Everyone, back to the tombstone.

193
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Go to the back of the stone.

194
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm going.

195
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Boss, come on.

196
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm done.

197
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm done?

198
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
There's nothing wrong with it.

199
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It really is a deep wound.

200
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's amazing.

201
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Dong'er.

202
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Dong'er.

203
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Dong'er.

204
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Dong'er.

205
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Dong'er.

206
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Dong'er.

207
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Dong'er.

208
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Dong'er.

209
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Dong'er.

210
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Dong'er.

211
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Dong'er.

212
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Dong'er.

213
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Don't panic.

214
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Everyone, don't talk.

215
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Don't panic.

216
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The blood on it is very thin.

217
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Even if it's a snow storm,

218
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
it's a small area.

219
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Don't worry.

220
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
As long as it's not washed by the snow,

221
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
it's fine.

222
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Try not to talk.

223
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Don't talk.

224
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
No way. I've already calculated the amount.

225
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm done.

226
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm done.

227
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Fatty.

228
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Be careful.

229
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm done.

230
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
No.

231
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
No.

232
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
No.

233
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Tianzhen.

234
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
No.

235
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
No.

236
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
The snow storm is coming.

237
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Everyone, retreat.

238
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Hurry.

239
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Hurry.

240
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Hurry.

241
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Hurry.

242
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Hurry.

243
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Hurry.

244
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Hurry.

245
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The snow storm.

246
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Come on in.

247
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Hurry.

248
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The snow is coming.

249
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Hurry.

250
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Hurry.

251
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Are you okay?

252
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I...

253
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I...

254
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
What?

255
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I...

256
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Okay.

257
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Don't talk.

258
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Don't talk.

259
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Rest.

260
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Let me tell you.

261
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
We're really lucky.

262
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's just a small part of the tunnel.

263
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
The snow is thin.

264
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Or else, we'll have to play.

265
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm sorry.

268
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm sorry.

269
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm sorry.

270
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm sorry.

271
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm sorry.

272
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm sorry.

273
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I...

274
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Oh, my god.

275
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Look, she's awake.

276
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You are lucky.

277
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You don't know anything.

278
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Then, you'll be in trouble.

279
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And someone else is counting on you.

280
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm telling you.

281
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You don't have to buy a ticket from the mountains.

282
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You little brat.

283
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Stop it.

284
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You want to kill us all?

285
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You...

286
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You...

287
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You...

288
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You...

289
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You're not alone.

290
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You're here.

291
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Who are you looking for?

292
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
No.

293
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Pan Zi.

294
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Pan Zi?

295
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
No.

296
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
She won't...

297
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
She won't be killed by the snow, right?

298
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
No way.

299
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Pan Zi is so strong.

300
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
She'll...

301
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
She'll be gone.

302
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I don't think so.

303
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
What?

304
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
After you're safe,

305
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Pan Zi will be gone too.

306
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Why?

307
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Why didn't you teach her?

308
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Why did you teach her?

309
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Why did she stop him?

310
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
She didn't have a reason to stop him.

311
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
She's been here all the way.

312
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Why did she leave

313
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
when she arrived?

314
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Maybe she wants to give San Shu a letter.

315
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
San Shu.

316
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
After that,

317
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I thought about it.

318
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I think

319
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
this piece

320
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
has been updated again.

321
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Tianzhen.

322
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Look at the sun shining on the snow.

323
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
We're going to light the snow mountain.

324
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Pan Zi.

325
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Do you think

326
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
we know

327
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
the scene we're seeing now?

328
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
No.

329
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
What's wrong?

330
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Tianzhen.

331
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Pan Zi.

332
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Do you remember?

333
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
We saw a mural.

334
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
That's how it looks.

335
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The mural of the sea.

336
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
The mural of the sea.

337
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Yes.

338
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Brother.

339
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You should remember it too.

340
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Brother.

341
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What are you talking about?

342
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
What mural of the sea?

343
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Tell us.

344
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Chang Hua said

345
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
we had a hole in it

346
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
before.

347
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
There's a wall inside.

348
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
We can't go through it.

349
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
We can't go through it.

350
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
We had a hole before.

351
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
There's a mural inside.

352
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
The picture on it

353
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
and the scene we're seeing now

354
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
are almost the same.

355
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
The only difference is

356
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
the red color in the picture

357
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
is fire.

358
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I was confused at that time.

359
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What could be

360
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
the whole Changbai Mountain?

361
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
But now I know

362
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
the red color in the picture

363
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
is the sunset.

364
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You're talking about it

365
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
more and more.

366
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Really?

367
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
The place where the sunset is

368
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
is where the sky is.

369
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The four haggos are analyzing it.

370
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
The treasure

371
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
is indeed at the bottom of our feet.

372
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
But we have to

373
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
think of other ways to get in.

374
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
No, Tianzhen.

375
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I think for our safety,

376
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
we should go back

377
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
and prepare for the next one.

378
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
We're on the way.

379
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It's so hard to get here.

380
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
If we get to the house now,

381
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
we'll be in trouble.

382
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm not willing to go in.

383
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm not willing to go in.

384
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
We can't go in

385
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
because we have other ways to get in.

386
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
But seeing the snow mountain...

387
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Let's try again.

388
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Try again?

389
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Mr. Si,

390
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
are you sure?

391
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
This time,

392
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
you must make sure

393
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
the amount of the medicine

394
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
is correct.

395
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
If there's any further trouble,

396
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
don't go back.

397
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
The amount of the medicine

398
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I used last time

399
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
is indeed a bit too much.

400
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I've already reduced the amount of the medicine.

401
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And I've increased the amount.

402
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
According to the angle of the slope,

403
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I've lowered six haggos.

404
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Six haggos

405
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
are about one meter deep.

406
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I think we should open

407
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
a four meter hole.

408
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'll go in.

409
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Everyone, back up and hide.

410
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Make sure your position is fixed.

411
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Mr. Si.

412
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Mr. Si.

413
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Mr. Si.

414
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Oh my god.

415
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
There must be five or six meters behind.

416
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
What's inside?

417
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
A few tens of thousands of years ago,

418
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
the location of the mountain

419
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
or the place where the mountain was located

420
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
was still a piece of a piece of a piece.

421
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It was because the main mountain was

422
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
spread out from the sea.

423
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
You said there was

424
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
such a big thing down there.

425
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Could it be

426
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
the body of the former Haisheng House?

427
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
No, right?

428
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
The mountain was already there

429
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
before the ice was formed.

430
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
If it were animal bodies,

431
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
it would have been a dead end.

432
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Could it be

433
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
the Kunlun Mountain?

434
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
What is Kunlun Mountain?

435
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It's a mountain.

436
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It's good.

437
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Kunlun Mountain is a natural

438
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
and unique city.

439
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It's at the end of the Longmai River.

440
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It's the place

441
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
where the world's spirit is located.

442
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Usually, it's a place

443
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
where rocks, ice-drawer

444
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
and trees are formed.

445
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It's a place

446
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
where the same kind of things are formed.

447
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
This thing is called

448
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
the Earth-like platform.

449
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
But there are still

450
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
no evidence of it.

451
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It sounds like a school gate.

452
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
But it looks like

453
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
it doesn't look like a human.

454
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Kunlun Mountain is a natural and unique city.

455
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Isn't it human?

456
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
If you say so,

457
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
if it's Kunlun Mountain,

458
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
then the spirit

459
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
must be down here.

460
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Don't say that.

461
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Let's go down.

462
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
No.

463
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
If it's really the natural

464
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
and unique city,

465
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
then how could it be

466
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
just a funeral?

467
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Then the real

468
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Cloud Sky Palace

469
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
and the Three Holy Mountains

470
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
are all over the place.

471
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It's not worse

472
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
than the Cloud Sky Palace.

473
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
No.

474
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I don't think

475
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
we should think so.

476
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
If the Cloud Sky Palace is fake,

477
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
it's designed

478
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
and built by humans.

479
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
It's a kind of

480
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
symbolic technique.

481
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
They deliberately

482
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
made the funeral

483
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
into a form of a ghost.

484
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
What we see now

485
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
is the shadow of the funeral.

486
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I'm the one who made it.

487
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
In my opinion,

488
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
it's no better than

489
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
the Cloud Sky Palace.

490
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
But the Cloud Sky Palace

491
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
is here.

492
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
It must be a problem.

493
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Could it be

494
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
that it changed the way

495
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
the Three Holy Mountains are?

496
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Master,

497
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I think we should open

498
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
the entrance.

499
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Let's not be so formal.

500
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Let's just go down.

501
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Fatty.

502
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I'll praise you this time.

503
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Wait a minute.

504
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
If we go down,

505
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
what we see

506
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
is not the funeral,

507
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
but the real

508
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Cloud Sky Palace.

509
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
If it's the real Cloud Sky Palace,

510
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
it's the miracle of Heaven.

511
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
It's worth going down to see.

512
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
What's the matter?

513
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
What's the matter?

514
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
It doesn't matter

515
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
what the Cloud Sky Palace is.

516
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
At least it's complete now.

517
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
It means that

518
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
there's no corruption.

519
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Look at the distance.

520
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
It seems to be

521
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
a huge pillar.

522
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
If I'm not mistaken,

523
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
it should be

524
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
used to support

525
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
the ice roof

526
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
at the bottom of our feet.

527
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
The ice wall

528
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
should not be

529
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
directly pressed on the building.

530
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
If it's directly pressed on the building,

531
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
it will collapse.

532
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
The building will be destroyed.

533
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
So the ice wall

534
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
has to have a groove.

535
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
This groove

536
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
will form a natural ice ball

537
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
on top of this slope,

538
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
protecting the building below.

539
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Just like

540
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
the roof,

541
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
the roof,

542
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
the roof,

543
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
this is the ice.

544
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
So I think

545
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
the distance

546
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
that goes down

547
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
from the pillar

548
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
will be

549
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
the place where the building is.

550
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Fatty,

551
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I really look

552
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
like a widow to you.

553
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
No, no, no.

554
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Indeed.

555
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Fatty said it's possible.

556
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Let's try it.

557
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Did you find it?

558
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Yes, sir.

559
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
The night-colored bar in the west.

560
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
How long?

561
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
About eight to nine minutes.

562
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Faster.

563
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Come on, Cheng Zhi.

564
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Okay.

565
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
When will you get the goods?

566
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I'm telling you,

567
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
the goods are very...

568
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Really?

569
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Really?

570
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I can lie to you.

571
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Is it reliable?

572
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
It is reliable.

573
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I'm not sure.

574
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I'm not sure.

575
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I'm not sure.

576
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I'm not sure.

577
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I'm not sure.

578
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I'm not sure.

579
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Let's go.

580
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Let's go.

581
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
�..!

582
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Hyper Mosquito

583
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
3

584
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
5

585
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:54,000
10

586
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
We now face us with the biggest problem.

587
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
It's the position where we're on is

588
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
the stage of the Round AU!

589
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
From here to below

590
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
every 500 meters.

591
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
and more than 20 meters of distance.

592
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Although the length of our living room is enough,

593
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
we can't cross the last 20 meters.

594
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Can't Xiao Ge do it?

595
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Xiao Ge can't counter the law of the room.

596
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Really?

597
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You're really a bunch of trash.

598
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Brother Sa, aren't we too excited?

599
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
We've never seen such a big city.

600
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
You always have experience.

601
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
How do you think we should do this?

602
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
We can't leave the house.

603
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
We should be careful.

604
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
How about this?

605
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
We'll go down first.

606
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
We'll go down to the wooden pillar of the ice ball.

607
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Then we'll go up the mountain.

608
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Then we'll use the rope to go down to the roof of the building.

609
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Master, you have a way.

610
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Tian Zhen, are you okay?

611
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Every wooden pillar below has more than 100 meters of distance.

612
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
This is not the length of a wood.

613
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Instead, we use a wooden rope to form a few wooden pillars.

614
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
This structure is not a problem of the weight of the building.

615
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
The key is whether the building can withstand the weight of the building.

616
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
If something happens,

617
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
a wooden pillar will hit other wooden pillars.

618
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
It will cause the entire ice ball to fall.

619
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
This is too risky.

620
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
It's too risky.

621
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I've calculated it before I came.

622
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I've calculated it for you.

623
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
This is our lucky high-ranking, red-haired leader.

624
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
We'll be happy if we succeed.

625
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
No problem.

626
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Keep pushing.

627
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
The wind is not strong enough.

628
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Wu Xie, do you have any other way?

629
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I'll do it.

630
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Little brother.

631
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
See?

632
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
We still have to be little brothers.

633
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Right?

634
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I'll make a hole in the wall.

635
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I'll make a hole in the wall.

636
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I'll make a hole in the wall.

637
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I'll make a hole in the wall.

638
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I'll make a hole in the wall.

639
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I'll make a hole in the wall.

640
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I'll make a hole in the wall.

641
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I'll make a hole in the wall.

642
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I'll make a hole in the wall.

643
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I'll make a hole in the wall.

644
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I'll make a hole in the wall.

645
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I'll make a hole in the wall.

646
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I'll make a hole in the wall.

647
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I'll make a hole in the wall.

648
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I'll make a hole in the wall.

649
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I'll make a hole in the wall.

650
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I'll make a hole in the wall.

651
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I'll make a hole in the wall.

652
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I'll make a hole in the wall.

653
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I'll make a hole in the wall.

654
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I'll make a hole in the wall.

655
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I'll make a hole in the wall.

656
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I'll make a hole in the wall.

657
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I'll make a hole in the wall.

658
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I'll make a hole in the wall.

659
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I'll make a hole in the wall.

660
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I'll make a hole in the wall.

661
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I'll make a hole in the wall.

662
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I'll make a hole in the wall.

663
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000

I'll make a hole in the wall.

681
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I just need to catch my buddy.

682
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Be careful, there's someone on the top.

683
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Let's go.

684
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
What are you doing, girl?

685
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
It's late. What do you mean?

686
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Sorry, I just came out.

687
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I didn't know you were here.

688
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I'm sorry.

689
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I'm sorry.

690
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I'm sorry.

691
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I'm sorry.

692
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I'm sorry.

693
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I'm sorry.

694
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I'm sorry.

695
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I'm sorry.

696
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I'm sorry.

697
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I didn't know you.

698
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Girl, you don't look well.

699
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
No.

700
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I just came out and saw you guys staring at me.

701
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
What did you hear just now?

702
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I didn't hear anything.

703
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I didn't hear anything.

704
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Don't take my bag.

705
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Hello.

706
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Have you seen this girl?

707
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Look carefully.

708
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Have you seen her?

709
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
No.

710
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Stop!

711
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Where?

712
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Over there.

713
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Over there.

714
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I'm sorry.

715
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I'm sorry.

716
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I'm sorry.

717
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I'm sorry.

718
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I'm sorry.

719
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I'm sorry.

720
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I'm sorry.

721
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I'm sorry.

722
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I'm sorry.

723
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I'm sorry.

724
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I'm sorry.

725
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I'm sorry.

726
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I'm sorry.

727
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I'm sorry.

728
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I'm sorry.

729
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I'm sorry.

730
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I'm sorry.

731
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I'm sorry.

732
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I'm sorry.

733
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I'm sorry.

734
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I'm sorry.

735
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I'm sorry.

736
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I'm sorry.

737
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I'm sorry.

738
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I'm sorry.

739
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I'm sorry.

740
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I'm sorry.

741
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I'm sorry.

742
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I'm sorry.

743
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I'm sorry.

744
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Please stop.

745
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Please stop.

746
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Please stop.

747
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Don't take my bag.

748
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I'm sorry.

749
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I'm sorry.

750
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I'm sorry.

751
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I'm sorry.

752
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one.

753
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one.

754
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

755
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

756
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

757
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I'm not sure if they could find the third one.

758
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Probably a mid Boston player.

759
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
They can't because they're in the new Ref corrupt.

760
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Or maybe the camp didn't like the 2000.

761
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
What's this?

762
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
It's nothing good.

763
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
It looks like a Tongjin style.

764
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
And the appearance of the Lin Palace.

765
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
It's very obvious that it's a Han people style.

766
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Don't forget.

767
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
This is the Pei Zang Ling of the East and the West.

768
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
The Pei Zang Ling of the East and the West is actually a Han people style.

769
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
This means that this is the handkerchief of Wang Zang Hai.

770
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
No matter where he goes to report to the city,

771
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
he will never escape his own nation and era.

772
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
The Pei Zang Ling of the East and the West is a Han people style.

773
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
The Pei Zang Ling of the West is actually a Han people style.

774
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
The Pei Zang Ling of the East and the West is actually a Han people style.

775
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
The Pei Zang Ling of the West is actually a Han people style.

776
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
The Pei Zang Ling of the East and the West is actually a Han people style.

777
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
The Pei Zang Ling of the East and the West is actually a Han people style.

778
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
The Pei Zang Ling of the East and the West is actually a Han people style.

779
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
The Pei Zang Ling of the East and the West is actually a Han people style.

780
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
The Pei Zang Ling of the East and the West is actually a Han people style.

781
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Thank you.

782
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
There are many kind of cast Jorge elsewhere

783
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
that built thisira ere so mysterious.

784
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Let's go have a look around.

785
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,120
Warriors

786
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:11,800
Open the door

787
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,080
FatzzInner, here he comes

788
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,360
Fatzz in

789
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,720
Please keep safe

790
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,280
Don't worry

791
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I'll kill you.

792
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
There's a chance!

793
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
There's a chance!

794
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Don't be afraid.

795
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
That's the defense team behind the door.

796
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
They've moved into the grave.

797
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Then we'll just wait for them to leave.

798
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Did you find out that the bottom is even colder than the snow mountain?

799
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Yun Ling's ability to open the door is not that good.

800
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Once the snow is gone, the enemy will be able to shoot at us.

801
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Our equipment will be able to survive.

802
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
We'll have to retreat.

803
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
The door is not even a bit of a shame.

804
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Wait a minute.

805
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Wait a minute.

806
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Forget it.

807
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
No.

808
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Brother.

809
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
You'd better come and see if there's any mechanism.

810
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Don't say that.

811
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
You two go after me.

812
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Don't talk.

813
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I'm sure Tian Zhen'er and I will follow you.

814
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:38,760
The

815
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Sago!

816
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Come.

风雪万重

820
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
何去何走

821
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
穿越千年的

822
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
迎记头上

823
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
在痛苦

824
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
寂寞的存在

825
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
追着云追着风

826
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
又轻忘了自己怎么抵达

827
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
穿过眼

828
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
穿过无比的在黑暗中

心穿逼着

832
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
深海灿烂的花

00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
归指的指向

834
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
吹放

835
