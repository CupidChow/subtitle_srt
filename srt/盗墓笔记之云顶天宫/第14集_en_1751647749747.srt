1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The End

2
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We were too petty.

3
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
He spent so much effort to set up this trap.

4
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
After we burn this, we can almost get out.

5
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You know everything but asking me?

6
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
How can I...

7
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
How do you know?

8
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
How can you be so...

9
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm sorry, Lang Feng.

10
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm not that kind of person.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's still early to decide whether we can get out.

13
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
No matter what, we need to confirm one more time.

14
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
There is nothing else here except the stone turtle that can interfere with the signal.

15
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Otherwise, we will be the same.

16
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I used to raise ghosts when I was a kid.

17
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But today, I hate this animal.

18
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I heard that your people want to use Xie's house to transport the famous weapons that they received from China.

19
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Is that true?

20
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
How long ago was that?

21
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Our team is currently working on the project of the Cloud Sky Palace.

22
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What you said is impossible.

23
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But that person has the logo and weapons of your company.

24
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
No.

25
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You don't think that we are in a partnership?

26
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Why do I have to be so bold and hit the gun?

27
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I suspect that the Huo family designed it.

28
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Or it's just that Qiu De Kao is a ghost.

29
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You want me to be blamed.

30
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You are so stubborn.

31
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Qiu De Kao and you are in a partnership.

32
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
His eyes will not be so united.

33
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That's right.

34
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
We are now with An Ning's team.

35
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But Qiu De Kao wants to get rid of us.

36
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's not the first time.

37
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
This time too.

38
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That's weird.

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
As far as I know,

40
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Qiu De Kao and your company have a partnership.

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It was established before the liberation.

42
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
How did the good relationship between you and your company suddenly break up?

43
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Is it because of your company?

44
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
According to the company's record,

45
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
the cooperation with Qiu De Kao has been very smooth.

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
We have worked together on many big projects.

47
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But in recent years,

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Qiu De Kao has started to intentionally reduce the cooperation of projects.

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Even on some long-term projects,

50
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
hiding the information that should be shared.

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Especially now.

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
He has started to ignore the company's warning.

53
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He plans to swallow the project.

54
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What does this partnership mean?

55
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Of course.

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I have already guessed a few.

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
West Coast Sea Wood.

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Guizhou Fog Village.

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And this Cloud Sky Palace.

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I have read the information you sent me.

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I found something interesting.

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
At that time, Qiu De Kao secretly sent people to join the archaeological team.

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And you also sent people inside.

64
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The two sides secretly fought.

65
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The two sides secretly fought.

66
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It caused a lot of trouble for the archaeological team.

67
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I think,

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
even the last missing of the archaeological team,

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
is because you can't escape from the relationship.

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't know much about this.

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
After all, at that time,

72
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I haven't entered the company.

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But I think I know what you want to ask.

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The death of Xie Lian Huan has nothing to do with us.

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Of course, this is indeed a doubt.

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I think the most clear thing about this,

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
is that it's not just Wu San Xing, but also Qiu De Kao.

78
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
According to the information I received,

79
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Wu Xie has entered the funeral of the Cloud Sky Palace.

80
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And Wu San Xing,

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm afraid he's a step ahead of him.

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Qiu De Kao is already on his way.

83
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I think the answer you want to know,

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
maybe you can find it in this mountain.

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I want this answer.

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What do you want to exchange it for?

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The black pot is already on my head.

88
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I think Huo Jia and Qiu De Kao won't let me go easily.

89
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I hope you can teach them a lesson.

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Exchange them for them.

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Let them stop in time.

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
By the way,

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
find out who is framing me.

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Okay, I want this answer.

95
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Jiansen,

96
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
is it reliable to hand this matter to Xie Yuhua?

97
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Do we have any other way?

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Maybe the company...

99
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
No need for you to say. We can handle it.

100
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Ever since we were sent to China,

101
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
all the things we encountered,

102
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
were all a bit of a mistake.

103
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The company won't waste its energy on useless people.

104
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But we have been suffering from the loss of our people.

105
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Now,

106
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
we can only rely on Xie Yuhua.

107
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This is very bad for us.

108
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Everything outside is not important.

109
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
As long as we can find the secret of Cloud Sky Palace,

110
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
victory is ours.

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
There are more people in Aning's team than us.

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Don't worry.

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
According to the news from Langfeng,

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
there is a chance for them to get the source.

115
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Sir.

116
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Ning, what's the status?

117
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Jason joined Xie Yuchen.

118
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
There seems to be a more eerie system.

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
They plan to exhaust our...

120
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Sir, are you okay?

121
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You know I have to manage my businesses.

122
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And I don't have enough energy to take care of many projects at the same time.

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
How are you, sir?

124
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What did the doctor say?

125
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Ning, I don't have much time now.

126
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I trust you will handle Jason by yourself.

127
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
At the moment, Wu Xie's safety is your top priority.

128
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Wait for my order.

129
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
After you get to the palace,

130
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
you will get rid of Jason.

131
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Even if someone tells you the palace is fake,

132
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
just pretend you believe them.

133
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Okay.

134
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And then, stay there and wait for me.

135
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Okay.

136
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's so hot.

137
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
This damn turtle is useful.

138
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
How is it?

139
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Done.

140
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Tong, tong, tong, tong, tong, tong.

141
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Sir.

142
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Sir.

143
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Sir.

144
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Sir.

145
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Sir.

146
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Sir, wait for me.

147
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Sir.

148
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Sir.

149
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Sir, where are you going?

150
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Sir, why are you acting strange?

151
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
What do you want to say to me?

152
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Sir, have you always had good eyes?

153
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Sir.

154
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Sir.

155
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Stop it.

156
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Fatty.

157
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You don't dig the good stuff for nothing.

158
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
If you dig it, it will be stolen by foreigners.

159
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's better to go to the water and get the moon first.

160
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You are hiding something from me.

161
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What did I say?

162
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Don't you know?

163
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Tell me the truth.

164
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I won't blame you.

165
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
What did you say?

166
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I said you are not good-looking.

167
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You are hiding too much from me.

168
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I am disappointed in you.

169
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Come back.

170
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Come back.

171
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Your phone keeps ringing.

172
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Don't you want to see it?

173
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Come back.

174
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Hello.

175
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Mr. Wang.

176
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Why is there no signal in the communication device?

177
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Where are you now?

178
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Didn't I say I don't want you to call me?

179
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I have to know if I have money.

180
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Now, Tianzhen has found out.

181
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Did you do it on purpose?

182
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You know Tianzhen will find out, right?

183
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You should have thought about it when you took the money.

184
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Why are you blaming me now?

185
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Mr. Wang, we have a contract.

186
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You can't go back on your word.

187
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I tell you.

188
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Get out of here.

189
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
How much did you hear?

190
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I didn't hear anything.

191
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Where are they?

192
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Why is there no one?

193
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
No one.

194
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I don't know.

195
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Why is the ghost still here?

196
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Can we stay here forever?

197
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Mr. Wang, I'll blow it up.

198
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
No, no.

199
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's too dangerous.

200
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I can't do it.

201
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I can't do it.

202
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I can't do it.

203
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I can't do it.

204
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I can't do it.

205
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I can't do it.

206
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I can't do it.

207
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I can't do it.

208
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I can't do it.

209
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
No, no.

210
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's too dangerous.

211
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's too dangerous.

212
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Trust me. I'm sure.

213
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Run.

214
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Run.

215
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
How can it be so familiar?

216
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Of course.

217
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
This is the love poem on the map.

218
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm sorry.

219
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm sorry.

220
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm sorry.

221
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Grandpa Si.

222
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Grandpa Si.

223
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Grandpa Si.

224
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Is that you, Grandpa Si?

225
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Grandpa Si.

226
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Grandpa Si.

227
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Grandpa Si.

228
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Who are you?

229
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You...

230
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Why are you Uncle Si?

231
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Yes.

232
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm your uncle.

233
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
What's wrong?

234
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Uncle Si, you...

235
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Where did you get this dress?

236
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I wore it.

237
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm sorry.

238
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Thief.

239
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm your uncle.

240
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'm your uncle.

241
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Look at me.

242
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm your uncle.

243
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm your uncle.

244
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Kid, wake up.

245
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Wu Xie, I'm your uncle.

246
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Nephew.

247
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Nephew.

248
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Wake up.

249
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Wake up.

250
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Nephew.

251
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Wake up.

252
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Get up, you guys.

253
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Get up.

254
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Get up.

255
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Get up.

256
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Fatty, stop playing.

257
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Chong Xiang Yu is here.

258
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
This meat is not enough to feed him.

259
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
This is...

260
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
This is...

261
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Don't talk. Listen carefully.

262
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm so pissed off.

263
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
The stone ghost wants to kill us.

264
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Hurry up.

265
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Go.

266
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Go.

267
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Brother.

268
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Where is brother?

269
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Hurry up.

270
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
This way.

271
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
This way.

272
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
This way.

273
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
This way.

274
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
This way.

275
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
This way.

276
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
This way.

277
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
This way.

278
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
No, no.

279
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
We're not that far from here.

280
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Why don't we run away?

281
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Brother.

282
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Fatty.

283
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Fatty.

284
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Fatty.

285
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Fatty.

286
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Let's go.

287
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
This way.

288
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Third Uncle.

289
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Third Uncle.

290
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Third Uncle.

291
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
You ran away when you saw me.

292
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
What do you mean?

293
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
This place is safe.

294
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
What do you mean by asking you to come in?

295
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
You tricked me into coming here.

296
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And then you played with me.

297
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Now you care about me.

298
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Chong Xiang Yu is very powerful.

299
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Listen.

300
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
You just remember to run away with Third Uncle.

301
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Chong Xiang Yu?

302
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
What?

303
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Tell me.

304
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
You don't know Chong Xiang Yu?

305
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It's a snake-like thing.

306
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It's the size of a nail.

307
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
It can attract insects within 10 meters.

308
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It's the first time I met Third Uncle.

309
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
After that thing is heated,

310
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
it's three times more powerful.

311
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Why did you kill him?

312
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You should have told me earlier.

313
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You're not done yet.

314
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Listen.

315
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
That porcelain can make you unconscious.

316
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
It can kill you.

317
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It can turn you into a moron.

318
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
The porcelain of this turtle

319
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
must be completely burnt to make it disappear.

320
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
No wonder it was in the tunnel.

321
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
How did we get it wrong?

322
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Third Uncle.

323
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Third Uncle.

324
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Can you stop talking?

325
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Can you talk to me?

326
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Can you tell me your plan

327
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
even just once?

328
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Don't make us

329
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
like the flies here every time.

330
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Okay?

331
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Little Third Master.

332
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Don't be angry.

333
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I can't be angry.

334
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You can.

335
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I can.

336
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I can.

337
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Third Uncle.

338
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
How much do you know

339
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
about Cloud Sky Palace?

340
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Do you know that Jason and his men

341
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
have arrived?

342
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I know that Ning has brought people here.

343
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
You know a lot.

344
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Can you share

345
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
some information with your nephew?

346
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Nephew?

347
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Everyone has secrets, right?

348
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Look at me.

349
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I'm afraid you'll hate me

350
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
for asking questions.

351
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Third Uncle.

352
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
You're helping Qiu De Kao?

353
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Or Jason?

354
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Or you're helping whoever

355
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
gives you more money?

356
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Hey, kid.

357
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You're right.

358
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Sometimes, whoever gives me more money,

359
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I'll help whoever...

360
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Turn off the power. Turn off the headlight.

361
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Hurry up.

362
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Hurry up.

363
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
What?

364
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
What's going on?

365
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Where are all the bullets? Third Master.

366
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Chong Xiang Yun brought them here.

367
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
You should save your own lives.

368
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
What?

369
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Go.

370
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Those who want to wear it, go ahead.

371
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Run, Fourth Master.

372
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Hurry up.

373
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Hurry up.

374
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Hurry up.

375
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Okay, okay.

376
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You only have Fourth Master.

377
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I don't care.

378
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
If I don't help him, no one will.

379
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Look.

380
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Hey.

381
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Lang Feng.

382
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It's me. Fourth Grandpa is here too.

383
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Fourth Grandpa, you've pissed me off.

384
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I...I'm sorry.

385
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
You're the one who followed

386
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
the one who followed the Fourth Grandpa?

387
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Yes. My name is Lang Feng.

388
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It's great to see you.

389
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Why are you alone?

390
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Where are the others?

391
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
They all left.

392
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I was just running around alone.

393
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
But I felt something was wrong.

394
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
From the hall to the back hall,

395
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
it's about 500 meters away.

396
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
But I ran for about ten minutes.

397
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I didn't get there yet.

398
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Then I found that the others were gone.

399
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I found a direction.

400
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And I came here.

401
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
We're the same.

402
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
What kind of trap or mechanism are we in?

403
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Did you touch a bug?

404
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
A bug? What kind of bug?

405
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It's a wall.

406
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
It's a secret.

407
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
It's like a rainstorm.

408
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Wu Xie, I'm begging you.

409
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Don't say that.

410
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I'm most afraid of this.

411
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
What should we do now?

412
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Listen to me.

413
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I can't carry on.

414
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Move forward.

415
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Come with me.

416
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
What's wrong?

417
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Uncle San Xing,

418
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
don't you think Lang Feng is strange?

419
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
What's wrong?

420
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I just feel that he's

421
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
sending messages to someone.

422
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Can you be sure?

423
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I can.

424
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I'm really impressed with you.

425
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Can I call you Uncle San Xing?

426
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Why didn't you say it earlier?

427
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
When did you hear that?

428
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I didn't catch him.

429
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
He's from the Four Seasons Palace.

430
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
What if he's wrong?

431
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Now is the time.

432
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Life and death are in the four sides of the same coin.

433
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
You're still so stubborn.

434
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
What are you learning?

435
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Are you learning from Maria?

436
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Pan Zi.

437
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Pan Zi.

438
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Let's go.

439
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Let go of me.

440
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Let go of me.

441
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Search.

442
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Don't touch me.

443
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Let go of me.

444
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Let me go!

445
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Let me go!

446
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Grandpa Si!

447
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
What's going on with Grandpa Si?

448
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Grandpa Si!

449
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Uncle Zhen.

450
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
You bastard!

451
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
You bastard!

452
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
You bastard!

453
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
You bastard!

454
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
You bastard!

455
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Grandpa Si.

456
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
He's your soldier.

457
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I can't fight him.

458
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
You do it.

459
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Uncle Si!

460
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Who are you?

461
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I'm your apprentice.

462
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I've been through three times.

463
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I'm your apprentice.

464
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Tell Grandpa Si to let me go.

465
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Grandpa Si!

466
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Grandpa Si!

467
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
You bastard!

468
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Uncle Zhen.

469
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Tan Zi.

470
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Grandpa Si is soft-hearted.

471
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Go and tell him the truth.

472
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Grandpa Si.

473
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
This situation is not good for him.

474
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Is it?

475
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
No, Uncle Si.

476
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Go.

477
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Uncle Si.

478
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
What's wrong with your dad?

479
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Master Hua.

480
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Master Hua.

481
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Master Hua.

482
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
What's wrong?

483
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Brother Dao has told me.

484
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
What?

485
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
He's not saying that he's from the second division anymore?

486
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
He told me everything.

487
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
He said that the next time we trade is tomorrow.

488
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Brother Xiao Xi.

489
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Is Xiao Xi reliable?

490
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
The trade code is different every time.

491
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
He doesn't know the next trade code.

492
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
If he wants to know, he has to let him go first.

493
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
One time is enough.

494
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Brother Dao can't be a coward anymore.

495
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Uncle Si.

496
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Uncle Si.

497
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Can you tell me the answer to the question I asked you before?

498
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Is my answer that important to you?

499
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Uncle Si.

500
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I feel like I've never met you before.

501
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
And?

502
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I know that many people have two faces.

503
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
One for their own people, one for outsiders.

504
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
But Uncle Si.

505
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Do you have more faces?

506
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Uncle Si.

507
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Kid.

508
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I'm warning you.

509
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
If you think too much, I'll strangle you to death.

510
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Uncle Si.

511
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
You're trying to avoid the problem.

512
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Can't you be more honest with your nephew?

513
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
There are things that will be told to you in the future.

514
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Uncle Si.

515
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
We've come in.

516
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I've gotten involved in this.

517
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I can't get rid of this relationship.

518
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Why are you hiding something from me?

519
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Because you're the only one in the Wu family.

520
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I don't want you to get involved in this.

521
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I want you to be a clean person.

522
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Isn't that good?

523
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Uncle Si.

524
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Because I'm from the Wu family.

525
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
So everything that happened to the Wu family has to do with me.

526
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And now that I've grown up, even if I get involved in these things,

527
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I'll have my own principles.

528
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
But Uncle Si.

529
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
What about your principles?

530
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
What are your principles?

531
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I remember now.

532
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
When you were in college, you were wearing a red scarf.

533
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
It seems that you're learning philosophy.

534
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Uncle Si.

535
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Aren't you still trying to avoid the problem?

536
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Fine.

537
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
What do you want to know?

538
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I'll tell you everything today.

539
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Ask.

540
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Start.

541
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Ask.

542
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Forget it.

543
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I don't want you to make up stories to fool me.

544
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
You thief.

545
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I really wanted to tell you.

546
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
But I said you wouldn't believe me.

547
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
You let me.

548
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
You just take a rope.

549
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
What?

550
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
You hang the third uncle to death.

551
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Third Master.

552
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I got it.

553
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
This kid is Jason's man.

554
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
He's been sending Jason a message all the way.

555
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
And he's got a positioning device.

556
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
He said Jason met a snowstorm on the way.

557
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
He lost a lot of people.

558
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
He's with An Ning now.

559
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I guess it's almost there.

560
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
It's just that it's already in.

561
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
They're moving faster than I thought.

562
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Yes.

563
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Here they come.

564
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Here they come again.

565
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Damn.

566
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Go.

567
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
No.

568
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Third Uncle.

569
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Go.

570
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Don't pull me.

571
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Third Uncle.

572
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Hold on.

573
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I can't run.

574
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Third Uncle.

575
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Third Uncle.

576
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
What now?

577
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Look.

578
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
What is that?

579
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I've had enough.

580
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I'm done.

581
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I'm done.

582
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I'm done.

583
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I'm done.

584
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Wu Xie.

585
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
You.

586
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Run.

587
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Run.

588
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Run.

589
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Third Uncle.

590
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Third Uncle.

591
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
It's no use calling me Third Uncle.

592
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I can't even run with these stones.

593
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Third Uncle.

594
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I'm going to run to the hall.

595
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Weren't the bugs in the dark?

596
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
We'll get out of the way when we get to the hall.

597
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Bullshit.

598
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Look.

599
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Look.

600
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Is there a way?

601
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
No.

602
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Don't take this risk.

603
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
No.

604
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Third Uncle.

605
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
We'll light the lanterns.

606
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
They're not hot.

607
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
We'll light the lanterns to distract them.

608
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
You're talking nonsense.

609
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
It's not embarrassing to let their bugs run to the hall.

610
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
What do you say?

611
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Two times.

612
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Kill them.

613
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Third Uncle.

614
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Wu Xie.

615
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Third Uncle.

616
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Are you okay?

617
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Don't be sad.

618
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
That's not mine.

619
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Wu San Yan.

620
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Fourth Uncle.

621
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
It's an emergency.

622
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
We've offended you.

623
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
We'll not do it again.

624
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Next time,

625
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
you have to see if anyone is there.

626
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Or you'll get hurt.

627
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Master Chen.

628
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Do you think we should take his equipment

629
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
or do you think we should take it?

630
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I don't think so.

631
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I think we should take it.

632
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Do you think we should take his equipment

633
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
or do you think we should take it?

634
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Forget it.

635
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Give it to me.

636
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I can take it.

637
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
You take it.

638
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Slow down.

639
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Slow down.

640
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Why are you so indifferent?

641
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Miaoshan

642
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,800
The shadow of the wind is in the air

643
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,800
The lonely wind

644
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,800
I chase the clouds and the wind

645
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,800
I've been through the four seasons, how can I remember

646
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,800
I've been through the night, I've been through the five days

647
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,800
I've been in the dark and I've got the answer

648
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:06,600
The wind of time is in the flower of the spring

649
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,600
The unknown direction

650
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:13,600
Follow the wind

651
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,600
Go down

652
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,600
I chase the clouds and the wind

653
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,600
I've been through the four seasons, how can I remember

654
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,600
I've been through the night, I've been through the five days

655
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,600
I've been in the dark and I've got the answer

656
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:52,600
The wind of time is in the flower of the spring

657
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,600
The unknown direction

658
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:59,600
Follow the wind

659
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,600
Go down
