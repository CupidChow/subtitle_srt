1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,980
gonna cook

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:11,860
exactly chocolate

3
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,860
I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I can help you.

4
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,860
I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I can help you.

5
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,860
I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I can help you.

6
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,860
I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I can help you.

7
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,860
I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I can help you.

8
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,860
I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I can help you.

9
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,860
I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I can help you.

10
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,860
I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I can help you.

11
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,860
I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I can help you.

12
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,860
I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I can help you.

13
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,860
The Ghost's Guard?

14
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,860
The Ghost's Guard?

15
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,860
The long-living street in front of the East Street.

16
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,860
The long-living street in front of the East Street.

17
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,860
Go!

18
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,860
Go!

19
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,860
We're lost!

20
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,860
13th Master,

21
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,860
You better jump over!

22
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,860
I'll cover you!

23
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,860
Hurry!

24
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,860
13th Master, I'm running out of bullets!

25
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,860
I'm running out of bullets!

26
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,860
Jump!

27
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,860
Hurry!

28
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,860
Hurry!

29
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,860
Hurry!

30
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,860
Hurry!

31
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,860
Hurry!

32
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,860
Hurry!

33
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,860
Send Hua out.

34
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,860
Send Hua out.

35
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,860
Little Third Master!

36
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,860
Hurry and answer me!

37
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,860
Little Third Master, Wu Xie!

38
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,860
Where are you, Little Third Master?

39
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,860
Where are you, Wu Xie?

40
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,860
Little Third Master...

41
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,860
Little Third Master has fallen.

42
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,860
Little Third Master,

43
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,860
I'll save you!

44
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,860
You can't go down!

45
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,860
This kind of lowly man...

46
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,860
Little Third Master,

47
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,860
Little Third Master,

48
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,860
I'm sorry!

49
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,860
You can't go down!

50
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,860
Pan Zi!

51
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,860
Xuan Zi,

52
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,860
Where is Little Third Master?

53
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,860
You must know where he is!

54
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,860
I don't know!

55
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,860
Little Third Master told me to tell Wu Xie.

56
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,860
Wu Xie will take us to him.

57
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,860
Little Third Master...

58
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,860
Little Third Master!

59
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,860
Come over here.

60
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,860
Come over here.

61
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,860
Little Third Master...

62
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,860
It's not going well...

63
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,860
Little Third Master

64
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,860
It's not good...

65
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,860
Little Third Master,

66
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,860
I'm leaving.

67
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,860
Third Master.

68
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,540
Run!

69
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,860
You can't get through this.

70
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,860
Hold on!

71
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,860
Light the fire!

72
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,860
Run!

73
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,860
Run!

74
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,860
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

75
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,860
Run!

76
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,860
Run!

77
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,860
Run!

78
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,860
Run!

79
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,860
Run!

80
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,860
Come on.

81
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,860
Third Master!

82
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,860
Help!

83
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,860
Third Master!

84
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,860
Run!

85
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,860
Run!

86
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,860
Xiao Ge.

87
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,860
Why are you here?

88
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,860
We have to leave this place quickly.

89
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,860
Have you thought out what your Third Uncle said to you?

90
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,860
The place where Xuan Wu died.

91
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,860
Third Brother.

92
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,860
In this world,

93
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,860
there is no such place.

94
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,860
If someone is buried in such a place,

95
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,860
his descendants will die.

96
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,860
Many tragic things will happen to him.

97
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,860
It won't be strange.

98
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,860
This is the worst feng shui in the world.

99
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,860
It's all gathered together.

100
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,860
Of course,

101
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,860
this feng shui treasure

102
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,860
is the same as the nine dragon petals.

103
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,860
Moreover, this is the East and West Imperial Tomb.

104
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,860
How can the feng shui be different from the place where the emperor was buried?

105
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,860
Feng shui is for people.

106
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,860
What if King Wan Nu is not a person?

107
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,860
How can King Wan Nu not be a person?

108
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,860
When we came here,

109
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,860
the totems,

110
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,860
paintings,

111
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,860
and the snake-eye-catching copper fish of Chen Ping A Si were all recorded.

112
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,860
King Wan Nu is not a person.

113
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,860
The information on the copper fish is incomplete.

114
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,860
If we can get all the snake-eye-catching copper fish back,

115
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,860
maybe we can figure it out.

116
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,860
But,

117
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,860
to put it another way,

118
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,860
since you are telling me this in this way,

119
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,860
it's very likely that

120
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,860
if you tell me this directly,

121
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,860
the outsiders will not understand it.

122
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,860
If that's the case,

123
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,860
we can't understand it in the way we want.

124
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,860
So,

125
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,860
only you can understand what I'm trying to say.

126
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,860
This is the special way you communicate with each other.

127
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,860
I don't know.

128
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,860
I don't understand.

129
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,860
Don't worry.

130
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,860
Take your time.

131
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,860
Xiao Ge,

132
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,860
let's go further.

133
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,860
Let's go.

134
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,860
Let's go.

135
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,860
The grave is red.

136
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,860
I wonder where their destination is.

137
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,860
I don't know.

138
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,860
I wonder where their destination is.

139
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,860
King Wan Nu,

140
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,860
these people

141
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,860
are the people who brought him down.

142
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,860
This is the place of Xuan Wu Ju.

143
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,860
He said that as long as you tell me this,

144
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,860
you will know where the entrance is.

145
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,860
A month ago,

146
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,860
San Shu knew where the entrance of the underground palace was.

147
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,860
It's impossible.

148
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,860
My wrong, wrong, wrong!

149
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,860
Who are you?

150
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,860
Who are you?

151
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,860
Tell me,

152
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,860
who am I?

153
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,860
Xie Lian.

154
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,860
Xie Lian.

155
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,860
Xie Lian.

156
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,860
Xie Lian.

157
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,860
Xie Lian.

158
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,860
Xie Lian.

159
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,860
Xie Lian.

160
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,860
Xie Lian.

161
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,860
Xie Lian.

162
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,860
Xie Lian.

163
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,860
Xie Lian.

164
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,860
Xie Lian.

165
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,860
Lian Huan.

166
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,860
Lian Huan.

167
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,860
In this world,

168
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,860
only one person can harm you.

169
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,860
That is me,

170
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,860
your San Shu.

171
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,860
Think about it.

172
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,860
Who loves you the most since childhood?

173
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,860
It's me, your San Shu.

174
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,860
Then you guys go first.

175
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,860
You,

176
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,860
follow me back.

177
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,860
Be careful.

178
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,860
Who shot just now?

179
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,860
Me.

180
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,860
Me?

181
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,860
And me.

182
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,860
Then you three stay here.

183
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,860
The others, leave here.

184
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,860
Why?

185
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,860
Hurry up, we don't have time.

186
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,860
Okay.

187
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,860
Okay.

188
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,860
This is not my idea.

189
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,860
It's your San Shu's idea.

190
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,860
San Shu?

191
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,860
You are also San Shu's person.

192
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,860
Don't ask so much.

193
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,860
When the time comes, I'll take you to see San Shu.

194
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:11,860
You guys ask yourself.

195
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,860
Xiao Ge,

196
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,860
do you think that Shun Zi

197
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,860
really deliberately separated us?

198
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:21,860
He pretended to be a fool all the way.

199
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,860
No one cares about him.

200
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,860
He could have told me

201
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,860
about San Shu secretly.

202
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,860
Why did he deliberately separate us?

203
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,860
Also,

204
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,860
why did Si A Gong

205
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,860
ask Shun Zi to go back with you?

206
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,860
Why not ask Hua He Shang

207
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,860
to be his own person?

208
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,860
Could it be

209
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,860
he left us

210
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,860
to spy on me and Fatty Wang?

211
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,860
I don't know.

212
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,860
Wait a minute.

213
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,860
Did you lose it?

214
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,860
Maybe.

215
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,860
Take a break.

216
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,860
Take a breath.

217
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,860
This route is a bit strange.

218
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,860
Hua Ye,

219
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,860
is there anything wrong?

220
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,860
Hua Ye,

221
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,860
is there anything wrong?

222
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,860
By the way, Hua Ye,

223
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,860
our next schedule

224
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,860
is like this.

225
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,860
After handling this,

226
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,860
we need to hurry back to Chang Sha.

227
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,860
This way, we can attend

228
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,860
the night's

229
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,860
singing and dancing party.

230
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,860
Secondly,

231
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,860
we have already told Miss Xiu Xiu

232
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,860
about this.

233
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,860
She has said she understands.

234
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,860
Also,

235
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,860
the last thing is about

236
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,860
the picture of the tomb.

237
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,860
We blacked in

238
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,860
the database of the Chude Gou

239
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,860
and confirmed that the picture is real.

240
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,860
Jia Sha,

241
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,860
Hua Ye,

242
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,860
sometimes

243
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,860
I am too stubborn.

244
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,860
Hua Ye,

245
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,860
look.

246
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,860
The signal

247
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,860
did disappear in this position.

248
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,860
It is indeed here.

249
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,860
Hua Ye,

250
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,860
do you think

251
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,860
this is the place

252
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,860
that Chude Gou

253
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,860
has deliberately arranged?

254
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,860
Then why did he

255
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,860
bring us here?

256
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,860
What is his purpose?

257
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,860
He is not hiding anything.

258
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,860
He is obviously

259
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,860
giving us a show.

260
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,860
Let's go.

261
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,860
Hua Ye,

262
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,860
the door is not locked.

263
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,860
Could there be an ambush?

264
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,860
It seems that

265
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,860
Qiu Dao Kao is very confident

266
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,860
about his own foundation.

267
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,860
Let's go.

268
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,860
Hua Ye,

269
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,860
the door is locked.

270
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,860
Let's go.

271
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,860
Hua Ye,

272
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,860
the door is locked.

273
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,860
Hua Ye,

274
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,860
the door is locked.

275
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,860
Hua Ye,

276
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,860
the door is locked.

277
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,860
Hua Ye,

278
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,860
the door is locked.

279
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,860
Hua Ye,

280
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,860
the door is locked.

281
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,860
Hua Ye,

282
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,860
the door is locked.

283
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,860
Hua Ye,

284
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,860
the door is locked.

285
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,860
Hua Ye,

286
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,860
the door is locked.

287
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,860
Hua Ye,

288
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,860
the door is locked.

289
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,860
Hua Ye,

290
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,860
the door is locked.

291
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,860
Hua Ye,

292
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,860
the door is locked.

293
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,860
Hua Ye,

294
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,860
the door is locked.

295
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,860
Hua Ye,

296
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,860
the door is locked.

297
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,860
Hua Ye,

298
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,860
the door is locked.

299
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,860
Xiao Kun,

300
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,860
where should we go?

301
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,860
Let's go and hide first.

302
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,860
Hua Ye,

303
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,860
I go and check this side.

304
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,860
the door of the study is open.

305
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,860
Let's go.

306
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,860
Mr. Hua, this is Mr. Wu's diary, right?

307
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,860
Looking at the handwriting, it's his.

308
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,860
His handwriting is not a few people's.

309
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,860
This is Mr. Wu's diary, learning from his grandfather.

310
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,860
He also wrote a book.

311
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,860
Mr. Wu's diary

312
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,860
Mr. Hua, this must be the trap of Qiu Dekou.

313
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,860
You...

314
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,860
If she's alive, we have to leave now.

315
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,860
Mr. Wu's diary

316
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,860
Mr. Wu's diary

317
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,860
Mr. Wu's diary

318
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,860
Rest well.

319
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,860
Mr. Wu's diary

320
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,860
Mr. Wu's diary

321
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,860
Drink some water first.

322
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,860
Xiao Ge.

323
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,860
What is this place?

324
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,860
This is a dirt building.

325
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,860
This building is probably where the engineers of the Heavenly Palace used to rest.

326
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,860
It's just a temporary shelter from the wind and sand.

327
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,860
Besides, we don't have much food.

328
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,860
Xiao Ge.

329
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,860
Then why should we let those people go?

330
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,860
Is there any shelter?

331
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,860
You're walking fast.

332
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,860
Fortunately, we're lucky.

333
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,860
After we fell down,

334
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,860
those people didn't chase us anymore.

335
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,860
Don't worry.

336
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,860
We know where the curse is.

337
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,860
Let's replenish our energy first.

338
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,860
Let's rest quickly.

339
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,860
Don't be afraid.

340
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,860
Those people are hiding and running away.

341
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,860
Don't think about it.

342
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,860
Rest quickly.

343
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,860
We still have a long way to go.

344
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:58,860
Xiao Ge.

345
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,860
It's good that I met you.

346
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,860
Otherwise,

347
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,860
I don't know how long I have to endure alone.

348
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,860
What about others?

349
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,860
Others...

350
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,860
They all ran away.

351
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,860
What about Fatty?

352
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,860
He can't not follow you.

353
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,860
Xiao Ge.

354
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,860
Why is this still a broken bridge?

355
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,860
I'm so heavy.

356
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,860
You can still lift me up?

357
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,860
Xiao Ge.

358
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,860
Xiao Ge.

359
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,860
Xiao Ge.

360
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,860
Xiao Ge.

361
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,860
Xiao Ge.

362
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,860
What's wrong?

363
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,860
Do you feel better?

364
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:37,860
I just don't know if those people will come back.

365
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,860
I don't think so.

366
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,860
The wind and sand here will disturb their senses.

367
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,860
Xiao Ge.

368
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,860
We've been waiting for you.

369
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,860
It's not a big deal.

370
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,860
Xiao Ge.

371
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,860
Xiao Ge.

372
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,860
Xiao Ge.

373
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,860
Xiao Ge, I'm tired.

374
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,860
I'm tired.

375
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,860
I see that you have a little bit of my life.

376
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,860
I was taken by that big bird.

377
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,860
It's not that I want to go back to you.

378
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,860
Do you know that?

379
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,860
So I can't follow your surname.

380
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,860
My surname is Wang.

381
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,860
Fatty Wu.

382
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,860
You...

383
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,860
Didn't I tell you?

384
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,860
What's wrong with you?

385
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,860
You...

386
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,860
Enough.

387
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,860
Stop it. Hurry up.

388
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,860
What?

389
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,860
Eat or not?

390
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,860
Fatty Wu.

391
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,860
I'm embarrassing you, right?

392
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,860
Come on, Xiao Ge.

393
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,860
Eat something first.

394
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,860
You see, Xiao Ge is still the one who is in charge.

395
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,860
I tell you, this is the internal conflict of the people.

396
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,860
It's not a conflict between the enemy and me.

397
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,860
You know that, right?

398
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,860
Enough.

399
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,860
When Wu Xie recovers tomorrow,

400
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,860
we will go to meet everyone.

401
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,860
We can't leave with the wound.

402
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,860
Everything is ruined.

403
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,860
Listen to Xiao Ge.

404
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,860
You're awake, right?

405
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,860
Get out of my way.

406
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,860
I'm going to sleep.

407
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,860
Fatty Wu.

408
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,860
Xiao Ge, look at him.

409
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,860
This...

410
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,860
Anyway, I don't change my surname.

411
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,860
My surname is Wang.

412
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,860
I don't change my surname because I don't want to change my name.

413
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,860
Wang Fatty.

414
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:58,860
My surname is Wu.

415
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,860
How tiring is Wu?

416
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,860
So many things happened between you and your family.

417
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,860
I have to take care of it.

418
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,860
If Wu San Xing comes,

419
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,860
my third uncle...

420
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,860
is too troublesome.

421
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,860
Wang Fatty.

422
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:34,860
Come here.

423
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:35,860
Come here.

424
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,860
Come here.

425
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,860
Shao Zi Guan.

426
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,860
The things in here

427
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,860
can only be used to make us

428
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,860
be able to get out of the archaeology room.

429
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,860
It's not a good place.

430
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,860
It's not a good place.

431
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,860
The things in here

432
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,860
can only be used to make us

433
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,860
be able to get out of the archaeology room.

434
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,860
It's not a good place.

435
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,860
It's the name of the archaeologist.

436
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,860
No matter how much you say,

437
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,860
it can't change our origin.

438
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,860
Third Uncle.

439
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:15,860
What era is this?

440
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,860
Do you still expect to live on your own?

441
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,860
It's time to change your mind.

442
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,860
Look at your boss.

443
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,860
An underground engineer.

444
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,860
He's so clean.

445
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,860
How much respect does he have?

446
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,860
How can he be so useless?

447
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,860
You're so useless.

448
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,860
You come or I come?

449
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,860
Fine, I'll come.

450
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,860
I'm good at left hand anyway.

451
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,860
If my right hand is cut,

452
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,860
it won't affect my chopsticks.

453
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,860
Lian Hua.

454
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,860
Xie Lian Hua.

455
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,860
Xie Lian Hua.

456
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,860
Third Uncle.

457
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:05,860
Third Uncle.

458
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,860
Third Uncle.

459
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,860
Third Uncle.

460
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,860
Who is it?

461
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,860
Come out quickly!

462
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,860
Who is it?

463
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,860
Who is it?

464
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,860
Come out quickly!

465
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,860
Who is it?

466
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,860
Come out quickly!

467
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,860
Who is it?

468
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,860
Third Uncle.

469
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,860
Why did you kill me?

470
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,860
Why did you kill me?

471
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,860
You want my life?

472
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,860
I treat you as my brother.

473
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,860
What should I do?

474
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,860
What should I do?

475
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,860
We can only live for one.

476
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,860
Who are you?

477
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,860
Who are you?

478
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,860
Who are you?

479
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:08,860
Who are you?

480
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,860
Who are you?

481
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,860
Who are you?

482
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,860
Who are you?

483
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,860
Who are you?

484
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,860
What's wrong?

485
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,860
Only you can understand what your Third Uncle designed.

486
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,860
This is a special way for you to communicate.

487
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,860
Xie...

488
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:46,860
You had a nightmare again?

489
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:51,860
I probably know what that last sentence meant.

490
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,860
What does it mean?

491
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,860
Then...

492
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,860
Yes.

493
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:56,860
What does it mean?

494
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,860
Let's wait until I'm sure.

495
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,860
I'm sorry.

496
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:45,860
Come, Ting Ting.

497
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,860
Drink some water.

498
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,860
Drink some water and then we'll leave.

499
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,860
I told you to drink water.

500
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,860
No need.

501
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,860
If you think there's nothing wrong,

502
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,860
let's go.

503
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,860
There's still a long way to go before the tower.

504
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,860
I'm telling you, you blind man.

505
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,860
If it weren't for the birds,

506
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,860
I wouldn't have followed you.

507
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,860
Come on.

508
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,860
Come on.

509
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,860
These people, if they all go to the museum,

510
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,860
can they cause a stir?

511
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,860
This is the horse-drawn dragon in the burial pit.

512
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,860
It's usually used to welcome the king

513
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,860
or the team on a trip.

514
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:35,860
But, Brother Yang, this kind of burial pit

515
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,860
usually only appears in underground caves

516
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,860
or in the burial pit.

517
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,860
How could they go there?

518
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,860
They're not going to die.

519
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,860
They're going to die.

520
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,860
The king of the ten thousand farmers

521
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,860
is going to die.

522
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,860
If the king of the ten thousand farmers

523
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,860
sees this place,

524
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,860
he will be killed by the super family.

525
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,860
Tianzhen,

526
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,860
this is the clothing of the Eastern Xia people

527
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,860
in the murals.

528
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,860
Don't just do it.

529
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,860
These things are weird.

530
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,860
Maybe there's something wrong with them.

531
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,860
They can still live.

532
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,860
Stone man,

533
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,860
you can't just leave.

534
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,860
Stone man.

535
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:24,860
These people

536
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,860
should have been in the river for a long time.

537
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:27,860
Their faces are blurred.

538
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,860
It's also because they were soaked in water for a long time

539
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,860
and were washed away by the river.

540
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,860
What is that?

541
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,860
The craftsmen were lazy.

542
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,860
They didn't do well, so they buried them in the river.

543
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,860
I don't think so.

544
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:39,860
Have you ever seen someone throw garbage

545
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,860
so fairly?

546
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,860
Did you notice that

547
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,860
all the craftsmen were going in the same direction?

548
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,860
It's like they were in the army.

549
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,860
They were all going in the direction

550
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,860
of the king of the ten thousand farmers.

551
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,860
They were all substitutes for the living.

552
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:22,700
epidemic

553
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:44,860
The wind blows in the wind

554
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:47,860
The wind of loneliness

555
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,860
The wind blows in the wind

556
00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:00,860
How can I resist the wind?

557
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,860
I pass through the night

558
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:07,860
I find the answer in the darkness

559
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:13,860
The scenery of time is looking at the flowers blooming

560
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:23,860
The unwavering faith is following the wind

561
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:40,860
The wind blows in the wind

562
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:47,860
I forget how to resist the wind

563
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,860
I pass through the night

564
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:54,860
I find the answer in the darkness

565
00:44:54,860 --> 00:45:01,860
The scenery of time is looking at the flowers blooming

566
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:10,860
The unwavering faith is following the wind

567
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:34,860
The End
