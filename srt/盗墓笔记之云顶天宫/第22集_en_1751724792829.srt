The Untamed

2
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,740
Episode 14

3
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,900
We should take a break.

4
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,860
We just had a bad battle.

5
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,340
We need to get back a 근� 이러 knead.

6
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,560
Don't you see it?

7
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,580
We already took more than two hours break.

8
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,740
I think we should..

9
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,060
More than two hours?

10
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,000
But you can't imagine where we are,

11
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,600
Is this a playground?

12
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,000
We can rest here.

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,600
What is this place?

14
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,200
We can kill people anytime.

15
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,000
If we all die,

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,200
what's the point of staying here?

17
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,800
Our people have already done their best to prepare and investigate.

18
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,800
Youyan just attacked us once.

19
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,800
She won't come here so quickly.

20
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,800
And you know about this tomb.

21
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,400
When it's night time, how many people are waiting for us?

22
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,600
Now is the best chance.

23
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,600
I know you're not feeling well.

24
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,600
But you can't stay here alone.

25
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Rest for an hour.

26
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,600
And then leave.

27
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Are you sure?

28
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,600
I'm sure.

29
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Chen Yifan

30
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Master Chen, you should rest.

31
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
You have to hurry.

32
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,600
What?

33
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,600
I'm going to pee. You're still following me?

34
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,000
Li merged with you.

35
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,600
I'll tell you, I pour your wild guess.

36
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,600
expanding Barcelona

37
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Fatso...

38
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
I want lowabe

39
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
What's wrong with you?

40
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
You're going backwards.

41
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
That part hasn't passed yet.

42
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
You still don't understand the situation now?

43
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
We have to be consistent with the outside, do you know?

44
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,600
I'm telling you, Ning and the others are in trouble.

45
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
What's wrong with you?

46
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,600
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

47
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
Are you okay?

48
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
It has nothing to do with you.

49
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,600
No.

50
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Your wound is very painful.

51
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
I can't even take it off.

52
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
It's okay.

53
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,600
I'm fine.

54
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
I'm fine.

55
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,600
I'm fine.

56
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,600
I'm fine.

57
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,600
I'm fine.

58
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
I'm fine.

59
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
I'm fine.

60
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
I'm fine.

61
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
I'm fine.

62
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
I'm fine.

63
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,600
I'm fine.

64
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
I'm fine.

65
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,600
I'm fine.

66
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
I'm fine.

67
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
I'm fine.

68
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
You can't look at anyone with this wound.

69
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Otherwise you'll be in danger.

70
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Everyone is staring at you.

71
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
No one can believe it.

72
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Don't worry, Master San.

73
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
I remember.

74
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Fatty, fatty.

75
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
Come on.

76
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Come help me boil water.

77
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
Where is Master San?

78
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
He's injured and he's going around.

79
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
He went to water.

80
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
It's okay.

81
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Master San hates people following him.

82
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
He takes care of him like a patient.

83
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Come and help me.

84
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Xiao Zhao, go out and have a look.

85
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
What does Master San need help with?

86
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Yes.

87
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
What are you looking at?

88
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,600
The water is going to dry.

89
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Help me.

90
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Pour it in.

91
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,600
Fatty, can't you let me go?

92
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Si Ya Gong.

93
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Let me ask you.

94
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,600
Do you know where this is?

95
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
This...

96
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
This...

97
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,600
This is the Cloud Sky Palace.

98
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,600
Wrong.

99
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
This is where you will die.

100
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,600
If you still believe in the smoke,

101
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
you will die soon.

102
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Si Ya Gong.

103
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,600
I call you this because I respect you.

104
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,600
But it doesn't mean you really know me.

105
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
It's none of my business.

106
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,600
And it's not that I'm just an outsider.

107
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,600
I really can't find the purpose of this operation.

108
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
For this operation,

109
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,600
I've been messed up by a lot of things.

110
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,600
I really don't want you to come back and talk to me.

111
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Wu Xie.

112
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,600
This operation is a very important one.

113
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
Since you've made your choice,

114
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,600
you have to be responsible for your choice.

115
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,600
When you do things,

116
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,600
the most important thing is to be indecisive.

117
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,600
You have to remember what's most important right now.

118
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,600
There are things that your third uncle thinks

119
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,600
is not the right time to tell you.

120
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
Ok.

121
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Wu Xie.

122
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
I'm going down.

123
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,600
Let's stop here.

124
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
Go back.

125
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
And move on down.

126
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,600
That's not a place for you.

127
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,200
Everything you want to know is in the Snake Eye Copper Fish.

128
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,200
Xiao Ge.

129
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,200
What does Xiao Ge mean?

130
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,400
Madam, I need your documents to open the three ports.

131
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,400
You're crazy. You can't do it.

132
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,200
But you have to tell me how much you will make this time.

133
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,400
I'm telling you the truth.

134
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,600
I can't make the decision.

135
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,800
You know I can't keep the old and young of the Huo family anymore.

136
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:49,000
Before, I broke the rules of the Old Nine Gate to help you.

137
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,600
Look at you. You're just losing everything.

138
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,400
You'll ruin the Huo family.

139
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,800
You're so smart.

140
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,400
You don't want to take care of the life of Huo Ling anymore?

141
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,800
That's our fate.

142
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,600
Fate is not part of it.

143
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,400
You think we won't remember what we did before?

144
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,800
You think we won't be prepared?

145
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,000
You are now a part of the family.

146
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,800
You don't want to see the Huo family ruined by you.

147
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,200
You have to do this.

148
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,000
You have to do it.

149
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:51,200
Take a look. If there's nothing wrong, sign it.

150
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,400
I don't want to see the Huo family ruined by you.

151
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,200
You have to do this.

152
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,200
You have to do this.

153
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,800
If you want to delay the time, I don't think you have to.

154
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,200
Because they are not my opponents.

155
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,800
Peanuts are also good for your stomach.

156
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:58,220
seals the

157
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,200
Oh no, Miss Xiu Xiu has left.

158
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,200
She even stole the key and the box from the warehouse.

159
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Madam, madam, someone is coming!

160
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Call the doctor, call the doctor!

161
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,200
Madam.

162
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:46,200
Xiao Ge left me a note saying that she went down alone and won't be with us anymore.

163
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:59,200
Third Uncle, I feel like you already know.

164
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,200
I think she's gone.

165
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,200
Chen Pi and Si took Xiao Ge away on purpose.

166
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,200
Shouldn't they be together?

167
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,200
Where did Xiao Ge go alone?

168
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,200
I'm already sick like this.

169
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,200
How would I know where she went?

170
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,200
I remember when I was talking with Xiao Hua,

171
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,200
there was someone who could make a human mask.

172
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,200
After wearing it,

173
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,200
she could do a real-life surgery.

174
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
Compared to the plastic surgery now,

175
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Xiao Hua has also learned to do it for a while.

176
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,200
Although she didn't do it very well,

177
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,200
if she's not very familiar with it,

178
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,200
she wouldn't be able to tell.

179
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,200
Really?

180
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:08,200
So, when did Chen Pi and Si get the bag you guys took?

181
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,200
I don't know.

182
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,200
I don't know.

183
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,200
When did you guys take the bag?

184
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,200
Is she...

185
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,200
Is she my third uncle?

186
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,200
You thief.

187
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,200
Did you fall from above

188
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,200
and break your head?

189
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
You're from the Lu family, right?

190
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,200
I met a bad person in a bad place.

191
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,200
The place is not bad. This is the Cloud Sky Palace.

192
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,200
Do you know what's the worst?

193
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,200
Normally, the most bad thing is when Fatty gets the head.

194
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,200
But you, you had to take a bunch of people to run away.

195
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,200
You went to the road and pretended to be a thief.

196
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,200
How many people came? How many people are there now?

197
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,200
They have someone who knows how to question women.

198
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,200
You have to give the agreement to An Ning.

199
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,200
Let them figure it out.

200
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,200
You...

201
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,200
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

202
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,200
We should have waited until the monk was here.

203
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,200
Why did you have to cooperate with Qiu De?

204
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,200
Your third uncle is not a prophet.

205
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,200
He only understood the situation after he came.

206
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,200
Are you talking about you or him?

207
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,200
My head is really broken.

208
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,200
You have to come.

209
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,200
You have to get this party going.

210
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,200
You have nothing to do?

211
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,200
I have something to do.

212
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200
Cooperation.

213
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,200
Cooperation?

214
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Then I have to think about it.

215
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,200
This cooperation is fine, but how to cooperate?

216
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,200
We have to discuss it.

217
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,200
I didn't collect any money.

218
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,200
The point is that we don't know what they know.

219
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,200
When we know what they know,

220
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,200
we will be the ones to cooperate, right?

221
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,200
Okay, then you can talk to him.

222
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,200
I'm too lazy to talk to him.

223
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,200
Third uncle, are you feeling better?

224
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,200
No, it hurts more and more.

225
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,200
You can cooperate.

226
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,200
But since we have to cooperate,

227
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,200
we have to be fair.

228
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,200
Tell me what you want.

229
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
I don't know what the purpose of the words is.

230
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,200
I just follow my fate.

231
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,200
But I can explain the past to you.

232
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,200
When I was in the underwater tomb,

233
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,200
I was ordered to find two things.

234
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,200
One is jade seal,

235
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,200
which is the ghost seal in the documents.

236
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
It can summon the evil army.

237
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,200
And the other one is the structure of the Cloud Sky Palace.

238
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,200
Unfortunately, I didn't find it.

239
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,200
Ghost seal?

240
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,200
King Lushan's ghost seal is in the underwater tomb?

241
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,200
After King Lushan's tomb was taken by Wang Zanghai,

242
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,200
he replaced the ghost seal with snake's tail copper fish.

243
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,200
We thought the ghost seal was buried in the underwater tomb.

244
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,200
But we didn't find anything in the underwater tomb.

245
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,200
And the structure of the Cloud Sky Palace

246
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,200
was probably in Wu Sanxing's hands.

247
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,200
We don't know how many times Wu Sanxing has set up.

248
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,200
But we still have to cooperate with him.

249
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Because he knows more than we do.

250
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,200
What did you find in the underwater tomb?

251
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,200
Don't touch it, Shunxu.

252
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,200
These are the jade seals we took in the underwater tomb.

253
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,200
Look at the content.

254
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,200
You surprised me this time.

255
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,200
What do you mean?

256
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,200
I know.

257
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,200
You're in the old world.

258
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,200
In your eyes, I'm just a half-bottled vegetable.

259
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,200
It's easy to trick me.

260
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,200
But...

261
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,200
You'll find out sooner or later.

262
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,200
Otherwise, we can't work together.

263
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,200
Even so, we have to dig deeper.

264
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,200
This is the style of the old world, isn't it?

265
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,200
It's too tiring to deal with people like you.

266
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,200
You talk too much. Do you want to see it?

267
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Yes.

268
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,200
Look.

269
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,200
The person who was kidnapped is Wang Zanghai.

270
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,200
Yes.

271
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,200
It means Wang Zanghai built the Cloud Sky Palace.

272
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,200
He may have been forced to do so.

273
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,200
He was kidnapped.

274
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,200
In the following murals,

275
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,200
it's all recorded that he was kidnapped.

276
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,200
He was kidnapped.

277
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,200
He was kidnapped.

278
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,200
In the following murals,

279
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,200
it's all recorded that he was kidnapped.

280
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,200
Wait. Is this the Imperial Tomb?

281
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,200
So the Imperial Tomb here was not built by Wang Zanghai.

282
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,200
He remodeled it?

283
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
We've researched.

284
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,200
The overall style of the Imperial Tomb is from the times of Yin Shang.

285
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,200
What we see now is the famous style after being remodeled by Wang Zanghai.

286
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,200
Because time has passed too slowly,

287
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,200
we can't use the old style.

288
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,200
We can't solve these.

289
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,200
It looks like a legend.

290
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
Okay. We can look at the photos later.

291
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,200
We've told you everything.

292
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,200
Now, shouldn't you tell me something?

293
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,200
We've already made a deal.

294
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,200
You and Wu Sanxing,

295
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,200
do you still want to keep it a secret?

296
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,200
What did you tell me?

297
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,200
You've already missed the point.

298
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,200
You're fooling me.

299
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,200
Wu Bu, do you want to eat?

300
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,200
300 knives.

301
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,200
No.

302
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
I'm telling you,

303
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,200
you give me cash or transfer the money,

304
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
I'm telling you,

305
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,200
the price of the goods will increase.

306
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,200
No, there's not much time.

307
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,200
Is there someone in your team who knows the language of women?

308
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,200
Yes.

309
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,200
Ask her to come here and break something.

310
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,200
All the content you want to know is in these two coins.

311
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
Tang Dao!

312
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,200
Tang Dao!

313
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
Why did you take it out?

314
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
You have two?

315
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,200
Where did you get it?

316
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,200
It's none of your business.

317
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,200
Can you translate?

318
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
I'll try.

319
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,200
Tang Dao!

320
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,200
Tang Dao!

321
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,200
Tang Dao!

322
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,200
Tang Dao!

323
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,200
Tang Dao!

324
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,200
Tang Dao!

325
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,200
Tang Dao!

326
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,200
Tang Dao!

327
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,200
Tang Dao!

328
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,200
Tang Dao!

329
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,200
Tang Dao!

330
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,200
Tang Dao!

331
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Tang Dao!

332
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Tang Dao!

333
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,200
Tang Dao!

334
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,200
Tang Dao!

335
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,200
Tang Dao!

336
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,200
Tang Dao!

337
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,200
Tang Dao!

338
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,200
Tang Dao!

339
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,200
Tang Dao!

340
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,200
Tang Dao!

341
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,200
Tang Dao!

342
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,200
Tang Dao!

343
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,200
Tang Dao!

344
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,200
Tang Dao!

345
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,200
Tang Dao!

346
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,200
Tang Dao!

347
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,200
Tang Dao!

348
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,200
Tang Dao!

349
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,200
It says here that this was carved by Wang Zang Hai.

350
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,200
He hopes that he will never see the sun again.

351
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,200
Even if someone finds out, he hopes that it's Han people, not women.

352
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,200
Then why did he use women's words to record it?

353
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,200
Those Han people know women's words.

354
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,200
I'm thinking of double insurance.

355
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,200
You can imagine.

356
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
If women's words are agreed upon,

357
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,200
they won't understand the mechanism of Han people.

358
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,200
They might not find the secret text on it.

359
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,200
Turn it around.

360
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,200
If Han people are agreed upon,

361
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,200
they won't understand women's words.

362
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,200
It's no use getting the logic.

363
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,200
Understand?

364
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,200
What Third Uncle said is reasonable.

365
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,200
Third Master.

366
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,200
You don't have to worry about me. Continue.

367
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,200
Hurry.

368
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,200
This is the thing that recorded Wang Zang Hai

369
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,200
being smuggled to the East China Sea.

370
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,200
It's almost the same as what's recorded in this mural.

371
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,200
I only said a few words.

372
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,200
In order to repair the imperial tomb,

373
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,200
we need a lot of protection from the East and West.

374
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:35,460
So Wang Zang Hai took people to dig up a lot of

375
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,460
The old man is a twin.

376
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,460
He wants people to find him, but he doesn't want people to find him.

377
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,460
He's divided.

378
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,460
You don't have to worry about me. Continue.

379
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,460
Continue. Hurry.

380
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,460
This Wang Zang Hai was trapped here for ten years.

381
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:58,460
He was taken to see the underground gate of the god's secret.

382
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,460
Is there a place to record the underground gate?

383
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,460
It's right under this imperial tomb.

384
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,460
The top of Mount Changbai

385
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,460
was built in the late Shang Dynasty.

386
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,460
I'm afraid it was built during the Xia Shang period.

387
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,460
The passage leading to the underground gate

388
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,460
was guarded by a bird with a human head.

389
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,460
This bird likes to catch prey

390
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,460
and throw it down to die.

391
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,460
Then hang it on a high pole to dry it up and use it as a backup.

392
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,460
That cat head eagle is used to guard the tomb.

393
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,460
Oh, right.

394
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,460
He also said that he had been to the underground gate.

395
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,460
After he went in, he found a piece of empty space inside.

396
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,460
He could only see the inside with the real fire.

397
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,460
Other lighting tools are useless.

398
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:35,460
I can't understand the words behind this.

399
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,460
A piece of empty space.

400
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,460
Did you record this?

401
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,460
Don't tell me that you were scared

402
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,460
when you were resting.

403
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,460
You were dreaming.

404
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,460
Bro, can you talk?

405
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,460
No.

406
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,460
We were just chatting, right?

407
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,460
We were just discussing.

408
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,460
There are things that only the underground gate can know.

409
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,460
We need to find the underground gate first.

410
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,460
We need to do the things in front of us first.

411
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,460
We need to do the things in front of us first.

412
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:18,420
We need to open the gates of the

413
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,460
3rd master.

414
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,460
3rd master, what's wrong?

415
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,460
Water, water, water.

416
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,460
Go and have a look.

417
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,460
3rd master, wake up.

418
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,460
3rd master, 3rd master.

419
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,460
3rd master, 3rd master is suffering from high fever.

420
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,460
What should we do?

421
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,460
It's too dangerous.

422
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,460
3rd uncle, 3rd uncle.

423
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,460
3rd uncle.

424
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,460
Pan Zi,

425
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,460
you go and send 3rd uncle up there.

426
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,460
Go down the mountain and find a hospital.

427
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:55,460
I won't go.

428
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,460
3rd master, you are suffering too much.

429
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,460
You can't even stand it.

430
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,460
You are so weak.

431
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,460
Besides, 3rd master is here.

432
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,460
What are you worried about?

433
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,460
You can't be confused.

434
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:13,460
I can't go.

435
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,460
3rd uncle,

436
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,460
why do you have to be so stubborn?

437
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,460
3rd uncle,

438
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,460
3rd uncle.

439
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,460
3rd uncle,

440
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,460
what do you want?

441
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,460
3rd uncle,

442
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,460
I want to see your wound.

443
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,460
It's only

444
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,460
my wound.

445
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,460
I know it myself.

446
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,460
3rd uncle,

447
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,460
why don't you let me see it?

448
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,460
You are injured.

449
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,460
Is it really that serious?

450
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,460
Bastard.

451
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,460
What time is it?

452
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,460
You are still joking.

453
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,460
3rd uncle, I believe you.

454
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,460
It's because I believe you.

455
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,460
So let me see it.

456
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,460
What's the problem?

457
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,460
3rd uncle,

458
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,460
I believe you.

459
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,460
It's only my wound.

460
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,460
I know it myself.

461
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,460
3rd uncle,

462
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,460
I believe you.

463
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,460
It's only my wound.

464
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,460
So let me see it.

465
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,460
What's the problem?

466
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,460
3rd uncle,

467
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,460
I believe you.

468
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,460
It's only my wound.

469
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,460
So let me see it.

470
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,460
3rd uncle,

471
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,460
I believe you.

472
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,460
It's only my wound.

473
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,460
Why?

474
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,460
I will beat you if you don't stop.

475
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,460
Go.

476
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,460
Get the doctor here.

477
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,460
Give me another shot.

478
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,460
It hurts.

479
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,460
3rd uncle,

480
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,460
why do you do this?

481
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,460
3rd uncle,

482
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,460
is that 4th uncle

483
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,460
Xie...

484
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,460
Bullshit.

485
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,460
How do I know who he is?

486
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,460
How long do you want to hide it?

487
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,460
Why do you two

488
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,460
hide your identities?

489
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,460
And you have been hiding it for so many years.

490
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,460
We will talk about it later.

491
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,460
But will you two

492
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,460
keep it a secret?

493
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,460
I don't know.

494
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,460
I don't know.

495
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,460
But will you two

496
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,460
keep it a secret?

497
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,460
I just think

498
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,460
sometimes you are not

499
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,460
who I think you are.

500
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,460
Is it important?

501
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,460
Kid,

502
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,460
who is important to me?

503
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,460
You need to know

504
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,460
what is the most important now.

505
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,460
Don't cause trouble for 3rd uncle.

506
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,460
Okay.

507
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,460
3rd uncle,

508
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,460
what did the doctor say?

509
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,460
Is your injury okay?

510
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,460
Can you still hold on?

511
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,460
You still care about 3rd uncle?

512
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,460
How sentimental.

513
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,460
Who is 3rd uncle?

514
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,460
He has been poisoned for years.

515
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,460
Has he died?

516
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,460
But it is the greatest blessing

517
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,460
if he doesn't die.

518
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,460
Don't be sad. Smile.

519
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,460
Smile.

520
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,460
Cry.

521
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,460
I know you are too shy.

522
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,460
Go.

523
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,460
Go.

524
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,460
Why are you so cruel to others?

525
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,460
You are cruel to yourself.

526
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,460
Go.

527
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,460
I am going, 3rd uncle.

528
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,460
Go.

529
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,460
3rd uncle,

530
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,460
wait for him to get the gauze.

531
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,460
Pan Zi,

532
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,460
there are some things

533
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,460
that can't be said

534
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,460
even if you die.

535
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,460
I am going.

536
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,460
Tianzhen,

537
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,460
in the deep well of Xuanwu Garden,

538
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,460
there is a coffin of Han Bai Yu.

539
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,460
There are a lot of bugs in it.

540
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,460
It is not deep enough.

541
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,460
Do you think Wan Nong Wang

542
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,460
is full of food

543
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,460
or a loser?

544
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,460
I don't know.

545
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,460
I can't even see through

546
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,460
the flashlight.

547
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,460
I am so dizzy.

548
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,460
I can't see anything.

549
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,460
I am so dizzy.

550
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,460
I can't see anything.

551
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,460
Yes.

552
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,460
Be careful.

553
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,460
The bugs have no effect on you.

554
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,460
But if you fall down,

555
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,460
you will fall into hell.

556
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,460
It is not like that.

557
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,460
It is like going to hell.

558
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,460
It is like going to hell.

559
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,460
Wu Xie,

560
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,460
don't be reckless.

561
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,460
What if the oil and salt in the coffin

562
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,460
are shaken again?

563
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,460
Don't worry.

564
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,460
The oil and salt will bite the beast first

565
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,460
and then eat me, the fatty.

566
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,460
It is not your turn.

567
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,460
Take care of yourself.

568
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,460
Is this the entrance?

569
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,460
If we go down,

570
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,460
the rope is not long enough.

571
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,460
And we will be bitten to death by the bugs.

572
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,460
It does not look like the entrance.

573
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,460
It looks more like a trap.

574
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,460
But the problem is

575
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,460
the entrance is only here.

576
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,460
If this is not the entrance,

577
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,460
where else can it be?

578
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,460
Yes.

579
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,460
Yes.

580
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,460
This can't be the entrance.

581
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,460
Where is the entrance?

582
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,460
This is the entrance.

583
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,460
Master San, drink some water.

584
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,460
This is a bit like the puzzle.

585
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,460
Try it.

586
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,460
See if it is a trap.

587
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,460
Wu Xie, we have already checked the original.

588
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,460
Except for the rotation,

589
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,460
it has no effect.

590
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,460
Then who will check it?

591
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,460
We are naive.

592
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,460
We can know the secret of it.

593
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,460
Fatty, stop talking.

594
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,460
Come down and help me.

595
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,460
Okay.

596
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,460
Come down and help me.

597
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,460
Come down and help me.

598
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,460
Come down and help me.

599
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,460
This can rotate.

600
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,460
You rotate the inner circle, I rotate the outer circle.

601
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,460
We should keep the same speed.

602
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,460
I always think that

603
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,460
it is useless to put such a wonderful thing here.

604
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,460
Come down and help me.

605
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,460
Come down and help me.

606
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,460
Come down and help me.

607
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,460
Come down and help me.

608
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,460
Come down and help me.

609
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,460
Come down and help me.

610
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,460
Come down and help me.

611
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,460
Come down and help me.

612
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,460
Come down and help me.

613
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,460
Come down and help me.

614
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,460
Come down and help me.

615
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,460
Come down and help me.

616
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,460
Come down and help me.

617
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,460
Come down and help me.

618
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,460
Come down and help me.

619
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,460
It rotates.

620
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,460
It rotates.

621
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,460
It is aligned.

622
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,460
It is aligned.

623
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,460
It is aligned.

624
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,460
It is aligned. Let's wait.

625
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,460
It stopped.

626
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,460
It stopped.

627
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,460
It seems to be able to...

628
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,460
be able to...

629
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,460
be able to open.

630
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,460
Come.

631
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,460
Come.

632
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,460
Come.

633
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,460
Come.

634
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,460
Come.

635
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,460
Come.

636
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,460
Come.

637
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,460
Except...

638
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,960
Except what?

639
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:27,740
Except the

640
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,460
Except what?

641
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,960
Little devil is a little devil.

642
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,960
He doesn't even know the direction of the dragon.

643
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,960
And he even learned how to break the mechanism.

644
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,960
What a joke.

645
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,960
The direction.

646
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,460
The dragon in the east, the tiger in the west.

647
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,460
The spider in the south, the black tiger in the north.

648
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,460
Fatty, I'll follow the direction, you follow the original.

649
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,460
The dragon is the tomb.

650
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,460
Let's go.

651
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,460
The tiger is the gold.

652
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,460
The black tiger is the water.

653
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,460
The spider is the fire.

The tiger is the fire.

657
