00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 17

2
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,500
How could you be so cruel?

3
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,500
I'll kill you if you continue to be cruel.

4
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,500
As long as you're angry, remember to live.

5
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,000
Do you think you're so lucky every time?

6
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Because of you, I'll kill you.

7
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'll kill you.

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You're back again?

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's finally dawn.

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The sleeping bag is not with us.

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's not like it's moving away from me.

12
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's fine if the little brother is still alive.

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Where's Tianzhen?

14
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Tianzhen!

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Tianzhen!

16
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's not strange to say that we've been here for so long.

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We've been here for so long, but we can't get out.

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We can't stop at this temperature.

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We can't stop.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You're not in here.

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We must have been in this situation after the fire.

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm telling you, there are two kinds of this.

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
One is the cause of the death of the owner of the tomb.

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The other is the cause of the death of the owner of the tomb.

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The other is the cause of the death of the owner of the tomb.

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Ghost?

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Ghost?

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What's wrong? Are you scared?

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm scared of mosquitoes.

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's okay.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's already brave to come in like this.

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Ghost! Ghost!

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Ghost!

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Ghost!

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Go inside!

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Go inside!

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Go inside!

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Don't worry.

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'll take care of this.

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Don't worry.

41
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm not here to help you.

42
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
How can you prevent their harm to you?

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Leave a way for yourself.

44
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's not a bad thing.

45
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You've never really met your uncle.

46
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,100
Kill him.

47
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Don't worry.

48
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,100
Don't worry.

49
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
그래.

50
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'll go and check.

51
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I can't contact Lang Feng.

52
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Is he in trouble?

53
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I don't know if he put the bomb on the guy who just exploded.

54
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'll go and check.

55
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
They're gone.

56
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'll go and check.

57
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's them.

58
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Fatty.

59
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Uncle.

60
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Uncle, are you okay?

61
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm fine.

62
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Don't worry.

63
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Uncle.

64
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I don't know you.

65
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Do you?

66
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yes, I do.

67
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm sure you do.

68
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Uncle.

69
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What's wrong with you?

70
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Speak.

71
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Lang Feng was killed by the gun.

72
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
We couldn't make it.

73
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm fine.

74
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You're a good man.

75
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You're all here.

76
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
We were fighting under the gun.

77
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I thought we were out.

78
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's Lang Feng's gun.

79
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You can use it.

80
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
But you can't use it.

81
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
If Lang Feng was with you,

82
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
it wouldn't have happened.

83
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Fatty.

84
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Look at him.

85
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
He's like Lang Feng.

86
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
He's a good man.

87
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You're not the one who can't see your father.

88
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's empty.

89
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The tunnel is built on the bridge.

90
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
There's a cave.

91
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
But the floor is flat.

92
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So there must be a room for a three-legged boat.

93
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's really a well-built place.

94
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The bridge was so big.

95
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It was so big.

96
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It was so big.

97
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Master.

98
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's bigger than the bridge.

99
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I don't have much money.

100
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
How many more?

101
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Just one.

102
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
There's a wind down there.

103
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It should be possible to go down.

104
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Look at the hole.

105
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's too small.

106
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It can't go through.

107
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It needs to be bigger.

108
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Be careful.

109
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The stone floor was broken.

110
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And the last explosion...

111
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
must have an effect on the underground rock structure.

112
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
If it happens,

113
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
it must be a whole floor.

114
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Then the tunnel will be our territory.

115
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What are you saying?

116
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's so sad.

117
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Since this is the trap designed by Wang Zanghai,

119
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
it's not a real burial.

120
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
We must leave here as soon as possible.

121
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's easy to leave.

122
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But what should we do next?

123
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
We're going to find the companion who lost his life.

124
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
We'll leave after we find him.

125
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Leave now.

126
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You're not good enough.

127
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You should go upstairs.

128
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
There's one more person and one more share.

129
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
We'll leave first.

130
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
We don't want to talk.

131
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Do you know that

132
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
there are other secret passages here?

133
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
After you get to the palace,

134
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
you'll get rid of Jason.

135
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Even if someone tells you the palace is fake,

136
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
just pretend you believe them.

137
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Stay and wait for me there.

138
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'll go upstairs.

139
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I don't understand what you're saying.

140
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So, it's real?

141
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Put the rope down.

142
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Put the rope down.

143
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Come on.

144
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
How is it?

145
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I think

146
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
it's real.

147
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Put it down.

148
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Put it down.

149
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Put it down.

150
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Hold it.

151
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Fatty, what's wrong?

152
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Get up.

153
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
The rope is broken.

154
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's too dangerous.

155
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's okay.

156
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's broken.

157
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
What's wrong?

158
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Something's wrong.

159
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Someone's holding my foot.

160
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's real.

161
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Put it down.

162
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Wait for me.

163
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Put the rope down.

164
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's real.

165
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That's it.

166
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
That's it.

167
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Hurry up.

168
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Fatty.

169
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
That's it.

170
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Hurry up.

171
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Hurry up.

172
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm done!

173
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm done!

174
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm done.

175
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You're okay?

176
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Run!

177
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
My back!

178
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
He's still holding me!

179
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm done! I'm done!

180
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You're still holding me!

181
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You're a fool!

182
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Master!

183
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Master!

184
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Master, are you okay?

185
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm fine.

186
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I said,

187
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
there's a big hole nearby.

188
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Everyone's safe.

189
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Take out the ladder.

190
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Are you okay, Master Sa?

191
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Master Sa,

192
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Master Sa has been hit by a brick.

193
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Take out the ladder.

194
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Take out all the ladder.

195
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Are you okay, Master Sa?

196
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Be careful.

197
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Master Sa.

198
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Be careful.

199
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Be careful.

200
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Master Sa.

201
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Don't move.

202
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Master Sa, are you okay?

203
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Why are you all here?

204
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Is it the legendary

205
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Rohan Jin Mountain,

206
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
the Tang's Hall?

207
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Did you die here?

208
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Pan Zi,

209
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
you've seen the world before.

210
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
What's the harm in dying?

211
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's not a harm.

212
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Everyone is a harm.

213
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Master Sa.

214
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Look at the hole.

215
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It'll break if you touch it.

216
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Master Sa,

217
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
what's that thing that's holding my foot?

218
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I said, Pan Zi,

219
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
you should be smart.

220
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
If it weren't for that body,

221
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
it would have been enough for you.

222
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Don't say that your foot

223
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
would have been gone.

224
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It's not that, Master Sa.

225
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's not enough.

226
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Do you understand?

227
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Pan Zi,

228
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm not talking about you.

229
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You're too little.

230
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You scared me.

231
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I thought you were a big boy.

232
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I can't tell if it's caught or caught.

233
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
These people are not human.

234
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Look at the hole.

235
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
They can take half of the face off.

236
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
They're not human?

237
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Pan Zi,

238
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
why are you so mean?

239
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
What else can they be?

240
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Monster?

241
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
They might be the blood of the legend.

242
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Those teeth

243
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
are made by their own hands.

244
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
These are the customs

245
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
of ancient Saman Sect.

246
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Later on,

247
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
they used fake masks

248
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
to replace them.

249
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
According to their fortune,

250
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
they're not like women or Mongolians.

251
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Look,

252
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
some bodies are made of mahogany.

253
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
They're not like women from the Ming Dynasty.

254
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
They're from the Eastern and Eastern countries.

255
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Their clothes are different from women's clothes.

256
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
No, no.

257
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
The clothes we see on the mural

258
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
are not like that.

259
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
But according to the history,

260
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
the women from the mountain of Changmei

261
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
had a war-hunt since ancient times.

262
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
They were scattered all year long.

263
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
They were moving one by one.

264
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
How many years did they have

265
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
to live in the dead bodies?

266
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I think

267
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
these bodies were the remains

268
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
of the ancient Saman Sect

269
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
when the desert was first built.

270
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
According to you,

271
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
the mountain of Taixing

272
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
used to be the tomb of the desert.

273
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
The land of the desert

274
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
was made of fake masks.

275
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
When the wall of the wall

276
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
was built of fake masks,

277
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
they were all made of them.

278
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'll ask you a question.

279
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Why did they make the bones of the mountain?

280
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Why did they make them here?

281
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Who knows?

282
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's not his idea.

283
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Maybe it's the people from the Eastern countries.

284
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
There are many

285
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
ancient ghost-like things in the Saman Sect.

286
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So I think these bodies

287
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
are related to their ancestors.

288
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
We've analyzed them all.

289
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
What's the point?

290
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
We can't go out.

291
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
We'll see if they're alive.

292
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Be careful.

293
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Why do I think it's a bit dirty?

294
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Let's go there.

295
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Wait a minute.

296
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Hello?

297
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Hua, are you hiding me from the investigation?

298
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm working now.

299
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'll explain it to you later.

300
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I'm not a 3-year-old.

301
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Can I be your witness?

302
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
No, I...

303
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Hua, I'm not your witness.

304
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm not your witness.

305
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I'm not your witness.

306
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'm not your witness.

307
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm not your witness.

308
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm not your witness.

309
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm not your witness.

310
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Hua, this is about my grandma.

311
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm not a witness.

312
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
How can I wait for you to come back?

313
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Baby, okay.

314
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Don't you want the box?

315
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm out there to talk business.

316
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'll be back soon.

317
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Okay?

318
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Are you out of your mind?

319
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Okay, baby.

320
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'll see you tonight.

321
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm feeling bad.

322
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Why are you here?

323
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'm so thirsty.

324
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm gonna drink this today.

325
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You can drink this first.

326
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Alright.

327
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
How is it today?

328
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Not so good.

329
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm gonna get it.

330
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
The white-haired woman in the west is not so good.

331
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
She's drunk.

332
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I almost thought something would happen.

333
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
What could happen here?

334
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You usually come here at night.

335
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You're here so early.

336
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I'm a little worried.

337
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
...cameraıy

338
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Today...

339
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
O........

340
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
O....

341
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Sit down and don't sit anymore.

342
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Sit.

343
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You go get burnt.

344
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
He's a little drunk when he caught fire.

345
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Let's go.

346
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
THE END

347
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,520
Fatty, what are you doing?

348
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,360
Fatty!

349
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,080
Fatty!

350
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,360
Fatty! Fatty!

351
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,520
Fatty!

352
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Fatty!

353
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,520
Fatty, are you okay?

354
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,240
Fatty,

355
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,320
don't forget that you saved Sanye again.

356
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,720
Thank you, Sanye.

357
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,960
What's going on? Tell me.

358
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,760
What happened just now?

359
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,280
Didn't you have to ask us to find a way out?

360
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,760
What?

361
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,960
You're a weirdo, Sanye.

362
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,160
No, no, no.

363
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,280
No.

364
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,360
No, I found a hole in the back of the exit.

365
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,160
I thought I'd just look through the hole.

366
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,560
But I saw a big coin.

367
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,760
It was so big that it was going to drag me down.

368
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,360
It was like a wild boar.

369
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,360
You're still talking to me?

370
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,760
No, that guy is a mother.

371
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,960
He's looking at you.

372
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,760
Why isn't he looking at you?

373
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,960
Why didn't he drag me down?

374
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,360
Fatty, Fatty!

375
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,360
You're a fool.

376
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,360
What are you doing?

377
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,560
They'll kill you.

378
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,760
You're going to save them?

379
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,760
Don't you dare to touch me.

380
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,960
You're a fool.

381
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,160
You're not going to look at your own mother.

382
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,360
Get out of here.

383
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,760
Get out of here.

384
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,360
Fatty!

385
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,360
Fatty!

386
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,360
Brother!

387
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,360
Brother!

388
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,360
Don't you see me?

389
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,360
Don't you see me?

390
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,360
Don't you see what he's doing?

391
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,360
Brother!

392
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,360
Fatty!

393
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,360
Fatty!

394
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,360
You're so smart.

395
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,360
Get up.

396
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,360
Get out.

397
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,360
Get out.

398
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,360
Get out.

399
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,360
Get out.

400
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,360
Get out.

401
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,360
Get out.

402
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,360
Get out.

403
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,360
Come on.

404
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,360
Where are you going?

405
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,360
You're still wearing a d-shirt.

406
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,360
I told you, it's only 2 meters long.

407
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,860
That head is so big.

408
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,360
I've never seen such a big brick.

409
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,860
Is that a change of fate?

410
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,360
Say it slowly. What else?

411
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,360
I was too busy walking.

412
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,860
But I've brought a few pieces of stone board.

413
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,860
It's made by the staff.

414
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,360
The staff?

415
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,860
Senior.

416
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,360
I thought these holes were natural-made fire-sand lava holes.

417
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,360
Or the air-con.

418
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,360
But the diameter of these holes is too big.

419
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,360
The holes at that time couldn't reach this level.

420
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,360
This hole looks like the underground tunnel in the northeast.

421
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,360
The staff who built this tomb back then wasn't the one in the northeast?

422
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,360
They even built a tunnel for themselves.

423
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,360
What's the name of this tunnel?

424
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,360
You're going to be late for the talk.

425
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,360
There's a wind.

426
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,360
But it's not a stone.

427
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,360
It must be connected to some place.

428
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,360
Connected?

429
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,360
Could it be the back door of the head of the Celestial Palace?

430
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,360
Yes, it's the secret passage of the Dragon Head.

431
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,360
The Dragon Head is fake.

432
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,360
What secret passage?

433
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,360
Maybe it's the plan of Wang Sang Hai.

434
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,360
He told us that the Dragon Head is fake.

435
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,360
And he arranged the tomb here.

436
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,360
The most dangerous place is the safest place.

437
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,360
This is the highest.

438
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,360
But the Dragon Head is fake.

439
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,360
Then it's not necessary to dig all these mountains.

440
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,360
And the power and power of the Eastern and Western countries

441
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,360
is hard to make such a big project.

442
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,360
Uncle San, be careful.

443
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,360
Don't come out and attack people.

444
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,360
Sanye, don't pick this.

445
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,360
Everyone is going to the inside.

446
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,360
Sanye, you're the one who's going to do it.

447
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,360
Let's have a democratic meeting.

448
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,360
Let's have a good time.

449
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,360
Right?

450
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,360
Yes.

451
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,360
The hole is going from top to bottom.

452
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,360
I saw the hole just now.

453
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,360
The hole is going from top to bottom.

454
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,360
What does it mean?

455
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,360
It means the hole is going from top to bottom.

456
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,360
Then is it possible that the craftsman

457
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,360
left the exit for himself when he was repairing the power?

458
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,360
There is also a hole in the back door.

459
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,360
It's just sealed.

460
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,360
It can't be broken.

461
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,360
Then they might be connected.

462
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,360
If it's true,

463
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:08,360
then there is a real underground palace and a real funeral.

464
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,360
It's impossible.

465
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,360
That's the underground palace.

466
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,360
The entrance should be under the windmill.

467
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,360
That's the water level.

468
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,360
But I didn't see anything just now.

469
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,360
According to my experience with Tianzhen,

470
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,360
I told you that Wang Sanghai is the one who doesn't go on the road.

471
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,360
Don't be ridiculous.

472
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,360
It's not the right choice.

473
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,360
He doesn't go on the road.

474
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,360
Let me tell you.

475
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,360
What does Sun Ming do?

476
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,360
He just studies in the forest.

477
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,360
He bought a lot of horses.

478
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,360
No one can find him.

479
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,360
Then where does this hole go?

480
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,360
It should be a underground palace in the Cloud Sky Palace.

481
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,360
No way, Uncle Sun.

482
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,360
They are too far away.

483
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,360
Even if the workers want to dig a tunnel for themselves,

484
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,360
there is no need to dig here.

485
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,360
Think about it.

486
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,360
The whole San Sheng Mountain is so big.

487
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,360
They have to dig a tunnel for a long time.

488
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,360
At least for 20 to 30 years.

489
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,360
And at the same time,

490
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,360
who can avoid the soldiers who are in the construction?

491
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,360
You little boy.

492
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,360
You are the only one left.

493
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,360
I'm not the only one left.

494
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,360
I'm the only one left.

495
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,360
If you don't go on the road,

496
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,360
you will be in the tunnel.

497
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,360
Okay.

498
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,360
Let's go down the stairs.

499
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,360
Let's go down together.

500
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,360
Fatty.

501
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,360
Fatty.

502
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,360
No way.

503
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,360
You just go down the stairs.

504
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,360
What about the little boy?

505
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,360
You are worried about him.

506
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,360
Yes, we are here together.

507
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,360
Of course we have to wait for them to go down together.

508
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,360
No.

509
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,360
Master San, sometimes the democracy is not good.

510
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,360
What about the workers?

511
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,360
It's getting dark.

512
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,360
It's the time for the workers to work.

513
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,360
I think we should have a good rest tonight.

514
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,360
We will wait for the day to come.

515
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,360
Okay.

516
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,360
Eat and drink.

517
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,360
Have a good rest tonight.

518
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,360
Sleep.

519
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,360
Master.

520
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,360
You know what?

521
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,360
I'm going to see him.

522
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,360
Go.

523
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,360
Master.

524
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,360
Have you checked the room?

525
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,360
Yes.

526
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,360
I checked it.

527
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,360
Master.

528
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,360
This is Xue Xin Yu.

529
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,360
It's an old friend.

530
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,360
He used a special dye to dye his hair.

531
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,360
He used bamboo juice to make a real show.

532
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,360
So they are not only good at walking,

533
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,360
but also fake?

534
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,360
They are very smart.

535
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,360
They are very smart.

536
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,360
They are very smart.

537
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,360
They are very smart.

538
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,360
They are very smart.

539
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,360
They are very smart.

540
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,360
They are very smart.

541
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,360
They are very smart.

542
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,360
They are very smart.

543
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,360
The Grass Alliance are very smart.

544
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,360
They have their own ideas.

545
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,360
My Lord.

546
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,360
This figure is the first one in the academic club

547
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,360
for a national collection.

548
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,360
Pay attention.

549
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,360
Is this happy news?

550
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,640
I think so.

551
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,040
Yeah.

552
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,800
Have they just buried the prints?

553
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,960
There you order.

554
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,840
Welcome.

555
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,040
See again.

556
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,120
How many of them killed

557
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,640
by stick folders in different countries

558
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,800
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

559
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,360
I've already checked the warehouse.

560
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,360
The internal affairs have been searched.

561
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,360
There are some firecrackers inside.

562
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,360
Doctor, we need to know how many more people are on the road

563
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,360
to the country.

564
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,360
And who is helping them.

565
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,360
And how many cultural relics are being taken by them.

566
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,360
Okay.

567
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,360
But there is a problem.

568
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,360
If there are so many people in the same time,

569
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,360
will they be able to clean the gold snake?

570
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,360
Hurry and check it.

571
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,360
The necessary means should be used.

572
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:29,360
What's wrong? Can't sleep?

573
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,360
You sleep in so many bodies.

574
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:37,360
You still have a voice that comes to you early in the morning.

575
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,360
Is it scary?

576
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,360
What's scary?

577
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,360
You are the most scary when you were a child.

578
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,360
You beat the white gold snake every time.

579
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,360
You just beat the first one and you fell asleep.

580
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:00,360
I never knew that I beat the white gold snake every time.

581
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,360
It's still fun when I was a child.

582
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,360
I was so good at it every day.

583
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,360
I taught this to my uncle.

584
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,360
He taught me how to play with books.

585
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,360
How to trick him.

586
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,360
I was a kid.

587
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,360
You lied to me that you took me out for fun.

588
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,360
But you threw me out.

589
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,360
You asked your aunt to go to a meeting.

590
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,360
You hurt my uncle.

591
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,360
You bullied me when I was a kid.

592
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,360
You still remember that?

593
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,360
You were a kid.

594
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:36,360
You forgot that you were going to beat me up.

595
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,360
What was it?

596
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,360
I remember.

597
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,360
He even let me bite you.

598
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,360
You climbed up the tree and didn't dare to come down.

599
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,360
I didn't leave you behind.

600
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,360
Really?

601
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,360
I couldn't resist until nightfall.

602
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,360
I was so scared.

603
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,360
You were so scared.

604
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,360
You beat me to death.

605
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,360
I remember that you had a headache.

606
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,360
You were bleeding.

607
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,360
You were too heavy and you didn't hold it.

608
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,360
Did you have a scar?

609
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,360
I remember you had a scar.

610
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,360
Let me see.

611
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,360
It's okay.

612
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,360
Let me see.

613
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,360
It's okay.

614
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,360
I remember that scar.

615
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,360
You should be bigger.

616
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,360
You know how to beat me.

617
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,360
I'm sorry.

618
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,360
Even after my mistakes,

619
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:20,360
I didn't wanna tire away from them.

620
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,360
I didn't mind their mistakes.

621
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,360
I just think about it.

622
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,360
I'm sorry I bit you on the way home.

623
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:38,700
Well, I have no family which is freer than my father.

624
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,180
Now your father knows the truth.

625
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,940
And you cannot refuse.

626
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,200
But you're careful.

627
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,540
R tan, leadership has done so much right.

628
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,080
Go tail R tan.

629
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,340
R tan, leadership has done so much right.

630
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,740
Then you forgot that you took me out to play once.

631
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,740
You went to the meeting and threw me on the road.

632
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,240
You made me hit the tree.

633
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,040
Is there?

634
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:06,740
Yes.

635
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,340
Is there?

636
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,340
Yes.

637
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,440
That's all.

638
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,940
You're a kid, aren't you?

639
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,540
Then, then, then, you forgot that you also made me a good joke.

640
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,040
You made me a joke.

641
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,840
You left the scar?

642
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,840
It hurts so much.

643
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,240
You left the scar.

644
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,940
Okay.

645
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,640
Then let me see.

646
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,240
What?

647
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,040
Let me see.

648
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:24,740
Don't look down.

649
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,540
Let me see.

650
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,840
Don't look down.

651
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,540
You really left the scar.

652
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,340
It hurts so much.

653
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,340
Enough, Uncle San.

654
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,340
You're such a little boy.

655
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,840
You're still afraid of losing.

656
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,940
You little boy.

657
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,940
You...

658
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,940
You little...

659
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,940
Uncle San, Uncle San, it hurts so much.

660
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,340
It hurts so much.

661
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,340
If you don't call me, I won't be able to perform.

662
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:45,340
I'll teach you how to perform.

663
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,940
Hey, look!

664
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,940
Look at that bruise.

665
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:05,440
He's definitely形ing like a monkey.

666
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,340
He's got a kind of physical form and is formless.

667
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,440
Look at his formless physical form and is formless.

668
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,340
Look at a figure.

669
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,340
A figure.

670
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,440
His face.

671
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,440
What does he look like?

672
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,440
A figure with a Radar.

673
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,240
A hat.

674
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,140
What is he looking for?

675
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,140
A recognize?

676
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,140
You're not sure?

677
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:16,940
A from a friend?

678
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:17,940
A deer hand like.

679
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:18,940
Yes.

680
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,140
A man has a real first name after a friend.

681
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,440
A person with his friend is a person with the highest physical form.

682
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,740
He has discovered some strange things.

683
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,540
How do we find him?

684
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:26,440
We also found him by chance.

685
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,340
Interesting!

686
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,340
Master, you and your disciple...

687
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:32,340
I'll be with Huahua.

688
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,340
Okay.

689
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,340
Master, don't worry.

690
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,340
I'll take care of Mr. San.

691
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,340
See you later.

692
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,340
Take care of Mr. San.

693
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,340
Let's go, uncle San.

694
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,340
Okay.

695
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,340
Let's go.

696
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:13,340
Master, don't you want to throw us out?

697
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:16,340
You're not reliable enough to follow us.

698
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,340
Master.

699
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,340
Master.

700
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,340
Master, wake up.

701
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,340
Master.

702
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,340
What's wrong with you, Master?

703
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,340
Master!

704
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,340
Master!

705
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,340
What's wrong?

706
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:05,340
I think he's gone.

707
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,340
Okay.

708
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,340
How is he?

709
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,340
He's gone.

710
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,340
Master.

711
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,340
Master.

712
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,340
Master, wake up.

713
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,340
Master.

714
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,340
I told you, he's old and not safe.

715
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,340
You're going to the school.

716
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,340
Shut up.

717
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,340
What kind of person is that?

718
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,340
No.

719
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,340
Is he a low-ranking man?

720
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,340
Hurry up.

721
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,340
In this extreme situation,

722
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,340
there's a possibility of death.

723
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,340
Have you seen the boy?

724
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,340
No?

725
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,340
What?

726
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,340
Help me.

727
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:18,340
Let him go.

728
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,340
No.

729
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,340
No!

730
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,340
Let'sni...

731
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,340
Let's go.

732
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:03,340
The shadow of the past year is reflected in the sky

733
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:06,340
The silent wind

734
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,340
The wind is blowing, the road is lightening

735
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,340
What's the meaning of self-pity

736
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:22,340
Passing through the night, passing through the fog

737
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:26,340
The answer is hidden in the darkness

738
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:30,340
The light of time is reflected in the sky

739
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:33,340
The flowers blooming in the spring sun

740
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:36,340
The answer is hidden in the darkness

741
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:42,340
The wind is blowing, the road is lightening

742
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:00,340
The wind is blowing, the road is lightening

743
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:03,340
What's the meaning of self-pity

744
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,340
Passing through the night, passing through the fog

745
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:09,340
The answer is hidden in the darkness

746
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:13,340
The light of time is reflected in the sky

747
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:16,340
The flowers blooming in the spring sun

748
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:19,340
The answer is hidden in the darkness

749
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:23,340
The wind is blowing, the road is lightening

750
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:28,340
What's the meaning of self-pity
