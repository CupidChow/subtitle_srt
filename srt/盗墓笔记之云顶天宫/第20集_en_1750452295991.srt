1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Episode 15

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Episode 16

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 16

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You guys found that there's not a single thing missing.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What did you find?

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Food.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Look. We've finished all of them.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
They didn't die of surprise.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
They were all dead.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
No.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
There's no food or water in this person.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
They've been there for seven days.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Think about it.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
They've already escaped for seven days.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
They're still waiting for death here.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That's weird. They must be dead.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Unless...

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
they can't get out.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Take it.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Tian Zhen.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This place isn't as big as the sea.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's more like a cave.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's like a elevator.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It might have doors, but it doesn't.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Anyway, we've got enough of this place.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
If it's not enough, we'll have to go.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
All right.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Shun Zi,

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
when your father was carrying several people into the tomb,

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
do you still remember?

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I remember

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
he left with seven people.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's eight people.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
There are six bodies here.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Two people disappeared.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Could it be that those two people

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
were trying to kill each other and then ran away?

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
No way.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
There's no signal of fighting here.

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And the movements and expressions of the bodies

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
don't look like they were killed.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Someone died here.

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I feel strange.

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Don't forget that we're here to stand up.

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I've just spoken to my sister.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The door was opened.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And there's only a treasure chest here.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
There's no coffin.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The number of people who came here

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
means that there's a name.

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It must be An Ji.

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
After that,

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
we're waiting for the second team to come and collect the treasure.

67
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
No way.

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The hole on the jade door

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
looks more like the bodies.

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Anyway, no matter what,

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
the coffin is not here.

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We need to go in the opposite direction.

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And Uncle San is also there.

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Right.

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Let's go find Uncle San.

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm going to the other side.

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm going to the other side.

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm going to the other side.

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm going to the other side.

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm going to the other side.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm going to the other side.

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm going to the other side.

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm going to the other side.

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm going to the other side.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm going to the other side.

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm going to the other side.

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm going to the other side.

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm going to the other side.

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm going to the other side.

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm going to the other side.

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm going to the other side.

92
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
There's no hiding place.

93
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Hurry and hide and come inside.

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
No hidden progress.

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hurry up.

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Thanks, Uncle San.

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'll help them out.

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
See you later.

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
OK.

100
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Thanks, Uncle San.

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Bye.

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Bye.

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Xiao, since I brought Xiu Xiu back last time,

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I can't contact her anymore.

105
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You're not obedient, so you should take care of her.

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You turned Xiu Xiu off?

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Xie Zi, you're actually not bad.

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But since Second Master and Ninth Master left,

109
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
you're also not good at teaching.

110
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I always thought that the person who loves Xiu Xiu the most is you.

111
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
If I don't love her, how could I let her go with you to escape?

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Escape?

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You wrote such a simple sentence,

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
you've given up all of her efforts.

115
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What are you afraid of?

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Is this the tone you're talking to a master?

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You just did what you came in to do,

118
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
and you're not satisfied with it.

119
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
This thing has been delayed until Qiu Dekou and Jason's second law firm

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
were in the Chinese department.

121
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This department has already started before the release.

122
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
In the past few decades,

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I can't imagine how many things they've done.

124
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But I can be sure that

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
they'll be the ones to take care of the people who killed Hai Ding Mu.

126
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And it also directly concerns the death of my uncle

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and the disappearance of your daughter Huo Ling.

128
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I don't believe that you can actually do such a simple thing

129
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
without seeing it.

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Xie Zi, you're a person.

131
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You have a good self-confidence,

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
but if you're blind,

133
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
then you've become a disadvantage.

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Understand?

135
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You can't harm others, and you can't even make others suffer.

136
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Why did you give me that photo?

137
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What do you want to tell me?

138
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm a little tired.

139
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You're old.

140
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Old Jiu Man Zhong,

141
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
you and Chen Pi A 4 are the only ones who are still alive.

142
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
We don't care about Chen Pi A 4.

143
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
These past few years,

144
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm afraid you feel very deeply

145
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
about your own body.

146
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
No one can escape from the natural law.

147
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You're right.

148
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's true.

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
How many people are so generous,

150
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
how many beautiful and handsome people

151
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
will die old.

152
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
After they die,

153
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
they'll become rich and rich.

154
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
No one can escape.

155
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Then why did you ask for a different way?

156
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Did he use this trick to seduce you

157
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
and convince you to help him?

158
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
If that's the case,

159
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
then isn't the underground palace very complicated?

160
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We can't get in and out.

161
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Probably not.

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Many people are stressed out by the scientists.

163
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's not easy to make people die.

164
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Many people are so exhausted that they'll die if they give up.

165
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes, no problem.

166
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You can go out.

167
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I don't know where he went.

168
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But he must have gone faster than us.

169
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
He's faster than us.

170
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
He's also faster.

171
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
He's a bit damaged.

172
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
He's not good at dealing with people.

173
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Don't touch this.

174
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm not with him.

175
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I don't know how he's been treated by the fire.

176
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
He's so worried.

177
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I thought you were his nephew.

178
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You're not my uncle!

179
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You said I'm not your uncle.

180
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Tell me who I am.

181
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You are Xie.

182
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Lian Huan.

183
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Kid, in this world,

184
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
only one person can't hurt you.

185
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That's me, your uncle.

186
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Tianzhen.

187
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Tianzhen.

188
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Hello?

189
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm leaving.

190
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Hello?

191
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Come in.

192
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Is it the same?

193
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
The same one?

194
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
No, that's the same.

195
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's so open.

196
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
They've been robbed again.

197
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Let's go.

198
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You're not going to let me go?

199
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
No, I won't.

200
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You've been robbed, right?

201
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Let's go.

202
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
How much is this?

203
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Another treasure?

204
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What did I say?

205
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I didn't lie to you.

206
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's another national treasure.

207
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
A silver.

208
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
A silver.

209
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Why is it another body?

210
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Why is it another body?

211
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
We're back.

212
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The last person who asked me this

213
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
has been blinded by the wolf.

214
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You're not old.

215
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
How many people have you dreamt of?

216
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I didn't expect there's still a market today.

217
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Do you usually don't buy the three-duty products?

218
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I don't.

219
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I met a fake master a while ago.

220
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
He told me something interesting.

221
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
His life

222
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
was the perfect product.

223
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's a human-like mask.

224
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
He said that after he wears it,

225
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
even his parents

226
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
can't distinguish the truth.

227
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Truth?

228
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yeah.

229
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Let me tell you something.

230
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,480
You have to do it all.

231
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,600
What's going on?

232
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,160
What's going on?

233
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,160
Shunzi.

234
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,800
I know the death is great,

235
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,560
but it's likely that it's your father's fault.

236
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,840
These bodies are here.

237
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,640
It's been so many years and it's easy to get caught.

238
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,560
So you should put your father down first.

239
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,760
Let's go one more time.

240
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,360
I won't.

241
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,920
Fang Yan.

242
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,920
Fang Yan.

243
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,640
Fatty, calm down.

244
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,640
Fatty,

245
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,160
we can't mess up at this time.

246
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Fang Yan.

247
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You often say that

248
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Wang Zang Hai's stuff

249
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
is just a little trick

250
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
that makes you feel stressed.

251
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
We can't know

252
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
that this is a big deal.

253
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
There must be something wrong.

254
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yes.

255
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Pan Zi is right.

256
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
This must be the mechanism.

257
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
There's no relationship

258
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
between Shunzi's father and this body.

259
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
We've been through it

260
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
when we were in the bottom of the sea.

261
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
There's no ghost force in this world.

262
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Wang Zang Hai is like this.

263
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
He's good at using these strange mechanisms

264
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
to create this kind of weird atmosphere.

265
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
When we don't know the bottom of the sea,

266
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
we're easily caught by him.

267
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
We can't just walk away.

268
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
One more time.

269
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Pan Zi,

270
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
let's go slowly this time.

271
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Let's see if we can

272
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
find the mechanism.

273
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I don't believe that he's not dead.

274
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Pan Zi,

275
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
let's go slowly this time.

276
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Let's go slowly this time.

277
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Let's go slowly this time.

Let's go slowly this time.

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Let's go slowly this time.

00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Let's go slowly this time.

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Let's go slowly this time.

00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Let's go slowly this time.

00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Let's go slowly this time.

Let's go slowly this time.

Let's go slowly this time.

288
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Let's go slowly this time.

289
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Let's go slowly this time.

290
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Let's go slowly this time.

Let's go slowly this time.

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Let's go slowly this time.

00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Let's go slowly this time.

296
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Let's go slowly this time.

297
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000

00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Let's go slowly this time.

370
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Let's go slowly this time.

371
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Let's go slowly this time.

372
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Let's go slowly this time.

373
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Let's go slowly this time.

374
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Let's go slowly this time.

375
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Let's go slowly this time.

376
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Let's go slowly this time.

377
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Let's go slowly this time.

378
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Let's go slowly this time.

379
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Let's go slowly this time.

380
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Let's go slowly this time.

381
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Let's go slowly this time.

382
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Let's go slowly this time.

383
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Let's go slowly this time.

384
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Let's go slowly this time.

385
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Let's go slowly this time.

386
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Let's go slowly this time.

387
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Let's go slowly this time.

388
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Let's go slowly this time.

389
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Let's go slowly this time.

390
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Let's go slowly this time.

391
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Let's go slowly this time.

392
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Let's go slowly this time.

393
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Let's go slowly this time.

394
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Let's go slowly this time.

395
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:34,000
No, no, no.

396
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It turns out that this is the Holy Spirit.

397
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Even if we can help her with this kind of appearance,

398
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
we can't help her with her temperament.

399
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Yes.

400
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
We never found out about her father and I.

401
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
When we found out,

402
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
it was too late.

403
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It was completely lost.

404
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The entire team was destroyed.

405
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yes.

406
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I heard that only the three of them came back.

407
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
He said that something happened to Xie's Xie Lian Huan.

408
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
They asked him to open the investigation boat and send the body back.

409
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Then he got married in the bottom of the sea.

410
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
When he woke up, he was already in the case.

411
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
He didn't know what happened to the others.

412
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Xie Lian Huan is dead? Where is the body?

413
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
The investigation boat was not in the case.

414
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
He was also missing.

415
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
He was also missing?

416
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Yes.

417
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
The entire investigation team,

418
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
the entire investigation team,

419
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
more than twenty people,

420
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
only one of the three of them was left.

421
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Yes.

422
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
What do you mean?

423
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
The Huo Ling that we went out with,

424
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
it's not that Huo Ling anymore.

425
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Who else is it?

426
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I don't believe that you didn't notice anything.

427
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
With your words,

428
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I should believe you, right?

429
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You know her better than I do.

430
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Maybe I don't know what's going on between them.

431
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
But according to my observation and my opinion,

432
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
the truth is that

433
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
if you don't believe me, I can't do anything.

434
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
No matter what,

435
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I have to find someone to judge.

436
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I also want to find them immediately.

437
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Even if it's not for others,

438
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
for myself,

439
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
for Wenjing,

440
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I also have to find them.

441
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
But have you thought about it?

442
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Only you are the one who came back.

443
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
This is a big problem.

444
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
This is a big problem, understand?

445
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Yes, this is a problem.

446
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Luckily,

447
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I can still come back alive.

448
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
At that time,

449
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I didn't believe in Wu Sanxing.

450
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
On the contrary,

451
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
these were all his tricks.

452
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
He wanted to destroy the Huo family

453
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
and the Xie family.

454
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
He wanted to destroy the Xie family and the Huo family.

455
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
But after a long time,

456
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I received a pair of gloves.

457
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I didn't know that.

458
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
He wore this dress.

459
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It was the last life of our mother and daughter.

460
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It was the first week before the trial.

461
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
He changed his clothes and came back.

462
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
He told me that

463
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
he put oil on the unit's machine

464
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
and changed his clothes.

465
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Let me out.

466
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Let me out.

467
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
What are you guys doing?

468
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Let me out.

469
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Let me out.

470
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Let me out.

471
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm Lin Ling.

472
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Mom.

473
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Mom.

474
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Help me.

475
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Mom.

476
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I understand.

477
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
No wonder you didn't suspect me.

478
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I really don't dare to act on this road.

479
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I don't want the outsiders to know.

480
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Especially the Ninth Lord.

481
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
He will judge the conspiracy

482
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:05,000
and find out the person behind the clues on this road.

483
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
With his clever and clever mind,

484
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
what will he do?

485
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It's hard to predict.

486
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Maybe my Lin Ling will be harmed.

487
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
So my grandpa thought that

488
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
it was an accident.

489
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
With the wisdom of the Ninth Lord,

490
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:43,000
he must have seen through the secret.

491
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
But with his personality,

492
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I don't know what else he can do.

493
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Besides, Xie Lian Huan's body is still missing.

494
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So what did the Ninth Lord tell him?

495
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Uncle, you're back.

496
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
What did you do?

497
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
He's your uncle Wu Jia.

498
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Your uncle's cousin.

499
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
They look alike.

500
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Uncle, hello.

501
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
This is Lian Huan's child.

502
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
The Ninth Lord.

503
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Song Ke.

504
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:19,420
You'd be dead hundreds of years ago.

505
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,780
You rescued new ladies looking like them.

506
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,780
After that...

507
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,160
I've been dealt as a disaster.

508
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,140
Help me!

509
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:35,340
Help me!

510
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,560
Help me!

511
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,680
Help me!

512
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
They installed the small decoration of the self-destruct.

513
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
They burned it after they saw it.

514
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
They almost caused the disaster.

515
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
That was the third year after Lingling was missing.

516
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
The clothes were not changed.

517
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
They were very crispy.

518
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
There was no words.

519
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
They were standing on the bed.

520
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
The height and Lingling were almost the same.

521
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It was the same level of water.

522
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
But there is no proof.

523
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
That was the time you were missing.

524
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Yes.

525
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And this self-destruct also made me very confused.

526
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
There must be some small details.

527
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I saw it many times.

528
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
They just destroyed it after they saw it.

529
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Since that fire,

530
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
there has been no news of Lingling.

531
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I really dare not hide.

532
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I thought there was a life of Lingling.

533
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
So for so many years,

534
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
you didn't do too much for Huoling's missing.

535
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
You just lost the Wu Family.

536
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Especially when Xiuxiu was investigating this matter,

537
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
you deliberately stopped her.

538
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I understand.

539
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
But the actions you made

540
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
made me look down on you.

541
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Why did you give me that photo?

542
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I want you to see the true face

543
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
of both Gu Sanxing and Wu Xie.

544
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
It's time.

545
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
You still want to lie?

546
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
What I told you is true.

547
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I want to see the true face of you.

548
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
True face, Xie.

549
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
A woman living in the old house

550
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
who is not a good person,

551
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
she must see people.

552
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Look at me.

553
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I have been thinking for decades.

554
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
No matter who is too strict,

555
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I can see it clearly.

556
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I must see Wu Sanxing.

557
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And we are not talking about

558
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
what Lingling and Wu Sanxing are.

559
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
What is the purpose behind it?

560
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
The whole team is coming back to her.

561
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Isn't this a big problem?

562
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
You just don't want to make Wu Sanxing feel better.

563
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
You know very well

564
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
about your novel.

565
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Do you still think Wu Sanxing is innocent?

566
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
What I know is that

567
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Qiu Dekou did participate in the Haidimu world

568
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
and has direct connection with the missing of the test team.

569
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
You are working with her at this time.

570
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Is it because of your daughter's whereabouts

571
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
or because of her secret heart?

572
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Qiu Dekou said that you helped her.

573
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
It should not be the whereabouts of your daughter.

574
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:51,780
Then her

575
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:54,780
I am not sure if you believe it.

576
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,780
I have already done my best.

577
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,780
No.

578
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,780
What I am sure is that

579
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,780
she has three doubts.

580
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,780
If she takes out the evidence,

581
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,780
then I am afraid that

582
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,780
she will also believe it.

583
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:14,780
What evidence does she want?

584
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,780
Yun Ding Tian Palace.

585
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,780
The palace is a secret palace.

586
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,780
The palace is a secret palace.

587
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,780
The palace is a secret palace.

588
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,780
The palace is a secret palace.

589
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:36,780
The palace is a secret palace.

590
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,780
The palace is a secret palace.

591
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,780
The palace is a secret palace.

592
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,780
The palace is a secret palace.

593
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,780
The palace is a secret palace.

594
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:52,780
The palace is a secret palace.

595
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,780
Jia Sha.

596
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:15,780
Are you ready for your winter vacation?

597
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,780
Yes, we are.

598
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,780
We'll be in the east of the country tonight.

599
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,780
We'll be able to get to the mountain by the day.

600
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,780
We've checked it out.

601
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,780
The weather is good these days.

602
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,780
The mountain road won't be too difficult to walk.

603
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,780
And we've already planned the road to the top of the clouds.

604
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,780
Okay.

605
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,780
Mr. Hua, do you think

606
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,780
we should go to the top of the clouds?

607
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,780
I always think...

608
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,780
There are some things

609
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,780
that I need to make sure I can get it right.

610
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,780
I'll go.

611
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,780
Let's do it again.

612
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,780
I'm sure I can get it right this time.

613
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,780
The Taoist Taoist will be back.

614
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,780
You...

615
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,780
Just die for this.

616
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,780
I've been wasting time there.

617
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,780
Do you know how long we've been here?

618
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,780
It's all a big deal.

619
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,780
That wood knife...

620
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,780
we can't get back.

621
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,780
How do you know?

622
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,780
Look at it yourself.

623
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,780
Those people

624
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,780
are definitely more than the number of people we've been here with.

625
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,780
Pan Zi,

626
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,780
let's measure the food first.

627
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,780
We need to make the plan for the long-term war.

628
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,780
The longer we live,

629
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,780
the more chances we get to go out.

630
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,780
Mr. Xiao,

631
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,780
I think

632
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,780
the food we have left

633
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,780
is enough to eat two tons.

634
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,780
I don't think we need to measure it.

635
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,780
Just make some soup.

636
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,780
If the medicine is not useful,

637
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,780
just wait and see.

638
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,780
All right.

639
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,780
All right.

640
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,780
Then, Mr. Chen,

641
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,780
get ready to eat.

642
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,780
I'm afraid that Mr. Fatty will be distracted.

643
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,780
He'll be distracted.

644
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,780
I can't figure out

645
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,780
how to get out of here.

646
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,780
Right?

647
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,780
I'll get some food.

648
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,780
Shun Zi.

649
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,780
Shun Zi.

650
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,780
Shun Zi.

651
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,780
Hurry up.

652
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,780
We can't hold it.

653
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,780
Come on, it's okay if it's Xiao Ge.

654
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:48,860
oh

655
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,940
Mr.

656
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,940
How about

657
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,860
rest

658
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,360
He is a good guy

659
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,600
right now

660
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,380
We don't know what's going on

661
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,640
We need to take up length with Xiao Ge

662
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,160
Tie him up!

663
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,160
Calm down.

664
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,120
The entire underground palace is a haunted house.

665
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,440
The middle is the spiritual hall.

666
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,320
This is the most serious place to know.

667
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,840
Wang Zanghai won't be doing his job on this part of the structure.

668
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,800
There are also the Shunzang pit, Peizang pit,

669
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,680
the water system and the complex tunnel.

670
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,440
We are likely to be outside the underground palace now.

671
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,600
So...

672
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,360
So?

673
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,360
So...

674
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,880
So...

675
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,760
So...

676
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,520
Okay, I've made up my mind.

677
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,240
The way we think is not right at all.

678
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,840
So, it's not right.

679
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,720
Can you say something that's right and useful?

680
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,720
I'm not wrong.

681
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,400
We're now thinking about your wasteful time and your physical strength.

682
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,400
Why don't we write down all the possibilities?

683
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,680
After we've reached a few,

684
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,000
we can just verify it, right?

685
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,440
What do you mean?

686
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,920
You should have made it clear.

687
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,200
Come on, take the notebook.

688
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,760
Don't make any trouble here. Hurry up.

689
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,280
Everyone says that this is impossible.

690
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,080
There's no possibility.

691
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,360
We don't need to talk about details.

692
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,200
Okay? Come on.

693
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:29,920
There's a mechanism.

694
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,000
Yes, there's a mechanism. What else?

695
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,240
I think something is affecting our feelings.

696
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,680
It's like a psychological case or something that's hypnotizing.

697
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,880
It makes us not know what to do.

698
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,480
I thought I was being assassinated.

699
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,760
I've experienced it myself.

700
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,960
What else is there?

701
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,640
From the theory, there's a possibility that it's a space folding.

702
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,360
Don't make any noise.

703
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,720
Say something a little...

704
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,120
The third lord is the most intelligent.

705
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,600
Maybe he's right.

706
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,200
Write it down.

707
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,720
Okay, space folding.

708
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,760
Then, the fat lord thinks there's a ghost.

709
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,440
Is there a fifth one?

710
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,280
Is there a fifth one?

711
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,280
Is there a fifth one?

712
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,240
Okay, let's think about it later.

713
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,840
The first one is the first one.

714
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,920
The second one can prove it together.

715
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,440
Take it.

716
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,320
Give me the gun.

717
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,000
Okay.

718
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,920
I'll go to the wooden entrance.

719
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,720
I'll shoot from there. Let's see what happens.

720
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,640
You said you knew what was going on.

721
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,600
You said you knew what was going on.

722
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,040
Shoot?

723
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,840
Yes.

724
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,880
Pan Zi, let's talk about the second one.

725
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,440
If it's a wrong decision, the bullet doesn't have a feeling.

726
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,080
The wood can affect our feeling, but it can't affect the bullet.

727
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,080
So, if the situation here can be explained in detail,

728
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,360
the bullet will definitely hit the wood's lens.

729
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,880
Also, the first one, if it's a mechanical trap,

730
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,800
such a short wood,

731
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,240
within a short two seconds, the bullet will definitely hit the head.

732
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,960
Without a mechanical trap, it can take so long to perform.

733
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,040
Pan Zi, you're so beautiful.

734
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,440
You're very good at scientific spirit.

735
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,320
Let's go.

736
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,840
Pan Zi!

737
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,640
Pan Zi, what are you doing?

738
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,560
Are you okay?

739
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,560
Where did you take the gun?

740
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,040
The friend sent a message to the wooden entrance.

741
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,880
I took it out.

742
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,760
The bullet came back after a while.

743
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,920
The friend who killed him almost shot him.

744
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,080
Don't be so nervous. Hurry up and find the bullet.

745
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,920
Hurry up and find the bullet.

746
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,360
The bullet came back.

747
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,160
Isn't this the place?

748
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,040
Here you go.

749
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,480
The big gun.

750
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,200
Take it.

751
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,600
All right.

752
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,880
Here you go.

753
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,880
We're back.

754
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,880
We're back.

755
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,880
We have a signal.

756
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,880
Sir.

757
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,880
Where are you?

758
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,880
What's the status?

759
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,360
Sir, we are at the Pente Corridor in the Sky Palace.

760
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,720
Some hallucination occurred.

761
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:25,680
They will be walking in circles for over seven hours, but still lost.

762
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,680
How is that possible?

763
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,520
We've lost our chance to get to the Sky Palace.

764
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,520
We're going to the Sky Palace.

765
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,620
The way is Snape and I didn't know.

766
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:40,200
We gathered a lot of people all through the prison.

767
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,360
This � I was looking for.

768
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,760
I failed to get on the route.

769
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,880
But it was a labyrinth.

770
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,280
I can say it looks plausible.

771
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,960
I feel it's the most elaborate way out.

772
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,620
Go take a deep breath.

773
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,620
Because that's what it would look like.

774
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:02,620
If there's anyone here that wishes to investigate the crime,

775
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,620
Don't you hang up. Walk the carriers again.

776
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,620
Jisun, Sir said...

777
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,620
Shut up!

778
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,620
The pattern has changed.

779
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,620
It's changed. It's a hundred-spirit bug.

780
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,620
When will it change?

781
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,620
It will.

782
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,620
I can't go down.

783
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,620
Where are we now?

784
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,620
We have to find a way to get out earlier.

785
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,620
Listen to me. Use the explosives to open it.

786
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,620
No! If there are other mechanisms...

787
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:51,620
Even if there are mechanisms, it's also an old mechanism for hundreds of years.

788
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,620
We have explosives.

789
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,620
Open it well. Listen to me.

790
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,620
If it's not just the mechanisms, it's something else.

791
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:01,620
Listen to Woosan Xing. Use the dynamite.

792
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,620
Prepare the explosives.

793
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,620
Yes, sir.

794
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,620
How is it?

795
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,620
Are you afraid of this test?

796
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,620
Isn't it amazing?

797
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,620
Isn't it just a piece of cake?

798
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,620
How is it?

799
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,620
It's just a big wall.

800
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,620
It's impossible to be a big wall.

801
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,620
Stop talking nonsense.

802
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,620
We've seen it in person.

803
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,620
What's the third one now?

804
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,620
Oh, right. Your...

805
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,620
Hurry up. Your ring is covered.

806
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,620
What should I do?

807
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,620
Brother.

808
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,620
What's wrong?

809
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,620
What's wrong?

810
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,620
What's wrong?

811
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,620
At that time,

812
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,620
would it be a space shuttle?

813
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,620
Yes.

814
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,620
But how do you prove it?

815
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,620
What's wrong?
