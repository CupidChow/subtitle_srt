00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 2

2
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Hey, kid. What are you looking for?

3
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Third Uncle?

4
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Stop investigating my body. I'll get you out.

5
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Third Uncle?

6
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
After you get out, I'm not your Third Uncle anymore.

7
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Otherwise, you'll die like this.

8
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Okay. Go die.

9
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Third Uncle! Third Uncle!

10
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
After the investigation, Wu Xie, Wang Pangzi, and Zhang Qiling

11
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
discovered that Qiu Degao had a greater intention for Chinese culture.

12
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
In the Miu Village in Guizhou, Zhang Jun was punished to die.

13
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
To stop Qiu Degao from dying, Wu Xie was in danger and couldn't escape.

14
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Third Uncle was left dead.

15
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Fortunately, Wu Xie was rescued by the rescue team.

16
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The mystery came to an end.

17
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Wu Xie had to set foot on the journey to find the truth again.

18
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
My child, we've never had true happiness in our lives.

19
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
If that's the case, why can't we let go of this?

20
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Third Uncle, save me.

22
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Don't you care about your friends? If you don't go, they'll die.

23
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Life and truth are more important to you.

24
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Third Uncle, tell me the truth.

25
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So many people died. You can't just leave like this.

26
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I want to leave. Can anyone stop me?

27
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
For the sake of my post, I'm warning you.

28
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Stop it. Don't put yourself in danger.

29
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's not worth it.

30
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Third Uncle, it's not worth it.

31
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Third Uncle, what do you mean by it's not worth it?

32
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What do you think is worth it?

33
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Third Uncle!

34
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Doctor!

35
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
He's regained his ability to sense and react to the outside world.

36
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Once the situation is stable, we can start treating him more actively.

37
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Thank you. These last two months have been really...

38
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You're welcome.

39
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
How is it?

40
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Two months. Tianzhen finally reacted today.

41
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
No one would have thought that Third Uncle would do something like that.

42
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You were all there.

43
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Xiao Xiao, stop talking.

44
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's possible that it's a misunderstanding even if we haven't investigated it.

45
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's not possible.

46
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,820
The

47
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
If you want to know the secret of your Third Uncle, go to this address.

48
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What are you doing?

49
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What is this place?

50
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yours.

51
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Snake Eye Copper Fish.

52
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Who are you?

53
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Who told you to give this to me?

54
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Did you go to the hospital to find me?

55
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You...

56
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
When I found him, I put this in my pocket.

57
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You're looking for Third Uncle again.

58
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You're awake.

59
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
How is it?

60
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Wait. I'll call a doctor.

61
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
No need.

62
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm fine.

63
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
If you're fine, the doctor will decide.

64
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Wait. I said no need.

65
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Why didn't you tell us when you went out?

66
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I was busy with my own business.

67
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What do you mean your own business?

68
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Aren't we friends? We're friends.

69
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm fine by myself.

70
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm going to the hospital today.

71
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You guys should go do your own business.

72
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
No, how can we do that? You're not fully recovered yet. How can you go to the hospital?

73
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
No, Tianzhen. I know you want to find your Third Uncle in a hurry.

74
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But we can help you.

75
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What do you know?

76
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I've been alone in the hospital for a long time.

77
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I want to go home when I'm free.

78
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You should go back to where you belong.

79
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Go back.

80
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Tianzhen, you don't have to do this.

81
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Wu Xie.

82
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Since Guizhou, Fatty has been watching you and taking care of you.

83
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You haven't been home yet.

84
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You treat him like this. It's not right.

85
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
We can understand your feelings.

86
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
But you're the person in charge. Wu Sanxing is your Third Uncle.

87
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
He doesn't care about our lives.

88
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
He left us in the desert to cooperate with American civil and military criminals.

89
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
No matter what the reason is, he has his problems.

90
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You're my friends.

91
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But you're not me.

92
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
My Third Uncle may be a bad person.

93
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But he's also my Third Uncle.

94
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
No matter what, I can't let go.

95
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Let's see how he goes on.

96
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I owe you a lot.

97
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I don't want to owe you more.

98
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm okay by myself.

99
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Okay.

100
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
If you want to know your Third Uncle's secret, go to this address.

101
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Wu Sanxing.

102
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Open the door!

103
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Wu Sanxing, what do you mean?

104
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Wu Sanxing!

105
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Open the door!

106
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Third Uncle.

107
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Did you see it?

108
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What did you see?

109
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
This is the place where you were.

110
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
This is the place where you were.

111
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
This is the place where you were.

112
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What did you see?

113
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
This?

114
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Or this?

115
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Third Uncle, you...

116
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
How did you...

117
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Wu Sanxing...

118
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You killed me.

119
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Wu Sanxing...

120
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Is there anyone here?

121
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Ye...

122
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Why are you here?

123
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Uncle Hai?

124
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Qilin blood.

125
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's the most valuable thing on me.

126
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Do you think it's okay?

127
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Then I won't be polite to Uncle Hai.

128
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
If you need anything,

129
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
just ask.

130
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Where's my Third Uncle?

131
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Where's my Third Uncle?

132
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I really don't know.

133
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Uncle Hai, the Guangxi Jing'er Palace in the news

134
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
is recorded in the entire Guangxi,

135
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
even within the country's scope.

136
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And I can't find the exact location on the map.

137
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But Uncle Hai,

138
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
you must know where it is.

139
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
This Jing'er Palace

140
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
is the saying of the Changsha people.

141
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
According to the North Sect,

142
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
it's called the Yin-Yang-Su.

143
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
For example,

144
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
this room.

145
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Under this room,

146
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
there's a room that's exactly the same.

147
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
If you dig it out,

148
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
you'll find that they're completely the same.

149
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Jing'er Palace! Jing'er Palace!

150
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Uncle Hai,

151
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
what does this stone tower have to do with my Third Uncle?

152
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Under this stone tower is the Jing'er Palace.

153
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
This Jing'er Palace has discovered the Snake Eye Copper Fish.

154
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
What do you think it has to do with it?

155
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
As long as I go there,

156
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
and find that thing,

157
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I can see my Third Uncle.

158
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Right?

159
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Jing'er Palace

160
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Jing'er Palace

161
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Go!

162
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Go Mr. Honrei over!

163
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Hurry!

164
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Third Uncle!

165
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Jing'er Palace

166
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
How could you do this to Xie Lian Huan?

167
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You traitor!

168
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
So fast.

169
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You're still waiting for your Third Uncle?

170
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
This fight of yours is worth it.

171
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Let's go.

172
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'll take you to eat fried liver.

173
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Little girl.

174
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Third Uncle,

175
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'll always trust you.

176
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Jing'er Palace

177
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Mr. Honrei!

178
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
The body is immune to the toxin in the Asian Tomb.

179
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It must contain some special substance,

180
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
which alters the telomere in the DNA

181
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
to prolong the denaturation.

182
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And this is the exact formula

183
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
that's injected in Wu Xie, right?

184
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Yes, with higher concentration.

185
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Now, everybody out!

186
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Jing'er Palace

187
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Finally, finally!

188
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Jing'er Palace

189
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Any progress on the research?

190
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
So far nothing.

191
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
The corpse has started to deteriorate.

192
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Damn it, it's taking too long.

193
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You are a total waste of space.

194
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I know.

195
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
My apologies.

196
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I take the book of the responsibility.

197
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
On the other hand,

198
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
be intentional or not,

199
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Wu Sanxin filed to warn us in advance.

200
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
He's losing our trust.

201
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Wu Sanxin did it, he was asked.

202
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So you should worry about your next moves.

203
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
The company will not tolerate any more missteps on your part.

204
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Okay.

205
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Sir, why didn't you share our experimental results?

206
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Why should I share my research on immortality with others?

207
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
What happened?

208
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
What's going on?

209
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
The corpse is dying.

210
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Uncle Sanxin, uncle Sanxin,

211
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
why don't you save me?

212
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Uncle Sanxin, save me.

213
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Uncle Sanxin, uncle Sanxin.

214
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Uncle Sanxin,

215
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
why did you become like this?

216
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Why did you become like this?

217
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You are so disappointing.

218
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Uncle Sanxin, what's the truth?

219
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
What's the truth?

220
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
What's the truth?

221
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
What's the truth?

222
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
What's the truth?

223
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Hello.

224
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Mr. Wu, today is the day you report on the progress.

225
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
There is no progress yet.

226
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Qiu Dakao has not made any progress, and neither have you.

227
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I think you should consider changing your candidate.

228
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Don't compare me to that useless person.

229
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You said he was useless.

230
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
You need to prove that you are not.

231
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I hope you can think about it.

232
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
How much money have you earned from me all these years?

233
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Let me ask you.

234
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Why are you looking for me?

235
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Is it because you are professional?

236
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You can't do well without me.

237
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I am still alive without you.

238
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Do you understand?

239
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Then tell me,

240
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
why do you keep asking us to go to the sky?

241
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Is it because you suddenly can't bear to leave your beloved nephew?

242
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Don't talk so weird, okay?

243
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I can let him die once,

244
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
and I can let him die again.

245
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Please believe me.

246
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I want you to promise that he will appear in the Cloud Sky Palace.

247
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I promise.

248
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I will.

249
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Wang Jiaming.

250
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
You dare to steal my stuff?

251
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
You are quite brave.

252
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Master Hua, I just wanted to see.

253
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I didn't take anything.

254
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I am just afraid that I might break something.

255
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Please forgive me.

256
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Who sent you here?

257
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
No one sent me here.

258
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I just heard that there is something valuable here.

259
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I just wanted to see.

260
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
There is something valuable here.

261
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I just wanted to see.

262
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Either tell the truth,

263
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
or leave the hand that stole the stuff.

264
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Master Hua, they asked me to come here to change money.

265
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
But I don't know what they are doing.

266
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
We contacted them through email and WeChat.

267
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I left their address and WeChat to you.

268
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
What did they ask you to steal?

269
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Snake.

270
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Snake didn't steal fish.

271
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You...

272
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Snake.

273
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
What does this place have to do with my third uncle?

274
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Don't you want to know the secret behind Wu Sanxing?

275
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Don't keep chasing him.

276
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Find an answer that you don't know.

277
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
You can find it yourself.

278
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Kid, if you really want to know the secret behind Wu Sanxing,

279
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
you must go to Jing'er Palace.

280
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Go.

281
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Go.

282
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Go.

283
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Go.

284
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Go.

285
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Get up.

286
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Hurry up.

287
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Why are you following me?

288
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Hurry up and go.

289
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
No.

290
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
No.

291
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Fire.

292
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Fire.

293
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Hold on.

294
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
It hurts.

295
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Burn it.

296
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Burn it.

297
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Burn it.

298
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
What's wrong with you? I'll save you.

299
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Stop following me.

300
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Tianzhen.

301
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Slow down. Wait for me.

302
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
What?

303
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Tianzhen, I saw someone's car on my way here.

304
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
It was full of food and drinks.

305
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I thought someone forgot to bring it.

306
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
If we bury it in the tomb,

307
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
we'll be starving to death.

308
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Also,

309
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I found a GPS on my way here.

310
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
If the ghost hits the wall and gets lost,

311
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I don't know how it died.

312
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
It's not a matter of starving to death.

313
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Thank me.

314
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I didn't tell you.

315
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Don't bother me.

316
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I said,

317
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I don't care about you.

318
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Do you know you're so annoying?

319
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Do you know you're so hurtful?

320
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I was also alone before I met you.

321
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I didn't want to be a loner.

322
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
But let me tell you.

323
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
After we get married and get the red book,

324
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
we'll sign...

325
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Stop.

326
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Don't joke with me.

327
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I'm not in the mood.

328
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Let's have a normal conversation.

329
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
We've got the red book and experienced so much.

330
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
We've signed the papers.

331
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
We have to move on.

332
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Don't communicate normally.

333
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I really don't want to talk.

334
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
It's not you.

335
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Tian Jun.

336
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
There's something to eat tonight.

337
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
It's him.

338
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
In the pocket in front.

339
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Yes.

340
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
You don't have to do it.

341
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
It's not poisonous.

342
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
You don't have to do it.

343
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Tian Jun.

344
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Tian Jun.

345
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
What's wrong?

346
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Did you have a nightmare again?

347
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I'm used to having a nightmare with me.

348
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
You can't get through this, can you?

349
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
You don't know where to pick up a broken newspaper.

350
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
And then you go to Guangxi alone.

351
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Aren't you afraid that someone will dig a hole for you?

352
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I know it must be a hole.

353
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
But I don't know who dug it.

354
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I guess...

355
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
It must be Qiu Dakao.

356
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
You know it's him who's still digging.

357
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
You trust people too easily.

358
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I don't believe in Qiu Dakao.

359
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
But I believe that...

360
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
As long as I see something related to the same thing as the snake's tail...

361
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I can definitely see my third uncle.

362
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Instead of wandering around in secret every day...

363
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Why don't we come here and gamble?

364
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Tian Jun!

365
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
You liar!

366
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
You abandoned your husband just to leave me behind!

367
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Wait!

368
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Sir, sending someone at this sensitive time...

369
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Alpha is obviously spying on us.

370
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Ning.

371
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
He's nothing but a pound sent here because of their insecurity.

372
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Instead of treating him as a spy...

373
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
We'd rather treat him as a friend.

374
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
He might even be of use for us.

375
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Please make him feel at home.

376
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Sir, they've already arrived.

377
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I'm sorry.

378
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I'm sorry.

379
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I'm sorry.

380
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I'm sorry.

381
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I'm sorry.

382
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I'm sorry.

383
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I'm sorry.

384
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I'm sorry.

385
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I'm sorry.

386
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I'm sorry.

387
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I'm sorry.

388
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I'm sorry.

389
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I'm sorry.

390
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I'm sorry.

391
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I'm sorry.

392
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I'm sorry.

393
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I'm sorry.

394
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I'm sorry.

395
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I'm sorry.

396
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I'm sorry.

397
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I'm sorry.

398
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I'm sorry.

399
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I'm sorry.

400
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I'm sorry.

401
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I'm sorry.

402
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I'm sorry.

403
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I'm sorry.

404
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I'm sorry.

405
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I'm sorry.

406
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I'm sorry.

407
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I'm sorry.

408
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I'm sorry.

409
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I'm sorry.

410
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I'm sorry.

411
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I'm sorry.

412
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I'm sorry.

413
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I'm sorry.

414
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I'm sorry.

415
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I'm sorry.

416
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I'm sorry.

417
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I'm sorry.

418
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I'm sorry.

419
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I'm sorry.

420
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I'm sorry.

421
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,400
What are you thinking?

422
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:31,700
Your Graham

423
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,780
Patrick

424
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,780
What are you talking about?

425
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,280
Can we stand where we are now?

426
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,280
Didn't we fall here before?

427
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,280
The stone tower is below you.

428
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,280
You are standing on the rock now.

429
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,280
You know?

430
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,280
The stone tower on the ground has damaged the ground structure.

431
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,280
The stone tower below the ground has collapsed because the tower is too heavy.

432
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,280
The rock in the middle and the bottom of the mountain are formed later.

433
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,280
That is where you are standing now.

434
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,280
Isn't this just like the 3 plus 2 cookies?

435
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,280
What's wrong?

436
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,280
How do we find it if it's so complicated?

437
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,280
We don't even know where the bottom of the tower is.

438
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,280
The stone tower in the middle is the guardian of the Tudeng in Chinese folk legends.

439
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,280
The stone tower we saw before represents the Golden Spider.

440
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,280
But the Tudeng in folk culture is not completely recorded in the history.

441
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,280
So I can only remember the order of the Tudengs recorded.

442
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,280
So you mean that based on the order of your memory,

443
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,280
we can find a stone tower that is not there.

444
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,280
The Tudengs in the stone tower are not there.

445
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,280
Based on the order of your memory,

446
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,280
we can find a stone tower that is not there.

447
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,280
You are good.

448
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,280
Fatty, don't block my way.

449
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,280
I am your uncle.

450
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,280
Hurry up.

451
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,280
Once the tower collapses,

452
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,280
people around will come here to pick up holes

453
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,280
when they hear the wind blowing.

454
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,280
See? I was right.

455
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,280
Who shot him to death?

456
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,280
Who shot him to death?

457
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,280
Hongli's Lotus?

458
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,280
Hongli's Lotus

459
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,280
It should be shot from his place.

460
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,280
Why didn't there be any mechanism before?

461
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,280
I don't know.

462
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,280
Maybe the tower was built for a special purpose.

463
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,280
Purpose? The guardian is protecting people.

464
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,280
It's not right to hurt people.

465
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,280
It's simple.

466
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,280
It's possible that the person who built it later changed the mechanism here.

467
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,280
Who?

468
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,280
That's right.

469
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,280
The eight treasures in the soil are the Snake Eye Copper Fish.

470
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,280
There are names everywhere in China.

471
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,280
Wang Zang Hai.

472
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,280
All the places where the Snake Eye Copper Fish is found

473
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,280
have clues pointing to the Cloud Sky Palace.

474
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,280
I wonder what the stone tower has to do with the Cloud Sky Palace.

475
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,280
The Seven Stars Luch Palace, West Desert Sea,

476
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,280
Guizhou Miu Village, and here,

477
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,280
there are eight places that are not there.

478
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,280
What kind of rule does it have?

479
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,280
Why did it do that?

480
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,280
The secret of the palace is not as simple as we think.

481
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,280
Of course.

482
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:26,540
It's impossible to do everything for the sake of the

483
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,280
Fatty,

484
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,280
these bodies were moved to a new position after they died.

485
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,280
Who moved them?

486
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,280
The stone statue came down to move them.

487
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,280
Come.

488
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,280
It's okay.

489
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,280
Nine-finger hook?

490
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,280
Nine-finger hook?

491
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,280
What a big windmill.

492
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,280
Tianzhen, look at this.

493
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,280
Let go of it.

494
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,280
Be careful.

495
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,280
This is the image of the Snake God.

496
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,280
According to the legend of Chinese civilization,

497
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,280
the female flower is also the image of the Snake God.

498
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,280
We should be careful.

499
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,280
What if there is some kind of mechanism on it?

500
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,280
But look at its eyes.

501
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,280
How strange.

502
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,280
What is so powerful that it can destroy its eyes?

503
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,280
Eight-finger hook?

504
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,280
Nine-finger hook?

505
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,280
Eight-finger hook?

506
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,280
Nine-finger hook?

507
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,280
Eight-finger hook?

508
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,280
Nine-finger hook?

509
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,280
Eight-finger hook?

510
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,280
This is the tower that was placed in the Eight-finger Castle.

511
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,280
How many?

512
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,280
The body of the mirror, the leg of the giant snake,

513
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,280
the soul of the red-gripped pear,

514
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,280
the claw of the fly, the eyes of the tiger,

515
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,280
the tail of the white shark,

516
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,280
and the last one,

517
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,280
the body of the snake.

518
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,280
All done.

519
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,280
The Eight-finger Gryph is here.

520
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,280
Let's go to the bottom, okay?

521
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:10,280
Where did you say the heavy mechanism was placed?

522
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,280
What are you looking for?

523
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,280
Isn't it here?

524
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,280
It's here.

525
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,280
The Eight-finger Gryph

526
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,280
The eight-finger Gryph

527
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,280
The eight-finger Gryph

528
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,280
The eight-finger Gryph

529
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,280
The eight-finger Gryph

530
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,280
The eight-finger Gryph

531
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,280
The eight-finger Gryph

532
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,280
The eight-finger Gryph

533
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,280
The eight-finger Gryph

534
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,280
The eight-finger Gryph

535
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,280
The eight-finger Gryph

536
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,280
The eight-finger Gryph

537
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,280
The eight-finger Gryph

538
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,280
The eight-finger Gryph

539
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,280
The eight-finger Gryph

540
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,280
The eight-finger Gryph

541
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,280
The eight-finger Gryph

542
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,280
The eight-finger Gryph

543
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,280
The eight-finger Gryph

544
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,280
The eight-finger Gryph

545
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,280
The eight-finger Gryph

546
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,280
The eight-finger Gryph

547
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,280
The eight-finger Gryph

548
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,280
The eight-finger Gryph

549
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,280
The eight-finger Gryph

550
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,280
The eight-finger Gryph

551
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,280
The eight-finger Gryph

552
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,280
The eight-finger Gryph

553
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,280
The eight-finger Gryph

554
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,280
The eight-finger Gryph

555
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,280
I chase the clouds and the wind

556
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:04,280
