2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

3
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,680
Simply

4
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,960
ment

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's finally dawn.

6
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,440
The sleeping bag is not with us.

7
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,360
No, it's freezing me to death.

8
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,880
It's fine if Xiao Ge disappears.

9
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,960
It's Tian Zhen.

10
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,040
Tian Zhen!

11
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,840
Tian Zhen!

12
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,360
When we came in,

13
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,280
it was said that there was no emergency.

14
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,440
We've been walking around for so long, but we can't get out.

15
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,560
At this temperature,

16
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,640
we don't dare to stop.

17
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,800
If we stop, we'll freeze to death.

18
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,480
I'm telling you,

19
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,840
it's not the time to come in.

20
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,680
This must be the case

21
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,920
after we burned the stone turtle.

22
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,120
I'm telling you,

23
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,680
there are two types of this situation.

24
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,080
One is that the owner of the tomb is suspicious

25
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,840
and creates traps to make us

26
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,560
see things.

27
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,760
The other one

28
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,000
is the ghost gun.

29
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,560
Ghost?

30
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,880
There's a ghost?

31
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,320
What's wrong? Are you scared?

32
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,360
It's so new.

33
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,680
I'm scared of mosquitoes.

34
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,760
It's okay.

35
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,160
It's brave enough

36
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,760
to be a ghost.

37
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,320
Ghost!

38
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:01,960
Ghost!

39
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:02,760
Ghost!

40
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,320
Ghost!

41
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,160
Ghost!

42
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,040
Get in!

43
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,480
Get in!

44
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,320
Brother!

45
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,160
Don't worry, Mr. Xia.

46
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,960
I'll handle it

47
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,840
if anything happens.

48
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:18,980
Thoseא�

49
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,120
the people you've been trusting

50
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,240
are not reliable anymore.

51
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,240
How can you prevent them from hurting you?

52
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,240
Leaving yourself a way is not a bad thing.

53
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,240
You never really knew your Third Uncle.

54
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,240
I'm sorry.

55
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,240
Xiao Zhao.

56
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,240
Go take a look.

57
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,240
We can't contact Lang Feng. Will something happen to her?

58
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,240
I wonder if she was the one who put the explosive just now.

59
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,240
Go.

60
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,240
They are gone.

61
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,280
What happened?

62
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,480
Nothing.

63
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,840
I am all right let's go.

64
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,280
I go my gr sacr difficult boter.

65
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,440
I give up the bond I hold on to.

66
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,760
That is what happened.

67
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,600
There is nothing to be modes doing.

68
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,720
Opp fenton OXe YWX AM??

69
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,720
You guaranteed me.

70
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,720
I'm relieved to have you, Master San.

71
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,920
Master San.

72
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,440
You don't look familiar.

73
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,440
Are you close?

74
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,440
I am!

75
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,440
I am!

76
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,440
Master San, what's wrong?

77
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,440
Say something.

78
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,040
Lang Feng was killed by the wall.

79
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,360
We didn't have time.

80
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,360
Your third uncle took him.

81
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,360
So you're all here.

82
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,360
Fatty and I were fighting under the wall.

83
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,360
I thought we'd come out.

84
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,680
This is the equipment Lang Feng left.

85
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,680
When you're done, take out everything you can.

86
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,680
If Lang Feng was with you earlier,

87
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,680
would it not have happened?

88
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,680
Look at this guy.

89
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,680
He's like Lang Feng.

90
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,680
Just like a bug.

91
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,680
You almost can't see your fourth uncle.

92
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,680
It's empty down there.

93
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,680
Isn't this tunnel built on the slope?

94
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,680
There's a slope down here.

95
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But the floor is flat.

96
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So there must be a space below.

97
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You're really a coward.

98
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The wall was so big.

99
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Then it was so big.

100
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Master San, if you hit a wall bigger than a man,

101
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I won't have much time.

102
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
How many times?

103
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Just one.

104
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,320
There's a hole down there.

105
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
We should be able to go down.

106
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
Look at this hole.

107
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,320
It's too small.

108
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
We can't go through.

109
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,320
Be careful.

110
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
The floor is already so cold.

111
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,320
And the explosion last time...

112
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,320
It must have affected the structure below.

113
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,320
If it collapses,

114
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,320
it's a big problem.

115
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,640
If it collapses,

116
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,640
the floor will collapse.

117
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,640
Then the palace will be our land.

118
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,640
What are you talking about?

119
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,640
You're so sad.

120
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,640
I want to talk to you.

121
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,640
Since this is a trap designed by Wang Zang Hai,

122
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,640
it's not a real burial ground.

123
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,640
We must leave here as soon as it's dawn.

124
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,640
It's easy to leave.

125
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,640
But what should we do next?

126
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,640
We're going to find a lost partner.

127
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,640
We'll leave after the meeting.

128
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,640
You're not good enough.

129
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,640
You should go first.

130
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,640
One more person, one more effort.

131
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,640
We'll leave first.

132
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,640
It's not like we're talking.

133
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,640
Do you actually know

134
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,640
that there are other secret paths to go through?

135
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,640
After you get rid of the palace,

136
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,640
you'll get rid of Jason.

137
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,640
Even if someone tells you the palace is fake,

138
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,640
just pretend you believe them.

139
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,960
Stay and wait for me there.

140
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,960
What are you talking about? I don't understand.

141
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,960
So it's true.

142
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,960
Let go.

143
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,960
Let go.

144
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,960
Come on.

145
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,960
How is it?

146
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,960
Let me see.

147
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,960
Let me see.

148
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,960
Let me see.

149
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,960
Let me see.

150
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,960
Let me see.

151
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,280
Let me see.

152
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,280
Let me see.

153
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,280
Let me see.

154
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,280
Hold on.

155
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,280
Fatty, what's wrong?

156
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,280
Come up.

157
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,280
The beam is broken. It's too dangerous.

158
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,280
It's okay.

159
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,280
It's fragile.

160
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,280
What's wrong?

161
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,280
No!

162
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,280
Someone is trying to grab my foot!

163
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,280
Use your strength!

164
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,280
Get him out!

165
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,280
Get him out!

166
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,280
Get him out!

167
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,280
Use your strength!

168
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,280
Use your strength!

169
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,960
Don't cut it!

170
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,960
Don't cut it!

171
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,960
You broke the beam.

172
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,960
Everyone has to get down.

173
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,960
Don't talk nonsense.

174
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,960
I'll beat you up!

175
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,960
Come out!

176
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,960
Fatty!

177
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,960
Don't cut it!

178
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,960
Someone is trying to grab my foot!

179
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,960
Is there anyone else?

180
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,960
Anyone else?

181
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,960
Anyone else?

182
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,960
Use your strength!

183
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,960
Oh, no.

184
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,960
What's wrong?

185
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,960
Are you okay?

186
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,960
My back!

187
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,960
He grabbed my thigh!

188
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,960
I grabbed it!

189
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,960
You touched my hand!

190
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,960
You're good at playing tricks.

191
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,960
Sir!

192
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,960
Sir!

193
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,960
Are you okay?

194
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,960
I'm fine.

195
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,960
I think there's a big hole

196
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,960
in the ground.

197
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,960
Everyone, be careful!

198
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,960
Take out the black and green ladder!

199
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,960
Are you okay, Sir?

200
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,960
Sir, I think I hit the brick.

201
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,960
This is the electric hole.

202
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,960
Take out everything that fell down.

203
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,960
Are you okay, Sir?

204
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,960
Slowly.

205
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,960
Sir.

206
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,960
Slowly.

207
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,960
Slowly.

208
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,960
Don't move.

209
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,960
Sir, are you okay?

210
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,960
Why are these all monks?

211
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,960
Are they the legendary

212
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,960
hidden masters of the Golden Mountain?

213
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,960
They're all monks.

214
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,960
They're all monks.

215
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,960
Is that the hidden master of the Golden Mountain?

216
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,960
Are these monks all dead?

217
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,960
Are these monks all dead?

218
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,960
Pan, you saw the world.

219
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,960
A dead person is not scary.

220
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,960
A living one can't be scary.

221
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,960
You see the hole?

222
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,960
It'll break when you touch it.

223
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,960
What is that thing

224
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,960
that grabbed my foot?

225
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,960
You know

226
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,960
what I mean.

227
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,960
If the dead body

228
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,960
didn't grab your hand

229
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
You're small.

230
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,960
Your legs are gone.

231
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,960
Not the third master.

232
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,960
Not the hooker.

233
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,960
Understand?

234
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,960
Fatty, I'm not the one who's talking.

235
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,960
You're too timid.

236
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,960
You scared me.

237
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,960
I really thought there was a big hole to bite you.

238
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,960
I can't tell if you're caught or hooked.

239
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,960
These people don't seem to be human.

240
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
Look at the mouth of the tooth.

241
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,960
It can cut off half of the face with a single tooth.

242
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,960
They're not human?

243
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,960
Fatty, why are you so good at talking?

244
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,960
What else can they be if they're not human?

245
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,960
Monsters?

246
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,960
They're probably legendary snowmen.

247
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,960
That tooth is their own demon's.

248
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,960
This is the tooth of the ancient Saman Sect.

249
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,960
This is the tooth of the ancient Saman Sect.

250
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,960
This is a custom of the ancient Saman Sect.

251
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,960
Later, because it was too troublesome, they used fake masks instead.

252
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,960
Judging from their clothes, they don't look like women or Mongolians.

253
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,960
Look.

254
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,960
Some of these bodies are covered in cloth.

255
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,960
They don't look like women in the Ming Dynasty.

256
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,960
They're from the Eastern and Western Dynasties.

257
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,960
Their clothes and style are different from women.

258
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,960
No, no.

259
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,960
The clothes and style we see in the murals are not like this.

260
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,960
But according to historical records,

261
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,960
women near Mt. Changbai have a custom of burying their bodies.

262
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,960
With time, they keep on collecting them.

263
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,960
These bodies move layer by layer.

264
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,960
The deepest bodies can have thousands of years of history.

265
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,960
So I guess these bodies are the ancient bodies

266
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,960
that were dug by Wang Zanghai when he was digging the mountains.

267
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,960
According to what you said, the remains of the Tai Xing Mountain

268
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,960
As you said, the Tai Xing Mountain Cave was once a cemetery.

269
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,960
Wang Zanghai planned to use this place as a burial ground.

270
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,960
Then when he built the burial ground,

271
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,960
he dug out all these bodies.

272
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,960
Let me ask you a question.

273
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,960
Why did he put the bones here?

274
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,960
Who knows?

275
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,960
Maybe he didn't mean it.

276
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,960
Maybe it's the Eastern Xia people.

277
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,960
What do you mean?

278
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,960
There are many strange rituals and curse in the Saman Sect.

279
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,960
So I guess these bodies are related to their curse.

280
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,960
You've been talking for a long time.

281
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,960
You've finished your analysis.

282
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,960
The key is how to get out.

283
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,960
Go around and see if there's an exit.

284
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,960
Be careful.

285
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,960
Why do I feel that this place is a bit evil?

286
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,960
Let's go over there.

287
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,960
Wait a minute.

288
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,960
Hello?

289
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,960
Xiao Hua, are you hiding from me to investigate?

290
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,960
I'm at work now. I'll explain to you when I get back.

291
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,960
I'm not a three-year-old child.

292
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,960
Can't I be easily fooled by you?

293
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,960
No, I...

294
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,960
Xiao Hua, this is related to my grandmother.

295
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,960
And I'm doing nothing.

296
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,960
How can I wait for you to come forward and prove it?

297
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,960
Baby, okay.

298
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,960
Okay.

299
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,960
Don't you want the speaker?

300
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,960
I'm talking business outside.

301
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,960
Big business.

302
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,960
I'll have the speaker when I get back tonight.

303
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,960
Are you crazy?

304
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
Okay, baby.

305
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,960
I won't talk anymore. See you tonight.

306
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,960
Uncle Nan, why did you come so late?

307
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,960
I'm so tired.

308
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,960
Today, give me this.

309
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,960
This is easy to say.

310
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,960
I'll type the code first.

311
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,960
Type the code?

312
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,960
Okay, okay.

313
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,960
Did it rise today?

314
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,960
The stock didn't rise.

315
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,960
Liu Yang River is rising.

316
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,960
White dew flies in front of the West Mountain.

317
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,960
Grape wine and night light.

318
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,960
Brother Gao, I almost thought something was going to happen.

319
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
What can happen to me here?

320
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,960
You usually come at night.

321
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,960
You came so early today.

322
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,960
I'm a little nervous.

323
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,960
I just have to go abroad and buy a ticket.

324
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,960
You understand. It's a small thing.

325
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,960
Is there a lot of goods today?

326
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,960
Not much.

327
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,960
Although I received it once last month,

328
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,960
two big stocks that were of the same age two days ago.

329
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,960
The names of the stocks are almost complete.

330
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,960
Let's go and have a look.

331
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,960
Go.

332
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,960
Go.

333
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,960
Go.

334
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,960
Go.

335
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,960
Fatty, what are you doing?

336
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,960
Fatty.

337
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,960
Fatty.

338
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
Fatty.

339
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,960
Fatty.

340
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,960
Fatty.

341
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,960
Fatty.

342
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,960
Are you okay, Fatty?

343
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,960
Fatty.

344
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,960
Don't forget.

345
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,960
Third Master saved you again.

346
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,960
Thank you, Third Master.

347
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,960
What's going on?

348
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,960
Tell me what's going on.

349
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,960
What happened just now?

350
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,960
Didn't your Third Uncle insist on us finding the exit?

351
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,960
What?

352
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,960
You clearly blame Third Master.

353
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
No, no, no.

354
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
No.

355
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,960
No.

356
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,960
I finally found a hole in the exit.

357
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,960
I thought it was a hole for the carbon dioxide.

358
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
I wanted to take a look inside.

359
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,520
But then I saw a big

360
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,960
lead.

361
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,960
It was a big lead that got me stuck.

362
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,960
It was going to drag me down

363
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,960
and make a mess with me.

364
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,960
You still hate me for being a loser?

365
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,960
No, that strong man is a woman, right?

366
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,960
Did he fall in love with you?

367
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,960
Why doesn't he fall in love with you?

368
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,960
Why doesn't he pull me?

369
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,960
He just pulled you.

370
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,960
Pan Zi! Pan Zi!

371
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,960
Get up.

372
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,960
What are you doing?

373
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,960
They will die.

374
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,960
Are you going to save them?

375
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,960
You're not going to bet?

376
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,960
You're not even going to see your own sister?

377
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,960
Get away from me.

378
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,960
Get away.

379
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,960
Pan Zi! Pan Zi!

380
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,960
Get away.

381
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,960
Get away.

382
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,960
Didn't you see me?

383
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,960
Why did you drag her away?

384
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,960
Get away.

385
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,960
You wretch!

386
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,960
You wretch!

387
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,960
Why is the big lead so slippery?

388
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,960
Get up.

389
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,960
Go back.

390
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,960
They're out.

391
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,960
Get them.

392
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,960
They're the ones who are going to die.

393
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,960
Get up.

394
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,960
Third Uncle.

395
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,960
Come.

396
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,960
Really?

397
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,960
I'm going to kill you.

398
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,960
I'm going to kill you.

399
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,960
Where is the stronghold?

400
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,960
I'm telling you, it's about two meters long.

401
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,960
That head is this big.

402
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,960
I've never seen such a stronghold.

403
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,960
Did that thing change its shape?

404
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,960
Take your time.

405
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,960
What else?

406
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,960
I'm too busy.

407
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,960
But I touched a few stone boards.

408
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,960
They're made by hand.

409
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,960
Made by hand?

410
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,960
Senior.

411
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:55,960
I thought these holes were natural

412
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,960
or the ruins of the construction site.

413
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,960
But the diameter of these holes is too big.

414
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,960
The holes at that time

415
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,960
couldn't reach this level.

416
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,960
This hole looks like the underground cellar in the northeast.

417
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,960
The workers who built this tomb

418
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,960
weren't from the northeast, were they?

419
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,960
They even built a cellar for themselves.

420
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,960
If you keep talking nonsense, I'll smoke you out.

421
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,960
There's a crack here.

422
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,960
But it's not made of stone.

423
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,960
It must have a connection with some place.

424
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,960
Connection?

425
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,960
Could it be the back door to the Heavenly Palace?

426
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,960
Yes, it's the secret passage of the Three-Headed Dragon.

427
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,960
It's connected.

428
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,960
The Three-Headed Dragon is fake.

429
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,960
How can there be any secret passage?

430
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,960
Maybe Wang Zang Hai's plan is like this.

431
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,960
He made us think that the Three-Headed Dragon is fake.

432
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,960
He arranged the path here.

433
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,960
The most dangerous place is the safest place.

434
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,960
This is a high move.

435
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,960
But the Three-Headed Dragon is fake.

436
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,960
Then there's no need to dig through all these three mountains.

437
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,960
And with the power and manpower of the Eastern Xia Kingdom,

438
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,960
it's hard to launch such a huge project.

439
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,960
Uncle San, be careful.

440
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,960
Don't let that strong man come out and attack us.

441
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,960
Third Master, don't pick this up.

442
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,960
Everyone will come in.

443
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,960
You're the only one who cares about Third Master.

444
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,960
Let's go.

445
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,960
Let's have a democratic meeting.

446
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,960
We'll dig every day in our field.

447
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,960
Right?

448
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,960
Yes.

449
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,960
The holes and the grooves are from top to bottom.

450
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,960
Did you see the hole?

451
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,960
The grooves are from bottom to top.

452
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,960
What does it mean?

453
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,960
It means that the hole is dug from bottom to top.

454
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,960
Could it be that the craftsman left an exit for himself during the repair?

455
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,960
There's also a hole in the back of the palace.

456
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,960
It's just sealed.

457
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,960
It can't be damaged.

458
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,960
Then they might be connected.

459
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,960
If that's the case,

460
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,960
there's a real underground palace down there.

461
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,960
A real burial ground.

462
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,960
Impossible.

463
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,960
That's the underground palace.

464
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,960
The entrance should be below the seal stone.

465
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,960
That's the seal's position.

466
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,960
But I didn't see anything just now.

467
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,960
According to my experience with Tianzhen,

468
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,960
Wang Canghai is like this.

469
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,960
He doesn't go on a normal road.

470
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,960
Don't be silly.

471
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,960
Are you a student or not?

472
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,960
You don't go on a normal road?

473
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,960
Let me tell you.

474
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,960
What does that mean?

475
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,960
Just learn to think.

476
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,960
If you dig a hole,

477
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,960
no one can find it.

478
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,960
Then where do you think this hole leads to?

479
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,960
It should be a certain underground palace in the sky.

480
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,960
No way, Third Uncle.

481
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,960
You're saying that they're too far away.

482
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,960
Even if those workers dig a tunnel

483
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,960
to leave their own way,

484
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,960
they don't have to dig all the way here.

485
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,960
Think about it.

486
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,960
The whole Sansheng Mountain is so big.

487
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,960
They have to dig a tunnel to get here.

488
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,960
It takes a long time.

489
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,960
It takes at least 20 to 30 years.

490
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,960
And at the same time,

491
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,960
the soldiers who are guarding it have to hide.

492
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,960
Who can do that?

493
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,960
You brat.

494
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,960
Your Third Uncle died for a lifetime just because of his feelings.

495
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,960
I said he can do it.

496
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,960
If you can't,

497
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,960
then you should use the original tunnel of the mountain.

498
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,960
Okay.

499
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,960
After the meeting,

500
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,960
let's go down and have a look.

501
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,960
Let's go down together.

502
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,960
Let's go.

503
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,960
No.

504
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,960
If you go down like this,

505
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,960
what about Xiao Ge?

506
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,960
Are you still worried about Xiao Ge?

507
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,960
Yes.

508
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,960
We came together.

509
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,960
Of course we have to wait for them to go down together.

510
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,960
No.

511
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,960
Third Uncle,

512
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,960
sometimes it's not good to be too democratic.

513
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,960
What about Fourth Uncle?

514
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,960
It's getting dark today.

515
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,960
It's getting dark.

516
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,960
It's time for the activities in Qiangchuan to begin.

517
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,960
I think

518
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,960
we should have a good rest tonight.

519
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,960
We'll make plans when the sun rises.

520
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,960
Okay.

521
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,960
We should eat and drink.

522
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,960
Let's rest tonight.

523
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,960
Let's sleep.

524
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,960
Master Hua,

525
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,960
I want to see it myself.

526
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,960
Let's go.

527
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,960
Have you checked the room?

528
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,960
Master Hua.

529
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,960
Let's go.

530
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,960
Master Hua,

531
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,960
this is the blood bath.

532
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,960
Old man used special dye to make it.

533
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,960
Then he used bamboo to burn it

534
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,960
to make it look like a fake one.

535
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,960
So,

536
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,960
they not only made the pattern,

537
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,960
but also made the fake one?

538
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,960
The people who made the fake one are very clever.

539
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,960
Ordinary people use the flesh and eyes.

540
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,960
They can't tell the difference.

541
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,960
They can't tell the difference.

542
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,960
They can't tell the difference.

543
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,960
They can't tell the difference.

544
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,960
Ordinary people use the flesh and eyes.

545
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,960
They can't tell the difference.

546
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,960
Master Hua, look.

547
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,960
This porcelain vase

548
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,960
was held in a private museum

549
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,960
which is a world-renowned collection.

550
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,960
It was held in a private museum.

551
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,960
Is this real?

552
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,960
Really?

553
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,960
Did they use fake to make it?

554
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,960
I'm afraid so.

555
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,960
Master Hua,

556
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,960
how many of these

557
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,960
domestic cultural relics

558
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,960
were secretly made

559
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,960
by them using fake?

560
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,960
And the real ones were shipped abroad.

561
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,960
Master Hua,

562
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,960
I've checked the warehouse.

563
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,960
I've searched the inside.

564
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,960
There are some people inside.

565
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,960
Please check it as soon as possible.

566
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,960
You need to know

567
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,960
how many people

568
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,960
are secretly made

569
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,960
by the knife in China.

570
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,960
And who is making the fake ones?

571
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,960
And how many cultural relics

572
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,960
were shipped abroad?

573
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,960
Okay.

574
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,960
But there's one question.

575
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,960
If at the same time,

576
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,960
the real ones were made,

577
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,960
how many of them

578
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,960
would be stolen

579
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,960
if so many people

580
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,960
disappeared at the same time?

581
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,960
Please check it as soon as possible.

582
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,960
It's necessary.

583
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,960
We need to use it.

584
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,960
The real ones were made.

585
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,960
They were made by the knife.

586
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,960
They were made by the knife.

587
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,960
They were made by the knife.

588
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,960
They were made by the knife.

589
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,960
They were made by the knife.

590
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,960
They were made by the knife.

591
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,960
They were made by the knife.

592
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,960
They were made by the knife.

593
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,960
They were made by the knife.

594
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,960
They were made by the knife.

595
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,960
They were made by the knife.

596
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,960
They were made by the knife.

597
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,960
They were made by the knife.

598
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,960
What's wrong?

599
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,960
You can't sleep?

600
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,960
I've slept

601
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,960
in so many bodies.

602
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,960
It's still the first time

603
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,960
I've ever had a sound.

604
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,960
Is death scary?

605
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,960
What's so scary?

606
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,960
The dead are scared.

607
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,960
What's so scary about death?

608
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,960
Death is scary.

609
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,960
Death is scary.

610
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,960
You

611
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,960
are the cutest when you were a kid.

612
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,960
You hit the white bone three times.

613
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,960
You fell asleep

614
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,960
when you hit the first one.

615
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,960
I never knew

616
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,960
what the two or three white bones were.

617
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,960
It was fun when I was a kid.

618
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,960
I was always playing with my third uncle.

619
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,960
He taught me this.

620
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,960
He taught me this.

621
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,960
How can you lie to me?

622
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,960
When I was a kid,

623
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,960
you lied to me

624
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,960
and said you would take me out.

625
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,960
But you left me on the side.

626
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,960
You went on a date with Aunt Wenjing.

627
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,960
I got sunstroke.

628
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,960
You bullied me when I was a kid.

629
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,960
You remember this?

630
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,960
You're a bad guy.

631
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,960
You forgot that I was beaten by

632
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,960
the old man.

633
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,960
I remember.

634
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,960
He let me bite you.

635
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,960
You climbed up the tree and didn't come down.

636
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,960
I didn't even leave you.

637
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,960
I even brought you food.

638
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,960
Really?

639
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,960
I couldn't stand it.

640
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,960
I couldn't think of how to get down.

641
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,960
You were beaten.

642
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,960
You didn't beat me to death.

643
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,960
I remember I hit you

644
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,960
and you bled.

645
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,960
I did.

646
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,960
My hands were too heavy.

647
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,960
Did you have a scar?

648
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,960
I remember you had a scar.

649
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,960
Uncle San, show me.

650
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,960
Show me.

651
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,960
Stop it.

652
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,960
Show me.

653
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,960
Enough.

654
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,960
This scar is bigger than I remember.

655
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,960
You know nothing.

656
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,960
Go to sleep.

657
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,960
I'm sorry.

658
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,960
I'm sorry.

659
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,960
You kid.

660
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,960
You have to be nice to me.

661
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,960
You have to be nice to me.

662
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,960
You're old.

663
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,960
Who loves you the most?

664
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,960
Not me.

665
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,960
My grandpa is the best.

666
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,960
Your grandpa is fine with you.

667
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,960
But who's been nice to you since you were a kid?

668
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,960
Me.

669
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,960
You forgot you took me out to play.

670
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,960
You went on a date and threw me out.

671
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,960
I got a heat stroke.

672
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,960
Really?

673
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,960
Yes.

674
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,960
That time?

675
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,960
You're a little jealous, right?

676
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,960
You forgot you took me out to play.

677
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,960
You got a heat stroke.

678
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,960
I got a heat stroke.

679
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,960
Let me see.

680
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,960
Stop it.

681
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,960
Let me see.

682
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,960
I got a heat stroke.

683
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,960
Enough.

684
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,960
You kid.

685
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,960
You kid.

686
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,960
It hurts.

687
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,960
Does it hurt that much?

688
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,960
You called me a cold-hearted man.

689
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,960
I'll teach you a lesson.

690
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,960
Let's go.

691
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,960
The bug is really gone.

692
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,960
We can't go on like this.

693
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,960
We're all dead.

694
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,960
How about this?

695
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,960
We split up.

696
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,960
Xiaoqi, Fatty, Pan, you group.

697
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,960
Others follow me.

698
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,960
Master, you and your apprentice...

699
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,960
I'll stay with the painter.

700
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,960
Okay.

701
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,960
Master, don't worry.

702
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,960
I'll take care of him.

703
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,960
See you later.

704
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,960
Take care of him.

705
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,960
Let's go, Grandpa.

706
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,960
Let's go.

707
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,960
Does Master want to get rid of us?

708
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,960
It's not good to follow a Pan.

709
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,960
Let's go.

710
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,960
Grandpa.

711
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,960
Grandpa, wake up.

712
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,960
What's wrong with you?

713
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,960
Grandpa.

714
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,960
What's wrong?

715
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,960
He seems to be out of breath.

716
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,960
How is it?

717
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,960
No pulse.

718
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,960
Grandpa.

719
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,960
Wake up.

720
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,960
Grandpa.

721
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,960
I told you he's old and insecure.

722
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,960
You let him go to the snow mountain.

723
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,960
Shut up.

724
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,960
He's dead.

725
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,960
Is he having hypothermia?

726
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,960
You should get him.

727
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,960
In such an extreme environment,

728
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,960
any death is possible.

729
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,960
Have you seen Xiaoge?

730
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,960
Grandpa.

731
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,960
Grandpa moved.

732
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,960
What?

733
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,960
Grandpa.

734
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,960
Grandpa.

735
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,960
Let go.

736
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,960
Let him go.

737
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,960
No.

738
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,960
Let him go.

739
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,960
You little bastard.

740
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,960
You little bastard.

741
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,960
Let go.

742
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,960
Let go.

743
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,960
Let go.

744
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,960
Let go.

745
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,960
Let go.

746
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,960
Let go.

747
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,960
Let go.

748
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,960
Let go.

749
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,960
Let go.

750
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,960
Let go.

751
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,960
Let go.

752
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,960
Let go.

753
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,960
Let go.

754
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,960
Let go.

755
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,960
Let go.

756
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,960
