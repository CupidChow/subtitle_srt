1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 10

3
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,320
This is a double-layered tomb.

4
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,320
The real coffin should be down here.

5
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,320
It should be in this secret passage.

6
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,320
That symbol is the one that the people inside left behind.

7
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,320
Who's action is faster than ours?

8
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,320
This secret passage is very secretive.

9
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,320
If it's the secret passage that starts from here,

10
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,320
then the original plate shouldn't be placed in the original place.

11
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,320
But, it's not there.

12
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,320
Then this person might have already known the location of this secret passage.

13
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,320
Or even the other ways to open the secret passage.

14
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,320
Even the location of the secret passage?

15
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,320
Then does he know the structure of the entire underground palace?

16
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,320
We have to go in quickly.

17
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,320
This person might not have been in recently.

18
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,320
Look at that symbol.

19
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,320
It's not the one that was carved recently.

20
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,320
If that person had gone in earlier,

21
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,320
then that thing might have been taken away by him.

22
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,320
You guys...

23
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,320
I'll go in.

24
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,320
Xiao Ge.

25
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,320
Oh my god, did you notice that

26
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,320
since Xiao Ge entered the Palace of Clouds and Sky,

27
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,320
he's become more powerful?

28
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,320
What kind of evil is he?

29
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,320
Anyway, no matter what,

30
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,320
we'll know once we go in.

31
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,320
The secret passage is here.

32
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,320
It's not here.

33
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,320
It's not here.

34
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,320
It's not here.

35
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,320
It's not here.

36
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,320
It's not here.

37
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,320
It's not here.

38
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,320
It's not here.

39
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
It's not here.

40
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,320
It's not here.

41
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,320
It's not here.

42
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,320
It's not here.

43
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,320
It's not here.

44
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,320
It's not here.

45
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,320
It's not here.

46
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,320
It's not here.

47
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
It's not here.

48
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,320
It's not here.

49
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,320
It's not here.

50
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,320
It's not here.

51
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,320
It's not here.

52
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,320
It's not here.

53
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,320
It's not here.

54
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,320
It's not here.

55
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,320
It's not here.

56
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,320
It's not here.

57
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,320
It's not here.

58
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,320
It's not here.

59
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,320
It's not here.

60
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,320
It's not here.

61
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,320
It's not here.

62
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,320
It's not here.

63
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,320
It's not here.

64
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,320
It's not here.

65
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,320
It's not here.

66
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,320
It's not here.

67
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,320
It's not here.

68
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,320
It's not here.

69
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,320
It's not here.

70
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,320
It's not here.

71
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,320
It's not here.

72
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,320
It's not here.

73
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,320
It's not here.

74
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,320
It's not here.

75
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,320
It's not here.

76
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,320
It's not here.

77
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,320
It's not here.

78
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
It's not here.

79
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,320
It's not here.

80
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,320
It's not here.

81
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,320
It's not here.

82
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,320
It's not here.

83
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,320
It's not here.

84
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,320
It's not here.

85
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,320
It's not here.

86
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,320
It's not here.

87
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,320
It's not here.

88
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,320
It's not here.

89
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,620
We get bigger and bigger with the greater attention

90
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,040
to the volcano.

91
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,740
They might find out we came to the hot springs

92
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,580
and theHereage-smario.

93
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,240
The area reacting to us

94
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,840
does act as a temperaturebed agony of death.

95
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,860
The temperature will become hierなる

96
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,180
Then I might be late.

97
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,480
Or we might just have to run with Ann köster,

98
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:47,880
to the이드 rock

99
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,880
Be careful.

100
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,880
Let go of your hands. Be careful.

101
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,880
Be careful.

102
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,880
Go, go, go.

103
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,880
Take a look.

104
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,880
It seems that these chains were not designed by the people of Dongxia.

105
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,880
They must be curious about what the situation was like under the chain that was sealed.

106
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,880
Will these bronze chains be used to protect the people who built this place?

107
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,880
They are used to keep things from climbing up.

108
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,880
For example, the black, giant, soft object that is depicted in the painting.

109
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,880
It's possible.

110
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,880
There is no enemy here.

111
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,880
There is no enemy in the war. Is the enemy invisible?

112
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,880
Could it be the cat-head eagle that grew human face before?

113
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,880
That thing flies very fast and can barely see the shape of the body.

114
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,880
Isn't that invisible?

115
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,880
That's impossible.

116
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,880
There is something in the wood and outside.

117
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,880
Look, the cat-head eagle has fallen.

118
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,880
Is this the person who drew the mark on it?

119
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,880
Who is he?

120
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,880
Why does he always lead us?

121
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,880
I was wondering where he went.

122
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,880
It turned out to be down already.

123
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,880
We also go down.

124
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,880
Sir.

125
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,880
Ning.

126
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,880
Thanks a lot.

127
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,880
You did a great job.

128
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,880
But I will take over the rest of the operation from here.

129
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,880
Jason.

130
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,880
Mr. Qiu De Kao is indeed willing to show himself at the end.

131
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,880
I am very happy to see you.

132
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,880
Mr. Qiu De Kao is willing to show himself at the end.

133
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,880
He is faster than us.

134
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,880
What a great trick.

135
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,880
Of course.

136
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,880
If I am with you,

137
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,880
I will waste too much time.

138
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,880
We are running out of time.

139
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,880
We can get here.

140
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,880
Everyone here is already chosen.

141
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,880
I hope everyone will work together.

142
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,880
Don't let any internal conflicts or disagreements appear again.

143
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,880
Sir.

144
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,880
We have studied the rules down there.

145
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,880
We should have our people at the tail.

146
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,880
And send some Wu San Xing's people to the front.

147
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,880
Once down there,

148
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,880
many things will be unpredictable.

149
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,880
In any case, I hope my research pays off.

150
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,880
Over there.

151
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,880
Hello, can I have a drink?

152
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,880
Sir, can I have a drink?

153
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,880
Sir, can I have a drink?

154
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,880
Sir, can I have a drink?

155
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,880
Madam.

156
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,880
We just found the airport records.

157
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,880
It says that Miss Xiu Xiu

158
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,880
bought the flight tickets two hours later.

159
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,880
Stop her.

160
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,880
We can't let her get in this time.

161
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,880
Go in, go in.

162
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,880
Yes.

163
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,880
You know everything.

164
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,880
You are Xie...

165
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,880
You...

166
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,880
You should call me Grandpa Si.

167
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,880
Grandpa Si.

168
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,880
Grandpa Si.

169
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,880
There are walls and bricks outside.

170
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,880
I haven't asked you how you got here.

171
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,880
Where are your men?

172
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
Don't worry.

173
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,880
I won't die.

174
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,880
When I'm shaking, don't put your head on the waist belt.

175
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,880
Besides, if I'm really alive,

176
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,880
I'll be noticed by the people who are asking for me.

177
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,880
It's not convenient.

178
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,880
You said the same thing.

179
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
Yes.

180
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
We are all disciples.

181
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,880
We have been together for so many years.

182
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,880
I think this place

183
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,880
and this place are similar.

184
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,880
Look.

185
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,880
We are really similar.

186
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,880
Okay, let's not talk about this.

187
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,880
Go back.

188
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,880
Don't let them suspect you.

189
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,880
Grandpa Si.

190
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,880
There are some simple antibiotics.

191
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,880
We brought some medicine.

192
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,880
You keep it.

193
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,880
I don't need it.

194
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,880
Just now,

195
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,880
Pan Zi gave me some medicine

196
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:15,340
that gave Wu San Xing the

197
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,880
Although Wu San Xing is not a good person,

198
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,880
at least he is a real person.

199
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,880
And some people...

200
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,880
are not even human.

201
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,880
There are some mechanisms here and there.

202
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,880
Grandpa Si.

203
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,880
Then why did you and Third Uncle

204
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,880
come here all these years?

205
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,880
Did your Third Uncle tell you?

206
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,880
Then I won't tell you.

207
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,880
Okay, go back.

208
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,880
Or they will suspect you.

209
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,880
Remember, don't look for me on the way.

210
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,880
If you need anything,

211
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,880
just ask your Third Uncle.

212
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,880
You told me this plan is so unreliable.

213
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,880
Do you think your experience

214
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,880
is useful to all the目的?

215
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,880
I, Wu San, can live to this day

216
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,880
because of my experience.

217
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,880
Why did you look for me?

218
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,880
Isn't it because you want to use my experience?

219
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,880
And why do you always let my brothers

220
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,880
go down every time you go down?

221
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,880
And not your brothers?

222
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,880
Tell me why.

223
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,880
There is nothing you can't do.

224
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,880
Don't forget that you are the leader

225
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,880
of the project.

226
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,880
Of course you should be in the front.

227
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,880
Don't fight here

228
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,880
at this critical moment.

229
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,880
Tell me,

230
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,880
what is your purpose

231
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,880
to delay the time?

232
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,880
What are you suspecting?

233
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,880
What are you suspecting?

234
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,880
I tell you,

235
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,880
our Jiu Men

236
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,880
know more about the Yinding Palace

237
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,880
than you do.

238
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,880
And,

239
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,880
the time is not right.

240
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,880
Without the time,

241
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,880
you can't get anything.

242
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,880
Where do you point to?

243
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,880
What do you know?

244
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,880
I know so much.

245
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,880
As a matter of fact, I tell you,

246
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,880
if the time is not right,

247
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,880
you will have no return.

248
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,880
I can't let my brothers

249
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,880
die in vain.

250
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,880
Understand?

251
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,880
You...

252
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,880
Sir,

253
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,880
I think we should listen to Wu Sanxing,

254
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,880
stay steady for the final step.

255
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,880
Even you adored me.

256
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,880
Ning, now you trust him

257
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,880
more than me now.

258
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,880
I don't mean that.

259
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,880
I'm just worried

260
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,880
about your health.

261
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,880
We should rest for the night.

262
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,880
I'm fine.

263
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,880
I don't want to wait any longer.

264
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,880
Let's pack and go.

265
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,880
Let's pack and go.

266
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,880
Your people are loyal.

267
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,880
Indeed.

268
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,880
Don't forget who raised you.

269
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,880
Tie her up.

270
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,880
Tie her up.

271
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,880
Help me up.

272
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,880
Sir, slow down.

273
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,880
Okay.

274
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,880
You can punish me.

275
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,880
But make it clear.

276
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,880
If there is any accident,

277
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,880
you should escape.

278
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,880
Don't expect my brothers to call you.

279
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,880
Okay.

280
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,880
Who saw Grandpa Si?

281
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,880
What happened?

282
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,880
Grandpa Si is missing?

283
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,880
No one saw him disappear?

284
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,880
Your grandpa is greedy.

285
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,880
Think about it.

286
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,880
What can we share?

287
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
You go down alone.

288
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,880
You can take more.

289
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,880
Why are you so worried?

290
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,880
Enough.

291
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,880
We leave now.

292
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,880
Now.

293
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,880
What should we do?

294
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,880
The symbol Xiaoge left.

295
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,880
When did Xiaoge leave?

296
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,880
There are six people on the jewelry.

297
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,880
Two people are missing.

298
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,880
Is Xiaoge one of them?

299
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,880
If Xiaoge is one of them,

300
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,880
what happened to her?

301
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,880
Who is the other person?

302
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,880
Are we going to go down?

303
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,880
Slow down.

304
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,880
Slow down.

305
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,880
Slow down.

306
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,880
Slow down.

307
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,880
Slow down.

308
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,880
Go down.

309
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,880
Your opinion is different from Xiaoge's.

310
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,880
Fatty.

311
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,880
Actually, I'm in a hurry to go down.

312
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,880
I feel that all our mysteries are just one step away.

313
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,880
If we don't go down now,

314
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,880
I might regret it for the rest of my life.

315
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,880
That makes sense.

316
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,880
Let's go.

317
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,880
Go.

318
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,880
Master, go to the airport.

319
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,880
Master, how about going to the high-speed train station?

320
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,880
Okay.

321
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,880
San Ya.

322
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,880
San Ya.

323
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,880
San Ya.

324
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,880
San Ya.

325
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,880
I'm here. You...

326
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,880
Uncle San.

327
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,880
Stop.

328
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,880
San Ya.

329
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,880
Hurry.

330
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,880
Give San Ya some medicine.

331
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,880
We'll stay here tonight.

332
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,880
San Ya, wake up.

333
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,880
San Ya.

334
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,880
Spread out a bit.

335
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,880
The patient is suffering from a high fever,

336
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,880
The wound of Wu Sanye has been seriously infected.

337
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,880
It's because the toxins in Youyan's body can't let the wound heal.

338
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,880
The wound is very deep.

339
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,880
The toxins have entered the internal organs.

340
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,880
Based on our current medical conditions,

341
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,880
I'm afraid that we can't extract the toxins from the body.

342
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,880
By night, I'm afraid that it will be more severe.

343
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,880
I estimate...

344
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,880
When can we cure it?

345
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,880
Can it be cleared by tomorrow?

346
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,880
Can it be cleared by tomorrow?

347
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,880
Doctor, can we go to the hospital now?

348
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,880
Now, the severe movement will make the disease more serious.

349
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,880
I want to give him a detoxifier.

350
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,880
And then absorb some oxygen.

351
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,880
If we can survive tonight,

352
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,880
there will be hope for tomorrow.

353
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,880
Sanye will definitely be able to hold on.

354
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,880
He said it himself.

355
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,880
He's been in such a big tremor.

356
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,880
He's never been in any danger.

357
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,880
This time, he can definitely survive.

358
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,880
Don't delay our progress.

359
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,880
Otherwise...

360
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,880
Don't. It's okay.

361
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,880
What Qiu Degao means is that

362
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,880
as the boss, he's got a bad sense of taste and taste.

363
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,880
Which of his men will be willing to sell his life?

364
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,880
Maybe one day he'll be able to pull the curtain.

365
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,880
Maybe he'll start from you.

366
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,880
He'll kick the hell out of you.

367
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,880
Kick the hell out of you.

368
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,880
Do you understand?

369
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,880
I understand.

370
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,880
Calm down. It's okay.

371
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,880
Sanche.

372
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,880
Sanche.

373
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,880
Miss Xiu Xiu didn't take the plane.

374
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,880
The airport travel record we mentioned is fake.

375
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,880
Maybe someone is helping her.

376
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,880
Someone is helping her?

377
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,880
Yes.

378
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,880
Is it Xie Zi?

379
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,880
No way.

380
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,880
It seems like someone is trying to drag me out.

381
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,880
No.

382
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,880
I don't think so.

383
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,880
I don't think so.

384
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,880
I don't think so.

385
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,880
I don't think so.

386
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,880
I don't think so.

387
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,880
You want to drag us out?

388
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,880
You tell everyone to come back.

389
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,880
We'll go straight to Dalian dock.

390
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,880
We'll go straight to Dalian dock.

391
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,880
Yes.

392
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,880
I don't think so.

393
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,880
I don't think so.

394
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,880
Although you don't play much,

395
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,880
You're not going to write?

396
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,880
It's okay. I know what I'm doing.

397
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,880
I'll let my uncle get through this night first.

398
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,880
But can the West Division still work?

399
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,880
The zombie doesn't have a gun.

400
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,880
When the time comes, it'll be easier to deal with the smoke and stuff.

401
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,880
How is it?

402
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,880
39.8 degrees.

403
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,880
That high?

404
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,880
If you burn it like this, you'll burn someone else.

405
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,880
Hold this.

406
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,880
Fatty, fatty!

407
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,880
Fatty, fatty!

408
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,880
Fatty, fatty!

409
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,880
Fatty, fatty!

410
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,880
Fatty, fatty!

411
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,880
What's wrong?

412
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,880
Uncle's body temperature hasn't dropped.

413
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,880
Let's go up and get him some ice.

414
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,880
Go up? Are you crazy?

415
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,880
It's so hard to walk up there.

416
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:20,160
And there are strong

417
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,880
frosts.

418
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,880
Come here.

419
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,880
Okay.

420
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,880
Then you sleep here.

421
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,880
You don't want to help Uncle. I'll go by myself.

422
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,880
Don't.

423
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,880
There are some anti-virus and anti-inflammatory drugs.

424
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,880
And vitamins.

425
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,880
I'll give you three shots.

426
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,880
Thank you.

427
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,880
What I said just now worked.

428
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,880
They've already started to split.

429
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,880
People like Qiu De Kao deserve to live.

430
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,880
Uncle.

431
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,880
Uncle, what's wrong?

432
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,880
Does it hurt again?

433
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,880
Uncle.

434
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,880
My nephew.

435
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,880
Uncle, you're awake.

436
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,880
Uncle, you're awake.

437
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,880
Don't talk.

438
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,880
You're very weak now.

439
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,880
We're listening to the doctor.

440
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,880
You'll be fine after a night of hard work.

441
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,880
Uncle has experienced so many times.

442
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,880
This time is different from the past.

443
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,880
I'm afraid I can't make it.

444
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,880
Uncle.

445
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,880
My nephew.

446
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,880
After I die,

447
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,880
no matter if you're happy or sad,

448
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,880
you have to make up your mind.

449
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,880
Don't let anyone see it.

450
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,880
And then you have to leave them.

451
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,880
Go to the old man.

452
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,880
Go.

453
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,880
Go.

454
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,880
You have to leave them.

455
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,880
Go to the old man.

456
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,880
On the third of next month,

457
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,880
Chen Piya will be waiting for me there.

458
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,880
After you see him,

459
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,880
I'll tell you everything.

460
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,880
If he's not there,

461
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,880
hand over all my belongings

462
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,880
to the young master.

463
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,880
Uncle.

464
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,880
Uncle.

465
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,880
I don't understand your business.

466
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,880
I don't understand.

467
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,880
When you're better, you can handle it.

468
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,880
For this,

469
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,880
you're still bragging to me.

470
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,880
Don't you want to be

471
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,880
a good-for-nothing second-class man?

472
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,880
Third uncle.

473
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,880
You're so lazy.

474
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,880
You just hide for a while

475
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,880
and you're playing with me?

476
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,880
How can you practice?

477
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,880
You'd better go back to Hangzhou.

478
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,880
Third uncle.

479
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,880
I don't know what to do.

480
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,880
You let me hide here.

481
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,880
But don't tell grandpa.

482
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,880
I've told him that I'm here to play.

483
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,880
I won't participate in business.

484
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,880
You're so smart.

485
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,880
Third uncle didn't teach you.

486
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,880
How can I know

487
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,880
that you really let me see these accounts?

488
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,880
I'm not afraid.

489
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,880
I'll see your accounts

490
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,880
and find out your gray business.

491
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,880
Purple?

492
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,880
You're really capable.

493
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,880
All the accounts are yours.

494
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,880
It's a deal.

495
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,880
Third uncle.

496
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,880
I don't want to see it.

497
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,880
I don't want to see it.

498
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,880
I don't want to see it.

499
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,880
You don't let me see it.

500
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,880
I don't want to see it, okay?

501
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,880
Third uncle.

502
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,880
Aren't you great?

503
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,880
Get up now.

504
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,880
Don't pretend to be sick.

505
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,880
I don't understand

506
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,880
your business and contract.

507
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,880
Don't give it to me.

508
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,880
If you give it to me,

509
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,880
I'll give you a bad product the next day.

510
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,880
You brat.

511
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,880
You dare to play with things?

512
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,880
I'll let the traitor beat you every day.

513
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,880
I'll beat you every day.

514
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,880
I'll beat you every day.

515
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,880
I'll beat you every day.

516
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,880
You have to beat him every day.

517
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,880
My nephew.

518
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,880
Third uncle.

519
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,880
I've done a lot of things

520
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,880
that I'm sorry about.

521
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,880
I had no choice.

522
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,880
Who told you

523
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,880
to be the only one?

524
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,880
There are things

525
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,880
I can't tell you now.

526
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,880
That's because

527
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,880
the later you know,

528
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,880
the better for you.

529
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,880
Forgive me.

530
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,880
Don't let me

531
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,880
take the regret away.

532
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,880
Third uncle.

533
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,880
Do you think

534
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,880
I'm soft-hearted?

535
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,880
If you don't get better,

536
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,880
I won't forgive you for the rest of my life.

537
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,880
I'm dying.

538
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,880
Can't you forgive me once?

539
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,880
Just once.

540
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,880
Third uncle.

541
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,880
Third uncle.

542
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,880
An Ning.

543
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,880
What's the situation with him?

544
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,880
Still unconscious. I'm afraid.

545
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,880
We can't wait anymore. We set out right after meal.

546
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,880
Let's go.

547
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,880
Third uncle.

548
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,880
Third uncle. Wake up.

549
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,880
Third uncle.

550
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,880
Third uncle.

551
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,880
Have you heard about

552
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,880
her death?

553
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,880
Third uncle.

554
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,880
Sire...

555
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,880
Sire...

556
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:00,880
Sire...

557
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,880
Sire...

558
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,880
Sire...

559
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,880
Sire...

560
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,880
Sire...

561
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,880
Uncle Sire...

562
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:30,880
Uncle Sire...

563
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,880
Uncle Sire...

564
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,880
Uncle Sire...

565
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,880
Don't worry.

566
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:50,880
I'm just afraid.

567
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,880
I'll take you back.

568
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:00,880
I'll take you back, Sire. Sire.

569
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:06,880
Sire...

570
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,880
Pan... Pan'er, I can't breathe.

571
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,880
Sire... Sire...

572
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,880
Sire, I'm glad you're okay.

573
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,880
I'm not like this kid.

574
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,880
This kid has no conscience.

575
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,880
Uncle Sire...

576
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,880
Uncle Sire, you can't scare people like this anymore.

577
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,880
Don't cry. I'll rest for a while.

578
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,880
Sire, you have to rest.

579
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,880
Sire...

580
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,880
Sire...

581
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,880
Sire...

582
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,880
Sire...

583
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:16,880
Sire...

584
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,880
Ani... Ani... We are reaching our goal.

585
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:26,880
Ani...

586
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,880
Sire...

587
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:56,880
Sire...

588
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,880
Sire...

589
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:06,880
Sire...

590
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,880
Sire...

591
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:16,880
Sire...

592
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:21,880
Sire...

593
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:26,880
Sire...

594
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:31,880
Sire...

595
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:36,880
Sire...

596
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:41,880
Sire...

597
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:46,880
Sire...

598
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:51,880
Sire...

599
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:56,880
Sire...

600
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:01,880
Sire...

601
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:06,880
Sire...

602
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,880
Sire...

603
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,880
Sire...

604
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,880
Sire...

605
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,880
Sire...

606
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,880
Sire...

607
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,880
Sire...

608
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,880
Sire...

609
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,880
Sire...

610
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,880
Sire...

611
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,880
The ball didn't come down.

612
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,880
This old fox might be holding something bad.

613
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,880
He won't disappear in such a critical place.

614
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,880
The Nine Dragon Taishi Pass.

615
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,880
Sire, this is the Nine Dragon Taishi Pass.

616
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,880
I didn't run away. This is definitely it. Look.

617
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,880
The Nine Dragon Taishi Pass.

618
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,880
That's the Nine Dragon Taishi Pass. Let's go.

619
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,880
Don't go. It's dangerous.

620
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,880
What's wrong?

621
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,880
Didn't you see the salt on it?

622
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,880
Isn't that a stone statue? What's there to be afraid of? What's with your eyes?

623
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:10,880
I'm not talking about the stone statue. It's the stone wall.

624
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:20,880
What's wrong?

625
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,880
Do you have eyes?

626
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,880
What about me?

627
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,880
The worms have mutated.

628
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,880
Why are they so big? This is abnormal.

629
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,880
Ning, your boss has a sharp tongue.

630
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,880
If you knew it was dangerous, you would have hidden in advance.

631
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,880
Do you want us to help you find a way out?

632
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:52,880
Ning, this is the toughest moment before success. You must help me.

633
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,880
If you're afraid, you can choose to leave. No one needs you here.

634
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,880
Look.

635
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,880
This is normal.

636
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,880
It's only two or three years old. It's as big as a little finger.

637
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,880
But these worms are so big.

638
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,880
They haven't lived for thousands of years, have they?

639
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,880
No. Why aren't they moving?

640
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,880
It's low temperature here. They're still in the winter. They won't wake up so easily.

641
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,880
It doesn't matter. We'll just have to shoot them a few times.

642
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,880
Then we'll see if the King of Bando is a human or a monster.

643
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:48,880
No. You said before that if this thing dies, its body will attract other companions.

644
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,880
There are so many worms on the way here. What if they all come?

645
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,880
What if they're bigger than this?

646
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,880
It's okay if they're afraid.

647
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,880
Oh, right. Li Qiu's exam is coming up.

648
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,880
I'll put a shield on your feet.

649
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,880
Pan Zi, when it's messy, you must protect Little Third Master.

650
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,880
An Ning, I don't have a gun. I'll lend you one.

651
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,880
You're not good at this. Come on.

652
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,880
Tang Dao, look at the words on the wall.

653
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,880
What does it say?

654
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,880
Look.

655
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:42,880
The words on the wall are like female characters, but they're not female characters.

656
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,880
If we have enough time and information, we might be able to study them.

657
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,880
I'm afraid we're in a situation where we're not.

658
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,880
You two are so low-key. Can you understand?

659
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,880
Are you okay, Third Master?

660
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,880
I'm here.

661
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,880
I'm here.

662
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,880
I'm here.

663
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,880
Where's Fatty?

664
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,880
Where's Fatty?

665
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,880
Little Third Master, look!

666
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,880
Fatty!

667
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,880
Fatty, what are you doing? Come down!

668
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,880
Little Third Master, don't worry.

669
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,880
Isn't he giving food to Youyan?

670
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,880
I just saw that Youyan's tail is locked on the stethoscope.

671
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,880
Fatty, come down from above. It shouldn't be dangerous.

672
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,880
No, he's...

673
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,880
You think the first switch can do anything?

674
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,880
Fatty, you're killing me!

675
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,880
You're killing me!

676
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,880
Fatty, you're killing me!

677
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,880
Fatty!

678
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,880
Fatty!

679
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,880
Are you okay, Little Third Master?

680
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,880
I'm okay.

681
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,880
Panda!

682
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,880
You...

683
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,880
Fatty!

684
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,880
You...

685
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,880
You...

686
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,880
You...

687
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,880
You...

688
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,880
The End
