1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 1

7
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 1

8
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
My grandpa's handwriting has always been like this.

9
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Because there's no explanation, I don't know what he drew.

10
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Later, I found out that...

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Isn't that Long Mai?

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Why didn't we find it before?

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
No wonder Qiu Dekang couldn't find it.

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
He made Long Mai into a star on the sky.

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Isn't he a lucky man?

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Three of them are the same name.

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
They are in the seven-star Lu Wang Palace, Guangxi Jing'er Palace,

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and the western Sea Department.

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
These three places are connected to a dangerous snow-covered dragon.

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's the first sea in Qianlong.

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But from a wind-covered snow-covered dragon,

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
this dragon has a short head.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Changbai Mountain?

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That's absolutely not wrong. It's Changbai Mountain.

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let me tell you, you're really good.

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yun Ding Tian Palace...

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What?

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
This is your shop?

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Come.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Two folks that work for you.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
As thick as lead.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What is your conversation?

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I have a businesspmph company.

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
They can all establish my business.

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I have found that video footage by two figures.

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But look where you bought it.

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I got it right away.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
How many have you grabbed?

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What?

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Why are you so noisy?

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You're making me sleepy.

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Look, you're sleeping.

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This is for you,

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
because I don't believe in Jason.

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I don't want to see

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
the things in the tomb

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
happen again.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Through this,

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
we can communicate.

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
For example,

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I can tell you in time

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
the people who Jason is.

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Here,

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
you can take a video

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and then tell me in time.

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You can take a picture

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
of the situation in the top of the clouds

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
and give it to me.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
If you don't want to take pictures,

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I can't do anything.

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But in fact,

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
we don't have any harm

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
to you at all.

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But those people

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
who you always believe in

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
may not be so reliable.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's not bad to leave

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
a trace for yourself.

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm going to the toilet.

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm going to the toilet.

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Mr. Wang,

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You should know

74
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
what to do next.

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Didn't I say

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
don't look for me

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
when you're fine?

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm worried that Mr. Wang

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
isn't self-sufficient enough.

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Mr. Jason,

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
would you like something to drink?

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Nen,

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
please bring some coffee

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
for our guest.

85
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I don't understand

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
how you can be so relaxed.

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The deadline is approaching

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and we haven't been able

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
to find the copperfish.

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Mr. Jason,

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
there's no need to rush.

92
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The team of Wu Shanxi and Wu Xie

93
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
have already reached

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
the cloud palace.

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Isn't that exactly

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
why we should rush?

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You are too impatient.

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Keep it together.

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The palace

100
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
is more dangerous

101
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
than all the terms

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
we have explored combined.

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's the ultimate secret

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
of Wang Zhanghai.

105
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
We must be extra careful.

106
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Wu Shanxi

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and his team

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
are experienced.

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
With them taking the lead

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
at the risk,

111
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
we were able to

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
wrap the reward end.

113
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Listen,

114
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I have planted ice

115
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
in their gym.

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
We will be informed

117
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
if anything turns up.

118
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Okay?

119
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Wu Xie,

120
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
you finally answered.

121
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I have to tell you something.

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Jason is going to

123
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
get the news

124
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and also

125
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
sign the contract.

126
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Wu Xie,

127
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
you can't believe me,

128
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
but I still have to remind you

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
that Jason's men

130
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
are being held in the police

131
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
and are being held in the

132
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
police station.

133
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm not going to

134
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
let you down.

135
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm not going to let you down.

136
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm not going to let you down.

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Oh,

138
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
thank you.

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You...

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What are you doing?

141
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What are you doing?

142
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What's wrong?

143
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Someone is following me.

144
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Who?

145
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I don't know.

146
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Maybe it's Jason

147
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
or Qiu Dekang.

148
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
They are all the same.

149
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Are they all the same?

150
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
No, you...

151
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Don't think about it.

152
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You can't, right?

153
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Hey, hey, hey.

154
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Hey, hey, hey.

155
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Hey, hey, hey.

156
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Hey, hey, hey.

157
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Hey, hey, hey.

158
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Hey, hey, hey.

159
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Hey, hey, hey.

160
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Hey, hey, hey.

161
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Hey, hey, hey.

162
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Hey, hey, hey.

163
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Hey, hey, hey.

164
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Hey, hey, hey.

165
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What is this?

166
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's from you.

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Hope you can keep it.

168
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You believe it?

169
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Of course not.

170
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What's wrong?

171
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Nothing.

172
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I...

173
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
There are many blind spots.

174
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
We have to be careful.

175
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Hey,

176
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm back.

177
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Where are you?

178
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Hey,

179
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
where are the blind spots

180
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
and the Tianzhen Bureau?

181
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You won't save me if you die.

182
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Well...

183
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yes, yes.

184
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It doesn't matter what the rest is.

185
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
But I'm in the store.

186
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Where are you?

187
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Where are you?

188
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm in the store.

189
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'll be there.

190
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Wait,

191
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You're still leaving?

192
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You mean you're not going to buy the store?

193
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm here for the big deal.

194
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You're the big deal.

195
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Chang, come back as soon as you can.

196
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Go to me when you're back.

197
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Here you are.

198
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Where's the stuff?

199
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I just got back.

200
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You don't know what to do.

201
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You're just like me.

202
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Like a drugstore.

203
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What stuff?

204
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You're just playing around.

205
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We're waiting for your owner.

206
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,800
Can you stop being so aggressive?

207
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,200
I can't afford to lose you.

208
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,200
You really don't have it in my hand?

209
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,600
Brother, don't touch me.

210
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,400
You're home.

211
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,200
I just like to see you...

212
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,800
Get out of here.

213
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,800
...get serious.

214
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,600
The sales are about to come.

215
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,800
Really?

216
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,800
You're eating?

217
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
The real deal?

218
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm telling you, that main customer...

219
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
...a Hong Kong person,

220
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
who has a five-picture real deal for a week,

221
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,600
he opened nine-picture books.

222
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,000
Your 10-picture book is really good.

223
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,800
Are you sure it's real?

224
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Hey, where is he?

225
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Guangxi?

226
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Okay, I got it.

227
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Okay, thank you.

228
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That's all.

229
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You're so petty.

230
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Mr. Wang.

231
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Oh my god, I didn't lock the door.

232
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's already late.

233
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Sorry, I'm late.

234
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Mr. Wang,

235
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
please show me how to get this.

236
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I can't stand it.

237
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I have to go on a business trip.

238
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Please, Mr. Wang.

239
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I only found you after I checked in.

240
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
They say you used to be a business man...

241
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
...and you're a big business man.

242
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
My family is sick.

243
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
They're in a hurry to get the money.

244
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That's why I bought the goods from the group.

245
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Okay.

246
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But I'm not a good person.

247
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You don't need to take out the new room.

248
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I have to read the first one.

249
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's not that.

250
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm a real man.

251
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Tangyin's real man.

252
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Tangyin's real man?

253
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
This is really Tangyin.

254
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It must be Tangyin.

255
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Okay, okay.

256
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
If this is the case,

257
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'll pay back the favor I owe you.

258
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Have some.

259
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Read it yourself.

260
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
What?

261
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm not talking nonsense.

262
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Let's go up the mountain.

263
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
If Mr. Yu's painting is okay,

264
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
we'll go to the next step.

265
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Okay?

266
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Mr. Yu,

267
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
can you show the painting to our boss?

268
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
He's looking forward to it.

269
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Okay.

270
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm willing to take this painting.

271
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But I have to pay for it.

272
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I can't pay it once.

273
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What do you mean?

274
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You have to hesitate for a few days

275
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
for our painting to be in this position.

276
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You misunderstood.

277
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's not a small number.

278
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Moreover, this gentleman wants cash.

279
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Can you give me a few days?

280
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You can.

281
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Pay the deposit first.

282
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You tell me.

283
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Here.

284
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Pay the deposit first.

285
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Give a point of three days.

286
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Mr. Wang,

287
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
but we don't have any guarantee

288
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
for this deposit.

289
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's hard to say if Mr. Yu

290
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
will take the deposit and go back.

291
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm not like that.

292
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Everyone will think of the painting.

293
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Are you willing to give us three days?

294
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
This is the electronic contract.

295
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Take a look.

296
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
If Mr. Wang makes this guarantee,

297
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
we'll be assured.

298
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But we also need to go down.

299
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's all out.

300
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
If you have any questions,

301
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
please sign it.

302
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
What do you mean?

303
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You're going to use my shop as a base?

304
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You misunderstood, Mr. Wang.

305
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
We just need a guarantee.

306
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
If Mr. Yu will take the painting

307
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
three days later,

308
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
you don't need to pay any price.

309
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm sorry.

310
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
The number you have dialed is busy.

311
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Please call again later.

312
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Mr. Wang.

313
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
My boss wants to talk to you.

314
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Hello, boss Jiang.

315
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Shi Jing.

316
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm Mr. Yu.

317
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Mr. Wang, it's me, Qiu Decao.

318
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Mr. Wang.

319
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Mr. Wang.

320
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You...

321
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
No, you...

322
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You gave me a trick, right?

323
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
No, what's your purpose?

324
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You're going to take my shop

325
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and you're going to throw away the promise you made?

326
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Mr. Wang,

327
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
can you tell me what I'm doing?

328
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm working with you with Shan Yi.

329
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Shan Yi, your grandpa.

330
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
If you promise me,

331
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'll keep on your travel contract

332
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
and I'll give you a good old friend.

333
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And I just want to ask you

334
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
to help me with a small favor.

335
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm telling you,

336
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I don't admit your contract at all.

337
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You know what?

338
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I don't admit any of the broken contracts.

339
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And that little thing.

340
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I really don't have time to give it to you.

341
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I just want you to help me with the blood.

342
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'll report to me in time.

343
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I don't do this, you know?

344
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Don't be anxious.

345
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I just want to know

346
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
how blood is moving.

347
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's necessary

348
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
to help you with some trouble.

349
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Think about it.

350
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's not for you.

351
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And you still have the right to say it.

352
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
That contract is valid.

353
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Hello?

354
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Hello?

355
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Hello?

356
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Come on, let's drink.

357
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Jie San.

358
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
How's your voice?

359
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Good.

360
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I heard you've got a lot.

361
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Not bad.

362
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Come on, let's drink.

363
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Come on, let's drink.

364
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Come on, come on.

365
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Come on.

366
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Let's drink first.

367
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Come on.

368
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Come on.

369
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,800
Look out.

370
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,320
Come on then.

371
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,120
Come, let's go.

372
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,080
Come.

373
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,400
Ok, let's go.

374
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,740
Go for it!

375
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,180
I'm going to ruin your business!

376
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:57,800
This guy belongs to my appeal as you combed your hair?!

377
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,440
I lost my eye toånga.

378
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,140
This captain in the adulting...

379
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,180
too much好人,

380
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,840
friend and status.

381
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,840
I'll kill you.

382
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,840
Boss,

383
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,840
clothes are expensive.

384
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,840
Go.

385
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,840
Don't think I don't want to choose.

386
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,840
Don't move.

387
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,840
Go.

388
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
Master.

389
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,840
Thank you.

390
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,840
Good morning, Mr. Jason.

391
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,840
What do you mean?

392
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,840
Nothing.

393
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,840
I'm just a friend.

394
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,840
Is this the way you friends are?

395
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,840
This is my way of friends.

396
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,840
Friends have a premise.

397
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,840
The premise is you have to know your own situation.

398
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,840
You can be my friend,

399
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,840
or you can be my friend.

400
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,840
I'm afraid you said it wrong.

401
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,840
Is this the way you friends are?

402
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,840
You can try it.

403
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,840
I'm happy to be with you.

404
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,840
But you haven't found Yun Ding Tian Gong.

405
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,840
You're here to get a big head.

406
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,840
I think your boss is very happy.

407
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,840
What?

408
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,840
Xie Yichen,

409
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,840
as I said,

410
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,840
two defeated each other,

411
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,840
it's not a good situation.

412
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,840
So,

413
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,840
you'd better not disturb me.

414
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,840
So,

415
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,840
I never hit a dog.

416
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,840
Mr. Jason,

417
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,840
you stole my snake-meat-tong fish.

418
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,840
I've already given you the face

419
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,840
of this situation.

420
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,840
What do you think?

421
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,840
It's simple.

422
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,840
I want to give you a chance to cooperate.

423
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,840
A chance to cooperate?

424
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,840
You've been looking for Yun Ding Tian Gong

425
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,840
in Changbai Mountain.

426
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,840
How do you know?

427
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,840
Of course, I have my news.

428
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,840
And I also know

429
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,840
Qiu Dekou will definitely stop you

430
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,840
from doing it.

431
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,840
And he will also use a good excuse

432
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,840
to go up the mountain.

433
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,840
For example,

434
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,840
let Wu Xie be the target.

435
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,840
Let's go and check the way.

436
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,840
Do you think I'll believe what you say?

437
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,840
Whether I believe it or not,

438
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,840
I know that

439
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,840
you can't believe Qiu Dekou.

440
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,840
You know better than anyone

441
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,840
that Yuan Cheng's operation

442
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,840
will never be a practical action.

443
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,840
If I were you,

444
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,840
I wouldn't want to delay

445
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,840
your hardware and time.

446
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,840
But Wu Xie has already left.

447
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,840
You can still leave now.

448
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,840
I know where they will be.

449
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,840
Xie Yuchen,

450
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,840
what do you want?

451
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,840
It's simple.

452
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,840
Someone stole my snake-meat-pickle.

453
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,840
I want you to take it back for me.

454
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,840
Even if you fail, it's fine.

455
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,840
It's also okay to cause them some trouble.

456
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,840
I want them to know

457
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,840
that Xie Yuchen's stuff

458
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,840
is not so easy to get.

459
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,840
That's all?

460
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,840
And

461
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,840
I want the information on the bottom of the sea

462
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,840
and the archaeological team.

463
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,840
I think you know

464
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,840
that you have already attracted the attention of the police.

465
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,840
If I didn't help you,

466
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,840
you would have had to deal with it yourself.

467
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,840
It might take a few more days.

468
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,840
They have already left.

469
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,840
If you continue to play for a few more days,

470
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,840
you will be back to the US.

471
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,840
Didn't your company give you

472
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,840
a lot of pressure?

473
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,840
If your company knows,

474
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,840
you have already been fired from the company,

475
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,840
what will happen

476
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,840
after you return to the US?

477
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,840
Then I thank you for your kindness.

478
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,840
Water.

479
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,840
Ani,

480
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,840
I think Jason is up to something soon.

481
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,840
Why don't you go to Changbai Mountain?

482
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,840
It's better if you stay with Wu Xie.

483
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,840
I'll go.

484
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,840
They are the police.

485
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,840
No.

486
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,840
Hurry up.

487
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,840
Hurry up.

488
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,840
Then I...

489
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,840
What kind of road is this?

490
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,840
They are the police.

491
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,840
How do you know?

492
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,840
You didn't see them in the medical room.

493
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,840
They are making a fuss.

494
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,840
They are shooting at us.

495
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,840
Do you think

496
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,840
they came to us?

497
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,840
Didn't you say that

498
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,840
you were checked once?

499
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,840
Thank you.

500
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,840
I don't know.

501
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,840
I don't know.

502
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,840
I don't know.

503
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,840
Thank you.

504
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,840
Then please ask

505
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,840
where you are from.

506
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,840
Where are you going?

507
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,840
Changbai Mountain.

508
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,840
We are just around the city.

509
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,840
We are just around.

510
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,840
I'm a big man.

511
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,840
I'm a weirdo.

512
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,840
Look at my little finger.

513
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,840
Let's go.

514
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,840
Where are you going?

515
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,840
I'm going to ask.

516
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,840
Where are you going?

517
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,840
Where are you going?

518
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,840
Are you going to hit the car?

519
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,840
Go to my car.

520
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,840
Sir.

521
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,840
Sir.

522
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,840
Follow me.

523
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,840
I'm going to the car over there.

524
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,840
Go.

525
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,840
We are going to this place.

526
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,840
Okay.

527
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,840
Let's go.

528
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,840
What do you mean?

529
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,840
Let's go.

530
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,840
I'm going to this place too.

531
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,840
Let's go.

532
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,840
I'm going to the car over there.

533
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,840
Let's go.

534
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,840
Over there.

535
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,840
Yes.

536
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,840
Come on.

537
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,840
Sir.

538
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,840
Sir.

539
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,840
Come on.

540
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,840
What are you doing?

541
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,840
Come on.

542
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,840
Take it slow.

543
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,840
We are almost there.

544
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,840
Okay.

545
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,840
That's good.

546
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,840
Don't worry.

547
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,840
Just a little bit more.

548
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,840
That's good.

549
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,840
Come on.

550
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,840
Sit inside.

551
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,840
Sit tight.

552
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,840
I want to sleep.

553
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,840
Go.

554
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,840
Take a deep sleep.

555
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,840
Lie down.

556
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,840
I'll tell you something.

557
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,200
It's now the snowy mountains

558
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,340
that you are going to.

559
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,840
The road is very difficult to walk at.

560
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,840
Few people can get there.

561
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,840
Luckily, you meet me here.

562
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,840
I can walk.

563
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,840
He drove a big car.

564
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,840
How courageous are you?

565
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,920
How did you know that?

566
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,840
I have a sprain on my shoulder.

567
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,920
Someone Gao Shuqian

568
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,920
Through the leather pants

569
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,060
With your spiral螃蟹

570
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,220
It means I'm right

571
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,460
Was I supposed to say that?

572
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,120
Thanks, big bro

573
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,560
We can manage

574
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,520
What's your name?

575
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,840
What happened?

576
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:53,840
The police caught two people who lost their lives.

577
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,840
Boss, they went up the mountain road.

578
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,840
Our car can't go up.

579
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,840
Master Hua, I know.

580
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,840
Go to the city to exchange the car.

581
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,840
Go to Changbai Pavilion.

582
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,840
Yes.

583
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,840
This way.

584
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,840
Fatty.

585
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,840
300.

586
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,840
Okay, 300 is 300.

587
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,840
Here you go.

588
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,840
Thank you, master.

589
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,840
Thank you, master.

590
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,840
You're welcome.

591
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,840
Thank you.

592
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,840
You're welcome.

593
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,840
Thank you.

594
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,840
Thank you.

595
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,840
Thank you.

596
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,840
Thank you, master.

597
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,840
You gave too much.

598
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,840
How can you give so much?

599
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,840
Really.

600
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,840
This dog is good.

601
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,840
Uncle Hai.

602
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,840
Uncle Hai.

603
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,840
Why are you here?

604
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,840
It's Mr. San.

605
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,840
I'm hired as an orphan.

606
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,840
I don't know what to say.

607
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,840
I don't know what to say.

608
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,840
Mr. San, why are you here?

609
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,840
I'm here to meet Uncle San.

610
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,840
Do you know where he is?

611
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,840
Uncle San.

612
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,840
He's a great swordsman.

613
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,840
Where can I meet him?

614
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,840
I'm curious.

615
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,840
Why did you come with Chen Pi and Si?

616
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,840
Who?

617
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,840
The old man on the road.

618
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:11,840
You should call him Si.

619
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,840
Fatty.

620
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,840
I...

621
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,840
You're from the same team, right?

622
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,840
Why are you here?

623
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,840
We're from the club.

624
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,840
We're here to participate in the ski resort.

625
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,840
Skis resort?

626
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,840
Yes.

627
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,840
What's the name of the club?

628
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,840
It's a club.

629
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,840
It's a club.

630
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,840
It's a club.

631
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,840
It's a club.

632
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,840
It's a club.

633
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,840
It's a club.

634
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,840
It's a club.

635
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,840
We're here to participate in the ski resort.

636
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,840
Skis resort?

637
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,840
Yes.

638
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,840
We're here to see a ski resort.

639
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,840
We'll check it out first.

640
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,840
See if it's appropriate.

641
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,840
If it's appropriate,

642
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,840
the ski resort and the Dujia Mountain villa

643
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,840
can also be built to attract the local economy.

644
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,840
It's a good thing.

645
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,840
But it's dangerous to walk on the mountain.

646
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
Of course.

647
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,840
We have so many people.

648
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,840
I can't afford to do anything.

649
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,840
We have to be careful.

650
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,840
Okay.

651
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,840
Then check the back door.

652
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,840
How's the scenery on this season?

653
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,840
The scenery is beautiful.

654
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,840
There are many people in the summer and autumn.

655
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,840
But in winter,

656
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,840
there's no such thing as a breeze.

657
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,840
It's just too cold.

658
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,840
The weather changes every three days.

659
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,840
It's not safe.

660
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,840
I'd rather not recommend it.

661
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,840
Okay, okay, okay.

662
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,840
Let's go.

663
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,840
Take care.

664
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,840
Thank you.

665
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,840
So close.

666
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,840
We can't tell.

667
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,760
I guess Mr. Slu's sketch

668
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,760
looks smaller than smoke?

669
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,840
It's a good guess.

670
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,040
He's not young.

671
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,440
Right. He's the one who's been praising the Xiong.

672
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,840
You think this kind of person

673
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,840
can only be met in the martial arts school?

674
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,840
Yes.

675
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,440
Si Ha Gong Hao, we really had a good time.

676
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,440
We really had a good time.

677
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,240
I'm not saying you had a good time.

678
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,240
I...

679
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,240
I'm sorry.

680
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,240
I'm sorry.

681
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,240
I'm sorry.

682
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,240
I'm sorry.

683
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,240
I'm sorry.

684
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,240
I'm sorry.

685
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,240
I'm sorry.

686
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,240
I'm sorry.

687
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,240
I...

688
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,240
He's not young.

689
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,840
Mr. San, you're also here.

690
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,840
Pan Zi.

691
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,840
Pan Zi.

692
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,840
I'm cleaning up the room.

693
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,840
Pan Zi, why are you here?

694
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,840
Mr. San asked me to wait for him here.

695
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,840
Mr. San?

696
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,840
Where is Mr. San now?

697
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,840
Mr. San went down.

698
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,840
I thought he went with you.

699
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,840
He said that if he didn't go down,

700
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,840
he would have to wait for a few days.

701
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,840
Are you here for Jiala?

702
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,840
Pan Zi, I'm a little tired today.

703
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,840
I'll go back to my room and rest.

704
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,840
I'll be looking for you later.

705
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,840
Okay.

706
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,840
You take a good rest.

707
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,840
I'll go find Jiala.

708
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,840
Okay.

709
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,840
I'll go back first, Pan Zi.

710
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,840
Okay.

711
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,840
Uncle Hai.

712
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,840
What a big snowstorm.

713
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,840
I thought you guys would not come.

714
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,840
How could it be, Uncle Hai?

715
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,840
You know that this is Mr. San's wish for many years.

716
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,840
Uncle Hai,

717
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,840
have they come to the Wuxia?

718
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,840
Look.

719
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,840
Have you lost?

720
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,840
Mr. San.

721
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,840
Pan Zi.

722
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,840
This is a joke.

723
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,840
He doesn't work.

724
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,840
He said that he would go down the snow these days.

725
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,840
He suggested that we should not go up the mountain.

726
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,840
There are no other jokes.

727
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,840
Although Uncle Hai is Jiala's son-in-law,

728
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,840
I think that Chen Ping-A is the key figure.

729
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,840
If he can cooperate with us,

730
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,840
this person will be very strange.

731
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,840
He should leave everything to his disciple.

732
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,840
Pan Zi.

733
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,840
You said that

734
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,840
Uncle Hai is Jiala's son-in-law.

735
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,840
Pan Zi.

736
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,840
Why can't you tell me why Uncle Hai is not here?

737
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,840
He may not know that you are here to see Jiala.

738
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,840
No way.

739
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,840
He is not here to see Jiala.

740
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,840
He is here to see Jiala.

741
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,840
He is here to see Jiala.

742
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,840
How could he not know that I am here?

743
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,840
You are thinking too much.

744
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,840
What are you thinking?

745
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,840
Uncle Hai may cooperate with Jiala.

746
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,840
So, I am sorry to see you.

747
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,840
It's embarrassing.

748
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,840
Actually, I am telling you.

749
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:44,840
The most important thing is to find a way to go up the mountain.

750
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,840
I am talking to you.

751
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,840
I am thinking too.

752
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,840
But look at the snow.

753
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,840
We can only wait.

754
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,840
And I don't know if Uncle Hai has gone up the mountain.

755
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,840
Pan Zi.

756
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,840
You...

757
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,840
You are a big man.

758
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,840
You are a big man.

759
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,840
You are a big man.
