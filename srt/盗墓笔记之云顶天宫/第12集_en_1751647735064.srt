1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The End

2
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The temperature here is quite low.

3
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The End

4
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What are you doing?

5
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's not easy to come to this place.

6
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You can't see it clearly.

7
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You have to appreciate it.

8
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
No.

9
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
This is a place.

10
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
If you light all these lamps,

11
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
the temperature will rise,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
and the ice will melt.

13
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
This is called a collapse.

14
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Such a big place.

15
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Your flashlight can't even see through.

16
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
How can you see without lighting the lamps?

17
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You have to light the lamps one by one.

18
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What?

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The End

20
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm not hungry anymore. Let's go.

21
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Zhang Hao.

22
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I advise you to tell me the truth.

23
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I don't have time to waste with you.

24
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
When I get you back,

25
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I won't be here to talk to you.

26
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Women talk too much.

27
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
If you're capable,

28
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
keep fighting.

29
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I...

30
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
No, no, no.

31
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Don't fight.

32
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Enough.

33
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'll talk.

34
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Go ahead.

35
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Miss.

36
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You're still here

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
playing with my pig and eating my tiger.

38
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You're still a little tender.

39
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Zha Sha, chase them.

40
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Don't be rash.

41
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Brother Xiao Hua.

42
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
They know a lot about the relics.

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
We must catch up with them.

44
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Xiu Xiu.

45
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Leave this to me.

46
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You're a girl.

47
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What if something happens to you

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
if I'm not here?

49
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Zhang Hao.

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm sorry.

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm sorry.

98
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm sorry.

101
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm sorry.

110
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm sorry.

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm sorry.

115
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm sorry.

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm sorry.

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm sorry.

122
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm sorry.

123
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm sorry.

124
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm sorry.

128
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm sorry.

129
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm sorry.

131
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm sorry.

139
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,240
is

140
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:36,240
hey

141
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,400
should

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,980
good

143
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,180
The possibility of a trap is very small.

144
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,580
And it's been sealed for so long. Even if there's a trap, it can't be used.

145
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,780
You're not listening to me.

146
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,980
You're trying to kill me with your lanterns.

147
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,280
Don't be surprised. Don't shoot me.

148
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,980
Whatever.

149
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,980
What are you doing?

150
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,980
Don't you think it's getting colder?

151
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,980
Fatty, I'm at my limit.

152
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,980
Your fat body is so unmovable.

153
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:32,980
I've been taking care of you for two months and you've already lost weight.

154
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,980
This temperature, no one can handle it.

155
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,980
Yes.

156
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,980
This is just a mirror.

157
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,980
It's not a mirror.

158
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,980
It's a mirror.

159
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,980
It's a mirror.

160
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,980
No one can handle it.

161
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,980
Yes.

162
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,980
This is just a mirror.

163
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,980
It's been a long time.

164
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,980
It can't be held.

165
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,980
Here.

166
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,980
Here.

167
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,980
Drink some water.

168
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,980
What sound?

169
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,980
No sound.

170
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,980
Grandpa, are you too cold?

171
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,980
Why don't you come over and warm yourself up?

172
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,980
I heard it too.

173
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,980
Ever since I got sick, I've been feeling much better.

174
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,980
It's late.

175
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,980
They say that the ancients are worse than the modern ones.

176
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,980
They say that the ancients are worse than the modern ones.

177
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,980
Actually, they're not.

178
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,980
Our ancestors left us wisdom.

179
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,980
Now, we still have to admire them.

180
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,980
Is there any fuel left?

181
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,980
Why is the fire so small?

182
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,980
It's all gone.

183
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,980
You almost burned my explosives.

184
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,980
There's still some alcohol left.

185
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,980
Everyone, calm down.

186
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,980
Listen carefully.

187
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,980
Where did this broken sound come from?

188
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,980
It's coming from there.

189
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,980
Turn off the fire.

190
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,980
This is made of ice. It's very cold.

191
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,980
Don't turn it off. It's cold.

192
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,980
Why is the fire so strong?

193
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,980
The soldiers can't stand the structure here.

194
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,980
They must have added some special material here.

195
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,980
That's why it's the same color as the main body.

196
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,980
And the clouds and fog in the hall are also because of the base.

197
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,980
During the day, the temperature is high.

198
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,980
These bases release white clouds.

199
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,980
When the temperature drops at night,

200
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,980
the clouds will be re-stained with frost.

201
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,980
When the temperature rises again during the day,

202
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,980
the clouds will come out again.

203
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,980
The cycle continues.

204
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,980
This is how the unique natural atmosphere in the hall is formed.

205
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,980
I didn't see it coming, Wu Xie.

206
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,980
You're so good at this.

207
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,980
You're a bad person.

208
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,980
That's the principle.

209
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,980
I think the only way to see the building is on this cold snowy mountain.

210
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,980
I think this is the first part of ancient China.

211
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,980
What should we do?

212
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,980
If we don't turn off the fire, we'll freeze to death.

213
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,980
How about...

214
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,980
Grandpa Si.

215
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,980
It's too cold.

216
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,980
Let's go out and come back when we're ready.

217
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,980
I'm fine.

218
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,980
If you young people are not as good as me,

219
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,980
I think we should just go back to the mansion.

220
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,980
It's too much trouble to go back now.

221
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,980
And we don't know what the snow layer is.

222
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,980
Let's hold on a little longer.

223
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,980
My feet and face are cold.

224
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,980
I'm almost out of my senses.

225
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,980
Let's go.

226
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,980
Xiu Xiu, what's wrong with you today?

227
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,980
Do you know how dangerous today is?

228
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,980
Can you handle this as a girl?

229
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,980
This is a matter of the Huo family's reputation.

230
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,980
If grandma really gets involved in the sale of cultural relics,

231
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,980
I hope I'm the first person who knows the truth.

232
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,980
The rules of the old nine gates are the rules of the old nine gates.

233
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,980
I will never do anything.

234
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,980
Maybe you misunderstood your grandma.

235
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,980
Maybe grandma Huo was deceived.

236
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,980
But once...

237
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:48,980
I hope you have the courage to accept the truth.

238
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,980
Brother Xiao Hua.

239
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,980
Brother Xiao Hua.

240
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,980
I always thought that a person like me,

241
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,980
who is fearless,

242
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,980
would have the courage to accept this.

243
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,980
I know the photos grandma sent you.

244
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,980
I also know you are very busy recently.

245
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,980
Actually, I didn't want to bother you.

246
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,980
Xiu Xiu.

247
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,980
Let me say it again.

248
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,980
I'm your brother.

249
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,980
You can't handle this alone.

250
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,980
So,

251
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,980
leave it to me.

252
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,980
Okay?

253
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,980
Xiao Hua.

254
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,980
You are always so calm.

255
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,980
Xiu Xiu.

256
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,980
We all have to pay for the people we love.

257
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,980
Wu Xie has to pay for his third uncle.

258
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,980
He is a doctor of nine lives.

259
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,980
He has to go to the Sky Palace.

260
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,980
You have to pay for grandma Huo.

261
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,980
No matter how big the risk is,

262
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,980
you have to find out the truth.

263
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,980
And I...

264
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,980
I have to pay for the people I love.

265
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,980
Jia Sha.

266
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,980
Master Hua.

267
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,980
Watch Zhang Hao.

268
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,980
Be careful.

269
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,980
He must have a business.

270
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,980
Don't be careless.

271
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,980
We have to put a long line.

272
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,980
Don't be careless.

273
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,980
I'm sorry.

274
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,980
It's really that close.

275
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,980
I almost froze to death here.

276
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,980
I'm sorry.

277
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,980
Go.

278
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,980
Go.

279
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,980
It's so beautiful.

280
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,980
If we hadn't come here,

281
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,980
who would have known that there is such a place

282
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,980
under Mt. Changbai that has such a great power.

283
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,980
I said, Fatty.

284
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,980
You are so beautiful.

285
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,980
I'm sorry.

286
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,980
I'm sorry.

287
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,980
I'm sorry.

288
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,980
I'm sorry.

289
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,980
I'm sorry.

290
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,980
I'm sorry.

291
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,980
I'm sorry.

292
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,980
I'm sorry.

293
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,980
I'm sorry.

294
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,980
I said, Fatty.

295
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,980
Even if there is no mechanism,

296
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,980
we have to protect the wooden house.

297
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,980
Let Fatty open a duck soup shop.

298
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,980
If it's warm, it's warm.

299
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,980
Can you?

300
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,980
Don't worry.

301
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,980
You...

302
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,980
Look.

303
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,980
Look.

304
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,980
Look at this.

305
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,980
Brother Hua.

306
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,980
What is this?

307
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,980
Shouldn't this be the statue of the owner?

308
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,980
Why is it this?

309
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,980
The Changsheng Heaven that changes from east to west.

310
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,980
This is their main deity.

311
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,980
This deity looks so ugly.

312
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,980
It's a big horse.

313
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,980
Can you be more polite?

314
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,980
Isn't this in his territory?

315
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,980
Aren't you afraid of being punished?

316
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,980
What are you afraid of with this tail deity?

317
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,980
The Changsheng Heaven is an invisible thing.

318
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,980
It represents the power of infinity.

319
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,980
It's a kind of cosmic worship.

320
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,980
How can it be like a horse?

321
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,980
Good.

322
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,980
You know a lot.

323
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,980
We are usually naïve.

324
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,980
It's not my turn to think.

325
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,980
Naïve.

326
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,980
You say it.

327
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,980
This thing looks like

328
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,980
a evil deity who worships the deity.

329
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,980
I saw it once when I was in Shanghai.

330
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,980
Their deity looks like this.

331
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,980
It's like a big bug.

332
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,980
Right?

333
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,980
Well, you continue.

334
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,980
You continue.

335
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,980
Yes.

336
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,980
It's written in the同一.

337
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,980
The king of the ten thousand slaves is a creature found underground.

338
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,980
Could this be the image of the king of the ten thousand slaves?

339
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,980
The East Xia people use a horse king as an emperor.

340
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,980
If only I could know the contents of the two other同一.

341
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,980
Try again.

342
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,980
Let them know that you have the same fish.

343
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,980
It's not a good thing.

344
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,980
Okay.

345
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,980
Fatty.

346
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,980
It's warm here.

347
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,980
Tianzhen.

348
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,980
Be careful.

349
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,980
I know.

350
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,980
Look.

351
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,980
It's Qingtong.

352
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,980
According to the literature,

353
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,980
she is a woman with a very strong heart.

354
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,980
She is a woman with a very strong heart.

355
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,980
According to the literature,

356
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,980
she is not a woman with a very strong heart.

357
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,980
She is not a woman with a very strong heart.

358
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,980
I think she is a woman with a very strong heart.

359
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,980
I think she is a woman with a very strong heart.

360
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,980
If this bug is really the deity of the East Xia people,

361
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,980
then these two men must be her guardian beasts.

362
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,980
The horse king and the monkey are really strange.

363
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:00,980
Maybe it has something to do with the mythical legend of the local speciality of hell.

364
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,980
We are not the people of the day.

365
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,980
We can't verify it.

366
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,980
But why is it Qingtong again?

367
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,980
It's Qingtong again.

368
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,980
The iron line was very developed at that time.

369
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,980
Brother.

370
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,980
It's Qingtong again.

371
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,980
It's not reasonable.

372
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,980
It's not reasonable.

373
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,980
In the common spiritual palace,

374
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,980
there are places for the sacrifice.

375
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,980
The long-living net is removed.

376
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,980
There are warm rooms, safe beds, and the gods.

377
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,980
But look around.

378
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,980
There is no simple burial object.

379
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,980
After all, it is a minority.

380
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:40,980
There may be no such custom.

381
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,980
Don't talk nonsense.

382
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:44,980
Why are you going?

383
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,980
You are my mother.

384
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,980
You always control me.

385
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,980
Fatty.

386
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,980
Fatty.

387
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,980
What's wrong?

388
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,980
Can't go?

389
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,980
What's going on?

390
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,980
It's dawn.

391
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,980
We can't see anything in the hall.

392
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,980
There must be a lot of dangerous things.

393
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,980
I'm going to annoy them.

394
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,980
How about this?

395
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,980
I have a rope on my waist.

396
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,980
You guys hold me.

397
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,980
I'll go in and see.

398
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,980
The waist is not very strong.

399
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,980
I can't go in.

400
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,980
I can't go in.

401
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,980
I can't go in.

402
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,980
I can't go in.

403
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,980
I can't go in.

404
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,980
Look.

405
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,980
If there is something good,

406
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,980
you count your skills.

407
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,980
I'll give you ten percent.

408
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,980
Fatty.

409
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,980
I hate you the most.

410
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,980
If you want to go crazy,

411
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,980
when we go out,

412
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,980
you will be crazy inside.

413
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,980
After you tie the rope,

414
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,980
we pull the rope.

415
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,980
When we pull it back,

416
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,980
you will have a big leg.

417
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,980
We will go in and find you.

418
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,980
Wait.

419
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,980
If you want to go, you go by yourself.

420
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,980
Okay.

421
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,980
I obey the organization.

422
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,980
Before I find out the enemy's situation,

423
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,980
I will never betray the organization.

424
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,980
You can't betray even if you find out.

425
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,980
Okay.

426
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,980
I listen to you.

427
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,980
Look at him.

428
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,980
OK.

429
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,980
Have you guys seen this?

430
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,980
This was auctioned at the auction.

431
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,980
It was 4 billion Hong Kong dollars.

432
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,980
Hey.

433
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,980
Think about it.

434
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,980
You move back so big a door like this.

435
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,980
Those are all noise.

436
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,980
Now the share price

437
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,980
of the antiques trade market

438
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,980
is of a higher price than 200,000.

439
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,980
The highest price for the door is 400,000.

440
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,980
Don't I know that?

441
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,980
What?

442
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,980
400,000 is two hundred million.

443
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,980
Impossible.

444
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,980
Everyone is waiting for someone like you to buy a house.

445
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,980
In the next life, the job is counting money at home.

446
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,980
In the next life, you can cry at home.

447
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,980
I think you are really falling into the trap.

448
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,980
Wu Xie, move aside.

449
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,980
Don't hurt yourself.

450
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,980
Wu Xie, move aside.

451
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,980
There is no sound at all.

452
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,980
Monk.

453
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,980
You said that this jade door is pretty good.

454
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,980
If I blow it up...

455
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,980
Blow up? Are you crazy?

456
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,980
This is a cultural relic.

457
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,980
Then I won't have any choice.

458
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,980
Have you thought about how to open the door?

459
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,980
I'm thinking about it.

460
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,980
Fatty.

461
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,980
You said that you have a fat body on your head.

462
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,980
Did we think of it a long time ago?

463
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,980
Listen to my tone. I'm trying to make fun of you.

464
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:09,980
I tell you, I've thought about it.

465
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,980
What if the switch is not on the door?

466
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,980
Fatty.

467
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,980
What did you say? Say it again.

468
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,980
I said the switch is not on the door.

469
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,980
The switch is not on the door.

470
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,980
Right.

471
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,980
We found it.

472
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,980
Maybe the way to open the door is not on the door.

473
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,980
Let's look around and see if there are any mechanisms.

474
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,980
What are you doing? Let's go.

475
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,980
Old man, three times the speed.

476
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,980
Oh.

477
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,980
Why are you looking at me with your eyes of admiration?

478
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,980
No sympathy.

479
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,980
This is a big oil rock.

480
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,980
This is the symbol of King of the Ten Thousand Poison.

481
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,980
Oh.

482
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,980
It's getting hotter and hotter.

483
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,980
Why didn't I see it just now?

484
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,980
What is this treasure?

485
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,980
This is a map of the Nine Palace Pavilion.

486
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,980
The current pattern is not complete.

487
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,980
We...we have to find the remaining four maps.

488
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,980
Then you can just take the four pieces around the altar.

489
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,980
I didn't get it down just now.

490
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,980
Now I have to use some strength.

491
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:47,980
Okay, Fatty.

492
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,980
It seems cold can keep your head clear.

493
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,980
No, I still can't get it down.

494
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,980
I think we have to find new patterns.

495
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,980
Impossible.

496
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,980
It's these four pieces.

497
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,980
The patterns on it are all in a series.

498
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,980
But how to get it down is a big problem.

499
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,980
I think I can get it down.

500
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,980
I think I can get it down.

501
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,980
I think I can get it down.

502
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,980
I think I can get it down.

503
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,980
I think I can get it down.

504
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,980
I think I can get it down.

505
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,980
I think I can get it down.

506
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,980
I think I can get it down.

507
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,980
I think I can get it down.

508
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,980
I think I can get it down.

509
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,980
I think I can get it down.

510
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,980
I think I can get it down.

511
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,980
I think I can get it down.

512
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,980
I think I can get it down.

513
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,980
I think I can get it down.

514
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,980
I think I can get it down.

515
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,980
I think I can get it down.

516
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,980
I think I can get it down.

517
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,980
I think I can get it down.

518
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,980
I think I can get it down.

519
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,980
I think I can get it down.

520
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,980
I think I can get it down.

521
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,980
I think I can get it down.

522
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,980
I think I can get it down.

523
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,980
I think I can get it down.

524
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,980
I think I can get it down.

525
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,980
I think I can get it down.

526
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,980
I think I can get it down.

527
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,980
I think I can get it down.

528
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,980
I think I can get it down.

529
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,980
I think I can get it down.

530
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,980
I think I can get it down.

531
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,980
I think I can get it down.

532
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,980
I think I can get it down.

533
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,980
I think I can get it down.

534
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,980
I think I can get it down.

535
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,980
I think I can get it down.

536
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,980
I think I can get it down.

537
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,980
I think I can get it down.

538
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,980
I think I can get it down.

539
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,980
I think I can get it down.

540
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,980
I think I can get it down.

541
00:31:54,980 --> 00:32:06,480
The

542
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,980
What did you steals this?

543
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,980
This is a secret.

544
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,980
I'm not going to tell you.

545
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,980
Secrets?

546
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,980
Why didn't you tell me?

547
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,980
I don't have any other three pieces.

548
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,980
No, I only have this one.

549
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,980
I'll try again.

550
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,980
I'll try. I don't believe in secrets.

551
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,980
I can do it too.

552
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,980
I have something!

553
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,980
I'll take it too.

554
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,980
Come, look.

555
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,980
What do you mean?

556
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,980
Wu Xin took this to take it down.

557
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,980
You have something to do with them.

558
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,980
Then you take this.

559
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,980
You take the other pieces.

560
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,980
This should be a rule.

561
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,980
This puzzle must be put in a new pattern

562
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,980
so that it can move again.

563
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,980
This position cannot be put anywhere.

564
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,980
Every time we put it in the pattern,

565
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,980
we directly decide the difficulty of our future puzzle.

566
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,980
Open the door, you're so clumsy.

567
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,980
Are you done?

568
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,980
Wu Xie, no, you move.

569
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,980
I'm not done.

570
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,980
I'm not done.

571
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,980
I'm not done.

572
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,980
I'm not done.

573
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,980
I'm not done.

574
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,980
Wu Xin, you move.

575
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,980
I have it!

576
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,980
Look.

577
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,980
Come.

578
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,980
The puzzle of the Ninth Palace.

579
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,980
It's not easy.

580
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,980
It's okay.

581
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,980
Just try it.

582
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,980
Try it.

583
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,980
Don't worry.

584
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,980
This...

585
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,980
We can't mess it up, right?

586
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,980
What if we try it wrong?

587
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,980
What if there are other mechanisms?

588
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,980
The worst result is that the door is sealed.

589
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,980
We can't get out.

590
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,980
What if...

591
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,980
Fatty.

592
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,980
You and Lang Feng go around and see.

593
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,980
See if there are other clues.

594
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,980
Lang Feng!

595
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,980
Stop!

596
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,980
Let's step on it first.

597
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,980
I'm not done yet.

598
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,980
I'm not done yet.

599
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,980
I'm not done yet.

600
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,980
I'm not done yet.

601
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,980
I'm not done yet.

602
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,980
I'm not done yet.

603
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,980
I'm not done yet.

604
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,980
I'm not done yet.

605
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,980
I'm not done yet.

606
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,980
I'm not done yet.

607
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,980
I'm not done yet.

608
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,980
I'm not done yet.

609
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,980
I'm not done yet.

610
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,980
I'm not done yet.

611
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,980
I'm not done yet.

612
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,980
I'm not done yet.

613
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,980
I'm not done yet.

614
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,980
I'm not done yet.

615
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,980
I'm not done yet.

616
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,980
I'm not done yet.

617
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,980
I'm not done yet.

618
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,980
I'm not done yet.

619
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,980
I'm not done yet.

620
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,980
I'm not done yet.

621
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,980
I'm not done yet.

622
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,980
I'm not done yet.

623
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,980
I'm not done yet.

624
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,980
I'm not done yet.

625
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,980
I'm not done yet.

626
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,980
I'm not done yet.

627
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,980
I'm not done yet.

628
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,980
Open up!

629
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,980
Fatty,

630
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,980
You're a scythe.

631
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,980
Can't you just study the explosion?

632
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,980
This is the ash

633
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,980
This hardness and material

634
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,980
to carve out such a beautiful pattern

635
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,980
is really not easy.

636
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,980
And I've seen all those pillars.

637
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,980
Each pillar's pattern is different.

638
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,980
How many

639
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,980
10 pieces of that

640
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,980
to be used?

641
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,980
This is all art.

642
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,980
It's a mess.

643
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,980
We can't take it out.

644
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,980
Let the people watch it.

645
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,980
This is easy.

646
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,980
Can you do this?

647
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,980
First, we blow up the mountain.

648
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,980
Then we show the whole underground palace.

649
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,980
Then we find a machine to move it up.

650
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,980
You're really thinking about the bomb.

651
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,980
For these pillars,

652
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,980
you destroyed the sky.

653
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,980
It's not worth it.

654
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,980
My style is simple.

655
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,980
This looks like a legend.

656
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,980
I have a feeling.

657
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,980
Goddess of Snow Mountain

658
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,980
used to have a husband who was always at war.

659
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,980
He waited for his husband for many years.

660
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,980
But he never came back.

661
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,980
He was so sad that he stayed in Changbai Mountain.

662
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,980
In order to let his husband find himself,

663
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,980
he became the Goddess of Snow Mountain

664
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,980
to protect this snow mountain.

665
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,980
Your legend

666
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,980
is just a story about the King of Dwarfs.

667
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,980
Get out.

668
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,980
Tianzhen.

669
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,980
Tianzhen.

670
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,980
I've taken a picture for you.

671
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,980
The painting on the pillar

672
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,980
is the wife of King of Dwarfs.

673
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,980
She used to be the Goddess of Snow Mountain.

674
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,980
Take a look.

675
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,980
It's too cold. I'll go and paint.

676
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,980
You guys eat something.

677
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,980
Goddess of Snow Mountain.

678
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,980
I'm not going to eat.

679
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,980
I'm going to eat.

680
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,980
Goddess of Snow Mountain.

681
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,980
Then is this

682
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:34,000
the

683
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,980
Goddess of Snow Mountain?

684
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,980
Uncle San.

685
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,980
Uncle San.

686
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,980
Think about it.

687
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,980
I'm old.

688
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,980
I'm not smart.

689
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,980
What's this?

690
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,980
It's all written in Chinese.

691
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,980
So,

692
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,980
according to the order of the painting,

693
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,980
we can refer to the content of this book.

694
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,980
Clouds, ice, and heaven.

695
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,980
The wind and the river.

696
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,980
The secret is in the air.

697
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,980
The dark and the bright.

698
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,980
The wind and the snow are all in one.

699
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,980
Where to go?

700
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,980
The mark of the past.

701
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,980
The head is in the hole.

702
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,980
The lonely wind.

703
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,980
The wind is blowing.

704
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,980
How can I resist?

705
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,980
The night is passing.

706
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,980
I can't get back in the dark.

707
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,980
The time is passing.

708
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,980
The bright flowers are hiding.

709
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,980
The paper is falling.

710
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,980
The wind is blowing.

711
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,980
The paper is falling.

712
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,980
The wind is blowing.

713
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,980
How can I resist?

714
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,980
The night is passing.

715
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,980
I can't get back in the dark.

716
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,980
The time is passing.

717
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,980
The bright flowers are hiding.

718
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,980
The paper is falling.

719
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,980
The wind is blowing.

720
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,980
The paper is falling.

721
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,980
The wind is blowing.

722
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,980
The paper is falling.

723
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,980
The paper is falling.

724
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,980
The wind is blowing.

725
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,980
The paper is falling.

726
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,980
The paper is falling.

727
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,980
The paper is falling.

728
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,980
The paper is falling.
