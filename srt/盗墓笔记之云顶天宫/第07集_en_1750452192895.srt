1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Wait a minute.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Wait a minute.

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Wait for a minute.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Wait a minute.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,520
Wait

21
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,000
Wait.

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,800
I was just kidding.

23
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,800
No, we should off.

24
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,300
This is a deliberately ends up hurting with a mencion.

25
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,760
Wait.

26
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,760
Wait,

27
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,560
wait.

28
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,560
Wait, wait!

29
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,560
Wait.

30
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,760
Ah, An Ning.

31
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,960
Why are you here?

32
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,160
Are you okay?

33
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,560
I'm fine.

34
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,560
It's not safe here. Let's go.

35
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,560
Ah.

36
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,560
This window is still a room.

37
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,560
I don't know how long it will last.

38
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,560
There's no signal here.

39
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
Ah.

40
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,560
Master Si, why don't we go to bed?

41
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,560
No hurry.

42
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,560
Okay.

43
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,560
Who would have thought that

44
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,560
this time, this work

45
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,560
would be so difficult.

46
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,560
If it had been so,

47
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,560
I wouldn't have come

48
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,560
to give me any benefits.

49
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,560
You don't need to comfort me.

50
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,560
I don't know

51
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,560
when I can go out.

52
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,560
Please don't be here.

53
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,560
Master Si, are you waiting here?

54
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,560
You don't need to comfort me.

55
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,560
There's a weird thing in the woods.

56
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,560
There's something that's confusing.

57
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,560
Many people are missing.

58
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
They're missing.

59
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,560
They're missing.

60
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
Where?

61
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,560
Didn't Miss An Ning go out to see you?

62
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,560
Didn't she come back with you?

63
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,560
No.

64
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,560
I don't know.

65
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,560
The doctor told me to go.

66
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,560
You didn't go to see them either?

67
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,560
We still have to do something more important.

68
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,560
My people can't be lost anymore.

69
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,560
Hey,

70
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,560
they went to see you, okay?

71
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,560
It's not me who asked them to go see them.

72
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,560
Tell them outside.

73
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,560
We're not going anywhere.

74
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,560
Take a break.

75
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,560
Go to bed immediately.

76
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,560
Tian Liang will leave again.

77
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
Jinsan,

78
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,560
we can't go back anymore.

79
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,560
You bastard.

80
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,560
What?

81
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,560
What happened?

82
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,560
I'm getting old.

83
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,560
I'm not going to use it.

84
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
What?

85
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,560
I still know how to play the sword.

86
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,560
I'll play it with my seven strings.

87
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,560
He doesn't seem to like that kind of thing.

88
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,560
If my people come to me,

89
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,560
they can find out in time.

90
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,560
You shouldn't have come.

91
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,560
I didn't come to save you.

92
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,560
I said you shouldn't have come to save me.

93
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,560
I'm not going to hide in the mountain.

94
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,560
What do you mean?

95
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,560
This trip just started.

96
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,560
It happened.

97
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,560
Can you imagine what happened behind you?

98
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,560
Yunding Palace is not a normal place.

99
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,560
If he's not dangerous,

100
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,560
I'm not quite excited.

101
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,560
Besides,

102
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,560
you're also here.

103
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,560
Here.

104
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,560
Do you have some sugar?

105
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,560
Have some chocolate.

106
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,560
I'll go get some sugar.

107
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,560
We might have to stay here for a while.

108
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
You should get some rest.

109
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,560
I'll be here today.

110
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,560
I don't understand.

111
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,560
Wu San Xing wanted to kill you.

112
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,560
Why did you risk it?

113
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,560
It's not your business.

114
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,560
You have your trust.

115
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,560
I have mine.

116
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,560
My uncle is not like this

117
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,560
before we work together.

118
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,560
I just want to see

119
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,560
what's the real reason

120
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,560
for my uncle to become like this now.

121
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,560
To answer that,

122
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,560
I'm not very good at winning.

123
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,560
Someone told me

124
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,560
that it's not good to be too careful.

125
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,560
Wu Xin, it's me.

126
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,560
Xiao Ge.

127
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,560
Xiao Ge.

128
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,560
Xiao Ge, are you okay?

129
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,560
How did you find us?

130
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,560
What happened outside?

131
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,560
There was a storm outside.

132
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,560
I didn't see anything in the storm.

133
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,560
But I think I hurt her.

134
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,560
You hurt her?

135
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,560
How are you? Are you okay?

136
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,560
I was about to go in.

137
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,560
Didn't I tell you

138
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,560
not to go out?

139
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,560
Oh, yes.

140
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,560
Did you save her?

141
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,560
Are you okay?

142
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
I'm asking you.

143
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,560
Are you okay?

144
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,560
I'm fine.

145
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,560
Everyone has worked hard for a day.

146
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,560
Go back and rest.

147
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,560
I'm fine.

148
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,560
It's good that you're fine.

149
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,560
Mr. Sa, slow down.

150
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,560
You're so careless.

151
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,560
I'm fine.

152
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,560
Shun Zi.

153
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,560
Let's go.

154
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,560
Get up.

155
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,560
Go back and rest.

156
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,560
I'm in Mount Snow Mountain.

157
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,560
Everyone has changed their rules today.

158
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,560
I don't know how hard it will be to go in the future.

159
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,560
I'm so worried about you.

160
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,560
I'm worried about you.

161
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,560
I'm worried about you.

162
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,560
I'm worried about you.

163
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,560
I'm worried about you.

164
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,560
It's been a long day.

165
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,560
Go back and rest.

166
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,560
Okay.

167
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,560
Sir, Jason's company insisted to enter the mountain.

168
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,560
Now they're trapped.

169
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,560
Both our teams have casualties.

170
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,560
We don't know what kind of magnesium our monster is present.

171
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,560
No phone signal either.

172
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,560
And everybody is panicked.

173
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,560
But Wuxi is unharmed.

174
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,560
He's fine.

175
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,560
You talk priority.

176
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,560
It's to protect the people.

177
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,560
But Wuxi is unharmed.

178
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,560
He's fine.

179
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,560
You talk priority.

180
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,560
It's to protect Wuxi.

181
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,560
Don't worry about other people.

182
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,560
I've got enough on my plate.

183
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,560
Sir, how could this be fake?

184
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,560
This is real.

185
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,560
You have to be careful.

186
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,560
Uncle San,

187
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,560
it's fake.

188
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,560
It's not real.

189
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,560
You have to be careful.

190
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,560
Be careful.

191
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,560
Chou Xiaozi, it's me.

192
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,560
It's you, Uncle San.

193
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,560
Come here.

194
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
Come down.

195
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,560
I'm here.

196
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,560
Come here.

197
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,560
Lin Zhen.

198
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,560
Lin Zhen.

199
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,560
What's wrong?

200
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,560
Uncle San is dead.

201
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,560
It's terrible.

202
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,560
Don't talk about it.

203
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,560
You go out and see for yourself.

204
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,560
Jason's subordinate is dead.

205
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,560
And he's suspicious.

206
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,560
Why don't you go out and see for yourself?

207
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,560
What are you kidding?

208
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,560
They're all crazy.

209
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,560
They don't want to die.

210
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,560
Now, there are so many people who are crazy.

211
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,560
They all came from the camp.

212
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,560
Who dares to go out?

213
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,560
Fine.

214
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,560
We have to go out and see.

215
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,560
At least we know what happened.

216
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,560
You two stay here.

217
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,560
I'll go.

218
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,560
Xiaoge.

219
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,560
Go.

220
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,560
Xiaoge has been gone for so long.

221
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,560
Why hasn't he come back?

222
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,560
What should we do?

223
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,560
We can't see anything.

224
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,560
We can only find them today.

225
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,560
Uncle San.

226
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,560
I'm thinking of preparing more.

227
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,560
If we fall down one by one,

228
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,560
we won't be able to get out of here.

229
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,560
Fine.

230
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,560
You go first.

231
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,560
And check the way.

232
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,560
Fine.

233
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,560
You go in.

234
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,560
I'll use my rope to fall down.

235
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,560
Do you want me to do it?

236
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,560
No.

237
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,560
The rope is tied.

238
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,560
Did you call me?

239
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,560
No.

240
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,560
Go.

241
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,560
No.

242
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,560
No.

243
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,560
Ye Cheng.

244
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,560
Ye Cheng.

245
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,560
Xiaoge.

246
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,560
What's going on?

247
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,560
It's my fault that I attacked her.

248
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,560
I found out that she was already like this.

249
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,560
What's going on?

250
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,560
I don't believe it.

251
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,560
I don't believe it.

252
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,560
Do you think that Xiaoge did something wrong?

253
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,560
And then she gave us a break on the way?

254
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,560
If we don't worry about this,

255
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,560
we should worry about the monster that killed her first.

256
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,560
How many monsters have we encountered?

257
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,560
The scariest thing is the human heart.

258
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,560
The human heart?

259
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,560
It's not me.

260
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,560
It's not me.

261
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,560
It's not me.

262
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,560
It's not me.

263
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,560
It's not me.

264
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,560
No wonder there's a smell of meat.

265
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,560
But these people are dead.

266
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,560
They don't have the energy to eat.

267
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,560
Ye Cheng.

268
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,560
Take a seat.

269
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,560
Jason.

270
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,560
I didn't mean anything else.

271
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,560
I just wanted to remind you.

272
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,560
Do you want to notice more?

273
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,560
Ok.

274
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,560
Ok.

275
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,560
I will come back.

276
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,560
I will see you later.

277
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,560
Bye.

278
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,560
Bye.

279
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,560
Bye.

280
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,560
Bye.

281
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,560
Bye.

282
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,560
Do you want to notice Mark more?

283
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,560
What?

284
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,560
Now you suspect that he's a mental patient?

285
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,560
I didn't mean that.

286
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,560
I just think that

287
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,560
he's avoiding Uncle Dashan's death.

288
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,560
But Uncle Dashan's death isn't his responsibility.

289
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,560
And your previous encounter also stimulated him.

290
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,560
He kept shouting,

291
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,560
it's not me.

292
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,560
It's not me.

293
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,560
Did you hear that?

294
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,560
Mark.

295
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,560
Shibin 1563.

296
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,560
Here.

297
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,560
Shibin 1563 is coming to report.

298
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,560
Please give me an order.

299
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,560
Shibin 1563.

300
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,560
I order you to tell me

301
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,560
whether you have anything to do with Uncle Dashan's death.

302
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,560
Report.

303
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,560
The last time I saw Uncle Dashan

304
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,560
was when I went to the kitchen to find the food.

305
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,560
Uncle Dashan drove me out.

306
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,560
Then I heard that there was a scene in the kitchen.

307
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,560
I thought that Uncle Dashan didn't allow me to enter the kitchen.

308
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,560
So I went back to the kitchen.

309
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,560
You don't know who the murderer is.

310
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,560
I don't know.

311
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,560
But when I saw the food in the kitchen last night,

312
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,560
I knew that I killed him.

313
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,560
I didn't save him.

314
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,560
I didn't save him.

315
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,560
You saw it?

316
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,560
Let's go.

317
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,560
Shibin 1563.

318
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,560
Shibin 1563.

319
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,560
Shibin 1563.

320
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,560
What are you doing here?

321
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,560
I buried Uncle Dashan in this small tree.

322
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,560
Let him stay with his little mother.

323
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,560
Why don't you go and see him?

324
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,560
My disciples are all buried with you.

325
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,560
What do you think?

326
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,560
When you are old enough to live like me,

327
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,560
you will understand.

328
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,560
But

329
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,560
I think you can't live.

330
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,560
If you are not hungry,

331
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,560
you will be full.

332
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,560
Eat some.

333
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,560
Who saw Uncle Hai?

334
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,560
When I was buying Uncle Dashan,

335
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,560
Uncle Hai said he was tired.

336
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,560
He went upstairs to rest.

337
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,560
He is not here.

338
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,560
I have looked for him.

339
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,560
He is not here.

340
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,560
Maybe he is a murderer.

341
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,560
That's impossible.

342
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,560
He is an old man.

343
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,560
He is not as good as you.

344
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,560
You are talking nonsense.

345
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,560
We have been together for a while.

346
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,560
You know that, right?

347
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,560
That's a good thing.

348
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,560
Stop arguing.

349
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,560
This is the punishment of the Snow Mountain Goddess.

350
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,560
We have to take it easy.

351
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,560
I will go and see Uncle.

352
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,560
I will go and see Uncle.

353
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,560
I will go and see Uncle.

354
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,560
I will go and see Uncle.

355
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,560
I will go and see Uncle.

356
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,560
We have to take it easy.

357
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,560
What are you thinking about?

358
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,560
Grandma,

359
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,560
is that photo real?

360
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,560
Is that true?

361
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,560
That's not important.

362
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,560
What's important is that

363
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,560
the person who saw the photo

364
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,560
is willing to take it as real.

365
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,560
I heard from Brother Wu Xie

366
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,560
that the thing at the bottom of the sea

367
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,560
also has a picture of Qiu Dekou.

368
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,560
If Qiu Dekou had already

369
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,560
got that photo,

370
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,560
so many years,

371
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,560
why didn't he reveal it?

372
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,560
Could it be that

373
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,560
he has always taken that photo

374
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,560
and threatened Wu San Yi to do something for him?

375
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,560
That's possible.

376
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,560
Grandma,

377
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,560
I want to go to Qiu Dekou.

378
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,560
What are you doing?

379
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,560
He knows so many secrets.

380
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,560
Does he know where Aunt is?

381
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,560
This matter has been hidden for so many years.

382
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,560
He won't easily reveal

383
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,560
your aunt's secret.

384
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,560
Unless he still wants to cooperate with us,

385
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,560
then there is still a chance.

386
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,560
Then,

387
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,560
I want to go to Changsha.

388
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,560
Are you doing this because of the photo?

389
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,560
No need.

390
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,560
I have already asked someone to send it to Xie.

391
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,560
What?

392
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,560
I didn't do it clearly.

393
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,560
Why did you give the photo to Xiao Hua?

394
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,560
What if he and Wu San Yi...

395
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,560
So what?

396
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,560
Madam,

397
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,560
thank you for your help.

398
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,560
Okay.

399
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,560
About the information,

400
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,560
that's fine.

401
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,560
That's fine.

402
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,560
There is one thing.

403
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,560
You can't let Xiu Xiu go to Changbai Mountain.

404
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,560
Okay, that's it.

405
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,560
The location has been sent to you.

406
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,560
You know my condition.

407
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,560
But I still have to remind you.

408
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,560
Go now.

409
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,560
Wu San Xing has been out for a few days.

410
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,560
If you don't go out,

411
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,560
then you will have nothing.

412
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,560
Can you take it from him?

413
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,560
You still have two words.

414
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,560
Jia Sha.

415
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,560
Master Hua.

416
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,560
Help me get the equipment.

417
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,560
We have to go to Changbai Mountain at any time.

418
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,560
Fatty,

419
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,560
how can we keep it locked?

420
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,560
Someone will never stop the wind.

421
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,560
How do you know they are not pretending?

422
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,560
Only if they pretend to be like others,

423
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,560
they won't be suspected.

424
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,560
Don't think so.

425
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,560
It's not like they are bad people.

426
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,560
Then how did Uncle Dashan die?

427
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,560
He is in the heaven.

428
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,560
What?

429
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,560
But this is not the place

430
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,560
where the kid can go.

431
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,560
I can't go far with him.

432
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,560
What?

433
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,560
I still have to help you pack up.

434
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,560
Here comes the sa-gong.

435
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,560
Wu Xie,

436
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,560
what do you mean by sa-gong?

437
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,560
I just want to help you pack up.

438
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,560
Wu Xie,

439
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,560
we are going to start the sa-gong.

440
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,560
Pack up and pack up.

441
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,560
Let's gather at the gate.

442
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,560
Sister,

443
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,560
the soul of Ning is gone.

444
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,560
She looks up to you today.

445
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,560
If you are idle,

446
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,560
just look at the route.

447
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,560
Don't follow the sa-gong all the time.

448
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,560
This is the way.

449
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,560
It's not the way.

450
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,560
We are going to get there.

451
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,560
We are going to go to Changbai Mountain.

452
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,560
We have to go there.

453
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,560
But we can't,

454
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,560
we have to go to Changbai Mountain.

455
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,560
We can't go there.

456
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,560
We can't.

457
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,560
You don't have to go there.

458
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,560
We can go to Changbai Mountain.

459
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,560
I will take care of them.

460
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,560
We can't go there.

461
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,560
We can't go there.

462
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,560
I want to help you pack up.

463
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,560
We can't go there.

464
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,560
We are going to Changbai Mountain.

465
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,560
We will finish them all.

466
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,560
Am I going to the main road?

467
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,560
Don't follow the three of us.

468
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,560
He's fine.

469
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,560
You know it, Xiao Gan.

470
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,560
What's that flash over there?

471
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,560
Stop! Stop!

472
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,560
I want to see the light over there.

473
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,560
The light is on.

474
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,560
All of you, get out!

475
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,560
They're all dead.

476
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,560
How is it?

477
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,560
I think it's a lie.

478
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,560
It's been a while since it was stolen.

479
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,560
And it seems to have been touched.

480
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,560
Do you think they're from our area?

481
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,560
I'll tell you later.

482
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,560
Let's take a look.

483
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,560
Fatty!

484
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,560
Look!

485
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,560
What's wrong?

486
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,560
Over there.

487
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,560
What?

488
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,560
Go over there.

489
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,560
Hey!

490
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,560
Big brother!

491
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,560
Big brother!

492
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,560
Do you know what's the most memorable thing about the waterway?

493
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,560
What's the most memorable thing?

494
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,560
It's the team that doesn't listen to the guide.

495
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,560
No.

496
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,560
Over there.

497
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,560
There's a fox!

498
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,560
Come on.

499
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,560
Come on.

500
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,560
Wu Xin, Chen Pi-A is out.

501
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,560
He's starting to suspect us.

502
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,560
What does he suspect?

503
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,560
I don't know.

504
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,560
But he won't let you out easily.

505
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,560
I can't follow you now.

506
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,560
Be careful.

507
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,560
Let's go.

508
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,560
No.

509
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,560
Ning!

510
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,560
What's wrong?

511
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,560
Let's go.

512
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,560
Let's go.

513
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,560
Hello, Ting Ting.

514
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,560
Ting Ting.

515
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,560
Ning, where did Ning and Celiou go?

516
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,560
Where did they go?

517
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,560
How do I know?

518
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,560
He didn't do anything.

519
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,560
He didn't have to go back to me.

520
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,560
What about Pan Zi?

521
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,560
Pan Zi has been away for days.

522
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,560
Is something wrong?

523
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,560
He's always stable.

524
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,560
Don't worry.

525
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,560
Listen.

526
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,560
Si A-Gong is suspecting everyone.

527
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,560
Don't ever mention it to him.

528
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,560
Don't worry.

529
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,560
But this time is so short.

530
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:58,560
Pan Zi can't take these things.

531
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,560
Pan Zi can't.

532
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,560
He can do so many things alone.

533
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,560
Don't think about it.

534
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,560
Have a good rest.

535
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,560
Shun Zi.

536
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:08,560
Can you let us start a fire here?

537
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,560
I'm so hungry.

538
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,560
Feng, hold on.

539
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,560
We must pass this forest today.

540
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,560
Why?

541
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,560
Because there's a weird forest.

542
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,560
What's wrong?

543
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,560
Yes, Shun Zi.

544
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,560
Tell us what's going on.

545
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,560
This forest is the meaning of the fishing.

546
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,560
I heard dad say that.

547
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,560
I don't know when someone started fishing here.

548
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,560
There's no one here.

549
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,560
There are dozens of people.

550
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,560
Later, on the young back of the mountain,

551
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,560
I saw a pair of dead people fishing in the forest.

552
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,560
Some of them were fighting for their family.

553
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,560
They went up to pick up the dead people.

554
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,560
I didn't expect that the next day,

555
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,560
they found out that they had been caught in the forest.

556
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,560
They all died.

557
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,560
Is that so evil?

558
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,560
I'm sorry.

559
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,560
I'm sorry.

560
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,560
I'm sorry.

561
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,560
I'm sorry.

562
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,560
I'm sorry.

563
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,560
I'm sorry.

564
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,560
I'm sorry.

565
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,560
I'm sorry.

566
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,560
I'm sorry.

567
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,560
I'm sorry.

568
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,560
