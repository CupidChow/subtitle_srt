1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,020
Alles

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Did you find anything missing?

4
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What did you find?

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Food.

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Look.

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
They ate it all.

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
They didn't die by accident.

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
They survived and died of starvation.

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
No.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
They didn't eat or drink anything.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
They stayed for seven days.

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Think about it.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
They ran out for seven days.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
They didn't even die here.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That's weird.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
They must not be hungry.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Unless...

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
They can't get out.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Tianzhen.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This place is not like the underwater tomb.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The tomb is upside down and the elevator is upside down.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
There will be doors and no doors.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We have enough explosives this time.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
If we can't, we'll blow it up.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Okay.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Shun Zi.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Do you remember how many people your father brought into the tomb?

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I remember...

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He left with seven people.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's eight people.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
There are six corpses here.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Two people are missing.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Could it be that they saw Cai Qi and killed them and ran away?

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Impossible.

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
There is no sign of fighting here.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And the movements and expressions of the corpses don't look like they were killed.

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Someone died here.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I always feel weird.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Don't forget our purpose of coming here.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I have a good feeling about this.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The door is blown up.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And there is only a treasure room here.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
No coffin.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The sign that led us here means that there is a famous item here.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It must be marked by An Ning and the others.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
After that, we'll wait for the second team to come and collect the treasure.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Impossible.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The hole on the door is more like the one in the last episode.

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Impossible.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The hole on the door is more like the one in the last episode.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Anyway, the coffin is not here.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We have to go in the opposite direction.

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And third uncle is over there.

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yes.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Let's go find third uncle.

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm going to go to the second uncle.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm going to go to the second uncle.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm going to go to the second uncle.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm going to go to the second uncle.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm going to go to the second uncle.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm going to go to the second uncle.

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm going to go to the second uncle.

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm going to go to the second uncle.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm going to go to the second uncle.

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm going to go to the second uncle.

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm going to go to the second uncle.

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm going to go to the second uncle.

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm going to go to the second uncle.

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm going to go to the second uncle.

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm going to go to the second uncle.

72
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm going to go to the second uncle.

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm going to go to the second uncle.

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm going to go to the second uncle.

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm going to go to the second uncle.

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm going to go to the second uncle.

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm going to go to the second uncle.

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm going to go to the second uncle.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm going to go to the second uncle.

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm going to go to the second uncle.

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm going to go to the second uncle.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm going to go to the second uncle.

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm going to go to the second uncle.

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm going to go to the second uncle.

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What's going on?

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Why are these murals

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
all changed?

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
This one

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I met with Tianzhen

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
in the underwater tomb.

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The principle is like this.

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Grandma Hua.

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Since I sent uncle Xue back last time,

94
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I haven't been able to contact him.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
After I sent uncle Xue back,

96
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I haven't been able to contact him.

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Children are disobedient.

98
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
They have to be taught.

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You locked up Xiu Xiu.

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Xie Zi.

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Actually, you're not bad.

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
since the second uncle

104
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and the ninth uncle left,

105
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
you've been the one who's been taught.

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I've been thinking

107
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
that the person who loves Xiu Xiu the most

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
is you.

109
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
If I don't love her,

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
how can I let her

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
run away with you?

112
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Run away?

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You said such a simple word

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and denied all of Xiu Xiu's efforts.

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You denied all of Xiu Xiu's efforts.

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What are you afraid of?

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Is this the way

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
you talk to an elder?

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Is this the way you talk to an elder?

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's just that what you've been doing

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
has made me doubt it.

122
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
This matter is related to

123
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
the layout of Alpha Company in China

124
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
where Qiu Da Kao and Jason are located.

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
This layout has already begun

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
before liberation.

127
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
These decades,

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I can't imagine how many things they've done.

129
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But I can be sure that

130
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
they have their hands in the bottom of the sea.

131
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And this directly relates to

132
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
my uncle's death and your daughter's disappearance.

133
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I don't believe that

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
you would have no idea about

135
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
such a obvious fact.

136
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Xie Zi,

137
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
a person is very confident.

138
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But you...

139
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
If you're blinded by confidence,

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
it becomes a disadvantage.

141
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Do you understand?

142
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You can't harm yourself

143
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
and you can't get others involved.

144
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Why did you send me that photo?

145
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What do you want to tell me?

146
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm a little tired.

147
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You're old.

148
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Old man,

149
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
you and Chen Pi A Si are the only ones

150
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
who are still alive.

151
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Chen Pi A Si doesn't care about it.

152
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
These years,

153
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
you must be feeling very old

154
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
and tired.

155
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
No one can escape

156
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
from the natural law.

157
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Well said.

158
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's true.

159
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Such a righteous person,

160
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
such a beautiful and handsome person,

161
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
they will all get old.

162
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
They will all die.

163
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
After they die,

164
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
they will turn into firewood and ashes.

165
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
No one can escape from it.

166
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Then why is it different to ask for a test?

167
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Did he use this puzzle

168
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
to seduce you to convince you to help him?

169
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
If that's the case,

170
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
then this underground palace

171
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
is a very complicated structure.

172
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We can't get in and out, can we?

173
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't think so.

174
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Even if we can't get in,

175
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:42,060
we can use the

176
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,060
trick of the twilight sea.

177
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,060
A lot of it is to exert psychological pressure on the explorers.

178
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,060
It's not easy to really trap people to death.

179
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,060
Many people are mentally broken in the end

180
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,060
and will die when they give up.

181
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,060
Correct. No problem. Just rest assured.

182
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,060
I don't know where Master San has gone now.

183
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:01,060
I'm not with him. I don't know how he is now.

184
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,060
I'm worried.

185
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,060
I thought you were his nephew.

186
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,060
You're not my uncle!

187
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,060
You said I'm not your uncle.

188
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,060
Then tell me who I am.

189
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:20,060
You are Xie Lian Huan.

190
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,060
You're not my uncle.

191
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,060
Kid, in this world,

192
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,060
there's only one person who won't hurt you.

193
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,060
That's me, your uncle.

194
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,060
Tianzhen.

195
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,060
Tianzhen.

196
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,060
He's gone.

197
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,060
Tianzhen.

198
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,060
This door.

199
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,060
It's exactly the same.

200
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,060
It's normal for the same workers to be exactly the same.

201
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,060
But, that hole.

202
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,060
It's good that it's blown up.

203
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,060
The machine was scalded by the previous person.

204
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,060
Right?

205
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,060
Let's go.

206
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,060
How rich is this?

207
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,060
Another treasure room.

208
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,060
What did I say?

209
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,060
I didn't lie to you, did I?

210
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,060
It's another broken palace.

211
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,060
A piece of silver.

212
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,060
Tianzhen.

213
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,060
Why are there another pair of retinue and corpses?

214
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,060
We're back again?

215
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,060
The last person who questioned me like this,

216
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:30,060
was already eaten by wolves.

217
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,060
Life is not long.

218
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,060
How many people have beautiful dreams?

219
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,060
I didn't expect there would be more market in the capital.

220
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,060
You don't usually sell three-factor products, do you?

221
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,060
I met a master of nail art some time ago.

222
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,060
He told me something very interesting.

223
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,060
In his life,

224
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:15,600
the most perfect

225
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,060
master of nail art.

226
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,060
This is the Ghost Bridge.

227
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,060
This is the Ghost Bridge.

228
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,060
We walked a whole cycle.

229
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,060
We passed through two heads.

230
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,060
It's all covered in dead bodies.

231
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,060
What's going on?

232
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,060
What's going on?

233
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,060
Shunzi.

234
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,060
I know the dead are great.

235
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,060
But it's very likely that it's your father's problem.

236
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,060
These corpses have been here for so many years.

237
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,060
It's easy to catch them.

238
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,060
So, you can put your father down first.

239
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,060
Let's walk again.

240
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,060
I won't let go.

241
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,060
Put it down.

242
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,060
Put it down.

243
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,060
Fatty, calm down.

244
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,060
Fatty.

245
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,060
You can't mess around at this time.

246
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,060
Little Third Master.

247
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,060
You don't often say things about the sea of dead.

248
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,060
The amount of blood is just a small amount of psychological pressure.

249
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:20,060
We can't know that this is still a big deal.

250
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,060
There must be something wrong.

251
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,060
Yes.

252
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,060
Pan Zi is right.

253
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,060
This must be a machine.

254
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,060
This has nothing to do with Shunzi's father's body.

255
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,060
When we were at the bottom of the sea,

256
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,060
we already confirmed that

257
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,060
there is no Ghost Bridge in this world.

258
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,060
Wang Zang Hai is just like that.

259
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,060
He is good at using these clever machines

260
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,060
to create this strange atmosphere.

261
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,060
When we don't know the bottom,

262
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,060
we are very easy to be led by him.

263
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,060
Let's walk again.

264
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,060
Pan Zi.

265
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,060
Let's walk slowly this time.

266
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,060
Let's walk slowly this time.

267
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,060
Let's feel if there is a machine at the bottom.

268
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,060
I don't believe that he has no flaws.

269
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,060
Let's go.

270
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,060
Let's go.

271
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,060
Let's go.

272
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,060
Let's go.

273
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,060
Let's go.

274
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,060
It turns out that this is Aunt Huo Lin.

275
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,060
Even if we can copy her appearance,

276
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,060
we still can't copy her temperament.

277
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,060
Yes.

278
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,060
Her father and I have never found out.

279
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,060
When we find out,

280
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,060
it's too late.

281
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,060
It's completely lost.

282
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,060
The whole team is missing.

283
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,060
Yes.

284
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,060
I heard that only the third person of the Wu family came back.

285
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:13,060
He said that something happened to the Xie family's Xielian Ring.

286
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,060
They asked people to open an investigation ship

287
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,060
and bring the body back.

288
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,060
After that, he was in the seabed and passed out.

289
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,060
When he woke up, he was already on the shore.

290
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,060
He didn't know what happened to the others.

291
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,060
The Xielian Ring is dead.

292
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,060
Where is the body?

293
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,060
The investigation ship was not on the shore.

294
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,060
He is also missing.

295
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,060
Missing too?

296
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,060
Yes.

297
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,060
The whole archaeological team.

298
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,060
The whole archaeological team.

299
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,060
Yes.

300
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,060
More than ten or twenty people.

301
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,060
Only Wu San Xing is left.

302
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,060
Yes.

303
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,060
What do you mean?

304
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,060
The Huoling who went out with me

305
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,060
is no longer that Huoling.

306
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,060
Who else could it be if it wasn't him?

307
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:16,060
I don't believe that you didn't notice anything.

308
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,060
With your one-sided words,

309
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:22,060
I should believe you, right?

310
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:26,060
You know him or do I know him as a mother?

311
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,060
Maybe there is something in the middle that I don't know.

312
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:33,060
But according to my observation and speculation,

313
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,060
the truth is like this.

314
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:37,060
If you don't believe me, I can't help it.

315
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,060
No matter what,

316
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:46,060
we have to find someone to judge.

317
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,060
I want to find them immediately.

318
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:53,060
Even if it's not for others, for myself,

319
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,060
and for Wen Jing,

320
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,060
I have to find them.

321
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,060
But have you ever thought about it?

322
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,060
You are the only one who came back.

323
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,060
This is a big problem.

324
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,060
This is a big problem.

325
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,060
Do you understand?

326
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,060
Yes, this is a problem.

327
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,060
Luckily, I'm still alive.

328
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,060
At that time,

329
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:30,060
I didn't believe Wu Sanxing's words.

330
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,060
On the contrary,

331
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:36,060
it was all his doing.

332
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:42,060
He wanted to destroy the Huo family and the Xie family.

333
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,060
The children of the Chuxi family.

334
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,060
After that,

335
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:52,060
I received a plate of Luxiang Dai.

336
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,060
He wore this dress.

337
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,060
It was the last time

338
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,060
for us to see each other.

339
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,060
It was the last time

340
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:18,060
before the archaeological team set off.

341
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:21,060
He changed into this dress and came back.

342
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,060
He told me that

343
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:26,060
he had put oil on the engine in the unit.

344
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,060
He put oil on the engine

345
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,060
and changed into this dress.

346
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,060
Let me out.

347
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,060
Let me out.

348
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,060
Who are you?

349
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,060
Let me out.

350
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,060
Let me out.

351
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,060
Let me out.

352
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,060
Mom.

353
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,060
Mom.

354
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,060
I'm Lin Ling.

355
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,060
Mom.

356
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,060
Mom.

357
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,060
Help me.

358
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,060
Mom.

359
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,060
I understand.

360
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,060
No wonder you didn't suspect it.

361
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,060
I really don't dare to act rashly

362
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,060
with this Luxiang Dai.

363
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,060
I don't want the outsiders to know

364
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,060
that especially the Ninth Lord,

365
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:57,060
he will judge the conspiracy.

366
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,060
And he will follow the clues

367
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,060
of this Luxiang Dai

368
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,060
to find the person behind it.

369
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,060
It's hard to predict

370
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,060
what he will do

371
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:14,060
with his strange and cunning mind.

372
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,060
Maybe my Lingling

373
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,060
will be harmed.

374
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,060
So my grandpa thought

375
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,060
it was an accident

376
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,060
until he died.

377
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:36,060
With the wisdom of the Ninth Lord,

378
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,060
he must have seen through

379
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,060
the secrets in it.

380
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,060
But with his personality,

381
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,060
I really don't know

382
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,060
what else he can do.

383
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,060
Not to mention that

384
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,060
Xie Lian Huan's body

385
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,060
hasn't been found yet.

386
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,060
Then what did the Ninth Lord

387
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,060
tell him?

388
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,060
Uncle, you're back.

389
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,060
What did you do this time?

390
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,060
He is your uncle from the Wu family.

391
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,060
He is my uncle.

392
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,060
Your uncle's cousin.

393
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:21,060
They look very alike.

394
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,060
Hello, uncle.

395
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,060
This is what Lian Huan

396
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,060
brought out.

397
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,060
Song Ke!

398
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,060
So many years,

399
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,060
is this all you have?

400
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:22,060
Then I received another one.

401
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,060
Let me out!

402
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,060
Let me out!

403
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,060
Let me out!

404
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,060
Let me out!

405
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,060
Let me out!

406
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,060
Let me out!

407
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,060
Let me out!

408
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,060
They installed

409
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,060
a small device that was destroyed.

410
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:53,060
It was destroyed after it was seen.

411
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,060
It almost caused a fire.

412
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,060
That was the third year

413
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,060
after Ling Ling's disappearance.

414
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,060
She didn't change her clothes.

415
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,060
She was very haggard.

416
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,060
She didn't say a word.

417
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,060
She just stood by the bed

418
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,060
and didn't move.

419
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,060
The height of the camera

420
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,060
is almost the same as Ling Ling's.

421
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,060
It's horizontal.

422
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,060
But there is no way to prove

423
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,060
that it was taken back then.

424
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,060
Yes.

425
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,060
And this self-destructing device

426
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,060
also makes me very confused.

427
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,060
There must be some small details in it.

428
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:43,060
I can see it several times.

429
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,060
They just want to prevent accidents

430
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,060
and destroy it after they see it.

431
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:55,060
Since the fire,

432
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:58,060
there has been no news of Ling Ling.

433
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,060
I really don't dare to hide

434
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:07,060
because there is the life of Ling Ling.

435
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,060
So for so many years,

436
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,060
at least in the face of the situation,

437
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,060
you didn't do too much for

438
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,060
Aunt Huilin's disappearance.

439
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,060
You just kept the Wu family away.

440
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:24,060
Especially when Xiu Xiu was investigating this matter,

441
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,060
you deliberately stopped her.

442
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,060
I can understand that.

443
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,060
But please don't do this.

444
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,060
I can't see clearly what you did.

445
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:46,060
Why do you send me that photo?

446
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,060
I want you to see clearly

447
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:56,060
the true face of Wu Sanxing and Wu Xie.

448
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,060
At this time, you still lie.

449
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:03,060
I'm telling you the truth, Xie Zi.

450
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,060
A woman in the old wine house

451
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,060
has to know how to live

452
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:12,060
without throwing up bones.

453
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,060
Look at me.

454
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,060
In the past few decades,

455
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,060
I have thought that

456
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:21,060
whoever looks at it,

457
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,060
he can see it clearly.

458
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:27,060
But I can't see it clearly

459
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,060
to Wu Sanxing.

460
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:32,060
And no matter what the relationship between

461
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,060
Lingling and Wu Sanxing is,

462
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:39,060
what is the purpose behind it,

463
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,060
the whole team will come back alone.

464
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:47,060
Isn't this a big problem?

465
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:53,060
You just don't want to make Wu Sanxing feel better.

466
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:56,060
You don't want to make Wu Sanxing feel better.

467
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:59,060
I just don't want to make Wu Sanxing feel better.

468
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,060
Isn't it written very clearly

469
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,060
in your little book's last words?

470
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:08,060
Do you still think Wu Sanxing is innocent?

471
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,060
What I know now is that

472
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,060
Qiu Dakao did participate in the underwater tomb incident.

473
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:17,060
And it has a direct relationship with the missing team.

474
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,060
You are obviously cooperating with him at this time.

475
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:22,060
Is it for your daughter's whereabouts

476
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,060
or for her secret?

477
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,060
Qiu Dakao said that you helped him.

478
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:29,060
He shouldn't have used your daughter's whereabouts to threaten him.

479
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:34,060
Then his secret is the only clue.

480
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:37,060
Is this secret about the immortality?

481
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:41,060
There is no such thing as immortality in this world.

482
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,060
It is absurd.

483
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,060
But with Qiu Dakao's statement,

484
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,060
his physical condition is a special power.

485
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:53,060
A special power that cannot even be explained in medicine.

486
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,060
Whether you believe it or not,

487
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,060
I have already half believed it and half doubted it.

488
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,060
No.

489
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,060
To be precise,

490
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,060
it is 7% trust and 3% suspicion.

491
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,060
If he gives evidence,

492
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:09,060
I am afraid that 3% suspicion will also become trust.

493
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:14,060
What evidence does he have?

494
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,060
The Cloud Sky Palace.

495
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,060
The Cloud Sky Palace.

496
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,060
The Cloud Sky Palace.

497
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,060
Jia Sha, are you ready to go to the east?

498
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,060
I am ready.

499
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,060
Tonight we will go to the northeast.

500
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,060
We can go hiking in the morning.

501
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,060
The weather is good these days.

502
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,060
The hiking route will not be too difficult.

503
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:28,060
And the route to the Cloud Sky Palace, we have already planned.

504
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,060
Okay.

505
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:33,060
Master Hua, do you think we must go to the Cloud Sky Palace?

506
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,060
I always feel that...

507
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,060
There are some things

508
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:43,060
I have to ask in person to be able to ask clearly.

509
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,060
I will go.

510
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,060
Let's do it again.

511
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,060
This time we can catch up.

512
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,060
The road is back.

513
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,060
You...

514
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,060
Just give up on this.

515
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,060
There is still time for the third master.

516
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,060
Do you know how long we have been walking?

517
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,060
Do you know how long we have been walking?

518
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,060
It's all ghost fights.

519
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,060
That road...

520
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,060
We can't go back anymore.

521
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,060
How do you know?

522
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,060
Look at it yourself.

523
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,060
Those people

524
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,060
are definitely more than the number of times we have walked.

525
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,060
Let's limit the food.

526
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,060
We have to plan for a long-term battle.

527
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,060
The longer we live,

528
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,060
the more chances we have to go out.

529
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,060
This third master,

530
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,060
I think

531
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,060
the food we have left

532
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,060
is enough to eat two meals.

533
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,060
I don't think we need to limit it.

534
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,060
Let's just work hard.

535
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,060
If you don't have any medicine,

536
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,060
just wait for the person to collect the food.

537
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,060
Okay.

538
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,060
Okay.

539
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,060
Then comrade Chen Yiruan,

540
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,060
hurry up and prepare the food.

541
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,060
So that Fatty can distract the attention.

542
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,060
This way I can think of how to get out.

543
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,060
Right?

544
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,060
I will go.

545
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,060
Right?

546
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,060
Shunzi.

547
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,060
Shunzi.

548
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,060
Shunzi.

549
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,060
Hurry up, I can't hold you.

550
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,060
You...

551
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,060
If only Brother was here.

552
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,060
You...

553
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,060
How is it?

554
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,060
Shunzi.

555
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,060
Take a break.

556
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,060
Take a break.

557
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,060
He is currently in a state of depression.

558
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,060
I don't know when he will recover.

559
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,060
We need to hurry up and meet with Brother.

560
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,060
Tie him up with rope.

561
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,060
Calm down.

562
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:25,200
The entire underground palace is in the shape of a

563
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,060
The entire underground palace is in the shape of a

564
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,060
Huizi. The center is the spiritual hall.

565
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,060
This is the most strict place.

566
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,060
Wang Zang Hai will not be able to move around in this part of the structure.

567
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,060
There are also the burial pit, burial pit,

568
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,060
drainage system,

569
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,060
and complicated swimming and wooden path.

570
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,060
We are currently very likely to be talking about the outside world of the underground palace.

571
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,060
So...

572
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,060
So what?

573
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,060
So...

574
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,060
So...

575
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,060
So...

576
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,060
I have thought it through.

577
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,060
The way we think now

578
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,060
is completely wrong.

579
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,060
It's wrong.

580
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,060
Can you say something more serious and useful?

581
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,060
I am not not serious.

582
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,060
We are thinking about it so much, you are wasting time and energy, right?

583
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,060
We might as well write down all the possibilities.

584
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,060
After we have written down a few of them,

585
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,060
we can just verify them.

586
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,060
What do you mean by that?

587
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,060
Say it clearly.

588
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,060
Come, bring the book here.

589
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,060
Don't write nonsense here. Hurry.

590
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,060
Everyone, tell us what is going on.

591
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,060
What possibilities do you have?

592
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:27,060
No need to say the details. Just say the big picture.

593
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,060
Okay? Come.

594
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,060
There are mechanisms?

595
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,060
Yes, there are mechanisms. What else?

596
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,060
I feel that something is affecting our feelings.

597
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,060
It's like a psychological hint or hypnosis.

598
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,060
It makes us come back unconsciously.

599
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,060
I felt like I was being hinted at.

600
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,060
I personally experienced it.

601
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,060
What else is there?

602
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,060
In theory,

603
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,060
it might be a space fold.

604
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,060
Don't be so mysterious.

605
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,060
Say it clearly.

606
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,060
Young Master San is the most cultured.

607
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,060
Maybe he is right. Write it down.

608
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,060
Okay, space fold.

609
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,060
Then,

610
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,060
I think there is something wrong with you.

611
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,060
Is there a fifth one?

612
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,060
Is there? Who else has a fifth?

613
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,060
Is there a fifth?

614
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,060
Okay, we'll think about it later.

615
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,060
First, verify the first one.

616
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,060
The second one can also be proved together.

617
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,060
Take it.

618
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,060
Give me the gun.

619
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,060
Okay.

620
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,060
I'll go to the entrance of the tomb

621
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,060
and shoot there.

622
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,060
See what the result will be.

623
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,060
No, you say it clearly before you go.

624
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,060
Say it clearly before you go.

625
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,060
Shoot?

626
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,060
Yes.

627
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,060
Pan Zi, let's talk about the second one first.

628
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,060
If it's a hallucination, the bullet won't feel it.

629
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,060
The tomb can affect our feelings, but it can't affect the bullet.

630
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,060
So, if the situation here can be explained in common sense,

631
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,060
then the bullet can't be used.

632
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,060
The bullet can't be used.

633
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,060
If the situation here can be explained in common sense,

634
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,060
then the bullet will hit the end of the tomb.

635
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,060
And the first point, if it's a trap,

636
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,060
then the bullet can hit the end of the tomb

637
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,060
in two seconds.

638
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,060
Without a trap, it can't work in such a short time.

639
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,060
Pan Zi's method is simple and beautiful.

640
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,060
It's very scientific.

641
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,060
Let's go.

642
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,060
Pan Zi!

643
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,060
Are you okay?

644
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,060
Are you okay?

645
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,060
I'm going.

646
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,060
Pan Zi, swear to the Demon King Xiao Bai,

647
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,060
I'll take the bullet out

648
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,060
and come back

649
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,060
after I search the bullet.

650
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,060
You almost got yourself killed.

651
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,060
Stop shooting. Hurry up and find the bullet hole.

652
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,060
Hurry up.

653
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,060
The bullet hit the end of the tomb.

654
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,060
It's back.

655
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,060
Isn't it here?

656
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,060
It's here.

657
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,060
Here, here, here.

658
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,060
The Ghost Bridge.

659
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,060
Take it.

660
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,060
Boss,

661
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,060
we're back.

662
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,060
There's a signal.

663
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,060
Sir.

664
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,060
Where are you? What's the status?

665
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,060
Sir, we are at the painted corridors

666
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,060
in the Sky Palace.

667
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,060
Some hallucination occurred.

668
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,060
They've been walking in circles

669
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,060
for over seven hours,

670
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,060
but still lost.

671
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,060
How is that possible?

672
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,060
We've been here for several hours.

673
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,060
There's no way to go.

674
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,060
There's no way to go.

675
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,060
I remember, I remember,

676
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,060
I remember, we didn't even walk this way.

677
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,060
Believe it or not.

678
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,060
I'm not playing anymore.

679
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,060
I want to go back. What the hell is this place?

680
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,060
I want to go out. I want to go out.

681
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,060
Please, you're not going to shut up.

682
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,060
I want to go out. I don't want to...

683
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,060
Are we really not going out?

684
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,060
Shut up.

685
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,060
Don't hang up.

686
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,060
Walk the corridors again.

687
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,060
Okay.

688
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,060
Jason, Sir said... Shut up!

689
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,060
The pattern has changed.

690
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,060
It has changed.

691
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,060
It's the Baizhu bug.

692
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,060
When did it change? It changed...

693
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,060
I can't be scared.

694
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,060
We have to find a way to get out of here.

695
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,060
Listen to me. Use explosives to blow it up.

696
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,060
No! What if there are other mechanisms?

697
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,060
Even if there are mechanisms,

698
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,060
they are old mechanisms for hundreds of years.

699
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,060
We have explosives.

700
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,060
Blow it up, okay?

701
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,060
Listen to me.

702
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,060
What if it's not just a mechanism, but something else?

703
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,060
Listen to Wu Sanxing. Use the dynamite.

704
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,060
Prepare explosives.

705
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,060
Calculate the spot. Yes, sir.

706
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,060
Let's go.

707
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,060
How is it?

708
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,060
Are you scared?

709
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,060
Isn't this amazing?

710
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,060
Isn't this a real weapon?

711
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,060
How is it?

712
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,060
It's a ghost wall. It can't be a ghost wall.

713
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,060
Stop talking nonsense.

714
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,060
We saw it with our own eyes.

715
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:29,060
What's the third one?

716
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,060
Oh, right. Your one. Hurry. Your ring is on the wall.

717
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:33,060
Think about how to prove it.

718
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,060
Xiaoge?

719
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,060
What's wrong?

720
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,060
What's wrong?

721
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,060
At that time,

722
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,060
could it be a space wall?

723
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,060
Yes.

724
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,060
But how to prove it?

725
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,400
The dark corner is full of

726
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,400
wind and snow

727
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,400
Where to go and where to go

728
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,400
The mark of the past

729
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,400
is reflected in the wind

730
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,400
The lonely past

731
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,400
Oh

732
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,400
Oh

733
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,400
I chase the clouds and the wind

734
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,400
I forget myself on the way

735
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,400
How to answer

736
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,400
Through the night

737
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,400
In the darkness

738
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,400
I got the answer

739
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,400
The wind and snow of time

740
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,400
are reflected in

741
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,400
the flowers that bloom

742
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,400
The mark of the past

743
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,400
is reflected in the wind

744
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,400
The wind

745
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,400
is reflected in the wind

746
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,400
Oh

747
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,400
Oh

748
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,400
Oh

749
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,400
Oh

750
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,400
Oh

751
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,400
Oh

752
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,400
Oh

753
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,400
Oh

754
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,400
Oh

755
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,400
Oh

756
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,400
I chase the clouds and the wind

757
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,400
I forget myself on the way

758
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,400
How to answer

759
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,400
Through the night

760
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,400
In the darkness

761
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,400
I got the answer

762
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,400
The wind and snow of time

763
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,400
are reflected in the flowers that bloom

764
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,400
The mark of the past

765
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,400
is reflected in the wind

766
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,400
The wind

767
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,400
is reflected in the wind

768
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,400
The wind

769
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,400
is reflected in the wind

770
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,400
Thanks for watching!
