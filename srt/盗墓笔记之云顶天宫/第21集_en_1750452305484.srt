1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 1

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 1

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 1

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 2

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 3

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
No need to prove it.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Mr. San.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Look.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
These are six bodies.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's said that there are eight people in total.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's said that there are two people missing.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Although we don't know how they went out,

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
if according to what you said,

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
there should be eight bodies here.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So,

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
we don't need to consider the third point.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
If we consider the third point,

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
it means that we are dead.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You are eight people.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Maybe only six people are missing.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Why can't you understand?

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It doesn't matter how many people are in.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What matters is that

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
the six people didn't go out until they died.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'll go and see if there are any clues

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
in their handwriting.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
No.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Get up and go there and see.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What is this?

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
There are many characters on it.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
They are all very confused.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Besides the number of people,

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
there are some information.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't know if you can understand.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I don't know.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I don't know.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I don't know.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I don't know.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I don't know.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I don't know.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I can't read the name of

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
the case of the two women's husband

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
the video was deleted.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I don't miss the detailed так.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's the legendary case.

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I don't know yet.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I have gear,

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,500
嗯

63
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,800
都省点练吧

64
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
把手电都关了

65
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,800
就用取暖的炉子照明

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,500
嗯

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
哎你们听着啊

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
今天卖掉了从海里带出来的最后一件东西

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
拿了三千块钱一千五还给老李

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
欠款还清

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
海里带出来的

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
他是不是去过海底墨

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
哎不是攀子

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
让你找线索你怎么看小说啊

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
哎呀别闹了

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
哎呀别闹了别闹了

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
就万一上面有什么线索呢

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
你看这个

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
你看这个人

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
这个人

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
这不是三爷吗

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
这不是三叔

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
这是谢连环拍照的人才是三叔

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
冷静

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
就这个人呢

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
三叔小哥为什么呀

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
是不是现在整个考古队都在于那天宫啊

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
为什么为什么他们非得要来这儿啊

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
不是你冷静一点

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
胖子上将要把这炸了

91
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
我现在就要离开这儿

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
我要去问三叔

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
这到底是怎么回事啊

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
是是是是

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
咱们肯定能出去

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
你冷静一点

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
这样你好好想怎么出去

98
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
咱们出去就找三爷

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
好吧

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
小三爷走

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
来

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
来想想

103
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
你看这个来这个给我

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
你喝点水

105
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
冷静一点

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
好好想

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
啊

108
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
小三爷

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
你现在最好保持冷静

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
你身上有内伤

111
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
要不咱们

112
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
今天就到这儿吧

113
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
明天保持一个好的状态

114
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
我知道你心里有事

115
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
不过这些事

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
也不是一时半刻就能解决的呀

117
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
小三爷

118
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
早知道咱不按你符号走

119
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
这符号明显是这八个人留下来的

120
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
当时他们一定是分成了两组

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
六个人这边两个人那边

122
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
他们把这个符号留在哪儿

123
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
说不准那个方向更凶下

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
不一定

125
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
也有可能是那两个人

126
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
发现这边人失踪了

127
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
所以留下了符号

128
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
也说不准

129
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
符号

130
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
符号

131
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
对呀

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
符号

133
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
你们冷静一点

134
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
冷静一点

135
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
这个木道根本就是一个背轮

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
它是不可能成立的

137
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
你慢慢说

138
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
你慢慢说

139
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
你听我说啊

140
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
如果是空间折叠的话

141
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
在这个木道里不管是因为什么

142
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
一定会让我们有一个

143
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
转 调转方向的过程

144
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
对不对

145
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
对不对

146
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
对

147
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
那如果我拿着笔

148
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
一路边画痕迹边往前走

149
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
我身后会有一条长长的痕迹

150
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
一路跟着我

151
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
在我调转方向之后

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
我会发生什么

153
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
目前有画的痕迹

154
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
说重点

155
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
重点是我们在调转了方向之后

156
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
它整个方向就反了

157
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
我原本在这边拿着笔的手

158
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
就会在另一边的木墙上

159
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
开始画道

160
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
对不对

161
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
你承认不承认

162
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
承认 承认

163
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
你听懂了吗

164
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
那么 这是逻辑推论

165
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
所以按照逻辑上来说

166
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
这个木道不管怎么样

167
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
它一定存在这么样一个转折点

168
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
在我们走到这个转折点的时候

169
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
就像走 through 里面

170
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
镜子

171
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
我们直线

172
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
就走到深入相反的方向去了

173
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
对吧

174
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
好

175
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
那现在问题来了

176
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
如果这个反生命

177
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
真的存在的话

178
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
它有多好

179
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
有

180
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
有多好

181
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
有多好

182
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
有多好

183
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
特别好

184
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
对呀

185
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
它一定是有厚度的呀

186
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
如果这个反生命

187
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
没有厚度的话

188
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
那我们走到这个反生命的时候

189
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
我们身体的前半部分

190
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
后半部分

191
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
就会在通过镜面的时候

192
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
就会

193
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
就会互相重疊

194
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
对

195
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
因为这个时候

196
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
我们身体的前一半

197
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
已经通过这个反生命了

198
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
但我们的后半部分

199
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
还留在镜子外面

200
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
如果我的这个说法

201
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
没有错的话

202
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
我们通过镜面的时候

203
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
必死无疑

204
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
就会变成一坨怪物

205
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
你的鼻子就

206
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
就就就

207
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
炸到你后脑上去了

208
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
啊

209
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
可是我们走了这么多遍

210
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
也没有死啊

211
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
这就是我要说的

212
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
这个反生命

213
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
它一定远大于

214
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
一个人的厚度

215
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
它是一个反射

216
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
过来的构图段

217
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
我们从这头走进去

218
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
再从另外一端走出来

219
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
在这个过程中

220
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
完成了整个空间的折叠

221
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
那么现在问题来了

222
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
这个距离

223
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
到底是多少呢

224
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
多少

225
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
这样

226
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
我们假设这个距离

227
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
只有两三不远

228
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
那么

229
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
我们在进入空间的时候

230
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
我们俩进入空间了

231
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
胖子留在外面

232
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
没有进入空间

233
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
因为这个空间

234
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
只有两三步的距离

235
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
这样

236
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
我们前面 后面

237
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
两边是都能看见的

238
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
这个时候会发生什么

239
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
我们就会看到

240
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
一模一样的王胖子

241
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
对

242
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
前后就会有

243
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
两个一模一样的王胖子

244
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
你说这都反应

245
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
这个时候

246
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
悖论就来了

247
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
我们身后的王胖子A

248
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
能不能看见身后的王胖子B呢

249
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
别 别 别 别 别 别

250
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
别说了

251
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
再或者说

252
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
我们回头

253
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
拉住了王胖子A的手

254
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
不是真别说了

255
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
听着盛的话

256
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
我提个建议行吗

257
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
你别老

258
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
拿我做比喻行吗

259
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
拿朗锋

260
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
拿朗锋做比喻去

261
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
那怎么可能发生

262
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
这种事情吗

263
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
对

264
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
所以这个所谓的

265
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
镜子空间是不可能存在的

266
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
这个怎么走也走不出

267
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
军的木道是不符合

268
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
逻辑基础的

269
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
这个木道的存在

270
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
它就是不合逻辑的

271
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
汪大海不是神

272
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
它不可能

273
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
创造自己的物理规则

274
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
这儿的激光和汪大海

275
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
也没有关系

276
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
这些尸体

277
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
也不是因为

278
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
这些激光困死在这儿的

279
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
我们现在遇到的是

280
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
一个全新的问题

281
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
是一个新的特例

282
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
我们被这些尸体误导了

283
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
而且最能造成

284
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
这种误导的

285
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
是什么

286
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
有鬼

287
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
我黑了一皮子呢

288
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
也

289
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
我说这么多

290
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
你给我分析出来一个妖鬼

291
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
你直接给结论不就完了吗

292
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
幻觉

293
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
第二点不是已经说了吧

294
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
王棒子

295
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
这样的幻觉

296
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
我们曾经经历过

297
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Qing Tong tree

298
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Mr. Sa

299
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Mr. Sa

300
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What are we looking for?

301
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You haven't told me yet

302
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
When we were in Qing Ling

303
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
we had met a strange heart

304
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
that could affect the people around us

305
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
and make people feel

306
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
that they can't go out

307
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
in a place that's always locked up

308
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Just like we are now

309
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
These are all the gold and silver beads

310
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
We can't find them

311
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Have you found them?

312
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Find them

313
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
There will be

314
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Ting Zhen

315
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Come and see

316
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Hurry up

317
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'll get them

318
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You're so lucky

319
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I finally found you

320
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
This is the last time

321
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I've found you

322
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I found it

323
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Hurry up

324
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'll burn it

325
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'll burn it

326
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'll burn it

327
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'll burn it

328
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
What's that sound?

329
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Where are they?

330
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Shun Zi

331
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Shun Zi

332
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm telling you

333
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Don't push the other side

334
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Don't get close

335
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Don't let him attack us from the back

336
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Where are they?

337
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,820
Yeah.

338
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,400
Yeah.

339
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,740
Yeah.

340
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,060
Go!

341
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,540
Oh no!

342
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,400
Who made that?

343
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,460
Pan Deng!

344
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,460
68 !

345
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,680
Sarin!

346
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,740
I'm sorry.

347
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,740
I'm sorry.

348
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,740
Xiao Hua.

349
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,740
Why are you here?

350
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,740
Mr. Xiao, are you okay?

351
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,740
I'm fine. Why are you here?

352
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,740
What's going on?

353
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,740
How long can you let him sleep?

354
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,740
Don't worry, he won't hurt you.

355
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,740
We're out!

356
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,740
Come out!

357
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,740
Xiao Hua, how did you find this place?

358
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,740
Someone's taking the medicine. Could it be them?

359
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,740
The drug is not small. Is there any problem?

360
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,740
I don't believe it.

361
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,740
Let's talk.

362
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,740
I'm sorry.

363
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,740
Do you know what they said?

364
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,740
Xiao Hua, how did you find this place?

365
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:36,740
Wu Xie, what's the secret behind Yun Ding's hiding?

366
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,740
It's a secret that attracts everyone.

367
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,740
Wu Xie, you came here for your uncle.

368
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,740
I came here for someone.

369
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,740
Who?

370
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:01,740
Before that, I have a few questions for you.

371
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,740
Can I ask you?

372
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,740
The first question.

373
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,740
Whether you did anything wrong,

374
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,740
you will always trust him unconditionally.

375
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,740
He's my uncle.

376
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,740
I know him.

377
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,740
The second question.

378
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,740
Do you know what happened to your uncle and I

379
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,740
in the West Sea Tomb?

380
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,740
Why I've been investigating for so many years,

381
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,740
but I haven't been in the battle at all?

382
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,740
Wu Xie, you've been to the West Sea Tomb.

383
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,740
Did you find anything?

384
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,740
At that time, we were in the Sea Tomb.

385
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,740
Many memories were discovered there.

386
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,740
Many traces of the archaeological team were destroyed.

387
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,740
We...

388
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,740
We met many strange things.

389
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,740
Okay.

390
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,740
The third question.

391
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,740
The third question.

392
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:24,740
Are you also the brother who treated you as his brother?

393
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,740
Xiao Hua, of course.

394
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,740
What do you want to ask me?

395
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,740
Wu Xie, in the eyes of the people,

396
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,740
I'm the youngest uncle of the Old Nine Sects.

397
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,740
I'm the one who said that I'm the second uncle.

398
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,740
I'm the businesswoman who's cold-blooded and innocent.

399
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:55,740
But I'm not here for you.

400
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,740
I'm not here for anything other than your brother and friends.

401
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,740
I think you're a smart person.

402
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,740
I think you should know that I don't want to leave the whole Xie family

403
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,740
to chase the Cloud Sky Palace.

404
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,740
Not just for a few simple questions.

405
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,740
I think you should know that I've found out the truth about you.

406
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,740
I just don't want to believe that you're hiding it from me.

407
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:36,740
All the time, I've never been so proud of you.

408
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:42,740
I'm just like Xie Lian Huan, who treats Wu San Xing the same.

409
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,740
So I want to ask you in person,

410
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,740
and give you another chance.

411
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:00,740
But I didn't expect that you'd still lie to me.

412
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,740
Xie Lian Huan, listen to me.

413
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,740
I'm not trying to hide it from you.

414
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,740
I know what you want to know.

415
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,740
But I just want to tell you that I should know everything.

416
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,740
Didn't you lie to me?

417
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,740
Yes.

418
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,740
I shouldn't lie to you.

419
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:31,740
But I just wanted to tell you the first time.

420
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,740
But I don't know why.

421
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,740
I'm a ghost.

422
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,740
I didn't say anything.

423
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,740
I won't be able to find another chance from now on.

424
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,740
I'm afraid that after I tell you this, you'll think of me.

425
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,740
I...

426
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,740
Fine.

427
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,740
Whatever I say, it's all right if I'm wrong.

428
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,740
I'm sorry.

429
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,740
Stop it.

430
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,740
When you find out the truth,

431
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,740
when you find out the truth and the betrayal you imagined,

432
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,740
when you find out Wu San Xing is the evil one,

433
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,740
you still won't tell me.

434
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,740
Xie Lian Huan was wrong, brother.

435
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:27,740
It seems that I've made the right choice.

436
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:38,740
You're the last thing I've done to Wu Family.

437
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,740
It's easy now.

438
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,740
Thank you.

439
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,740
Xiao Hua.

440
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,740
You can't be a brother.

441
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,740
I only want to say one thing.

442
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,740
Stop it.

443
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:15,740
I'm afraid that you won't be able to leave this place.

444
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,740
Xiao Hua.

445
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,740
Xiao Hua.

446
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,740
Xiao Hua.

447
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,740
She's gone.

448
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,740
Why is she leaving now?

449
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,740
What did she say to you?

450
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,740
Tian Zhen.

451
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,740
Tian Zhen.

452
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,740
Tian Zhen.

453
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,740
Tian Zhen.

454
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,740
Tian Zhen, stop it.

455
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,740
Tian Zhen, stop it.

456
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,740
What did you say to Xiao Hua?

457
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,740
Why didn't she stay with us?

458
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,740
We're going to the wrong place this time.

459
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,740
How do you know?

460
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,740
Xiao Hua told you.

461
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,740
No, how did she know?

462
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,740
Is it reliable?

463
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,740
Yes.

464
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,740
Wu Xie.

465
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,740
I won't go with you.

466
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,740
I've brought what Wu San told me.

467
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,740
I'm not happy with his money.

468
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,740
And my father found it.

469
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,740
I want to take him home.

470
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,740
I don't want to participate in your future journey.

471
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:48,740
Moreover, I'm not good enough with you.

472
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,740
I have to go to Wenquan.

473
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,740
Shun Zi.

474
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,740
Can you go back alone?

475
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,740
Don't worry.

476
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,740
I'm sure I'm stronger than you.

477
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,740
We just pulled your leg, right?

478
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,740
Brother Huan.

479
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,740
You know I'm not like that.

480
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,740
Enough.

481
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,740
Don't be so hasty.

482
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,740
Shun Zi, be careful on your way back.

483
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,740
Boss Wu.

484
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,740
I know you've been through a lot.

485
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,740
You won't get out if you don't find a solution.

486
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,740
But don't forget.

487
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,740
You'll be gone soon.

488
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,740
There are still days to go.

489
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,740
You have a plan.

490
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,740
Be careful.

491
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,740
Si Si.

492
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,740
This...

493
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,740
Pan Zi.

494
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,740
I've told you before.

495
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,740
What?

496
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,740
What?

497
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,740
Forget it.

498
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,740
Ask him in person.

499
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,740
What?

500
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,740
Is this a dead end again?

501
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,740
Be careful.

502
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,740
Go.

503
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,740
Take a rest.

504
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,740
Okay.

505
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,740
Let's go.

506
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,740
Go.

507
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,740
Why are you here?

508
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,740
Mr. Qiu Tenggao asked us to come here to meet you.

509
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,740
Where is he?

510
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,740
He's almost here.

511
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,740
Is something wrong?

512
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,740
Why hasn't he answered the phone?

513
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:16,740
He won't show up until he sees the answer.

514
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,740
Mr. Qiu Tenggao asked us to bring the doctor here.

515
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,740
He brought a very good doctor.

516
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,740
You're too serious.

517
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,740
Let him see it for you.

518
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,740
Thank you.

519
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,740
You need to take another shot to detoxify yourself.

520
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,740
It's very sensitive.

521
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,740
Remember, don't exercise.

522
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,740
Especially, exercise.

523
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,740
Thank you.

524
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,740
There must be many treasures in here.

525
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,740
No.

526
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,740
No.

527
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,740
No.

528
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,740
No.

529
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,740
Madam.

530
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,740
What's the matter?

531
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,740
Madam.

532
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,740
I want to see you.

533
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,740
No.

534
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,740
I've been in a bad mood recently.

535
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,740
I don't want to see these evil dogs.

536
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,740
He said that you and Mr. Qiu Tenggao

537
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,740
promised to meet him.

538
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,740
He said you must be interested in seeing him.

539
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,740
No.

540
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,740
This way.

541
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,740
No.

542
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,740
They've knocked the wall.

543
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,740
Do you need help?

544
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,740
What should we do?

545
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,740
You and their whole army are in the same boat.

546
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,740
Unless we can get them out of here.

547
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,740
But Mr. Qiu Tenggao is a man of the eye.

548
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:28,740
We saved An Ning for several times.

549
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,740
After that, I'll tell you.

550
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,740
He didn't take his hand when he killed us.

551
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,740
Uncle San.

552
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,740
San.

553
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,740
San.

554
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,740
San, what's wrong?

555
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,740
Be careful.

556
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,740
Be careful.

557
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:51,740
Stop.

558
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,740
San.

559
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,740
You little bastard.

560
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,740
You can go back.

561
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,740
Okay.

562
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,740
When Mr. Qiu Tenggao comes back,

563
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,740
I'll talk to you in person.

564
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:47,740
Qiu Tenggao has arrived at the Cloud Sky Palace.

565
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,740
I'm afraid you can't see him for a while.

566
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,740
You should open the door and see the mountain.

567
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,740
What do you want?

568
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,740
People are so good at jumping.

569
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,740
They jump because of the water.

570
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,740
You can do nothing.

571
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,740
You can turn around and do it for three weeks.

572
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,740
Okay.

573
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,740
I'll give you a hug.

574
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,740
Hurry up.

575
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:20,740
Don't waste the dust in the county.

576
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,740
San.

577
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,740
San, what's wrong?

578
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,740
San.

579
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,740
How did you take care of San?

580
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,740
Don't worry.

581
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,740
I'm not dead.

582
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,740
I'll go with you.

583
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,740
San.

584
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,740
San.

585
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,740
San.

586
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,740
You finally show up.

587
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,740
Do you want some water?

588
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,740
Come.

589
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,740
How is San?

590
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,740
He was forced into the flesh.

591
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,740
That must hurt.

592
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,740
What are you talking about?

593
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,740
It's San's.

594
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,740
You should have died earlier.

595
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,740
There's no more meat left.

596
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,740
The strong stick of the sword is broken.

597
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,740
Half of the rest can be cut into pieces.

598
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:40,740
Aunt.

599
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,740
They're all cut with a knife.

600
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,740
That's why they're here.

601
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,740
Okay.

602
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,740
Don't say that.

603
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,740
You've been through this.

604
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,740
Come.

605
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,740
Don't let An Ning see it.

606
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,740
Have some food.

607
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,740
San.

608
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,740
San.

609
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,740
Uncle San.

610
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,740
How is he?

611
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,740
He's not in a good condition.

612
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,740
He's still in the flesh.

613
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,740
Okay.

614
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,740
Uncle San.

615
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,740
If there's nothing wrong,

616
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:25,740
Mr. Qiu Dekou still wants to work with the fire family.

617
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:33,740
Your appetite is very big.

618
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,740
I'm afraid the fire family

619
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,740
can't keep you.

620
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,740
By then, you'd better

621
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,740
live a peaceful life.

622
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,740
You'll have more wealth.

623
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,740
I believe you'll have a way.

624
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,740
Unless you don't care about

625
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,740
Huo Ling's whereabouts.

626
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,740
Other than this,

627
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:58,740
what else can you threaten me?

628
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,740
Mr. Qiu.

629
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,740
Your appetite is very big.

630
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:10,740
I'm touched by the things in the Celestial Palace.

631
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,740
This is the last time.

632
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,740
You should know what's in the Celestial Palace.

633
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,740
After getting it,

634
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,740
everything else is no longer important.

635
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:26,740
Mr. Qiu.

636
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,740
Mr. Qiu.

637
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:26,740
Mr. Qiu.

638
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:56,740
Mr. Qiu.

639
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,740
Mr. Qiu.

640
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:56,740
Mr. Qiu.
