1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,880
dimension.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
If you want to change the order, these two pieces can be put together.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But if these two pieces are put together, then the other order is wrong.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Actually, I think the most important problem is the order.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
This is the same.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Boss, please eat something. It's been a long time.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Sa, you eat something.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Come on.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Fatty, can you stop messing around?

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Can you do something with your brain?

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Look, is it supposed to be a fighting meaning?

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
According to my understanding, war is more accurate.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
War?

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yes.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,800
The

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Jia Sha.

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Master Hua.

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Old Mrs. Huo helped Mr. Qiu to export a large batch of cultural relics.

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Then the photo is very likely that Mr. Qiu asked Mrs. Huo to give it to me.

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I will go to the meeting.

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But the most urgent thing is to let Miss Xiu Xiu know about this.

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
After all, if there is her help in this cultural relic case,

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
then you will be much more convenient to deal with.

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Go and call Xiu Xiu.

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Okay.

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It seems that Grandma really participated in the sale of the cultural relics.

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Xiu Xiu.

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We found some information about her business price through the account of the outside.

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Calm down first.

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This matter is not as simple as we think.

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Maybe Grandma Huo has some difficulties.

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Master Hua.

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Look.

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This is Zhang Hao's superior.

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
He is known as Dao Ge.

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
This Dao Ge is especially careful and cautious.

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Even looking for a woman is on his own.

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
There are no two passwords, don't want to see him.

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And this person is very business-oriented.

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
He has a route that belongs to him.

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The route that we currently clearly control

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
has Lao Wu, Thailand, and then change to the water route to Europe.

70
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Why is he cautious?

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He changed a lot of ways along the way.

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So it's hard to track down the whereabouts.

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Everyone likes Dao Ge's reputation and route.

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So the whole 70% of the sellers in Changsha have a partnership with him.

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So this Dao Ge has a large number of trading lists.

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
If we want to enter the group, we have to control him.

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But Master Hua, this Dao Ge is very cunning.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Even Gu Yong's bodyguard is Gu Yong Bing.

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I think he won't be hooked in the general way.

80
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Brother Xiao Hao, I have a way.

81
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What's written on here is that

82
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
King Wan Nu buried his wife at the bottom of the sea.

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
After the bottom of the sea, he was re-created to the top of the formation.

84
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's a story of killing enemies in the southwest.

85
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But I always feel that this...

86
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So the twelve hand-painted figures at the bottom of the sea are King Wan Nu's wife.

87
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's quite a good story.

88
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What's written behind it seems to be a love letter.

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yes.

90
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It says, what is love?

91
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Two swans face each other with their lives.

92
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
They are miles apart, lonely.

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Their future is short and long.

94
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
They have lost their love for life.

95
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Even if they are in love, what's the point of living?

96
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
This...

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
This is clearly a love letter from the original King of the Qing Dynasty.

98
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What is love?

99
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's only called life and death.

100
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Two swans face each other with their lives.

101
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
They are miles apart, lonely.

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Their future is short and long.

103
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Their future is short and long.

104
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
They are miles apart, lonely.

105
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Who are they going to?

106
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yes!

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yes!

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Why are you all staring at me?

109
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:50,380
Didn't you see the

110
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
two swans face each other?

111
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
They are all swans.

112
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
No, you guys are not done yet.

113
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
We are done.

114
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Wu Xie.

115
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Wu Xie.

116
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Move.

117
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You have the answer?

118
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You are sure and you've squarely guided your answers?

119
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I think so.

120
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I think so.

121
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I made the star with Wu Xie.

122
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I think it's right.

123
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Wu Xie, you can't do this.

124
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
No, Wu Xie.

125
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Fatty, where did you move the statue?

126
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I moved it everywhere.

127
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I mean, did you touch anything else?

128
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Me again?

129
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
No.

130
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Anyway, this statue is our only variable now.

131
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Come here, everyone.

132
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Help me clean up the blood.

133
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Come on.

134
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Come on.

135
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Come on.

136
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Wu Xie.

137
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
King of the Ten Thousand Poison

138
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
King of the Ten Thousand Poison has treated Fatty as a cleaner, right?

139
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So the blood on his body shows loneliness and skill.

140
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Only by helping him to get rid of the blood, the door will open.

141
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I didn't expect that King of the Thousand Poison is like me.

142
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
He is still a young man.

143
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
No, it's not scientific.

144
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's unreasonable.

145
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
How did the door open?

146
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
The wisdom of the ancestors.

147
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
What's scientific?

148
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Anyway, the door is open.

149
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
No, it's not.

150
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
No, it's unreasonable.

151
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
How did the door open?

152
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Stop arguing.

153
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
No, no one has ever thought about it.

154
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Grandpa Si.

155
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Grandpa Si.

156
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Clean up the things.

157
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Clean up the things.

158
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Clean up the things.

159
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Clean up the things.

160
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Clean up the things.

161
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Clean up the things.

162
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Clean up the things.

163
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Clean up the things.

164
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Clean up the things.

165
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Clean up the things.

166
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Clean up the things.

167
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Clean up the things.

168
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Clean up the things.

169
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Clean up the things.

170
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Clean up the things.

171
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Clean up the things.

172
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Clean up the things.

173
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Clean up the things.

174
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Clean up the things.

175
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Clean up the things.

176
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Clean up the things.

177
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Clean up the things.

178
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Clean up the things.

179
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Clean up the things.

180
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Clean up the things.

181
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Clean up the things.

182
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Clean up the things.

183
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Clean up the things.

184
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Clean up the things.

185
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
This is really evil.

186
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
These paintings surround all the commitment.

187
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You really are komö bare.

188
00:15:47,000 --> 00:16:09,640
man from the

189
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,200
the content of these murals should be their life situation.

190
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,400
If it's a worshiping god,

191
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,800
it should be a scene from the past.

192
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,200
For example, the civil official is a water-saving, martial official is a soldier.

193
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,600
But if you look at it this way,

194
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,000
these murals...

195
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,000
don't seem to be the same.

196
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,400
Why are there bugs?

197
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,800
You're right.

198
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,000
And even if it's a dragon,

199
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,800
the one who worships must have a leader.

200
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,200
This is the burial ground.

201
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,200
Then they should worship the king of the ten thousand slaves.

202
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,000
The one who worships the burial ground

203
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,200
should be the left and right four sides of the king of the ten thousand slaves.

204
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
But look at it now.

205
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,400
There are soldiers and slaves.

206
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,800
It's so strange.

207
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,000
And this is a painting in the imperial palace.

208
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,400
It's too unusual.

209
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,200
Is it possible that this painting is also double-layered?

210
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,800
Let's take it apart.

211
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,000
Don't take it apart.

212
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,600
This is a cultural relic.

213
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,400
Look.

214
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,000
It's already broken.

215
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,800
But there's nothing special behind it.

216
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,600
Look at it this way.

217
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,600
These are two statues of Buddha and Buddha.

218
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,200
This is made of bronze,

219
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,800
it would never leave the house.

220
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:52,200
The

221
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,960
Without the Hotel

222
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,120
ait

223
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,240
You ask your people to have a ready

224
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,080
under control

225
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,920
to each room

226
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,200
The place where you can hide.

227
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,200
Is Qiao Jie reliable?

228
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,200
Before Qiao Jie was a mother,

229
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,200
she was a member of the Xie family.

230
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,200
She can trust people.

231
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,200
Qiao Jie

232
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,200
Brother Xiao Hua.

233
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,200
Look at me.

234
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,200
I look like a flowery girl.

235
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,200
Who is more beautiful?

236
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,200
If you are not ready,

237
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,200
I have a secret plan.

238
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,200
Miss Xue Xue.

239
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,200
Your clothes now

240
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,200
are perfect for the taste of doggo.

241
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,200
Of course.

242
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,200
Okay.

243
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,200
Xue Jiu.

244
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,200
From now on,

245
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,200
you will be the first one to be called Summer.

246
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,200
There is a tracker in this earmuffs.

247
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,200
You wear it and hide it.

248
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,200
If anything happens, you will protect yourself.

249
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,200
I know.

250
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,200
You are so beautiful.

251
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,200
You are so beautiful.

252
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,200
You are so beautiful.

253
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,200
Listen carefully.

254
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
Get ready.

255
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,200
The guests will be here soon.

256
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,200
Qiao Jie. Summer.

257
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,200
I will find you

258
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,200
the best actor in this place.

259
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,200
Thank you Qiao Jie.

260
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,200
I will recommend you to Brother Dao later.

261
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,200
You can take the time.

262
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,200
Qiao Jie, you are so nice to me.

263
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,200
It's all up to you.

264
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
Thank you Qiao Jie.

265
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
You can think of me in such a good place.

266
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,200
Next time, we will have a good place.

267
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
Take all of us to go there.

268
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
Sisters, did you hear that?

269
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,200
Good place.

270
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Come on.

271
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,200
I will go to receive the eggs.

272
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,200
Come on. Sit.

273
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
You must take me.

274
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,200
Yes. There is me.

275
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,200
Don't forget. There is me.

276
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,200
I will go to receive the eggs.

277
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,200
I will go to receive the eggs.

278
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,200
I will go to receive the eggs.

279
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,200
I will go to receive the eggs.

280
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,200
I will go to receive the eggs.

281
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,200
I will go to receive the eggs.

282
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,200
I will go to receive the eggs.

283
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,200
I will go to receive the eggs.

284
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,200
I will go to receive the eggs.

285
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,200
I will go to receive the eggs.

286
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
I will go to receive the eggs.

287
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
I will go to receive the eggs.

288
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,200
I will go to receive the eggs.

289
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,200
I will go to receive the eggs.

290
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,200
I will go to receive the eggs.

291
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,200
I will go to receive the eggs.

292
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,200
I will go to receive the eggs.

293
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
I will go to receive the eggs.

294
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,200
I will go to receive the eggs.

295
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,200
I will go to receive the eggs.

296
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,200
It is too poor in East Xiared country.

297
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
There is no burial stuff in the funeral grave.

298
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,200
It is not that Wan Nu King

299
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,200
throw all the burial stuff into his house?

300
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,200
The funeral grave has only a little left.

301
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,200
A big grave like this

302
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,480
Is there any special reason?

303
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,760
That's not right.

304
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,760
No matter how much he tries to make up a story,

305
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,760
no matter how much he tries to make it up,

306
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,760
the dead camel is still bigger than the horse.

307
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,760
If there's no gold and jewelry,

308
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,760
how many bronze weapons do you think there are?

309
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,760
There are bronze weapons. Look.

310
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,760
Isn't this the monkey from before?

311
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,760
But it doesn't look like it's worth it.

312
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,760
I don't know.

313
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,760
I thought it was a modern artist who just carved it.

314
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,760
Look.

315
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
There are one, two, three...

316
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
three pavilion tables.

317
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
Is the person who buried it very loyal?

318
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,320
He even buried his wife and child together?

319
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,320
This is a tombstone. Look.

320
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,320
The entrance to the underground palace must be up here.

321
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,320
Whether there are any burial items, it depends on this.

322
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,320
Come, come, come.

323
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,880
Wait, wait.

324
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,880
Brother Xiao, do you want to check if there are any mechanisms here?

325
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,880
How is it?

326
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,880
No.

327
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,440
Come, let's help each other.

328
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,440
Listen to my instructions.

329
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,440
One, two, three.

330
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,440
One, two.

331
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,440
Come, let's work harder.

332
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,440
One, two.

333
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,440
Come, come, come. One, two, three.

334
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,440
Work harder. One, two.

335
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,440
Okay.

336
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,440
What's going on? Is this tombstone fake?

337
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,440
Impossible.

338
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
There are only basic tombs. Why can't we play this?

339
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
The entrance must be down there.

340
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Could it be sealed under the green bricks?

341
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
These green bricks are not sealed by the iron.

342
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
This means that the entrance is not sealed under here.

343
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Let's open it and see.

344
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Right?

345
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Come.

346
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
This is not right.

347
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Come, come, come.

348
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Miss Xiu Xiu is really extraordinary.

349
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It's only been a while and she's already gotten inside.

350
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Jia Sha.

351
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Don't praise her in front of her.

352
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
The less she gets involved, the better.

353
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I know.

354
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Master Hua, Brother Dao is here.

355
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Brother, look. The girls are waiting.

356
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Girls, come.

357
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Call Brother Dao.

358
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Brother Dao.

359
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,560
Brother Dao, there's a new girl today.

360
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,560
What's your name?

361
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,560
My name is Summer.

362
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,560
Take off your mask.

363
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,120
I'm going to bed.

364
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,120
Brother Dao, is this one okay?

365
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,120
I think it's okay.

366
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,120
But...

367
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,120
I'm afraid you can't stand it.

368
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,120
That's it. Let's go.

369
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,120
Sit, sit, sit. You guys sit.

370
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,120
Everyone, be careful. The target is entering the elevator.

371
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,120
Sit.

372
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,680
Sit.

373
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,680
Brother Dao, let's drink first.

374
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,680
Why drink?

375
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,680
Isn't it more fun to drink?

376
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,680
Let's drink.

377
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,680
Why are you playing music?

378
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,240
The wine is going to wake up.

379
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,240
Let's listen to the song first.

380
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,240
Let's listen to the song.

381
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,240
What song?

382
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,240
After listening to the song,

383
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,240
let's dance.

384
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,240
What dance?

385
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,240
Brother Dao, you...

386
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,240
Get ready to move.

387
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,240
All departments, get ready to move.

388
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,240
Brother Dao, let's drink first.

389
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,240
Drink?

390
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,800
Here.

391
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,800
Cheers.

392
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,800
Wait.

393
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,800
I'll drink with you.

394
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,800
Cheers.

395
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,800
Why aren't you drinking?

396
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,800
Brother Dao, you're really good at drinking.

397
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,800
I won't do the dishes with you.

398
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,800
I'll go take a shower first.

399
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,800
What shower? Come on.

400
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,800
Brother Dao.

401
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,360
Damn it.

402
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:08,360
Master Hua, this might put Miss Xiu Xiu in danger.

403
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,360
Who is it?

404
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,360
Help me. Get lost.

405
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,360
Here.

406
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,360
Is this a stone?

407
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,360
No.

408
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,920
Why is this shell on a woman's face?

409
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,920
Why is there no entrance to the underground palace?

410
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,920
What are you talking about?

411
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,920
Move it away and you'll know.

412
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,920
Here.

413
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,920
This stone shell is carved from stone?

414
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,480
This stone is carved from stone?

415
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,480
What's wrong?

416
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,480
You're fooled.

417
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,480
Master Hua.

418
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,920
Move it.

419
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,920
Theおっ Atlantic Dragon is fake.

420
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,920
The Tsunwak Dorothy stroke the wrong direction.

421
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,920
How can it be fake?

422
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,920
Grandfather Si.

423
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,920
a huge stone from stone is already hung up here.

424
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,440
First Grandfather used line,

425
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,440
then a fiscally.

426
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,440
We can discuss his situation in advance.

427
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,440
The Hopla in line with the top end has been corrected,

428
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,440
which proven error!

429
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,560
when his lie was discovered..

430
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,440
this deep AC and this ice

431
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,920
and this spiritual power

432
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,820
All are fake and existe

433
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,800
All aregens why we were teleported into this pernmager

434
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:42,020
This is your what is really this grave

435
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:45,060
Everything which should have in the house

436
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,780
What happened

437
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,480
We have to take everything

438
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,400
Our things are not allowed to go our Sinsheng Ridge

439
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:56,400
If we go back to fix it, it will be a waste of time.

440
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,400
We have to rest for a few days.

441
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,400
We have wasted all our time.

442
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,400
Even if they leave, they will be in front of us.

443
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,400
Don't worry.

444
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,400
We can go back to the village and make a mess.

445
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:16,400
It's impossible to bring all the things we have.

446
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
Impossible.

447
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,400
If we come back soon, we will have some leftovers.

448
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,400
Some leftovers?

449
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,400
You will eat some leftovers when you come back from the prison?

450
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,400
You are so good at this.

451
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,400
You say it.

452
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,400
You said you were going back to fix it.

453
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,400
Go back.

454
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,400
Go.

455
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,400
Do you recognize the way?

456
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,400
Why do I have to recognize the way?

457
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,400
I can take you out.

458
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,400
But now we are exhausted.

459
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,400
We have to rest for a while.

460
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,400
Otherwise we will be tired on the way.

461
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,400
What should we do?

462
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,400
How can I know?

463
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,400
I am a guide.

464
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,400
Shut up.

465
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,400
Yes, you can say it.

466
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,400
Come on, say it.

467
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,400
Say it.

468
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,400
Are you crazy?

469
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,400
What are you looking for?

470
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,400
You blame me?

471
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,400
Yes, I am the one who is blamed.

472
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,400
What are you arguing about?

473
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,400
Now the problem has appeared.

474
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,400
We should find a way to fix it.

475
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,400
No need to fix it.

476
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,400
It doesn't matter at all.

477
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,400
If you put it here now,

478
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,400
whoever touches it will be unlucky.

479
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,400
Do you dare to say Jason and others didn't touch it?

480
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,400
They may have the wrong direction.

481
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,400
They may be beaten into a nest by the border guards.

482
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,400
I tell you,

483
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,400
you should go back to the village as soon as possible.

484
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,400
You should get ready.

485
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,400
Come back after you finish.

486
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,400
What a waste of time.

487
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,400
I am leaving.

488
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,400
Did I ask you to leave?

489
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,400
It's none of your business.

490
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,400
I don't care about you.

491
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,400
It's none of your business.

492
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,400
Let go of me.

493
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,400
Stop fighting.

494
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,400
Come here.

495
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,400
Fatty, listen to me.

496
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,400
Don't you think it's strange?

497
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,400
After we all come here,

498
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,400
we become very arrogant.

499
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,400
Even if we know we are in trouble,

500
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,400
we shouldn't be so depressed.

501
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,400
Now we are in a bad mood.

502
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,400
I am in a bad mood today.

503
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,400
Come here.

504
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400
This stone turtle

505
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,400
can affect the strong magnetic field of emotions.

506
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,400
It will make the negative emotions in people very big.

507
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,400
So I hope everyone can control their emotions.

508
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,400
Xiao Ge.

509
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,400
Do you have a headache again?

510
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,400
It's not that serious in the dark.

511
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,400
But I can feel it.

512
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,400
There is something strange here.

513
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,400
I think I will find it.

514
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,400
Where?

515
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,400
This is another way.

516
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,400
To another spirit well.

517
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,400
I think it's impossible.

518
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,400
The observation table and the porcelain

519
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,400
have exposed the intention of the owner

520
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,400
to deceive us.

521
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,400
If so,

522
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,400
the person who made the noise

523
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,400
destroyed this place in a fit of rage.

524
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,400
Then the real spirit well

525
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,400
will be exposed.

526
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,400
I think there must be other places.

527
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,400
It seems different.

528
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,400
But how did you find such a hidden place?

529
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
What's so strange about it?

530
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,400
I think it's almost the same.

531
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,400
Is there any wind out of the wall?

532
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,400
Is there anything empty inside?

533
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,400
What's the matter?

534
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,400
There is a person in the hospital.

535
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,400
There is something strange about it.

536
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,400
I think it's not the same.

537
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,400
But how did you find such a hidden place?

538
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,400
What's so strange about it?

539
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,400
I think it's almost the same.

540
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,400
Shunzi has been looking at this place. Come and check it out.

541
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:09,400
Shunzi, since he got sick, his physical abilities have changed.

542
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:14,400
When he was scared, he was looking for an escape exit.

543
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,400
It's getting dark outside. The temperature here is getting lower. Let's be clean.

544
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,400
I think...

545
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,400
I used the explosive. It's safe to use it.

546
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,400
And it won't affect other walls.

547
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,400
You weren't the one who blew up the top.

548
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,400
I was the one who blew up the top.

549
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,400
I was the one who blew up the top.

550
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,400
I was the one who blew up the top.

551
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,400
You weren't the one who blew up the top.

552
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,400
Do you believe I put the explosive in your mouth?

553
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,400
Wolf, calm down.

554
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,400
You forgot that we're in a bad mood.

555
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,400
Let's be serious.

556
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,400
Stop arguing.

557
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,400
We can't get out of the front wall.

558
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,400
The front wall has a very special structure.

559
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,400
We can only fight from there.

560
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,400
The entrance is sealed from the outside.

561
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,400
We can't get out.

562
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,400
This is a method of the soldiers who built the tunnel.

563
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,400
I think this tunnel can reach the real tunnel.

564
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,400
But we can't open it from here.

565
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,400
It's been hundreds of years.

566
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,400
Can't we open it?

567
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,400
It's because it's very special.

568
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,400
When the soldiers left, they crawled out and sealed the entrance.

569
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,400
This way, it's safe to use.

570
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,400
We don't have to prepare too much.

571
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,400
It also guarantees the density and the integrity of the hole.

572
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,400
It's just that the temperature in this hall is too cold.

573
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,400
The workers couldn't withstand the heat.

574
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,400
That's why we found this wall.

575
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,400
I'm afraid that if we use the current method to demolish it,

576
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,400
it will cause a lot of collapse.

577
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,400
So we should go another way.

578
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,460
Master, greetings to you.

579
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,400
Excuse me, can you give me an address?

580
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,400
You nove Hong, don't say a word?

581
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,400
Go ask around to find out what Brother Dao does.

582
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,400
Nobody there wants to go out alive tonight!

583
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,400
All my guys are downstairs.

584
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,800
He has already called the police.

585
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,640
Take him away.

586
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,040
What are you doing?

587
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,600
I won't forgive you!

588
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,800
Wait!

589
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,840
This must be a curse. We must destroy it.

590
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,320
Otherwise, we can never get out of here.

591
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,320
Let's go.

592
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,960
Langfang!

593
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,920
Let him burn it.

594
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,600
Otherwise, we will always go in the wrong direction.

595
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,680
Xiao Ge.

596
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,160
What if the ice in this palace is melted?
