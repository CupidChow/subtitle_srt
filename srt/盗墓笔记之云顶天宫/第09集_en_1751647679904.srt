1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,640
you

3
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:28,280
here.

4
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,280
It's too narrow.

5
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,160
If I wear this cheap clothes,

6
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,960
I will be in trouble.

7
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,580
Today, there are many holes and cracks.

8
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,460
You don't understand the fashion circle.

9
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,360
This hole, this place,

10
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,840
is too natural.

11
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,460
It's natural.

12
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,200
But the temperature here is getting higher and higher.

13
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,260
I can't breathe now.

14
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,960
I think so too.

15
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,960
Fatty,

16
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,860
why don't you take off your clothes?

17
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,420
I think the air quality is not good here.

18
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,380
We are too aggressive.

19
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,540
How about we take off our clothes first?

20
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,420
No.

21
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,760
It's a pity to go back now.

22
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,560
And if we go back like this,

23
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,400
it will be more uncomfortable.

24
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,960
Fatty,

25
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,740
hold on.

26
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,260
Let's go two steps forward.

27
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,260
If we can't go to the end,

28
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,560
we will climb back.

29
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,060
Adjust your breathing.

30
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,460
Go.

31
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,540
Xiao Ge?

32
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,080
What's wrong?

33
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,040
What's wrong?

34
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,240
Nothing.

35
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,980
Let's go.

36
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,360
Fatty.

37
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,860
Do you think I'm still here?

38
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,760
Why are you so confused?

39
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,860
Do you think I'm not here?

40
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,960
You are here.

41
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,760
You are here.

42
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,560
You are a bunch of cowards.

43
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,560
You are crazy.

44
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,440
Cat & Cat

45
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,760
My god.

46
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,240
There actually are more hot water bottles here.

47
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,560
I think we are really not the first bunch to go to there.

48
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:32,560
I don't know if the gap has collapsed when they came here.

49
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,560
This mural is depicted as the scene of the fairy flying.

50
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,560
There are boulders and stones blocking the entrance.

51
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,560
There's a mural inside.

52
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,560
What is this place?

53
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,560
What place?

54
00:05:49,560 --> 00:06:06,100
Anyway, for the

55
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,980
Caution

56
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,100
This is a music.

57
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:34,440
Use the videos toups tocl

58
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,440
It's a warm place.

59
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,440
I think this place is good.

60
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,440
What do you think, Xiao Ge?

61
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,440
Yes.

62
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,440
This place is a bit high.

63
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,440
Other places are fine.

64
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,440
I think we should call them down.

65
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,440
Xiao Ge.

66
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,440
When you were climbing in there,

67
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,440
did you feel anything wrong?

68
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,440
Is there a problem?

69
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,440
I don't know.

70
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,440
Maybe I have a lack of oxygen in my altitude.

71
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,440
I feel like I'm having a hallucination.

72
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,440
Actually, when we were up there,

73
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,440
before Fatty Wang fell,

74
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,440
when we were looking at the information left by the archaeological team,

75
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,440
I felt like I was having a hallucination.

76
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,440
Are you really okay?

77
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,440
I'm just too tired.

78
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,440
I'll just take a rest.

79
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,440
Don't worry.

80
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,440
Hurry and call them in.

81
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,440
If Shun Zi keeps freezing outside,

82
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,440
he'll freeze to ice.

83
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,440
Slow down, Xiao Ge.

84
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,440
Come, come, come. Sit, sit, sit.

85
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,440
What's wrong?

86
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,440
Fatty Wang has eaten again.

87
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,440
Yeah.

88
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,440
Maybe I just fell asleep

89
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,440
for a few seconds while I was climbing.

90
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,440
Then I had a dream.

91
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,440
I'm telling you, don't come down here.

92
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,440
You have to be careful.

93
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,440
But it's pretty good.

94
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,440
You had a dream and you dreamed

95
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,440
of all the places in the Cloud Sky Palace.

96
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,440
We're in the province.

97
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,440
Okay, take a rest.

98
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,440
Wait for them to come down and eat something.

99
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,440
Okay.

100
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,440
There's someone outside. Everyone, be careful.

101
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,440
Here.

102
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,440
How did it end up like this?

103
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,440
We didn't think of a way out.

104
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,440
We were going to find a way out by the road.

105
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,440
But we were so close to a cliff

106
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,440
that we almost dropped all the equipment.

107
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,440
We got snow to bury us.

108
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,440
We were lucky

109
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,440
and we were stuck on a rock.

110
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,440
We were so close to crawling out

111
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,440
but most of the equipment got wasted.

112
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,440
Did those people get away?

113
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,440
You can stay here until dawn.

114
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,440
After dawn, I'll give you the equipment.

115
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,440
It's enough for you to go down the mountain.

116
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,440
I want to talk to your boss.

117
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,940
I want to talk to Qiu De Kao.

118
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,440
Miss Ning, you can't make decisions for him.

119
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,440
But I can decide who can use my equipment and who can't.

120
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:16,440
Of course. But when Qiu De Kao finds out, he'll be very upset.

121
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,440
He can not know. A complete team disappears under the snow.

122
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:26,440
Maybe he'll be discovered in the next few years.

123
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,940
If Qiu De Kao said that, I would have been fired.

124
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,940
But you are different.

125
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,440
I was raised by Sir. I'm the same as him.

126
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,440
Here, for you.

127
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,940
Thanks.

128
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
Sir, have some water.

129
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,440
I'll drink it.

130
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,440
It's cold. I don't know if he can stand it.

131
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,440
You've done your best. It depends on his life.

132
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,940
If he dies, it's our fault.

133
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,440
He was innocent. He was dragged into it.

134
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,440
Sometimes I hate your morality.

135
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,940
Xuan Zi.

136
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,940
Take it.

137
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,440
I'll take it.

138
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,440
Xuan Zi.

139
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,440
Take it.

140
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,440
Xuan Zi, drink some water.

141
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,940
Okay?

142
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
Xuan Zi.

143
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,440
It's okay. You won't die.

144
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,940
Good. You really saved him.

145
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,940
Yes.

146
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,940
Okay.

147
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,440
It's obviously a natural city.

148
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,940
The cave is narrow.

149
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,440
Why did he draw the murals here?

150
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,940
It's strange.

151
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,440
He left the murals in such a special place.

152
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,940
He must want to pass on some information.

153
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,440
But most of the murals are about the beautiful women and the singing and dancing.

154
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
It's not reasonable.

155
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,940
The beauty is really good.

156
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,440
The future is bright.

157
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,940
But it's not real.

158
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,440
Oh my god. Can you stop pulling me?

159
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,940
Can you stop being so cruel?

160
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,440
Fatty.

161
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,940
It's not valuable, but it's a gift.

162
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,440
Don't destroy it.

163
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,940
Pervert.

164
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,440
No.

165
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,940
Look at this.

166
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,440
It's not a floor.

167
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,940
I don't think it's that simple.

168
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,440
Go.

169
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,440
In theory,

170
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,940
It's impossible to build such a cave by Losing these murals.

171
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,940
But what's the purpose of this?

172
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,940
Someone is coming again.

173
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,940
Who is it?

174
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,940
Uncle San.

175
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,940
Pan Zi!

176
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,940
Little San Ye! It's really you!

177
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,940
Pan Zi, how did you find us?

178
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,940
How can he not find us? He is the man that Uncle San likes the most.

179
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,940
I set out following the route that San Ye gave me.

180
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,940
I wanted to show you the way,

181
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,940
but I got lost.

182
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,940
I didn't expect to meet you here.

183
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,940
The route map of Uncle San?

184
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,940
Yes.

185
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,940
Why didn't I hear that Wu San Xing

186
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,940
has such a map?

187
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,940
Master Chen, even if

188
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,940
they work together, they don't

189
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,940
necessarily share the cards.

190
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,940
You should be sincere

191
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,940
to tell them the cards.

192
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,940
My master has lost his apprentice.

193
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,940
We are in a mess.

194
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,940
But you, Wu San Xing, are in the same boat.

195
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,940
I don't care about these.

196
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,940
You are the one who is talking.

197
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,940
How can I trust you?

198
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,940
Besides, there are many dangers along the way.

199
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,940
I don't believe

200
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,940
that you have the skills of Wu San Xing.

201
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,940
Master Chen, if you don't believe me,

202
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,940
I will show you

203
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,940
what a real hot spring pit is.

204
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,940
Uncle San,

205
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,940
please believe in Pan Zi.

206
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,940
He won't harm me.

207
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,940
We will go with him.

208
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,940
Thank you.

209
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,940
Uncle San, how about I show you around?

210
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,940
What's that sound?

211
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,940
I don't know.

212
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,940
Where is Shun Zi?

213
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,940
What's that sound?

214
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,940
Shun Zi!

215
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,940
Shun Zi!

216
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,940
Did you see them?

217
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,940
Yes.

218
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,940
Where are they?

219
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,940
What's going on?

220
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,940
He is in a mess.

221
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,940
Be careful.

222
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,940
Why is the fox gone?

223
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,940
What happened to Shun Zi?

224
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,940
Was he bitten by a fox?

225
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,940
Shun Zi, why are you still here?

226
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,940
Something happened here.

227
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,940
Something happened to the fox.

228
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,940
Why are you in such a hurry?

229
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,940
I have never seen this before.

230
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,940
What should we do?

231
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,940
I don't know.

232
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,940
I don't know.

233
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,940
I have never seen this before.

234
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,940
What should we do?

235
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,940
If Chen Jia Si knows, Shun Zi will be in trouble.

236
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,940
Hot spring can detoxify.

237
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,940
Are you sure?

238
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,940
The hot spring here is different from other places.

239
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,940
Okay.

240
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,940
We have to go now.

241
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,940
We can't let them wait for us.

242
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,940
It's all settled.

243
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,940
What were you doing?

244
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,940
I was just playing.

245
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,940
Mr. Chen, the hot spring is up there.

246
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,940
Let's hurry up.

247
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,940
Or we will be late.

248
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,940
This way.

249
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,940
Please.

250
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,940
Please.

251
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,940
Mr. Hua, I have found out the result.

252
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,940
That photo was taken by a few foreigners

253
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,940
in the underwater cemetery.

254
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,940
It is said that it was the underwater survey

255
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,940
organized by the Chiu De Kao.

256
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,940
Mr. San also took part in it.

257
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,940
Do you have any more detailed information?

258
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,940
I want to know what happened to them down there.

259
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,940
The Chiu De Kao's confidentiality measures are very strict.

260
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,940
If we have to investigate it,

261
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,940
I'm afraid...

262
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,940
I don't care.

263
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,940
We have to contact the hackers

264
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,940
as soon as possible through Xie's channel.

265
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,940
We have to find out the truth.

266
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,940
Slow down.

267
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,940
Follow me.

268
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,940
The real hot spring pit is

269
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,940
this place.

270
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,940
Fatty.

271
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,940
This must be the hot spring pit

272
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,940
that Shun Zi mentioned.

273
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,940
The people in the past were so smart.

274
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,940
They were so smart that they even

275
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,940
fooled the members of the team.

276
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,940
Fatty.

277
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,940
Fatty.

278
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,940
You're really persistent.

279
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,940
I'm not a bad person.

280
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,940
Show Fatty if there are two layers.

281
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,940
There are two layers?

282
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,940
Oh my god.

283
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,940
I was just saying that it's weird.

284
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,940
The style of the painting is different.

285
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,940
It's messy.

286
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,940
There must be something wrong.

287
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,940
Someone must have painted

288
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,940
another layer on top of the original painting.

289
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,940
The air contact with the outside layer

290
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,940
is too long. It naturally retreats and falls out.

291
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,940
Show the inside layer.

292
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,940
It's been a long time.

293
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,940
The inside layer also falls out.

294
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,940
But none of these are important.

295
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,940
What's important is... Fatty,

296
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,940
you have a good eye. How did you know?

297
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:06,100
This pair of

298
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,940
The upper layer

299
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,940
seems to have some unfinished work.

300
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,940
What do you mean?

301
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,940
The painting after Tang Dynasty

302
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,940
often painted a special light.

303
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,940
Just like gold, it can protect the painting.

304
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,940
The painting will not be so easy to be faded away.

305
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,940
This may be the painting before Tang Dynasty.

306
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,740
It's hot and damp in this place.

307
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,740
It also affects the preservation of the murals.

308
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,540
Why are you looking at me?

309
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,140
No. It's just that you rarely say such reasonable words.

310
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,540
I'm just trying to get some rest.

311
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,340
Don't think I don't know your hard work.

312
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,340
I can rest my soul.

313
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,140
Rest, rest.

314
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,140
The carriage on the clouds, and the clothes of these people...

315
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,540
Fatty, Little Brother, do you remember

316
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:06,140
that we've seen this kind of clothes in the mural at the bottom of the sea?

317
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,540
This is also related to the Heavenly Palace.

318
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:31,200
The

319
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:36,940
Third Brother, I heard that they've been talking about the Cloud Sky Palace.

320
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,740
Is it the right place?

321
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,540
Okay. You guys go help them.

322
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,940
Let's go.

323
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,340
Thank you, Kuan Dai.

324
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,540
Please take care of the future trip.

325
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,340
Tang Dao, take him to rest.

326
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,140
Watch our goods.

327
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,740
In case he gets fooled by someone else.

328
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,140
I know. Don't worry.

329
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,940
Sir, we got our own logistic channel.

330
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,940
Why are we collaborating with Jason et al.?

331
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,740
Ning, I have a bunch of cargo ready to send out.

332
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,940
I need a new road and a new team.

333
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:29,540
In fact, Jason's plan is quite reasonable.

334
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:32,540
Just send some to keep an eye on him.

335
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:38,140
If he plays any games, let's say they might encounter a small snow slide.

336
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,740
If he doesn't behave, don't worry.

337
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:45,940
If he cooperates, he could even take a peek at the Palace's secret.

338
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:49,340
We can talk about it when I'm there.

339
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:53,140
Sir, the weather is unpredictable at the moment.

340
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,540
It's not a good time.

341
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,740
Sir, I don't recommend you to come. It's too dangerous.

342
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:01,340
If you want to monitor the situation, I could report.

343
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,740
Or via video streaming. It's too dangerous here.

344
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,540
No, I have to see with my own eyes.

345
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:12,740
Ning, the secret of the Cloud Sky Palace is very dear to me.

346
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:17,140
It's like a long lost love of mine.

347
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,140
Nothing is unacceptable.

348
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:25,340
You have to understand the desperate yearning of a Lord Man.

349
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,540
Mrs. Wang...

350
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:51,800
Mt. Qin camp area operates in

351
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,640
Address L Please stay tearful and stay safe.

352
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,840
Look.

353
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:04,540
It's quite possible that this also may be the käori battle.

354
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,840
It would be a war.

355
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,840
Phichi Pagode

356
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,740
Look.

357
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,740
These people wearing education Inner прокu use Mongolian campers

358
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,340
and Mongolians have much greater memorial power than debenture campers

359
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,340
This is a war of oppression.

360
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,340
East and West countries use female soldiers.

361
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,340
Isn't the country natural?

362
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,340
I just praised you, and you exposed your ignorance.

363
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,340
Look.

364
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,340
The faces of these East and West countries are so beautiful.

365
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,340
Actually, this is very special.

366
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,340
According to the records on the史,

367
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,340
everyone who had dealt with the East and West countries said

368
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,340
that this country didn't have an old person.

369
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,340
And later, the records of the North Koreans

370
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,340
said that even after death,

371
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,340
the people of this country still have youthful looks.

372
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,340
Isn't it strange?

373
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,340
Could it be that the people of this country

374
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,340
can live a long life?

375
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,340
This painting is described in two parts.

376
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,340
But when combined, it is very complete.

377
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,340
It's simply...

378
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,340
It's simply beautiful.

379
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,340
Look.

380
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,340
The war described here is very fierce.

381
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,340
It's divided into three.

382
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,340
But in the end, there are too few people.

383
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,340
They were all shot by the Mongolians.

384
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,340
The war ended up as a slaughter.

385
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,340
Brother Hua is really cultured.

386
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,340
We don't understand what you're saying.

387
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,340
It's all nonsense, right, Yan Zhen?

388
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,340
It's just a false claim.

389
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,340
Don't be ridiculous.

390
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,340
I'm interested in this history.

391
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,340
You know the history of the North.

392
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,340
The books we read are different.

393
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,340
So what?

394
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,340
What else do you want to say?

395
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,340
Tell us about the East and West countries.

396
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,340
This...

397
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,340
The East and West countries

398
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,340
were the time when the female soldiers were destroyed.

399
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,340
In the era of Jilin and Heilongjiang,

400
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,340
a new regime was suddenly established.

401
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,340
According to historical records,

402
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,340
they actually have a relationship with the female soldiers.

403
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,340
Even if it's a text, they use the same kind.

404
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,340
They were attacked by the Japanese.

405
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,340
They were killed.

406
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,340
In the whole history,

407
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,340
they only existed for 70 years.

408
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,340
So some historians thought

409
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,340
they were a big tribe.

410
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,340
Because of their population, politics, and territory,

411
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,340
they couldn't reach the country's level.

412
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,340
Grandpa Si.

413
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,340
Didn't you say that we were going to find

414
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,340
a tomb of the East and West Emperor?

415
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,340
But the East and West countries only existed for 70 years.

416
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,340
They didn't have a lot of people.

417
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,340
And from the murals,

418
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,340
their clothing and buildings

419
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,340
were not very productive.

420
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,340
How could they be able to build such a tomb?

421
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,340
Even if they were able, they wouldn't have time.

422
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,340
Yes.

423
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,340
The tomb of the ancients is of different levels.

424
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,340
How big is the tomb you're talking about?

425
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,340
I heard you say

426
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,340
the clothes of the East and West people.

427
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,340
Have you seen it in other murals?

428
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,340
The murals describe a group of women

429
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,340
wearing such clothes and burying them in the snow mountain.

430
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,340
The end is a palace

431
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,340
in the clouds.

432
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,340
Have you ever thought

433
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,340
if the so-called Cloud Sky Palace

434
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,340
would be the same as the tomb of the East and West?

435
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,340
We considered this possibility.

436
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,340
But didn't Brother Hua also say

437
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,340
that the tomb of the East and West people

438
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,340
is in the early days of Yuan Dynasty?

439
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,340
And the Cloud Sky Palace is the masterpiece of Wang Zang Hai.

440
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,340
It's been a few decades

441
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,340
or even hundreds of years.

442
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,340
You're right.

443
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,340
I've looked into the information.

444
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,340
From the records,

445
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,340
I found some clues.

446
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,340
Actually, the East and West people didn't completely disappear.

447
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,340
It's very likely that

448
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,340
they have some of the remaining parts

449
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,340
and entered the deep mountains.

450
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,340
I've researched the Gaolizhi.

451
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,340
I also found some North Korean people

452
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,340
wearing strange clothes in the mountains.

453
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,340
I believe

454
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,340
they are the people who didn't disappear.

455
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,340
Yes.

456
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,340
And

457
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,340
we have more direct information

458
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,340
to prove it.

459
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,340
The Snake Eye.

460
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,340
What is this?

461
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,340
Take it out and have a look.

462
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,340
Is this real?

463
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,340
Is this real?

464
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,340
The ghost is here.

465
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,340
The ghost is here.

466
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,340
The ghost is here.

467
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,340
The ghost is here.

468
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,340
The ghost is here.

469
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,340
Kuang Xin and the second grandpa's ghost

470
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,340
are really with him.

471
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,340
Give it to the fourth grandpa

472
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,340
so he doesn't hurt him.

473
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,340
This kind of copper fish

474
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,340
is a type of dragon.

475
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,340
It was given to us by chance.

476
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,340
I believe the people who made this

477
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,340
must know a lot about the east and west

478
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,340
and it's even more strange.

479
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,340
Through this copper fish

480
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,340
there is a secret.

481
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,340
Third grandpa

482
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,340
Look.

483
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,340
The secret is in the copper fish's scales.

484
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,340
There are 47 female characters hidden in it.

485
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,340
It's amazing.

486
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,340
Ancient people have such strange thoughts

487
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,340
and such memories.

488
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,340
When I first saw it

489
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,340
I almost lost my chin.

490
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,340
What is written on it?

491
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,340
The data is not complete.

492
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,340
I can't decipher it.

493
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,340
But I firmly believe that the people who made this copper fish

494
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,340
wanted to record the secrets of the East and West.

495
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,340
What is written on it is

496
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,340
that after the East and West war

497
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,340
some people retreated

498
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,340
to the border of the Jilin and North Korea.

499
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,340
They lived there for a long time.

500
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,340
If I can find the data

501
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,340
I can reveal the truth of this history.

502
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,340
Fourth grandpa

503
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,340
Until some time ago

504
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,340
I only knew

505
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,340
that Xie Yuhua

506
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,340
also had a snake and copper fish.

507
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,340
I had already got it.

508
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,340
But your third uncle took it.

509
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,340
Fourth grandpa, you are so generous.

510
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,340
Such a precious thing.

511
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,340
You gave it away.

512
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,340
Your third uncle used two ancient tombstones

513
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,340
as a exchange.

514
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,340
And he promised me

515
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,340
that after the information of the copper fish is revealed

516
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,340
he would give it to me.

517
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,340
I don't think I'm at fault.

518
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,340
But now there is no more information.

519
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,340
I can't find it.

520
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,340
Third uncle sent you to find the Cloud Sky Palace.

521
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,340
I think he has already

522
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,340
revealed the information of the copper fish.

523
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,340
Fourth grandpa

524
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,340
I came out to find the copper fish.

525
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,340
I didn't exclude you.

526
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,340
Yes.

527
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,340
It means he didn't want to hide anything from you.

528
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,340
And we are in an accident.

529
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,340
There is a gap in the middle.

530
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,340
We can only rely on ourselves.

531
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,340
Yes.

532
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,340
Besides, if you didn't tell me

533
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,340
what connection the Cloud Sky Palace has with the Eastern Xia Kingdom

534
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,340
we wouldn't know.

535
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,340
Yes.

536
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,340
Wu Sanxing

537
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,340
Wu Sanxing

538
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,340
loves to play the secret.

539
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,340
This time

540
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,340
he is not playing it off.

541
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,340
He put your seed in.

542
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,340
Yes.

543
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,340
My third uncle didn't

544
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,340
cheat me once or twice.

545
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,340
If it wasn't for my third uncle

546
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,340
I would have turned against him.

547
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,340
Yes.

548
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,340
He cheated me too.

549
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,340
Let's get out of here.

550
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,340
Let's find the clues about the Cloud Sky Palace.

551
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,340
Let's go.

552
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,340
Your majesty.

553
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,340
Do you think

554
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,340
behind this crack

555
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,340
is...

556
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,340
What if I blow it up?

557
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,340
Why do you want to blow it up everywhere?

558
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,340
You really don't care about your name?

559
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,340
Do you want to blow this crack up?

560
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,340
Yes. I don't want it.

561
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,340
Why?

562
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,340
Do you know why it's called the God of Fire?

563
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,340
I tell you.

564
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,340
In the past, if there was a place where you couldn't go

565
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,340
you would blow it up.

566
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,340
The amount of gunpowder is not bad at all.

567
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,340
Let's be low-key.

568
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,340
That's great.

569
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,340
Then our future winnings

570
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,340
may be bigger.

571
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,340
But I mean there is no way behind this crack.

572
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,340
Why?

573
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,340
This is a natural ice-cold solid structure.

574
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,340
It's covered by a lot of blood.

575
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,340
There is no hole

576
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,340
or extra space behind this crack.

577
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,340
According to the thickness of the solid here

578
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,340
and the flow of air

579
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,340
there is no hole behind this crack.

580
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,340
Good job, Wu Xie.

581
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,340
How did you get this knowledge?

582
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,340
I studied architecture in college.

583
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,340
Why are you guys blocking the wall?

584
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,340
If you can't do anything, let's go back.

585
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,340
It's meaningless to stay here.

586
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,340
Really.

587
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,340
I'm afraid there is something behind.

588
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,340
Why are you here?

589
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,340
Shun Zi, are you feeling better?

590
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,340
Much better.

591
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,340
I think it's the effect of the snow mountain hot spring.

592
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,340
I woke up and saw you guys were not here.

593
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,340
So I came out to take a walk.

594
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,340
I was afraid you guys would be in danger.

595
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,340
That's great. How did you know about this place?

596
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,340
This is the hot spring I mentioned before.

597
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,340
Very few people know about it.

598
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,340
My father told me.

599
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,340
Come here.

600
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,340
Come here.

601
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,340
Look. We found it in the hot spring pit.

602
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,340
Let's see if it's the archaeological team your father brought.

603
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,340
Zhao Yuzheng?

604
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,340
I don't remember.

605
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,340
They came to the mountain a long time ago.

606
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,340
Shun Zi, did your father tell you

607
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,340
where the archaeological team is?

608
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,340
No. I was young at that time.

609
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,340
He wouldn't tell me that.

610
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,340
Aren't you guys from the mountain?

611
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,340
Shun Zi,

612
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,340
since we are here,

613
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,340
you should know

614
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,340
what to say and what not to say.

615
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,340
Okay. Let's clean up

616
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,340
and go back.

617
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,340
Let's go. Don't be busy.

618
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,340
Shun Zi!

619
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,340
Shun Zi!

620
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,340
Don't you want to know the reason?

621
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,340
Open his palm.

622
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,340
Let's see what it is.

623
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,340
Tong Yu?

624
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,340
Get up!

625
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,340
Don't be rash!

626
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,340
Ask him first.

627
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,340
What's wrong with Shun Zi?

628
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,340
Mr. Sa, this...

629
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,340
He's unconscious now.

630
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,340
He was temporarily held by Wen Quan.

631
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,340
Now the poison in his body

632
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,340
has infected his nerves.

633
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,340
We can only watch him from now on.

634
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,340
Why is that?

635
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,340
After he was bitten by a fox,

636
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,340
he couldn't clean his wound in time.

637
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,340
The poison entered his nerves

638
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,340
and caused the central nervous system to be disturbed.

639
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,340
So,

640
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,340
he took the blame for me.

641
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,340
Mr. Sa,

642
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,340
he didn't mean that.

643
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,340
He said Shun Zi was unconscious

644
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,340
and took your snake sister Tong Yu.

645
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,340
It's okay as long as you get rid of the poison.

646
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,340
Shun Zi!

647
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,340
Tell me,

648
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,340
what happened just now?

649
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,340
I don't know.

650
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,340
I only know

651
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,340
that the poison was very attractive.

652
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,340
Then,

653
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,340
I wanted to take it.

654
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,340
I don't know what happened after that.

655
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,340
Fine!

656
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,340
You're not even in your right mind.

657
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,340
You're a thunderbolt.

658
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,340
I told you not to waste resources on those useless people.

659
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,340
You can't say that.

660
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,340
If you don't have him,

661
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,340
we can't get here safely.

662
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,340
He's just poisoned.

663
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,340
He's fine with the hot spring.

664
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,340
Who knows how long he'll be fine?

665
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,340
Do we have that much time to waste?

666
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,340
Two days.

667
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,340
He's not poisoned.

668
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,340
At most, two days.

669
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,340
How do you know?

670
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,340
I feel like

671
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,340
you're familiar with this place.

672
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,340
I knew it.

673
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,340
If it happens again,

674
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,340
your reputation will be ruined.

675
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,340
Are you okay?

676
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,340
Are you okay?

677
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,340
The last sentence of the

678
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,620
female

679
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,620
is very interesting.

680
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,620
What is it?

681
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,620
Actually, the last sentence

682
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,620
is not very clear.

683
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,620
It's because the data is incomplete.

684
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,620
If I can find the last part,

685
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,620
I can break it out.

686
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,620
We're from the same generation.

687
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,520
If someone When it's changed,

688
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,520
we'll understand.

689
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,520
Do you know howEZhi Doctor's Bloody Meat glance it?

690
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,480
In fact, I've been thinking

691
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:57,480
why people who can draw

692
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,960
offers call

693
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,960
and move to the cemetery.

694
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,960
Or,

695
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,960
they are really just too lazy to do anything.

696
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,960
Do you know?

697
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,960
We are just too lazy to do anything.

698
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,960
Really.

699
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,960
Why do we have to guess the painting?

700
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,960
Does it make any sense?

701
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,960
Unless you find the painter,

702
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,960
he doesn't even know why he's painting here.

703
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,960
Do you know?

704
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,960
You have a lot of talent.

705
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,960
No.

706
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,960
With you,

707
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,960
you can always think of those

708
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,960
very complicated things

709
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,960
extremely simple.

710
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,960
You will never get a job in your life.

711
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,960
Thank you.

712
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,960
Stop talking nonsense.

713
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,960
Let's go back to the pit and have a rest.

714
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,960
Right.

715
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,960
I'm so tired.

716
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,960
Sir.

717
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,960
Come.

718
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,960
Shun Zi.

719
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,960
You go back first.

720
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,960
I'll put Shun Zi in the hot spring

721
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,960
and detoxify him.
