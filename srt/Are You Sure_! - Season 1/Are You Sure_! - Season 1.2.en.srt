Are we sure?!

1241
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,180
I can't believe it's raining so much.

1242
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,390
Are we sure about this?!

1243
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:05,685

01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:11,649
It went mute.

Seriously…

1248
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:15,778
[Jimin] This is more comfortable.

1249
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:19,866
I don't think there's been a day
where I didn't get wet.

1250
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,160
I want to show this on camera.

1251
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:24,203
You can turn it forward.

1253
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:30,084
[Jung Kook] Does it show?

1254
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:33,171
[Jimin]
No. The weather looks clearer on camera.

1255
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:36,007
It's raining so much.

1256
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:37,592
The sound is insane.

1257
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:41,971
I think our audio would get mixed up
with the rain sound.

1258
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:43,556

Speak louder.

1259

-It's delicious.
-Yes, this is my favorite.

1277
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,280
It's definitely

1278
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,950
more delicious because our ARMY made it.

1279
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:46,869

I'm only drinking water.

-[Jimin] Yes.

Thank you.

01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,733
-It's our last time in this car.
-That's too bad.

[Jung Kook] Say goodbye to it.
What's its name?

1289
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:20,319
Well, my car's name is Ppongdaengi,

01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:46,262
I'll have to starve myself from tomorrow.

1301
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:48,639
Don't do that.
You should eat at least once a day.

1302
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:50,224
Eat chicken breasts or something.

1303
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:51,434
Once a day is enough.

1304
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:54,020
I'm getting rid of all sugar and carbs.

1305
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,231
It's fine to eat once a day
if you work out.

1306
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:58,524
-[Jung Kook] That's true.
-Is that too much?

1307
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,443
Yes, too much workout
might mess with my throat.

1308
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:04,822
That was great.
I can see why you wanted to ride it.

1309
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:07,450
-The motorcycle?
-Yes, I liked it.

1310
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:08,868
Feeling the breeze was great.

1311
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:12,455
It'd be nice and safe riding here
where there's less traffic.

1312
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:13,915
No rain would've been better.

I'm right. It's very close.

[Jung Kook] It is.
And it's our final stop.

1319
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:27,512
[Jimin] Right.

1320
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,097
We'll have to enjoy it to the fullest.

[Jung Kook] What are they eating?

1347

It kind of looks like
the short rib grilled cheese.

1348
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:31,158
It's not a sandwich.

1349
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:32,493
Is it like a salad?

I could go for that.

like you from earlier.

1410
01:07:31,922 --> 01:07:33,090
[laughs]

1411
01:07:38,095 --> 01:07:40,097
[laughs]

1412
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:45,102
[both exclaim]

1413
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:47,021
[Jung Kook exclaims]

1414
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:52,777
-[Jimin in English] Oh. Oh, thank you.
-[waiter] You're welcome.

1415
01:07:53,652 --> 01:07:54,653
[in Korean] Let's dig in.

1416
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,155
-[waiter in English] Enjoy.
-Thank you.

1417
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:58,199
[both exclaim]

1418
01:07:58,282 --> 01:08:00,076
[in Korean] This is it.
This one. This one.

1419
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:02,078
[Jung Kook] This is the Korean beef taco,

1420
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:04,330
the lobster mac and cheese,

1421
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:07,208
and the lobster sandwich.

1422
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:08,584
-[Jimin] The lobster salad…
-[Jung Kook] Wow.

1423
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:10,586
…roll.

1424
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:13,005
[hissing]

1425
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:18,219
"An excited Jung Kook's wild camerawork"

1426
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:20,179
[Jung Kook chuckles]

1427
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:23,099
-Perfect.
-Can we eat now?

1428
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:24,850
-[Jung Kook] Let's eat.
-Okay.

1429
01:08:25,559 --> 01:08:26,602
[amazed exclaim]

1430
01:08:27,311 --> 01:08:28,521
[amazed exclaim]

1431
01:08:29,313 --> 01:08:30,773
This looks delicious. My goodness.

1432
01:08:30,856 --> 01:08:32,525
[Jung Kook] The cheese. Oh, yes.

1433
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:35,528
[satisfied hum]

1434
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:39,949
[whistles]

1435
01:08:42,034 --> 01:08:43,035
[Jung Kook] It's so good.

1436
01:08:45,579 --> 01:08:46,872
This was made for me.

1437
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,543
This is amazing.

1438
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,338
We have to eat this now.

1439
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:56,507
[Jung Kook] We should try it.

1440
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:58,050
"Next is the lobster salad roll"

1441
01:08:58,634 --> 01:08:59,718
[Jimin] I'll hold it.

1442
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:05,766
[exclaims]

1443
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:09,520
[Jimin] There's this too.

1444
01:09:11,897 --> 01:09:13,941
-It's good.
-[Jimin] Is it?

1445
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:22,741
This is

1446
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:25,286
Super delicious

1447
01:09:25,369 --> 01:09:26,453
Oh, wow.

1448
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:28,706
[Jimin] This is amazing.

1449
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:45,848
[amazed hum]

1450
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:52,771
Cheers to how delicious they are

1451
01:09:56,775 --> 01:09:57,985
[exhales sharply]

1452
01:10:02,823 --> 01:10:06,243
Alert

1453
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:08,537
[Jung Kook] That was great.

1454
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:10,414
[Jimin] Wow, this was delicious.

1455
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:11,707
[Jung Kook] I'm so happy.

1456
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:15,961
We'll come back with a new season.

1457
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:17,504
We've eaten a lot.

1458
01:10:17,588 --> 01:10:19,381
We've eaten a lot and gotten sick a lot.

1459
01:10:19,465 --> 01:10:20,507
See you again.

1460
01:10:20,591 --> 01:10:21,592
[sighs]

1461
01:10:21,675 --> 01:10:23,093
[both] Are you sure?!

1462
01:10:24,678 --> 01:10:25,721
[chuckles]

1463
01:10:27,264 --> 01:10:30,100
We started this
because we just wanted to do it,

1464
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:31,644
and now it's actually started.

1465
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:33,812
I don't know how many times we'll do this,

1466
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:36,815
but I hope we can travel a lot
so we can show you

1467
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:39,193
a lot of our traveling adventures.

1468
01:10:39,276 --> 01:10:41,654
How many more should we do?

1469
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:43,906
-I'm thinking at least season 12.
-Season 12?

1470
01:10:43,989 --> 01:10:46,367
Let's practice being better entertainers

1471
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:48,953
so the two of us can continue doing this.

1472
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:50,746
-Even after our military services?
-Yeah.

1473
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:53,499
Until we turn 50.

1474
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:55,209
[in elderly voice] Oh, Mr. Jung Kook.

1475
01:10:55,292 --> 01:10:57,044
Slow down.

1476
01:10:57,795 --> 01:11:00,089
[in normal voice] Let's become
world-renowned entertainers.

1477
01:11:00,172 --> 01:11:01,632
"We shall continue until they become
world-renowned entertainers"

1478
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:06,053
Hello, everyone, this is Jimin.
[breathes deeply]

1479
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:07,388
There was

1480
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:11,100
a ramyeon I really wanted to eat
during this trip.

1481
01:11:11,558 --> 01:11:13,852
Tomorrow…

1482
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:17,898
I'll be going on a plane to Korea.

1483
01:11:18,315 --> 01:11:19,900
I could've just eaten this there,

1484
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:22,236
so I actually don't understand
why I'm eating it now.

1485
01:11:23,153 --> 01:11:24,488
But I was really craving this.

1486
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:30,452
Thanks for following us along
on this trip.

1487
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:35,457
"A ramyeon to reward myself
after a tough few days"

1488
01:11:37,334 --> 01:11:38,460
[exclaims]

1489
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:49,638
"Finished it in just a couple of bites"

1490
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:50,723
Wow, I finished it.

1491
01:11:51,932 --> 01:11:53,475
I'm puffy already.

1492
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:56,520
My nose is still swollen.

1493
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:58,647
That was a fun trip.

1494
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:02,067
I'll have a safe ride back home.

1495
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:03,485
Best of luck to Jung Kook's Seven.

1496
01:12:03,777 --> 01:12:04,778
Are You Sure?!

1497
