1
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:18,810
Are You Sure?!

2
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:33,867
Yeah.

3
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,535
What's this?

4
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,746
It's currently…

5
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,831
What time is it?

6
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,834
It's 9:41 a.m.

7
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,253
It'll be 10 soon.

8
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:49,966
It's a bit overcast right now.

9
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,094
Is it going to rain?

10
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:54,721
I'm not sure

11
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,975
if this is season two of Are You Sure?!
or if it's still the first season.

12
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,269
Either way, we've arrived in Jeju Island.

13
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,730
It'd be nice if we could go to Jeju Island

14
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,940
for our next trip.

15
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:08,526
-Jeju Island?
-We can go there

16
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,653
and have mackerel ssambap.

17
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,113
You like mackerel, right?

18
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,698
I like grilled mackerel, yes.

19
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,117
Mackerel ssambap is good.
We should have that

20
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:17,702
and go for a drive.

21
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,621
- Sounds good.
- And play some card games.

22
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,998
I hope you get a stomach bug again.

23
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:31,049
Are You Sure?!
In Jeju Island

24
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,843
What are we doing today?

25
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,887
A special guest is here.

26
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,431
We'll introduce him when we get off.

27
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,559
Or maybe he won't get out of the car.

28
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,563
There's a BTS group chat
for sharing our schedules

29
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,981
and I saw "Flight to Jeju Island"

30
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,818
two days before the flight.

31
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:53,404
So I said, "Why am I being left out?
I'm going too." And so I came.

32
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,365
He was very adamant.

33
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,327
So am I your first guest ever?

34
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,789
The first and probably the last.

35
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,712
The youngest members' Jeju trip
Let's Go

36
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:11,923
Hey.

37
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,635
You want me to hold it?

38
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:16,928
Here.

39
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,182
"A special performance for the guest"

40
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:25,979
Is this it?

41
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,856
- Oh, it's…
- This car is adorable.

42
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:28,940
Damn!

43
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,151
Let's go!

44
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,322
Do you have your seatbelts on?

45
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,199
-Yes. We have them on.
-I'll be your driver today.

46
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,284
Let's do this.

47
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,124
Let's have ourselves a fun drive.

48
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,292
Okay.

49
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,461
This car is tiny.

50
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,796
♪ Get out of our way ♪

51
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,548
It's like my old car.

52
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,551
It does remind me of that.

53
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,094
-The size, right?
-Yeah.

54
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,013
Was it bigger than this?

55
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,890
-It was.
-A lot bigger.

56
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,519
It's overcast, but it's still nice out.

57
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,438
Right, it's nice and cool.

58
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,691
Yes, it's actually better
since it's the summer.

59
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,027
This is nice.

60
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,989
We're on vacation

61
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,658
-so let's turn on some exciting music.
-Okay.

62
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,493
I'll do it since you're driving.

63
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,468
What game do you want to play
at the meet and greet?

64
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,055
Have you thought of one?

65
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:47,727
Immersed in the music

66
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,530
We're here already.

67
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,618
Oh, man. I don't think I can eat.

68
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,161
What?

69
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,746
I'll throw up if I eat.

70
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,791
Jimin's stomach is a bit upset

71
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:13,878
Wait.

72
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,632
- But V isn't good at parking.
- I've been here before.

73
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,676
- I've parked already.
- You have?

74
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:25,556
All right.

75
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,476
Mackerel Ssambap Restaurant

76
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,270
- I'm telling you.
- Go inside.

77
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,480
I've been to this place before.

78
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:34,857
That's crazy.

79
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,277
Come on, hurry up.

80
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,071
V and Jung Kook enter first

81
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:43,491
I can't believe they just abandoned me.

82
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,122
Pretending to be okay

83
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,332
Is this our view as we eat?

84
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,750
This is great.

85
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,711
- Wow.
- We just have to

86
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,337
order now, right?

87
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,756
-Do you have your wallet?
-My wallet?

88
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,924
I have a corporate card.

89
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,927
Corporate card, let's go.

90
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,143
I like the sea.

91
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,978
People ask me,

92
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:15,648
"Didn't you see the ocean
every day in Busan?"

93
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,735
But there are actually
a lot of mountains in Busan too.

94
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,362
I grew up right under a mountain in Busan

95
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,491
and I've only been to the seaside twice

96
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,161
up until high school.

97
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:30,997
That's why I like the sea.

98
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,000
Did you order, Jung Kook?

99
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,210
Yeah, the pork cutlet and…

100
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,379
The grilled hairtail fish looks good too.

101
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,589
I didn't order that yet.

102
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:43,593
Just the pork cutlet
and three portions of braised kimchi.

103
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:48,139
What about the grilled mackerel
and hairtail fish?

104
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,266
Do you want the mackerel?
Let's choose one.

105
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,517
Choose the one you want.

106
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,437
The braised kimchi has mackerel in it.

107
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,439
-Then hairtail fish.
-Hairtail fish? Okay.

108
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,232
This view is beautiful.

109
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,028
- Wow.
- It's insane.

110
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,738
-It's insane.
-Is Jimin not coming?

111
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,198
- He's behind us.
- Hello.

112
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,616
- Hello.
- Hello.

113
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,201
-Hello.
-You look cute.

114
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:09,952
I'm cute, right?

115
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,793
Oh, hello!

116
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,461
What's that?

117
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,841
"Jung Kook is excited to see the drone"

118
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,051
Are you sure?!

119
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,886
Oh, that's from You Quiz on the Block.

120
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,596
This place is beautiful.

121
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,016
You see that splashing thing over there?

122
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,434
You think it's a fish or not?

123
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,395
-It's not.
-So it's from waves?

124
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,063
No, not that either.

125
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,315
I told them not to do that.

126
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,363
That's a friend of mine

127
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,949
who lives at that blue house over there.

128
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,412
-I shouldn't have come.
-Why?

129
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,580
-Go back then.
-We always do this

130
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,707
-even without the cameras.
-Go back to Seoul then.

131
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,459
-Why did you come?
-No, it's still fun.

132
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,336
I can't believe you said that.

133
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,796
This is our trip.

134
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,424
You should go join them and swim.

135
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,510
Yeah, join them. No, not like that.

136
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,768
You might end up with a stomach bug too.

137
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,437
- What?
- And get smacked in the nose.

138
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,314
You might get a stomach bug
and get smacked in the nose

139
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,899
while sleeping next to Jung Kook.

140
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,484
Really? Why?

141
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,403
That happened to me.

142
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,616
He got smacked in the nose

143
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,368
You should take some medicine.

144
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,995
"And even got a stomach bug"

145
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,998
I really hope
nothing bad happens this time.

146
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:40,126
Bittersweet…

147
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,252
- Hello.
- Hello.

148
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,670
Hello.

149
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,088
- Yes.
- That looks good.

150
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,424
Here's the braised kimchi.
Should I put it in the middle?

151
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,676
- Yes, please.
- Wow.

152
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,095
That looks good.
There's mackerel in it, right?

153
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,388
That's right.

154
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,682
- Wow.
- Wow.

155
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:55,892
This is what I'm talking about.

156
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,226
Let's take some insert shots.

157
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,106
This looks amazing.

158
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,486
I'm filming you filming that.

159
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,323
I can't wait to try it. Let's dig in!

160
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,034
Wow.

161
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,577
- You can put it down here.
- Okay.

162
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,872
This looks insanely good.

163
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,874
Do you want me to take the bones out?

164
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:21,501
Yeah, can you?

165
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,045
- Goodness. Should I do it for V?
- No.

166
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,796
He knows how to do it, but he's just lazy.

167
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,424
- Enjoy your meal.
- Oh, really? Then I won't do it.

168
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,592
No, no, no, no, no.

169
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,760
-I don't know how.
-No, I won't do it.

170
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,053
- I won't do it.
- Do it for me.

171
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,722
Come on, do it for me. How do you do this?

172
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,433
- All right, let me show you.
- Okay.

173
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,227
There are bones

174
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,604
- on the side like this.
- Okay.

175
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,273
It's important to take these out.

176
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,317
- Yes.
- I'll take them out for you.

177
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,112
Actually,

178
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,156
- you shouldn't take out the fillet.
- Right.

179
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,491
But that's what I'm doing right now.

180
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,326
I know.
Why did you take so much fillet out?

181
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,994
Just leave.

182
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,455
-Go.
-It's pretty hard to take them out.

183
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,748
Why are they all mushed?

184
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:01,832
Take this.

185
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,921
I guess the way chefs do this
is harder than I thought.

186
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,173
They're really good at it.

187
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,050
Everyone, let's smile as we eat.

188
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,593
Smile and say hi.

189
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,974
They officially begin feasting

190
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,313
Wow.

191
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,830
It's so good.

192
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,593
Meanwhile, one person
is feeling sentimental

193
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,973
It's so nice seeing the ocean
for the first time

194
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,558
- in a while.
- I know.

195
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,393
This view is amazing.

196
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,287
The other two only see their food

197
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,248
We're in Aewol. Do you guys know Aewol?

198
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,585
What? What?

199
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,670
- We're in Aewol right now.
- Okay.

200
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,839
Do you guys know anything about Aewol?

201
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,884
-You don't know.
-Aewol?

202
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,554
There are a lot of vacation homes here.

203
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,021
Thanks for the information.

204
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,274
Chuckling

205
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,484
Right, I almost forgot.

206
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,527
It's Chuseok right after we land in Korea.

207
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,072
This is ssambap
but I forgot about the ssam.

208
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,075
Wow, this is insane.

209
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,118
Look at that.

210
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:06,374
Chomp

211
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:13,798
- Are you finished?
- Yeah.

212
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:14,882
No.

213
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,842
- You should eat more.
- I'm fine.

214
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:20,137
We have to go feast on more new memories.

215
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,306
How do we feast on them?

216
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,058
What will we be eating?

217
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,895
- Are you finished?
- Wow, yeah.

218
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,022
Let me make a ssam for my friend.

219
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,941
That was delicious.

220
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,275
"Very full"

221
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,360
I'm so happy now.

222
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:38,197
I have to put rice in here
with the grilled mackerel.

223
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,865
- Like this.
- That was so good.

224
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:40,991
With some rice.

225
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,493
Wrap it.

226
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,453
That was delicious.

227
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,247
What?

228
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,666
Thank you for the meal.

229
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,668
What?

230
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,545
I made a ssam and he just left.

231
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,383
-Film me. Film me now.
-What?

232
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,886
Eat your ssam.

233
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,097
Eat your ssam.

234
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,291
Eat your ssam!

235
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,009
I don't have shoes on.
I can't go that far.

236
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,678
Wait, you don't even have shoes on.

237
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,597
- Hurry up and eat this.
- Seriously?

238
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,931
Eat it!

239
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,935
What are you doing without your shoes?

240
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,566
I did it.

241
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,109
"A barefoot spirit"

242
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,778
My feet are burning.

243
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,202
That was great.

244
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,537
That was insanely delicious.

245
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:10,956
Okay.

246
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,708
We've got our teaser.

247
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,629
-He's asking where you put his shoes.
-Over there.

248
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,547
Get over here with my shoes.

249
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,799
They're over here.

250
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,593
Why did you bring them in here?

251
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,553
My feet are burning.

252
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,805
I made him eat it.

253
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:29,266
What? The ssam? Jeez.

254
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,478
Jimin never knows how to give up.

255
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,647
That made me so happy.

256
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,856
It was good, right?

257
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:38,984
Thank you for the meal!

258
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,611
- Thank you for the meal.
- Thank you.

259
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:43,531
- Thank you for the meal.
- Hope your restaurant thrives!

260
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,783
Okay, okay. Let's go!

261
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,201
Let's go!

262
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,370
To our next destination.

263
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,957
We're heading to our lodging.

264
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,315
The breeze feels nice.

265
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,401
Are you okay out there?

266
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,152
I'm all good.

267
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,237
Is it breezy?

268
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,030
- Yes.
- Great.

269
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,574
Be careful driving.

270
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,992
- Okay.
- Safety comes first.

271
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,035
Always watch your surroundings.

272
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,037
- Got it.
- Okay.

273
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,030
You both look very excited from behind.

274
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,566
Glancing

275
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,113
Shout out to j-hope!

276
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,157
- Hang on.
- Let's go!

277
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,576
You turned this on just to do that?

278
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,578
-I'm sorry.
-You don't even know the lyrics.

279
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,663
You don't know anything.

280
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,581
Sorry, I'm not good with lyrics.

281
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,999
That's all you can do?

282
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,919
-I'm good with choreography, not lyrics.
-Okay, I understand.

283
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:06,423
"Just enjoy the moment"

284
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:14,264
An energetic start to the trip

285
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:21,355
It feels great being on Jeju Island.

286
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,273
I feel so liberated.

287
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,402
Did you need some rest?

288
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,113
Not exactly.

289
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,073
But I just really wanted to travel.

290
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,324
-Really?
-Yeah.

291
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,962
It'd be nice if we could get off here
and take some pictures.

292
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,548
There's a couple taking photos.

293
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,717
Let's take some pictures later.

294
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:51,802
Couple shots?

295
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:55,389
No. Are you crazy?

296
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,017
There's a drive-thru.

297
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,020
Americano for me. I need coffee badly.

298
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,109
What do you want, Jung Kook?

299
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,153
- Me?
- Yeah.

300
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,032
- I want… Iced Americano.
- I don't know how to do this.

301
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,159
-You don't have to get off.
-What?

302
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,077
Just roll the window down.

303
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,662
- Iced Americano.
- Roll it down.

304
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,247
Hello.

305
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,875
- Yes, may I take your order?
- Oh, what?

306
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,210
-Iced…
-Two iced Americanos.

307
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,670
Say, "Two iced Americanos."

308
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,881
Two iced Americanos, please.

309
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:32,051
Two iced Americanos.
In what size?

310
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,427
Large, regular, or small.

311
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,596
Regular, please.

312
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,182
Two regular iced Americanos.

313
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,892
"Dazed"

314
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,394
And one caramel IB too.

315
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,855
One caramel ice-blended.
Also in a regular size?

316
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,608
-Yes.
-Would you like whipped cream?

317
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:48,942
-Yes.
-Okay.

318
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,070
You're just saying yes, aren't you?

319
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,946
Yes.

320
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,031
Yes.

321
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,034
-What was that? What now?
-Drive forward.

322
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,495
You've never been to a drive-thru before?

323
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,746
No, I don't know how to do it.

324
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,332
Okay, now give them the card.

325
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,293
This is where you pay.

326
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,879
-Okay.
-Yes, roll the window down.

327
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,881
- Hello.
- Hello.

328
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,007
- Hello!
- They'll be right out.

329
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,550
-Okay.
-Jung Kook.

330
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:18,013
Shouldn't you drink this first
since you have to drive the motorcycle?

331
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,349
I just need like three sips.

332
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,560
Should we stop by the beach here
and drink before we go?

333
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,063
I'm fine.

334
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,941
I'm not. You should drink this first.

335
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,611
-Just admit you want to drink first.
-I can drink sitting here.

336
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,196
If we can stop somewhere, let's stop.

337
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,448
-Let's do that.
-We'll stop if we find a nice spot.

338
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,825
- Okay.
- Let's just go and see.

339
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,202
All right.
Should we hold onto yours, then?

340
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,496
- Yeah.
- Got it.

341
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,081
Thanks.

342
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,771
The sea looks beautiful.

343
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,152
It would've been nice
if the other members were here too.

344
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,614
j-hope would've loved this.

345
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,242
I miss him.

346
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,456
This feels great.

347
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,316
Villa

348
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,903
We've arrived at our lodging.

349
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,487
Let me show you.

350
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,822
Here it is.

351
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,365
"Go-to BGM when revealing a place"

352
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,367
That song's too old now.

353
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,328
Sing something else.

354
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,046
A fiery stare through the window

355
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,339
Oh, hello.

356
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,883
It wasn't us.

357
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,718
We're just…

358
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,845
- It wasn't us.
- We're just ordinary people.

359
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,555
- We didn't order.
- We're not the mafia.

360
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,140
We didn't order anything.

361
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,934
- Wasn't you?
- We didn't.

362
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,018
Well, darn.

363
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,441
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

364
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:35,651
Drive safely!

365
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,071
That was scary.

366
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,281
- Let's get off.
- Did you see his tattoos?

367
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,741
- Yeah.
- He was scary.

368
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:47,162
- Let's go! This is where we're staying.
- Thank you.

369
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,414
-Let's go!
-Okay. Oh!

370
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,209
It's so nice.

371
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,211
- What?
- It's so nice here.

372
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:57,965
This is incredible.

373
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,424
Wow.

374
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,718
There's a pool too.

375
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,429
This is great.

376
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,640
- It's cool inside.
- This is amazing.

377
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,142
Oh, yeah.

378
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,811
There's even a karaoke machine.

379
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,562
- There is?
- Yeah.

380
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,772
- Let's sing.
- Oh my.

381
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,856
Let's sing.

382
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,318
We're singing already?

383
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,948
Let's look around the house.
There's some stuff here.

384
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,951
Some stuff over there.

385
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:29,246
There's the karaoke machine.

386
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,498
Take a look.

387
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,793
Nice. Swim trunks, nice.

388
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,420
Board games, nice.

389
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,255
- Wait, that's mine.
- Nice.

390
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,174
-Can't I just…
-No.

391
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,260
It works better this way.

392
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,845
You film everything then.

393
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:47,097
- Let's look at the rooms.
- Okay, let's go.

394
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,932
♪ Let's go look at the rooms ♪

395
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,851
♪ Let's go ♪

396
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,060
Whoa!

397
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,938
- Hey, that's V's spot.
- V's spot.

398
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,024
This was made for him.

399
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,401
- Where?
- This is mine,

400
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,111
that's his, and that's yours.

401
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,488
- Okay.
- It's nice and cozy here.

402
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,740
That's perfect for you.

403
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,658
- Exactly.
- Okay, I'll take this.

404
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,452
-They're filming outside.
-What?

405
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,495
Sit here.

406
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,081
Let's take an insert shot. Sit here.

407
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,500
Wave with your right hand.

408
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,752
One, two, three.

409
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:18,879
I said right hand.

410
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,133
One, two, three.

411
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,677
Oh, come on.

412
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,389
-That's enough. Forget it.
-All right!

413
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,974
- Nice.
- Jung Kook, let's do it together.

414
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,225
One, two, three.

415
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,481
This is great.

416
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,150
It's awesome.

417
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,782
It's so hot.

418
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,241
What are we going to do?

419
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,580
In English, it's "right."

420
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,874
Here.

421
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:59,086
Jung Kook taking care of the staff
who are out in the hot weather

422
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,587
Thank you.

423
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,631
It's cool.
Drink it while it's cool.

424
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,264
This is nice.

425
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,601
I love this.

426
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,520
It's so nice.

427
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:19,064
The floor is so nice and cool.

428
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,273
It's amazing.

429
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,775
It feels cool.

430
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:23,985
The floor's so cool when you lie on it.

431
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,074
It's great lying down
and watching the sky.

432
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,121
Oh, you little…

433
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,623
Lie down next to me.

434
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,166
Stop annoying me.

435
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,967
It's so cool here, I love it.

436
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,057
I love this.

437
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:03,567
This is it

438
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,199
I feel sick.

439
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,742
Jeez, I need to lie down

440
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:17,289
"Join me, friend!"

441
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:18,707
No, I might throw up.

442
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:21,751
Rock will never die!

443
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,337
Make some noise!

444
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,977
"Please save Jimin…"

445
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,479
I might go for a swim.

446
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,191
I'm going for a swim.

447
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,572
Jung Kook, are you going to swim?

448
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,115
Let me join.

449
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:54,993
Wow, this is cool!

450
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,803
"Tiptoeing"

451
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,055
Hey.

452
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,683
I'm exhausted.

453
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:21,895
What's that?

454
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,231
Where did you find that?

455
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,821
Give me! I want to try!

456
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,615
The front and the back?

457
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:40,163
An innocent 5-year-old

458
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,959
Spraying both the front
and back is too much.

459
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:47,963
Another innocent 5-year-old

460
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:55,804
Please stop.

461
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,734
Aim

462
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,736
Fire!!!!!

463
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:15,282
Man, that's cold.

464
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:17,909
Great.

465
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,840
They've got to be kidding me.

466
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:35,760
Pooltime officially begins!

467
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,632
- How is it?
- It's ticklish.

468
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:14,841
How does it feel?

469
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,114
This is nice.

470
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:47,791
Go in!

471
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,313
I turn 30 next year.

472
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:15,527
My body's not the same anymore.

473
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:18,780
Right?

474
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,074
I know.

475
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:26,413
I should lie down…

476
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,857
Is he alive?

477
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,779
He's alive

478
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:02,949
Snooze…

479
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,957
Get him!

480
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:17,422
Clueless and deep in sleep

481
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,259
It doesn't reach him.

482
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:28,433
He's fast asleep

483
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,524
I should shower while he sleeps

484
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,201
On a solo ride while Jimin sleeps

485
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:52,081
Ooh la la

486
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,291
Hey, Are You Sure?!

487
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,067
- What?
- Did you ride the scooter?

488
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,401
- Yeah.
- How was it?

489
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,569
It was nice.

490
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:23,780
It was all right.

491
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,909
How long was I asleep?

492
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:32,956
That was a good nap.

493
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,921
- That was great.
- Was it?

494
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,842
Wait, is that…?

495
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,807
Grinning

496
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:17,250
What a quick-witted brat

497
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,423
Don't do it.

498
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:24,966
- Do what?
- Please.

499
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,676
"Take that!"

500
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,928
Hey, come on.

501
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,972
Stop.

502
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,685
Please don't come for me.

503
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:38,271
Not me.

504
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:39,939
Hey.

505
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,735
What do you have to say for yourself?

506
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,320
What do you have to say?

507
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,404
I'm sorry.

508
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:59,042
Jimin's bag

509
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,586
- Why are you holding my bag?
- What?

510
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,463
- Why are you holding my bag?
- Jimin.

511
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,548
- What?
- Come on, cut me some slack.

512
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,008
- Why?
- Please.

513
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:10,053
I promise I'll make up for it later.

514
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,471
How will you do that?

515
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,056
No, no. Please.

516
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,058
- Stand back.
- Okay.

517
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,392
- Put my bag down.
- Okay.

518
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,769
- Put my bag down!
- Why?

519
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,395
Put it down or I'll shoot.

520
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,897
Put it down or I'll shoot!

521
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,152
Who knew this would happen?

522
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:27,236
The tables have turned.

523
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,741
Peeking

524
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:54,931
Ready or not

525
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,976
Here I come

526
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,491
Faster than I thought

527
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,660
Okay, okay. I'm done.

528
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,286
I'm done.

529
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,789
- Put your guns down.
- Putting them down. Okay.

530
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,666
Take three steps back.

531
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,214
Hey!

532
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:35,847
"How dare you!"

533
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:36,931
How dare you.

534
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,976
You're fast.

535
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,979
Enough of this.
Put these away.

536
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,063
You want to keep going?

537
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,356
- Let's stop.
- You want to stop?

538
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,983
-Let's stop.
-Okay.

539
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,317
No more.

540
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:50,903
Just go.

541
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,281
I'm furious.

542
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:57,368
I can't believe I lost it.

543
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,458
- We're stopping, right?
- It's over.

544
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,752
Don't get cheeky

545
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,715
Let's call a truce.

546
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:14,260
"A peace treaty is signed"

547
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:16,846
You have to swear
you won't break this treaty.

548
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,473
-If you do…
-Let's just throw them away.

549
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,099
They're no good.

550
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,310
Let's not do that again.

551
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,193
Do you need
the flash even in daylight?

552
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:32,487
- No.
- Take a picture of me.

553
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,579
One, two, three.

554
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,083
Done.

555
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,131
- Legs down.
- Okay.

556
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,424
- Sit up straight.
- Okay.

557
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:54,884
Tilt your head this way.

558
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,303
-Do you prefer your right side?
-Any side is fine.

559
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,679
That's just annoying.

560
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,515
- Sit up straight.
- Okay.

561
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,767
Turn your head a bit this way.

562
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,143
Smile.

563
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,354
Not like that. Without teeth.

564
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,273
All right, here I go.

565
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,735
Wow, it's perfect

566
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,572
Jimin…

567
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,703
Nice.

568
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,542
Let's go.

569
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,502
It looks good.

570
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,546
These clothes are nice.

571
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:33,881
I like them.

572
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,133
They're really nice.

573
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,010
How do I look?

574
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:39,846
- You look nice.
- Do I?

575
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,139
You really do.

576
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,682
Let's go!

577
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,392
- We're finally going.
- Oh, yes.

578
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:50,314
"This was filmed safely
in compliance with traffic laws"

579
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,013
We're going climbing!

580
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,019
Entertainment Park

581
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,822
Is this the theme park?

582
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:41,324
How exciting.

583
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,077
I'm going to sweat it all out here.

584
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,287
This is safe, right?

585
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,206
Yes, you'll be fully equipped.

586
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:52,168
This black rope is quite firm,
so make sure you don't hurt your hands

587
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,045
when coming down.

588
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,130
- Okay.
- Just hold the blue rope.

589
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,049
Just the blue rope. Got it.

590
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,508
- Let's head over.
- All right.

591
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,802
What should we do first?

592
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,347
So these are all for climbing.

593
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,976
Whoa, wow, wow!

594
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,397
Whoa, I'm going straight for this one.

595
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,901
- Take this red thing…
- Do we walk on this?

596
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,152
- Click.
- Yes.

597
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,238
- No way.
- And then…

598
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,823
- Do I hold this and go up?
- Yeah, try it.

599
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:29,997
Jump!

600
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:31,540
Jump!

601
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:34,835
Nice.

602
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,965
- Wow.
- That was really fun.

603
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,342
- Hey.
- You're going again?

604
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,269
- Wow.
- It's super fun.

605
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:55,106
-You make it look so easy.
-And then I put it back like this.

606
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,110
-It's so fun!
-You look so cool.

607
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,112
"Give me something even more fun"

608
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,571
How do I do this one?

609
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,829
Taking big leaps up

610
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,250
I made it!

611
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,003
That was fun.

612
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,796
So fun.

613
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,841
There's no time to rest

614
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,643
This is so fun.

615
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,645
How can it be this fun?

616
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,772
Wow. Look at him go.

617
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,779
He made it.

618
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,242
Yes! I made it.

619
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:52,079
Gosh, that's so high.
That's too scary.

620
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,873
- Mr. Jimin!
- Mr. Jung Kook!

621
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:54,999
That looks scary.

622
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,751
This one's difficult, Mr. Jimin.

623
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,338
Mr. Jimin!

624
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,089
- Mr. Jimin!
- Wow!

625
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:05,092
Guys, that's… You might get hurt.

626
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,427
Why?

627
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,553
Mission: Impossible.

628
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,557
You make it look so easy.

629
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,978
- Mr. Jung Kook!
- Mr. Jimin!

630
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:18,689
Whoa!

631
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,650
This looks scary too.

632
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,870
- You're good.
- Do you want to go? Try it.

633
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,914
- It's not scary, right?
- This one's fine.

634
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,797
If it's safe and not scary, he'll try it

635
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,382
You got this!

636
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,428
Wait, this is really scary.

637
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:50,638
You're almost there.

638
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:57,728
- Do I jump?
- Yeah. Hold the blue rope.

639
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:00,398
- What?
- Hold the blue rope in front of you.

640
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,108
Hold the blue rope by your stomach

641
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:03,484
- and step backward.
- This one?

642
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,568
- Yeah.
- Oh!

643
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:11,867
Be careful.

644
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:14,036
Connect it to the one below you.

645
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,623
"Forget the cowardly V"

646
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:20,709
This one, right?

647
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:22,294
Okay.

648
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,805
Let's see what else there is.

649
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:36,183
There's a speed-climbing thing here.

650
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,435
- For going against each other?
- Yeah.

651
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,519
Okay.

652
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,771
The three men fight for their honor!

653
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:41,856
Ready.

654
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,482
Foot down, foot down.

655
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:44,733
Go!

656
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:46,902
I'm not going up.

657
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,115
He's too hasty.

658
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,409
- He's pretty fast.
- Careful.

659
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,497
Look at his legs go.

660
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,168
-15 seconds.
-15 seconds.

661
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,044
You're pretty fast.

662
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,337
I'm a bit nervous.

663
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,298
- Your turn, Jimin.
- Foot down?

664
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,758
Yeah. Ready, set, go!

665
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,427
Oh, man.

666
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:16,432
He's just climbing the wall itself.

667
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,894
He's just climbing the wall.

668
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:25,483
I can't move because I'm laughing.

669
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:29,320
That was too slow.

670
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,158
Ready, go.

671
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,958
Wow, 12 seconds.

672
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:48,005
Jung Kook wins 1st place with 12 seconds

673
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,673
I'm going to do that one.

674
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,300
I'm exhausted.

675
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,803
Jimin is worn out

676
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:56,972
No, come here.

677
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,433
We have to do this one now.

678
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,976
Hey, Jimin.

679
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,895
I'll show you
that I'm not the kid I used to be.

680
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,773
Well, yeah. You're an adult now.

681
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,776
The youngest Jung Kook goes first

682
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:09,944
I'm doing mime.

683
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:11,654
It does look like it.

684
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,239
You look like a caterpillar.

685
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,409
I can't feel my hands.

686
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,995
Hands above your head. One, two, three!

687
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:23,916
That was so fun!

688
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:25,626
-Was it?
-Yeah.

689
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:26,794
That was awesome.

690
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,379
How was it?

691
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:29,463
It actually feels like you're falling.

692
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,548
What?

693
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,716
It's like you're freefalling.

694
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,885
For me, this was scarier
than bungee jumping.

695
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,639
I'll just go up to "Let it go."

696
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:41,350
-There's no "Let it go."
-I mean "Really go."

697
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,185
- Oh, man.
- "Really go."

698
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,520
Goodness, sir.

699
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,063
- You barely got to "Just go."
- "Really go."

700
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,274
- I want "Really go."
- You're there now.

701
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,818
Just let me down. I can't do this.

702
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,321
-There's no going back.
-I can't. I really can't.

703
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,781
Just let it go.

704
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:57,533
- I really can't.
- Come on!

705
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,867
-It feels like you're falling.
-Let go!

706
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:00,869
-My arms hurt!
-Let go!

707
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:02,830
Just let go!

708
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:04,582
Let go!

709
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:11,922
Isn't it fun?

710
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,215
Don't you want to go again?

711
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,551
How far up did I go?

712
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:18,137
"Really go"? Did I make it that far up?

713
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,556
Oh.

714
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,308
It wasn't "Let it go"?

715
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,310
Where did you see that?

716
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:27,271
- Can you try "Completely go"?
- I can't.

717
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,315
- Show me a new side of you.
- I want to try this one.

718
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,566
Okay, then.

719
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:32,693
Let's do the sandbag one and go.

720
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,778
- Sandbag? The jumping one?
- Yes.

721
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:37,323
I really want to see V try that.

722
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,408
Jimin, let's do this one and go!

723
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:41,744
- What?
- Let's do this one and go.

724
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:42,828
Me too…?

725
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:44,496
Can you do this
without the equipment?

726
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,415
-No, I'll die.
-Show us how it's done.

727
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:48,792
Fight for your life.

728
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:52,379
Seriously. As if your legs might break.

729
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,383
Wait, hang on.

730
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,261
-That--
-No, no. You can do it.

731
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,180
You're taller than me.

732
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,724
Show me that it's possible to do this.

733
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,184
-No, just try it.
-Show me.

734
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:07,269
- Show me if it's possible first.
- All right.

735
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:18,739
V, here I go.

736
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:20,949
- Are you scared?
- What?

737
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:22,868
-Are you scared?
-Of course, I am.

738
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:24,036
You scaredy cat.

739
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:32,044
I don't think you grabbed onto it.

740
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,295
- I bit my lips.
- What?

741
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:34,922
Wait, you're bleeding.

742
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,465
-You're bleeding.
-You're bleeding.

743
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:37,758
He bit his lips.

744
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,552
You always get hurt.

745
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,137
-You're bleeding a lot.
-Am I?

746
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,347
Yeah.

747
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,807
I smacked my head onto it.

748
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,226
Why do you always get hurt
when you travel?

749
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,645
Is this supposed to happen?

750
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:54,858
I'll show you how much I've grown

751
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:57,027
Let's go!

752
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:00,155
Okay.

753
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,532
Why aren't you jumping?

754
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:03,242
-What?
-Why aren't you jumping?

755
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:05,536
-I don't think I can.
-You little…

756
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:08,872
If you come down, I'll kill you.

757
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,999
I even sacrificed my lips.

758
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:14,503
Hang on. I'll test this out first.

759
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:15,713
- No!
- No.

760
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:16,880
Don't do that.

761
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:17,965
- Sorry?
- Should we bring it closer?

762
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,133
Yes, please.

763
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,677
No. No, don't.

764
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:23,887
Just do it!

765
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,013
Just go!

766
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,057
-You got this!
-I'll count for you.

767
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,268
One, two--

768
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:30,728
No, don't do that.

769
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,187
- What?
- Don't do that.

770
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:35,691
V, I'm here.

771
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:38,152
"Jung Kook cheering from way up close"

772
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:39,945
- I'm here.
- Hey, Jung Kook.

773
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:41,155
Do you think I can do this?

774
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:42,948
You can do this!

775
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,659
You can do it!

776
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,703
- You got this!
- Okay, I got this.

777
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:49,455
- V, you can do it!
- Okay.

778
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,874
I'm not that scared now.

779
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:53,333
No, I am scared.

780
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:54,835
But not as much as before.

781
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,424
Hurry up!

782
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:05,053
Nice!

783
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,222
Nice!

784
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,811
- Bravo!
- Nice!

785
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,938
- Bravo!
- Nice!

786
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:22,279
- Nice!
- Nice!

787
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:25,324
I'm proud of you.

788
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:29,578
It was nothing.

789
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:31,622
It's further away than I thought.

790
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:34,750
This isn't fun because I know
you're going to do well.

791
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:44,259
One, two, three, go.

792
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:47,221
See? Everyone knew you'd do well,
so no one's applauding.

793
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,305
Absolutely no one.

794
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,141
My moment was more moving.

795
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,643
- It was.
- That was fun.

796
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,144
- You did well.
- That's all that matters.

797
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,730
- Let's go.
- Time for go-karts.

798
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,899
These are really fun.

799
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,359
- Are they fast?
- Yeah.

800
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:03,111
I'm going to be in first place.

801
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:04,196
I'm number one.

802
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,573
Let's do this!

803
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,159
What's this? There's "go" and "stop."

804
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:12,037
There's a way to go fast. What was it?

805
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,372
How can we go fast?

806
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:17,626
Step and release the pedal
repeatedly like you're changing gears.

807
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:18,836
-I see.
-I see.

808
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,754
Like this?

809
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,258
- Step and release.
- This is exciting!

810
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,968
Let's take a test lap.

811
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:27,594
-Two laps.
-Okay, two laps

812
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:28,804
-and then we'll race.
-Okay.

813
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:30,889
How exciting!

814
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,689
This is really like Kart Rider.

815
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:43,318
"I'm leaving first"

816
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:46,405
Going in order

817
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,997
Excited

818
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:00,502
Mr. Jimin!

819
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,424
You're fast!

820
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:08,719
-Mr. Jimin!
-How did you get here so fast?

821
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,387
You're good.

822
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:14,683
See you then

823
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:35,162
Enjoying the ride in their own ways

824
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,376
Jung Kook, I'm here

825
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:54,932
Spirits are lifted with the cool breeze

826
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,184
What's up!

827
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:07,653
This is fun.

828
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:09,321
When do we go?

829
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:10,989
Let's go now

830
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:12,074
From where?

831
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:13,742
Let's go from here.

832
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,453
Jimin VS V
The 95 liners' racing battle

833
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:19,414
-Are you ready?
-I feel like I'm going to lose to you.

834
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:20,666
-What?
-I feel like I'm going to lose.

835
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,209
No, you just have to…

836
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,919
-The pedal? Like this?
-Yeah.

837
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,087
"Pat, pat, paaat, pat, pat"

838
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,588
-Like that?
-Okay.

839
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,674
Are they racing?

840
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:30,592
How childish.

841
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:31,677
How immature.

842
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,887
All hung up on competing.

843
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:41,436
One, two, go!

844
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,738
V wins at the first corner

845
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:59,204
I won't lose

846
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,419
I'll let you pass

847
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:08,088
Wow, look at you going easy on me.

848
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,677
Full of confidence

849
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:24,187
However, V takes over at the corner

850
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,494
V makes it through the finish line first

851
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:42,956
I won

852
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:47,711
You're pretty good.

853
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:49,629
-Of course.
-What was that?

854
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:50,881
You can have a head start.

855
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:52,466
One lap?

856
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:54,217
"Okay"

857
00:50:57,262 --> 00:51:00,849
The 95 liners' second race

858
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:08,440
This time Jimin takes the lead

859
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:11,610
His eyes turn serious

860
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:28,376
You can't get past me

861
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:33,006
Hey!

862
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:44,476
You're blocking me!

863
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:53,568
Jimin wins with some fierce blocking

864
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,863
- You blocked my way!
- What?

865
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,615
You blocked my way!

866
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:05,580
Meanwhile, Jung Kook drives peacefully

867
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,044
I want to rest for a bit.

868
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:20,470
This is fun.

869
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:25,934
Just sitting here isn't bad either.

870
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:27,686
-It's suddenly quiet.
-I know.

871
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:34,317
You know, I kept getting branches
in my eyes.

872
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:35,569
-It's your hair.
-That's because…

873
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:36,736
That's because you're weak.

874
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:38,780
That was so harsh.

875
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:39,865
Hey.

876
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:42,784
We're here to have fun.
Don't say things like that.

877
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:45,745
Got it? If you don't
want to see blood, that is.

878
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,498
- You might be the one to bleed.
- What?

879
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,750
Yeah, I was talking about my blood.

880
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,963
I didn't mention whose blood it'd be.

881
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:56,923
Unless you don't want to see blood,

882
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:58,967
-don't take it too far.
-Yes, sir.

883
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,803
Regardless of whose blood it'd be.

884
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:02,888
It might be mine.

885
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:05,015
You've already seen one blood.

886
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:06,433
How do you see "one blood"?

887
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:09,603
Taking a break to play with something else

888
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:12,522
One, two,

889
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:14,316
three.

890
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:22,115
I'm going to ride some more.

891
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:29,623
This was filmed safely under
controlled conditions and prior approval

892
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,752
Wow!

893
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:38,590
Hello, sirs.

894
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,967
- Hello!
- Hello!

895
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,510
-Hello!
-Hello!

896
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:44,095
Where are you off to?

897
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,347
Over there.

898
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:46,890
- Is that so?
- Yes.

899
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:49,851
This is exhausting.

900
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,607
It would've been better
to just ride that again.

901
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:58,151
Why did we waste our energy?

902
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:02,113
This is fun!

903
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:05,825
How Kook enjoys his solo go-kart ride

904
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:10,622
1. Taking in the breeze

905
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,416
2. Fast and furious

906
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,126
Inside lane!

907
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,050
3. Enjoying it together

908
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,306
This is great!

909
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:31,977
Look at his face.

910
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:39,317
You're so cool.

911
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:44,072
V and Jimin's praises make him spin around

912
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:56,084
Are You Sure?!

913
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,420
- Did you get it?
- Awesome. I did.

914
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:00,463
- Jeez, my hands.
- I'll show you later.

915
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,048
Actually…

916
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:07,929
Climbing was so much fun today.

917
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:09,347
Good thing
I suggested this place, right?

918
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:10,473
Yeah.

919
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:13,768
Riding the kart
was really fun for me.

920
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,312
I might go climbing in Korea.

921
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:16,563
But this is Korea.

922
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,940
Oh, right. I mean Seoul.

923
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,612
Our trip begins here!

924
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,032
Can you feel it?

925
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:28,116
Can you feel the black spots?

926
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:30,035
You gave me white spots.

927
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:32,704
After stuffing themselves with food

928
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:34,914
It's time for swimming in the sea!

929
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,666
Don't hesitate and Go

930
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,085
Still full of energy

931
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,421
Captain, we'd like to catch some big fish!

932
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:43,673
It took the bait and swam off.

933
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,091
The line snapped.

934
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,551
I don't think
we're going to catch anything.

935
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:47,927
But then!

936
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:49,846
We caught something!

937
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:51,181
"Finally a fish!"

938
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:52,515
We caught two!

939
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,726
Who caught the fish?

940
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:56,269
Are You Sure?!

941
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:57,354
