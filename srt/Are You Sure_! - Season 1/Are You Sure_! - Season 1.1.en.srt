There aren't many different kinds
of burgers here.

Just a standard American burger,

00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,317
This is the way you park. Just like that.

351
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,069
You shouldn't be looking
at the backup camera display.

352
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,780
-I'm looking at the side-view mirrors.
-It's dangerous to look at this.

353
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,865
-You'll get hurt.
-I'm looking at the side-view mirrors!

354
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,784
-How can I look at the back without this?
-[♪ comical music playing]

355
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,744
You have to park without this!

356
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,037
I have to watch the back.

357
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,331
This is why your driving hasn't improved.

358
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,249
-[laughs]
-You're one to speak.

359
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,336
-You're a terrible driver too.
-[Jimin laughing]

360
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,713
Be quiet and get off.

361
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,466
Getting off now.

362
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:11,345
Repeatedly locking out of anger

363
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,224
[Jung Kook in English] Oh, yes.
Let's go. Let's go.

364
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,393
-Oh, man.
-[in Korean] First…

365
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,269
Let's find some sportswear first.

366
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,690
I like this place. It's huge.

367
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,110
[Jung Kook] It's massive.

368
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,487
I like this one.

369
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,655
[both chuckle]

370
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,824
[Jung Kook]
Why don't you make a full outfit?

371
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,368
Here are the shorts that go with that.

372
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,494
[Jimin] Looks good.

373
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,704
Let's go over there.

374
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,583
-Yes, slides.
-Slides. Slides. Slides.

375
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,336
This is 12, 8, 7, and 11.

376
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,673
But I don't see any

377
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:49,925
in my size.

378
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,885
I found mine.

379
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,054
[both chuckle]

380
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,765
"Jimin's pick is kids' slides (?)"

381
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,058
They're too small.

382
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,518
[imitates a child's voice]
You can't.

383
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,062
That's no good. That's no good.

384
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,481
Can't we just buy these?

385
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,150
[Jung Kook] We got the slides.

386
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,693
[Jimin] Sweatpants.

387
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,739
I picked out some shorts.

388
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:12,990
-[Jung Kook] You did?
-Yes.

389
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,074
"1 set complete"

390
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,201
-Let's hurry.
-[Jung Kook exclaims playfully]

391
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,412
[exclaims playfully]

392
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,456
This looks cute.

393
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,667
[soft chuckle]
He's actually shopping.

394
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,794
No, no.

395
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,796
No.

396
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,131
They're all in XL.

397
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,216
They won't fit.

398
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,969
[♪ upbeat music playing]

399
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,141
I like this.

400
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,851
These two for the top.

401
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,228
-[Jung Kook] It should fit.
-Really?

402
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,314
-[Jung Kook] I think so.
-Let's try it.

403
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,899
Let's buy the same ones.

404
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,650
[Jimin] All right. We're good.

405
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,445
-[shopper] Jimin?
-[in English] Yes.

406
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:52,654
-[shopper] You are Jimin?
-Yes.

407
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,947
-[shopper] Oh, wow.
-[both chuckle]

408
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,699
-Nice to meet you.
-[shopper] Nice to meet you.

409
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,034
-That's Jung Kook?
-Yup.

410
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,869
"An ARMY recognized them"

-[♪ cheerful music playing]
-[chuckles]

412
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,083
[in Korean] Why? What's happening?

413
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,251
-[Jimin] I think she recognized us.
-Ah.

414
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,962
-We've still got it.
-[Jung Kook] Of course we do.

415
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,799
We've still got it, she recognized us.
Feels great.

416
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,383
[in English] Yeah!

417
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,219
[Jimin in Korean] Let's go.

418
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,849
-[cashier in English] How's it going?
-[Jimin] Hi, thank you.

419
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,227
[in Korean] This is new
and the sleeves are already dirty.

420
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,311
[Jung Kook] That happens.

421
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:25,562
Of course.

422
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,482
[Jung Kook in English]
"Dear God. Can you just do it?"

423
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,484
[in Korean]
Your shoulders should come out here.

424
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,777
And turn your hips.

426
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,030
[Jung Kook] Yeah, something like that.

Your movements are too big.

[Jimin] They say we should try
some samples and then order our drinks.

I want to order from that guy.

443

[staff in English] Welcome, welcome.

444
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,288
[Jung Kook] Is there a sample?

445
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,124
Sample?

446

-[Jung Kook] Light beer.

449

-Mmm.
-It's okay.

-[Jung Kook in Korean] This one's good.
-I like this one.

00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,358
It's not the same?

-[in English] What is this?
-[staff] So that's…

460
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,496
It's a tropical hard seltzer

-with pineapple, passionfruit, tangerine.
-Mm.

462

It's like a light yellow beer.

Yeah, they give me headaches.

487
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,982
They can actually brew beer right here.

488

[Jimin] They must make it here.

490
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,697
I want to try making whiskey.

You should.

492

Jin did something like that.

you say you want to try
making it yourself.

501
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,760
I never think like that.

502
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:44,845
I just go,

so I can eat this more."

It feels like you're here to relax.

507
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,279
I don't know what we're filming.

508
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,866
Let me tell you, Jung Kook.

509
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:11,580
It's a show about us traveling
before we go off to military service.

511
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,666
That way,

while we're serving.

513
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,838

519
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:42,361

with the highest alcohol content.

It's hilarious.

701
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:29,786
[Jimin] He looks so clunky.

703
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:39,879

[in Korean] I'm tired.
[panting]

711
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,823
[Jung Kook] It's stress-relieving.

712
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,409
[Jimin] Hello there!

713
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,829
You come here often?

714
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:17,000
You're soaking wet,
you must have flipped over.

715
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:18,960
-I haven't.
-You haven't?

716
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,044
It's just sweat.

717
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,754
You must be really hot.

718
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,549
Yes, I've been paddling nonstop.

719
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,509
I'm going to focus now.

720
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,970
How far should we go before heading back?

721
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,763
-Should we head back?
-[Jimin] What?

722
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,098
Should we head back?
[chuckles]

723
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:34,017
[Tired]

724
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,185
-[in English] Hi.
-[Gino] How are you doing, fellas?

725
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,146
-[Jung Kook] Hi!
-[Gino] Having fun?

726
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,564

[Jung Kook] Shall we?

731
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,742
-[Jimin] Let's take that way.
-That way?

732
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,828
-Okay. Toward the bridge, right?
-[Jimin] Yeah.

733
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:54,996

[Jimin] That was nice.

740
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,439
I did so great out there.

741
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,233
You've got power, Jung Kook.

742
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:26,402
-Did you have fun?
-[Jung Kook] Yeah.

743
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,655
-That's all that matters.
-It was fun.

744
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,156
[Jung Kook] It was awesome.

745
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,574
-[Jimin] I loved it.
-[Jung Kook] I loved it.

746
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,372
[Jimin] I really enjoyed that.

747
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,792
I'm going to sleep great tonight.

JK.

755
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,440
[Jung Kook] I should film some scenery.

756
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,025
[Jimin] Is that a supermarket?

757
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,112
I'm starting to feel hungry.

758
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,155
-We should eat when we get there.
-[Jung Kook] Yeah.

759

Eat and then take a shower.

760
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:14,575
[Jimin] Then have a drink.

761
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,619
Have a drink, then go to sleep.

766

-[Jimin] It's like a horror movie.
-[Jung Kook] It'd be fun to see a bear.

767
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,761
-[Jimin] You want to see a bear?
-[Jung Kook] Yeah. That'd be scary.

768
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:37,015
You have to look fierce
when you meet a bear.

769
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,100
[Jimin laughs]

770
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:43,604
Look directly into its eyes
and slowly take a few steps back.

-It's over when you show your back.
-[Jung Kook] Yeah.

-Is it that place?
-[Jimin] I think so.

773
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,029
Yeah.

774
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,614
We have arrived.

All right, let's go.

[Jimin exclaims]

785
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,399
[in Korean] It's a lot cooler
and better than I expected.

786
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,027
I know you're not curious
about the bathroom

787
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,528
but I'll film it anyway.

788
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:34,363
Even if you don't want to know.

789

It's too bright.

Anyway, here it is.

-It's pretty nice.

797

[Jung Kook] There's a shower booth.

798
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:04,102
We can make some ramyeon.

799
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,020
We can make coffee in the morning.

800
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,397
[Jimin] Hot coffee is lowkey the best.

801
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,565
Oh, hot sauce.

802
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,985

-My favorite?
-I mean, you're a good cook.

There's Bibimmyeon, Jung Kook!

805
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,575
That goes well with meat.

806
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,955
Ramyeon is more appropriate when camping.

807
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,290
-Like Shin Ramyun?
-No, Jin Ramen Spicy.

-Okay.

We're both hungry.

810

[Jung Kook] Let's make a delicious sauce.

811
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:36,300
This isn't the best pork,

812
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,511
so I think I should marinate it
in barbecue sauce

813
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,180
to make it more delicious.

-Making barbecue sauce.

How? What did you put in?

Pretty much everything.

It's amazing.

This pork didn't look good on its own,

-so I'm going to spread this on it.
-Spread the sauce?

Sounds great. Let's go!

-[Jung Kook] I'm marinating the meat.

-You're soaking it in the sauce?
-That's right.

Soaking it in a bath?

at least one bug tonight.

00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,930
-[Jung Kook] The scissors…
-[Jimin] Yes.

876
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,307
This is what you meant, right?

877
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,600
-[Jung Kook] That's right.
-[Jimin] I got it.

878
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:33,769
-I'll bring this over soon.
-[Jung Kook] Where are the scissors?

879
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:38,899
"After a long battle with the onion"

880
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:42,778
Mission successful!

881
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,864
[Jimin]
Are you going to grill the onions now?

882
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:47,241
I… might as well.

883
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:49,910
There's one more.

884
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:56,792
[Jung Kook] The pork's getting braised
in the sauce. Nice.

885
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,502
[Jimin] It's getting braised?

886
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,505
[Jung Kook]
Yeah, the moisture's escaping from it.

887
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:03,632
What if…

888
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,181
"Thinking"

889
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,599
How about…

890
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,732
something like this?

891
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:21,275
Will this be good?

892
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,736
[soft chuckle]

893
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,237
It just needs to be edible.

894
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,699
[Jung Kook] What if it tastes horrible?

895
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,868
Actually, it doesn't smell bad.

896
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,079
[Jung Kook exclaims]

897
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:43,381
-Whoa!
-[♪ upbeat music playing]

898
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,757
You know what?

899
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,925
This sauce…

900
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:50,137
tastes like the chicken skewers
they sell near subway stations.

901
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,515
That's what it tastes like.

902
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,558
Seriously.

903
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,604
That's some good sauce.

904
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,316
[satisfied hum]

905
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:04,819
I'll let Jimin taste it.

906
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:09,490
Jimin.

907
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,200
[Jimin] Yeah?

908
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,327
[Jung Kook] It's like the chicken skewers
they sell in front of schools.

909
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,913
It's a little tough but it's good.

910
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,164
-It's good.
-[Jung Kook] Right?

911
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,249
Yeah, it's good.

912
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:25,464
[satisfied hum]

913
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:27,800
[playful chewing]

914
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,639
It's better now that it's cooked.

915
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:40,604
[Very pleased]

916
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:45,901
Jimin is in charge of making ramyeon
Jimin is in charge of making ramyeon

917
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,029
[Jimin] Jung Kook will kill me
if I don't do this right.

918
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,115
[♪ playful music playing]

919
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,870
This is going to be bland for sure.

920
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:57,872
In that case…

921
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,877
[Peeking]

922
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,588
[Jimin] I'll put more seasoning in.

923
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,506
[Slurp]

924
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,217
Was I wrong? Was it okay before?

925
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,722
-Ramyeon's all done, sir.
-[Jung Kook] Is it?

926
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,056
-[Jimin] Yes.
-Let's eat.

927
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:19,977
You can just eat the pork like this.

928
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,061
[Jimin] Okay.

929
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,898
[Jung Kook] Wow, look at the ramyeon.

930
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,691
-[Jimin] What's wrong?
-Way to go, sir.

931
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:28,068
-[Jimin] Not too bad, right?
-[Jung Kook] Not bad at all.

932
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,862
Let me try. Darn it!

933
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:30,946
[exclaims]

934
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,031
"Three-second rule"

935
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,115
[both exclaim]

936
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,911
-I'm so sorry.
-[Jung Kook] It's okay.

937
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,372
[Jimin] You worked so hard to cook this.
I'm so sorry.

938
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,457
Go and rinse it.

939
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,543
-It's all good.
-[Jimin] Should I still try it?

940
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,253
No, there's more here.

941
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,506
But you cooked this for me.

942
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,549
[Jimin] How could I?

943
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:53,052
I'm sorry. I really am terribly sorry.

944
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,595
No, it's delicious.

945
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:55,971
It's awesome.

946
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,681
[Jimin]
How could I lose a piece like that?

947
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,643
It was cooked with so much effort.

948
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:02,895
Darn it.

949
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:04,396
It's fine.

950
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,899
[Jimin] I'm really sorry.

951
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:08,192
I made a big mistake.

952
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:10,903
-Mmm!
-[Jimin chuckles]

953
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,279
We have a bowl, you know.

954
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,198
"An eco-friendly bowl (feat. lettuce)"

955
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,282
Is the ramyeon good?

956
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:16,867
-Yes.
-Thank goodness.

957
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,707
Thank you for cooking the pork.

958
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,292
It's very tough.

959
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:29,380
Mmm! The sauce is amazing.

960
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,675
It's like the chicken skewers
in front of schools.

961
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,134
-[Jimin] Right.
-It tastes just like it.

962
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,262
[mouthful] It's incredible.

963
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,889
Should we mix a little rice
with the ramyeon?

964
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:39,974
[Jung Kook] Yeah.

965
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,225
Okay.

966
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:49,567
Guys, I know we're filming,

967
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,736
but I'm not sure
how this will all turn out.

968
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:54,822
Who are you talking to?

969
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,323
You know, our viewers.

970
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:59,493
-[Jimin] Can you see the viewers in here?
-Yes.

971
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,579
[chuckles]
How do you see them?

972
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:02,746
I only see us two.

973
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:05,833
-They're watching in cinematic mode.
-[Jimin] Is that so?

974
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,252
I didn't know.
I'm not good with this stuff.

975
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:10,045
Right. That's okay.

976
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,302
Bring it over.

977
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,345
[exclaims]

978
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,888
Oh, wow.

979
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,057
-You can use this for your bowl.
-Okay.

980
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,475
Do you have a bowl?

981
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,060
No, I'm very quick.

982
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,563
-What does that even mean?
-[laughs]

983
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:29,523
I put food in my mouth very quickly.

984
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,486
-Do you like it?
-It's good.

985
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,571
Thank goodness.

986
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:42,828
This can be my bowl.

987
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,080
[sniffles]
That'll take forever to eat.

988
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,249
This is like four bowls in one.

989
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,834
And it's disposable.
[chuckles]

990
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:53,005
[Jimin sniffles]

991
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:54,548
[Jimin] I'm sorry.

992
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,008
[Jimin chuckles]

993
00:43:56,842 --> 00:44:00,012
I remember that time
we did a V Live with V.

994
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,221
When he kept saying brand names?

995
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,724
I still can't eat Shin Ramyun.

996
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,434
Can you say the brand name so openly?

997
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:08,854
I stopped drinking Coke recently.

998
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:11,815
-What did you drink a couple of days ago?
-I've been drinking Fanta.

999
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:13,984
-Another brand name.
-[stifled chuckle]

1000
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,320
-[Jimin] See you in part 3.
-[chuckles]

1001
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:17,946
I don't drink it often.

1002
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,407
Baskin-Robbins 31. One, two, three.

1003
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,867
-One, two, three.
-Not again.

"A day of frenzy"

1005
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:25,954
I miss V so much.

1006
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,247
Should we video-call him?

1007
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,876
Should we also video-call RM
and make them talk to each other?

1008
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,628
[both chuckle]

1009
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:33,796
"Hey, how have you been?"

1010
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,590
-Wait, V's working right now.
-[Jimin] Really?

1011
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:37,716
Yeah.

1012
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:39,802
Hey.

1013
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,595
-Where are you right now?
-[V] Hey.

1014
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,555
-I'm at a photoshoot.
-[sniffles]

1015
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:44,640
We're filming a show.

1016
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,058
[V] Where?

1017
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:48,811
In New York.
We're riding a motorcycle tomorrow.

1018
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,397
[V] Are you really riding a motorcycle?

1019
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:54,692
-Yeah, we're riding my motorcycle.
-[V] That's cool.

1020
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:55,943
Have fun, V!

1021
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:59,321
[V] So you can ride a motorbike
in your travel show?

1022
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,948
-Okay.

[Hilarious]

1025
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:15,045
He texted me right away.

1026
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,130
What did he say?

1027
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,841
[birds chirping effect]

1028
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,426

1029
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,304
Isn't V adorable?

1030
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:25,806
"You're the best."

1031
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,058
"I love you."

1032
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:29,476
"I love you."

1034
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,397
I want to see SUGA's reaction.

1035

[line ringing]

1036
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:39,778
[SUGA] What?

1037
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,029
[chuckles]

1038
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,322
What?

1039
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:45,117
-I'm having some beer right now.
-[SUGA] What?

1040
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,535
I'm at Hannam Intersection.

1041
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:49,997
[SUGA] Aren't you in America?

1042

[both chuckle]

1043
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,791
-You already knew.
-That was fast.

1044
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,877
-I'm very touched, SUGA.
-[SUGA] Of course.

1045
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,588
-I knew you were going there.
-Okay.

1046
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:59,006
I was filming a show

1047
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:01,175
-with Jung Kook.
-SUGA!

1048
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,594
[SUGA] I saw your performance, Jung Kook.

1049
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:05,971
-What did you think?

00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:13,518
-[Jung Kook] What?
-[Jimin] It's not going to air.

1223
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:14,602
[Jung Kook] Not at all?

1224
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:18,857
[Jung Kook] This feels great!

1225
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:20,567
I love the breeze.

1226
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,444
[♪ upbeat music playing]

1227
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,156
Jimin and Jung Kook
enjoy a trip filled with relaxation

1228
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:27,407
I feel so free!

1229
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:30,535
"The trip is more enjoyable"

1230
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:33,079
"Because they're together"

1231
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,623
How about an episode
of me abandoning Jimin?

1232
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:37,292
But it's also great to be alone!

1233
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:39,336
There was something I wanted to eat.

1234
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,755
Here it is. And nacho chips.

1235
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,423
"Jimin hunts down Jung Kook"

1236
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:44,966
I just saw Jung Kook here.

1237
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,343
The hunter

1238
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,303
And the prey

1239
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:51,556
How will this rainy day chase end?

1240
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:54,017
Are You Sure?!
