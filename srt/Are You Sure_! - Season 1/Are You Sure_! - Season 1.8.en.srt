1
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:20,020
Are You Sure?!

2
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,689
The first night in Sapporo
was full of laughter

3
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,984
Jimin and Jung Kook
had a therapeutic time in the hot springs

4
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,907
I hope we remember this meal
when we're serving in the military.

5
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,411
Their time here is sadly coming to an end

6
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:42,375
They spend a crazy night

7
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:46,254
Take pictures of their time together

8
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,006
"And fully enjoyed their moments"

9
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,216
The clouds are so pretty.

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,801
This is fun.

11
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:53,887
This is fun.

12
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,014
This is our last moment of relaxation.

13
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,265
Our last.

14
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:58,349
I love it.

15
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:01,311
"The final chapter of Are You Sure?!"

16
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:07,692
Wow, it's cold. So cold. So cold.

17
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,279
I should turn the heater on now.

18
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:17,327
Heater ON

19
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,961
Let's go!

20
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,046
I turned the heater on.

21
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,339
Good idea.

22
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,382
Are you hungry?

23
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,009
- What?
- Are you not hungry?

24
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,011
No.

25
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,056
Well, I'm hungry.

26
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,141
Let's go.

27
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,434
"Off to get dinner"

28
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:45,021
We're going to eat
a lamb dish called Jingisukan.

29
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,147
Oh, lamb?

30
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,274
You can also get beef at that restaurant.

31
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:52,153
- I love it.
- I saw some pictures of it,

32
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:56,199
and there was meat piled up
in a gigantic pot.

33
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,576
-Sounds great.
-Yes, I'm excited.

34
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,290
It's an hour and 40 or 50 minutes drive,

35
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,917
- so good luck.
- Okay.

36
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,837
I like it.

37
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,094
I didn't mean to play your song.

38
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:21,516
I played Korea's top songs,
and your song just came out.

39
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:30,942
It's a good song.

40
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,319
What's the next song?

41
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,240
Standing Next to You.

42
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,012
You shouldn't have overdone it.

43
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:02,182
The pain is not going away

44
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,769
That scared me.

45
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,190
Stop playing this.

46
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,275
-Why?
-How did this get on?

47
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,861
What is this?

48
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,279
How did this happen?

49
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,405
All right.

50
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:20,742
Let's go with this, then.

51
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:21,993
Sure, I like this song.

52
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,806
I had a lot of fun with this song.

53
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,105
The Jimin summoning spell.

54
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:57,028
Being summoned

55
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,823
I like this part.

56
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:06,120
I'm almost there, beers.
Hang in there!

57
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:07,872
Let's go!

58
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,796
All right.

59
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,547
Gosh, my knees are killing me.

60
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,350
Let's go, Jung Kook.

61
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,895
Oh, man. It's cold.

62
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,108
- Hello.
- Welcome.

63
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,734
Gosh, it's cold.

64
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,738
This is it.

65
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,616
Open.

66
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:46,869
Welcome.

67
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:47,996
All right, let's go in.

68
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,415
Okay.

69
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,958
Welcome… Wait, no.

70
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,793
- Welcome.
- Hello.

71
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,628
Hello.

72
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,881
Hello.

73
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,925
There's a lot I want to try.

74
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,969
How about we just order this whole set?

75
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,762
Is that lamb, though?

76
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,432
It has both beef and lamb.

77
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,183
Is this too much?

78
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,602
- Let's try it.
- What?

79
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,895
Let's try it.

80
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,107
Ordering the luxury set
that includes different dishes

81
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,483
Also…

82
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,402
I want to eat this.

83
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,653
You want to eat this, right?

84
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:21,738
You would like that one too?

85
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,907
- Yes.
- This one too, please.

86
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,617
- One bowl of cold noodles.
- Yes, please.

87
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,119
-Also…
-Also.

88
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,330
Two draft beers, please.

89
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,540
- Got it.
- Thank you.

90
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,046
This does look good.

91
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,756
- It does, right?
- Yes.

92
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,215
Let's just try it.

93
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,301
I can't wait.

94
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,136
I'm excited.

95
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:48,848
I had a lot of fun today. A lot of fun.

96
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,060
It was a great day,

97
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:56,189
but I think I was too reckless on the ski.

98
00:05:56,272 --> 00:06:00,068
It was difficult
because it was our first time.

99
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:04,489
Exactly, I should've been more careful
since it was my first time.

100
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:07,116
"Regretting his actions"

101
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,494
"The eagerly awaited draft beer"

102
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:10,828
Here are the draft beers.

103
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,414
Thank you.

104
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,500
- Well done for today.
- Well done.

105
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,043
I had fun. It's our last night.

106
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,252
Yes, our last night.

107
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,922
So let me show everyone how I drink this.

108
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,758
Is that really necessary?

109
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:28,721
I'm not doing that
since I don't look my best today.

110
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,314
- It's so good, isn't it?
- Yes.

111
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,442
It's the best. Wow, so good.

112
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,778
It's our first meal today.

113
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,322
It's going to be so good.

114
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,284
"A camera!"

115
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:54,455
There's a camera there.

116
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,541
Outside.

117
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,885
This is the boyfriend shot.

118
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:09,762
- Jung Kook.
- Yes?

119
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,180
This is the boyfriend shot.

120
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,725
But my hair. That's a dummy shot.

121
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,186
No, this is the boyfriend shot, isn't it?

122
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:24,485
The long-awaited meat comes in

123
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:29,782
Is this lamb?

124
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,659
- This is the sirloin…
- The sirloin.

125
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,536
- …and this is the chuck.
- The chuck.

126
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,413
Which sauce do we use?

127
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,248
- First…
- So first…

128
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:40,835
- …try the meat without any sauce.
- Oh, okay.

129
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,545
- I got it.
- Without the sauce.

130
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,763
- It's good to eat now.
- Can we eat now?

131
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,307
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

132
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,933
Let's eat!

133
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,362
How is it?

134
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,248
Here you go.

135
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:24,170
Oh, sorry.
Are we drinking one sip per bite?

136
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,763
Thank you.

137
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,807
Is there more meat after this?

138
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,018
Yes, a lot. There's beef

139
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,187
and another kind of lamb.

140
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,730
Look.

141
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:46,567
This is what we have now.
So we're waiting for this and this.

142
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,613
- I think we made the right choice.
- Yes.

143
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,323
-It's the right amount for us.
-Yes.

144
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,325
"The sashimi comes in soon after"

145
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,827
Hello, I'm the head chef here,

146
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,746
and I have a present for you.

147
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,331
- Really?
- Yes.

148
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,916
Thank you.

149
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:06,462
"The dishes just keep on coming"

150
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,714
This is
Hokkaido's most famous cut of beef.

151
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:12,301
- This is lamb sausage.
- Okay.

152
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,637
This is salmon roe over rice on the house.

153
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,721
Thank you.

154
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:20,977
This is the spare rib,
lamb chop, and tongue.

155
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,521
Wait, what did we order?

156
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,273
- Why won't it end?
- It's all part of the set.

157
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,941
This is the last dish.

158
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,360
- There's too much meat.
- Right.

159
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,654
There's so much
that I don't know where to start.

160
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,365
Do you want to see
how much meat we have here?

161
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,867
This much. We can't eat all of this.

162
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,412
We should share this with others.

163
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,914
Let's try one each.

164
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,082
Okay.

165
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,333
- Is one too much?
- Let's just grill two

166
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,793
of everything.

167
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,170
Did they say
that was the best cut of beef?

168
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,756
- Yeah, this one.
- Should we eat that one next?

169
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,384
Let's put it on the grill now.
The tongue will cook faster.

170
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,178
They said that was
the best Wagyu beef in Hokkaido.

171
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,347
We should eat the best ones
while we're still hungry.

172
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,640
That's right.

173
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,893
-Almost forgot the insert shot.
-I think we ordered too much.

174
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,687
We haven't taken an insert shot yet.

175
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,773
Okay.

176
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:13,279
So this is Hokkaido's best Wagyu.

177
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,282
And what is this?

178
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,367
This is the sausage.

179
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,369
I think that was lamb sausage.

180
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:21,871
What is this?

181
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,708
I don't know.

182
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,877
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

183
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,387
Delicious.

184
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,139
It's really delicious.

185
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:41,849
Looks like this.

186
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,435
"Eating the sashimi as the meat cooks"

187
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,729
They're all a bit different
in color, texture, and taste.

188
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,774
I think this would have a nice chew.

189
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,276
It looks delicious.

190
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,323
Try this one.

191
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,326
Time to try the cow tongue.

192
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,453
I'll have it with wasabi.

193
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,455
Any sauce is good.

194
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,706
The texture is amazing.

195
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,591
Isn't it good?

196
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,802
It has a sort of nuttiness.

197
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,220
Yeah.

198
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:22,723
There's a nice texture
and a nuttiness I like.

199
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,558
It's my first time trying cow tongue.

200
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,021
Oh, yes. Cow tongue, baby.

201
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,195
I'm going to try the Wagyu.

202
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,828
It has an incredibly rich aroma.

203
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,162
What aroma?

204
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,831
The beef aroma.

205
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,749
- The beef?
- Yes.

206
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,835
I like the texture too.

207
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,172
It's good.

208
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,469
We can eat this now too.

209
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,434
"The final dish is here"

210
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,102
All right.

211
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,186
Thank you.

212
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,273
Hey, this was a cold dish.

213
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,066
It's cold? Oh, it's cold noodles.

214
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,651
- I actually prefer that.
- Cold noodles.

215
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,986
Yes, I actually prefer that.

216
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,155
It even has kimchi in it too.

217
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,906
Because kimchi is the best.

218
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,534
-Yes, kimchi.
-We can't live without kimchi.

219
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,286
We really can't live without it.

220
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:33,419
This is like a Japanese version
of cold kimchi noodles.

221
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,466
Thank you.

222
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,347
What's this at the center?

223
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,809
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

224
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:56,817
It has a nice chew.

225
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,712
Hey.

226
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,464
I was going to unbuckle my pants,

227
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,758
but I had already unbuckled them.
I'm that full right now.

228
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,802
Everything's open right now.

229
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,470
Then you gotta take them off.

230
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:25,638
Take off your pants

231
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:26,722
and underwear.

232
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:32,269
Loud and repetitive sounds
make Jimin feel very nervous.

233
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,233
I still have to drink this.

234
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,568
A lone glass in front of Jung Kook

235
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,779
The last drink.

236
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,322
Oh, last drink?

237
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,448
Japanese sake.

238
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,533
Japanese style.

239
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,409
"Traditional sake from the head chef"

240
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,831
Wow, thank you.

241
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:53,666
It's my first time seeing this.

242
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,795
"The crew is here to drink it for them
since they're too full"

243
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,463
- What does it taste like?
- You drank it in one go?

244
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,799
- It's sake, but milder.
- Milder?

245
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,009
- Let me finish this.
- It's very mild.

246
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,302
-Really?
-It's a mild sake.

247
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,512
It's really mild.

248
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:07,930
I'll just have a taste.

249
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,604
It is very mild.

250
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,314
- I like it.
- It's delicious.

251
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,066
- I like this sake.
- Yes, me too.

252
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,901
It's the best sake I've ever had.

253
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,862
My goodness.

254
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,989
I've eaten too much again.

255
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,825
Thankfully, we only had one meal.

256
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,451
But that one meal wasâ€¦

257
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,912
Like three meals in one.

258
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,456
That was great.

259
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,377
Thank you for the meal.

260
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,545
That was delicious.

261
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:40,880
It really was delicious.

262
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:41,964
So delicious.

263
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,799
Should we go, Jung Kook?

264
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:47,803
Oh, my knee.

265
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,430
My knee.

266
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,640
My knee is killing me.

267
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:53,976
My left knee hurts so much.

268
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,854
"The aftermath of skiing
comes crashing in"

269
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,404
That was a great meal.

270
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:11,327
"To the nearest convenience store"

271
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,703
- Jung Kook.
- Yes?

272
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,998
You can get as many
triangle gimbap as you want at the store.

273
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,250
The stores here
don't have those triangle gimbap.

274
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,585
Is that so?

275
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,212
All right.

276
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,304
Hey, hey, hey.

277
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,890
Let's go.

278
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,391
Freeze.

279
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,727
Freeze, freeze, freeze.

280
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:51,742
I'm aching all over

281
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:56,538
Not moving an inch

282
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,754
He's coming.

283
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,763
"Get out here"

284
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:13,847
Okay.

285
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,140
Okay, I will.

286
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,527
I love the convenience store!

287
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,452
Here it is.

288
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,415
What's this? A block of ice?

289
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,667
-Wow, that's a block of ice.
-Yes.

290
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,335
Should we get some ice? It's quite hot.

291
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,670
I want to drink whisky.

292
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:47,548
Let's go.

293
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,383
-Is that all?
-Is that enough?

294
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:53,887
The foodie wants more food

295
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,857
Beer +1

296
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,316
Beer +2

297
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,741
I found the tuna mayo stuff
that Jung Kook likes.

298
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,243
"Anything else?"

299
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,662
I do have some snacks in my bag.

300
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,582
We have enough now.
We'll have another meal later.

301
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,667
We have enough.

302
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,669
- I just need this.
- Let's go.

303
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,004
Let's go now.

304
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:30,049
I'm tired. I want to wash up.

305
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,474
I feel like I'm missing something…

306
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,975
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

307
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,814
"Come on, come on"

308
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:46,940
What are you doing?

309
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:54,281
Standing Next to You

310
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,290
Isn't this it?

311
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:04,374
It's right, no?

312
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,890
Hello.
Can I have a bag?

313
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,975
- Of course.
- Thank you.

314
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,695
"Another shopping spree"

315
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,447
Oh, this one's good.

316
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,117
Wait, chocolate cookies?

317
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,744
"I have to get this!"

318
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,538
It's delicious.

319
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,301
These too, please.

320
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:02,391
Camerawork of excitement

321
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,813
Thank you.

322
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,649
Let's go and eat them all.

323
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,651
All right.

324
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,822
Let's relax a bit when we get there.

325
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,950
Is the jacuzzi pretty big?

326
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,952
It's bigger
than the cold tub from yesterday.

327
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,453
Oh, from yesterday.

328
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:27,332
That's big enough, then.

329
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,668
- That's right.
- Yes, that's big enough.

330
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,211
You have arrived at your destination.

331
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,213
- Are we here?
- What?

332
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,464
We're here.

333
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,716
What happened?

334
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:37,885
We're already here?

335
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,595
Wow, it's pretty here.

336
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,805
It's very close to the restaurant.

337
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:42,890
It's pretty.

338
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,769
Is that even my song?

339
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,271
I don't know.

340
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,023
I just used your lyrics.

341
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,858
It sounded like a Chungcheong-do dialect.

342
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,526
"Standing next to ya."

343
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,570
"Standing next to ya."

344
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,030
I told you not to.

345
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,907
Thank you.

346
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,325
Let's go.

347
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,414
Let's go!

348
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:11,627
This is our last accommodation
for this trip.

349
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,380
Let's go.

350
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,177
We keep groaning.

351
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,346
"Arrived at the last accommodation"

352
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:28,810
What's this?

353
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,813
Which place is which?

354
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,650
Hey, I think this is our room.

355
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,109
No, there are stairs here.

356
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,277
No, look here.

357
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,071
Oh, really?

358
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,240
Doesn't it look like our room right away?

359
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,825
I mean, the camera gives it away
that this is our room.

360
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,494
Oh, yeah?

361
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,914
- I knew when I saw the big beds.
- Right.

362
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,833
- This is our room.
- They gave us pajamas too.

363
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,585
- Which one would you like?
- Me?

364
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,087
I'm good anywhere.

365
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,381
It doesn't matter to me.

366
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,966
Okay, I'll take the one inside.

367
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:00,467
All right.

368
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,805
Which floor do you want to look around?

369
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:08,517
The second floor was
like a living room or something.

370
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,601
Let's go and see.

371
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,354
There were four rooms on the first floor.

372
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,858
Oh, my knees. My knees.

373
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,278
-Wow, what's this?
-Right? This is what I was saying.

374
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,321
Isn't it pretty?

375
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:25,158
Isn't it nice?

376
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,078
- There's something out here.
- It's storage.

377
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,873
-This is storage.
-You sure about that?

378
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,417
You can stay in there.

379
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,626
"It's a trap!"

380
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,047
Oh, okay.

381
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,841
Does it lead to there?

382
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,342
Is this the jacuzzi?

383
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,262
Oh, it's here. This is the jacuzzi.

384
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:46,680
- You're feeling woozy?
- Jacuzzi.

385
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,098
They set it to 104°F.

386
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,850
- I thought you said "woozy."
- Sure.

387
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,727
"Take that!"

388
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,354
Open this right now.

389
00:21:58,734 --> 00:21:59,818
I'm too tired for this.

390
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:06,992
Hello.

391
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,621
Okay, so here's the jacuzzi.

392
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,623
- Should we go down to the basement?
- The basement?

393
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,584
-You didn't go there, did you?
-I wonder what's down there.

394
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,420
While we're up here,
let's put the snacks in the fridge.

395
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,672
Where did you put the rest?

396
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,009
I don't know.

397
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,511
Where did you put the rest?

398
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,347
You only brought the ones for yourself.

399
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,390
No, you were the one who packed these.

400
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,100
- The ice is more important.
- Hang on.

401
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,186
There's just your snacks
and triangle gimbap.

402
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,231
Hang on, hang on.

403
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,400
Where did I put them?

404
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,030
Why did we buy so much stuff?

405
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:46,615
What's this?

406
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:47,991
There they are.

407
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,452
Right here.

408
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:57,584
They're here.

409
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,212
The fridge is pretty big.

410
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,006
That's cold.

411
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,929
Be careful with your joints
while you go downstairs.

412
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,263
Okay.

413
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,307
I'm going to go backward.

414
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,811
Going down the stairs backward

415
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:23,527
This is a long flight of stairs
to the basement.

416
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,326
-Is there no basement?
-No, there isn't.

417
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,539
- So it was nothing.
- It was nothing.

418
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,249
All right.

419
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,835
I brought a lot of snacks.

420
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:44,881
How are you going to eat them all?

421
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,051
And you bought
a whole bunch at the store too.

422
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,511
When are you going to eat them all?

423
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,887
I don't know, man.

424
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,098
- I'm about to throw up.
- I can do it.

425
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,100
What's this? Is this the peanut stuff?

426
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,853
-Yes.
-You ate one and you brought them all.

427
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:01,398
I brought all of these here too.

428
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,152
The ones I bought on the first day.

429
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,780
This is what I ate this morning.

430
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,074
"Try it!"

431
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,159
It's good.

432
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,663
Let me take these upstairs.

433
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,090
All right.

434
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,301
All done.

435
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:30,510
This is nice.

436
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,761
Hey, Jung Kook.

437
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,722
- Jung Kook!
- What?

438
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,892
You're going
in that scuzzi or something, right?

439
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,602
Jacuzzi.

440
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,606
-I don't know, man.
-Scuzzi.

441
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:46,276
But you understood me.

442
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:47,569
You're going in, right?

443
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,653
Why?

444
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,615
I'm just asking.

445
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:52,949
So why?

446
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,367
Can you not understand me?

447
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:57,787
I'm literally just asking.

448
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,414
I'm just asking as well.

449
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,127
"My cute little Jung Kook"

450
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,715
I have one more.

451
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:14,012
Will you go in if I go in? Is that it?

452
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,805
Of course. I'm going in regardless.

453
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,307
- You are?
- It's our last night.

454
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,184
Let's do it for our last night.

455
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,268
Let's go.

456
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,811
Are you ready?

457
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:27,484
Let's give it a go

458
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:31,279
Wow, it's cold.

459
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:32,948
It's cold.

460
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,075
It's so cold outside, Jimin.

461
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,370
We're going to be soldiers soon.
Just soldier on.

462
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:40,705
Watch me.

463
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,040
"Let me show you how it's done"

464
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,959
"Back inside in 0.1 seconds"

465
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,043
Isn't it cold?

466
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,419
That's… frustrating…!

467
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,507
And we can't just jump into 104°F water.

468
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,175
No, we can't jump in.

469
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,552
It's too hot for that.

470
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,307
Unbelievably cold

471
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,102
I can endure hot water…!

472
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:04,813
Wow, that's hot.

473
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:14,447
Unbelievably hot

474
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,450
Oh, man. This is too hot.

475
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,703
It's even hotter
than the one from yesterday.

476
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:20,787
It's that hot?

477
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,667
Oh, no.

478
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,835
Is this really 104°F?

479
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,378
"A suspiciously high temperature"

480
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:30,380
It is, but… Oh, man!

481
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,176
How are we supposed to get in here?

482
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,762
It's too cold. And this is too hot!

483
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,264
Are we sure about this?

484
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,641
A bold entry!

485
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,226
Failed

486
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:52,402
I am strong…! I am strong…!

487
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:56,323
No, I'm not strong…!

488
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,074
How can we get in here?

489
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,953
Gosh, that's hot.

490
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,247
So hot. So hot.

491
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,791
This is not the same temperature
as yesterday's jacuzzi.

492
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,376
We should

493
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,962
cool the water with the air.

494
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,256
"How to survive in a jacuzzi
Step 1. Cool the water in cold air"

495
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:17,886
Step 2. Lower the setting
for the water temperature

496
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:22,682
Step 3. Just tough it out

497
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,602
- Doesn't it feel ticklish?
- Yes.

498
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:26,728
Is it any better?

499
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,818
I want to go in too.

500
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,862
Wow, it's nice.
It's actually nice once you're in.

501
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,207
It's tingling, right?

502
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,753
But my knees feel more relaxed.

503
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,339
Wow, it's nice. It feels great.

504
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:57,384
- Oh, yes, baby.
- I want to go in too.

505
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,223
It's so hot that it doesn't make sense.

506
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,520
Jung Kook.

507
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,439
Just come inside and fight through it.

508
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,486
It's snowing.

509
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:17,821
Oh, you're right.

510
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:18,905
This is nice.

511
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,783
Wow, being in a jacuzzi in Japan
under the snow.

512
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:25,995
This is amazing.

513
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:27,747
I love it.

514
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,545
- I really love this.
- It's hot.

515
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,674
This is nice

516
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:40,009
Wow, this feels nice.

517
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,608
You don't have to be scared.

518
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:07,912
No!

519
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,748
"No, my snow!"

520
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,214
I'm making it longer

521
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,008
and flatter.

522
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,722
Pack it down.

523
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,937
My head is cool now.

524
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:56,419
Where did my snow go?

525
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,797
Are you getting more snow?

526
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,347
Put that on my head.

527
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:25,490
Down with the snow hat!

528
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,950
Aren't you cold?

529
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,744
I'm not cold at all.
It's perfect right now.

530
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,124
No, my snow hat…

531
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,543
The water's really hot.

532
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,044
Yes, it's too hot.

533
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,800
Let's play rock, paper, scissors,
and the loser lies on the snow.

534
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,635
Yeah? The loser lies down face forward.

535
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:46,970
- No, on the back.
- Come on, face forward.

536
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,054
It's colder on the back.

537
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,138
- Is it?
- Yes.

538
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,849
Let's just do one round.

539
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,059
One round of rock, paper, scissors,
lie down, that's it.

540
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,561
- That's it? No more rounds?
- No.

541
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,396
Rock, paper, scissors.

542
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,189
Rock, paper, scissors.
Rock, paper, scissors.

543
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,941
Lie down.

544
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,610
You can lie face forward if you want.

545
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,488
"Is this for real…?"

546
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,407
I'll heat myself up first.

547
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,409
That'll make this harder.

548
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,370
Come on.

549
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,080
Come on, baby.

550
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:18,501
"Do you really want me to do it…?"

551
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,420
Of course

552
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,505
All right.

553
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:23,590
Hurry up and do it.

554
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:25,633
Go lie down on your back.

555
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,010
Let's go!

556
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,680
This is tough.

557
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,516
"Freezing"

558
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,853
- Hey, Jung Kook.
- Yeah?

559
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,860
- Okay. Everyone…
- I'll stand next to you.

560
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,029
Please stay tuned…

561
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,073
for Season 3 of Are You Sure?!.

562
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,411
Let's go!

563
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:56,039
"I can't do it…"

564
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,290
Let me cool you down.

565
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,376
- There you go.
- Okay.

566
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,669
All done.

567
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,588
"Let's go!"

568
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,592
Your legs too.

569
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:12,639
"Frozen"

570
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:13,890
"Tag!"

571
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,025
Oh, my back.

572
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,236
My bottom stings the most.

573
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,238
That was pretty good.

574
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,782
Was it rough?

575
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:31,950
It hurts.

576
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,077
It's so cold that it hurts?

577
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:35,745
It hurts.

578
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,963
Melting his frozen body!

579
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,383
Should we go?

580
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:50,510
Let's go.

581
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,595
I'm properly heated up.

582
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,515
That was nice.

583
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,726
Yes, it was really nice.

584
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,395
It was perfect.

585
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,856
I might go
for a beer right now.

586
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,659
My Happiness Comes from ARMY and Beer
Composed and written by Jung Kook

587
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,881
No, tuna gimbap is too much.

588
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,065
Right.

589
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,152
The can's nice, but…

590
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:57,452
That's my Jung Kook

591
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,225
Want to join?

592
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:24,103
"To. ARMY
Would you… join me…?

593
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:27,065
"Meanwhile, Jimin is exhausted"

594
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:30,109
Going back to Korea tomorrow.

595
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:35,782
If you just watch
my trip with Jung Kook here,

596
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:39,535
you'll know exactly what I do
every day at home.

597
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,996
I'm exactly like this in Korea too.

598
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:49,045
It's hilarious the more I think about it

599
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:55,843
Kookoo.

600
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:56,928
Yes?

601
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:00,389
- So here…
- There's draft beer here too.

602
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:03,309
I brought
a very rare bottle of booze.

603
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:05,311
There's draft beer here too.

604
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,730
This is much better than draft beer.

605
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,857
Let's see how it looks.

606
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,442
Let's drink it.

607
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:14,278
I have one at home too. I know it's good.

608
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,907
My goodness, it looks gorgeous.

609
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:19,617
It's gorgeous.

610
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,369
-It's a good one.
-Gorgeous.

611
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,287
Honey.

612
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,372
They look similar.

613
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:30,002
Hello.

614
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,337
How are you?

615
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,423
"Feeling the whisky with his whole body"

616
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:35,508
Good evening.

617
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,430
That's nice.

618
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,225
- It's delicious.
- Whisky…

619
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:51,649
I want to tell our fans

620
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:53,860
about the time I first tried whisky,

621
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:57,446
but it's TMI,
so I'll share it in a live stream.

622
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,616
When is the live stream?

623
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,910
After I finish my service.

624
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:06,914
After you finish? Not before you go in?

625
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:10,126
You might not even remember
to talk about your whisky story.

626
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:15,631
No, I would recall this moment
the next time I drink whisky.

627
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:19,468
We hope to hear the story someday…

628
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,683
Did you get your physical examination?

629
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,395
No, right?

630
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,064
-We're going together, you know.
-Oh, right.

631
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,029
Let's gather around.

632
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,155
Should we say cheers?

633
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,785
Well done. Thank you, everyone.

634
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:45,912
Thank you.

635
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,374
This has armrests.

636
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:54,462
Should I take this chair home?

637
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:57,006
There's a chair made for you.

638
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,384
I'll take that too.

639
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,930
There's even something to help you…

640
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,390
…stay on the chair.

641
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,476
Let me try sitting on it.

642
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,769
I have a good feeling.

643
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,688
I feel like this is just my size.

644
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,649
I don't think you'll fit.

645
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,360
You don't know. I have a slim pelvis.

646
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,531
One of the cheeks isn't going in.

647
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:27,536
I can't fit.

648
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,914
Why do I feel like I can fit in here?

649
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,461
No, I can't.

650
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:37,463
How would you fit if I don't fit?

651
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:39,715
"I thought I'd fit"

652
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,134
-My butt was unbelievable…
-I spilled some.

653
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,804
…back in the day.

654
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:45,972
What about now?

655
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,391
Now, it's just believable.

656
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:50,434
"Now it's believable"

657
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,478
You know, it's believable.

658
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,899
I'm working hard to sculpt my butt

659
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,986
so our ARMY won't be disappointed.

660
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,697
It'll be out of this world
by the time you see this.

661
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,031
"It'll be out of this world by that time"

662
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,450
Jung Kook and I
are working hard to get ripped.

663
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,411
We're working extremely hard.

664
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,538
-Because we're starting our service soon?
-Yeah.

665
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,999
Yes, that's right.
We're working out a lot.

666
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:14,750
Salute.

667
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,545
Wow, seriously…

668
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:22,300
I just felt this
when I was in the shower just now.

669
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:27,138
I think I enjoyed this trip
as much as I could,

670
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,098
so I'll be more relaxed when I get back.

671
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:33,060
I don't think I would've been that excited

672
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,313
if I saw snow in Korea right now,

673
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,773
so I was unsure if I'd get excited
when I came here.

674
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:41,027
But wow, I was wrong. I love it.

675
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,903
I just love being outside here.

676
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:43,988
On the train too.

677
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:46,782
Yes, it started from the train.

678
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:56,375
I had such a great time.

679
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,086
What will your ranks be
when this is released?

680
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,588
Private.

681
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,799
Do we have
the New York episode with us right now?

682
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,010
- The first episode?
- Should we connect to the TV

683
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,303
and show them the first one?

684
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:08,929
-That sounds fun.
-Let's do it.

685
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,431
-I want to see it.
-Sounds fun.

686
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,851
The special premiere
of Are You Sure?! Episode 1

687
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:17,229
Jimin, it's ready.
It's ready. Let's watch it.

688
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:21,484
We Koreans are determined enough
to make anything possible.

689
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:31,786
Hello.

690
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,496
Did Jung Kook do well today?

691
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:37,750
Season 1 was filmed in July 2023

692
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:40,378
I asked him about making a video
of the two of us traveling

693
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,922
before we start our military service.

694
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:44,340
My hair.

695
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:48,302
-Jung Kook didn't think much about it…
-My hair's so long.

696
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,305
…but he still agreed to it.

697
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,225
I took a 14-hour flight to get here

698
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:55,684
and I was thinking,

699
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,729
"What am I doing?"

700
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:03,317
I briefly wondered
if I made the right choice.

701
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,402
Very briefly.

702
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,654
Come on, yo!

703
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,490
Let's get going!

704
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:10,866
We're already going.

705
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:15,871
I know, but I'm just doing it
for the sake of the video.

706
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,958
- But we're already going.
- Let's get going!

707
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,502
- Let's go.
- Go, go.

708
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:25,714
The reason
why we can't hear Jung Kook that well

709
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:29,176
is that we basically lost all the audio
when you fell in the water.

710
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,433
Since your song is out,
we should listen to it as we go.

711
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,061
Let's have a look
at your performance from today.

712
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:45,734
Did someone beat me up?

713
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,695
Why am I so puffy?

714
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:51,991
You look the same as now.

715
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:53,367
Is that so?

716
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,163
I guess I can't see myself objectively.

717
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,539
I see people.

718
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:21,812
That place didn't feel much like New York.
It was really nice.

719
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,356
"Jung Kook and Jimin's Travel Log."

720
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,233
"The trip started
without the program title"

721
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,027
-How about "Just Jung Ji"?
-"Jung Ji."

722
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,361
"Just Jung Ji" sounds good.

723
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,655
Just Jimin.

724
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,824
Just marvelous Jimin.

725
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,910
Just affectionate Jimin.

726
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,454
It's all Jimin.

727
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:39,955
-It's not.
-I mean…

728
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,958
Why do I always get so childish
in front of a camera?

729
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:45,211
-But that's what makes it so fun.
-I mean, yeah.

730
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,504
I like it.

731
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,631
This all feels like such a long time ago.

732
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,799
We have… Oh, thank you.

733
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,218
That was so delicious.

734
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,303
- It was so good.
- Black and blue.

735
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:55,846
Mine wasn't that good.

736
00:41:56,889 --> 00:42:00,226
-Because you didn't like the cheese.
-I ordered without realizing.

737
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,311
-You didn't like gorgonzola cheese.
-The gorgonzola cheese.

738
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:03,646
I didn't know.

739
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,022
It's a very stinky cheese.

740
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:08,275
I only thought of gorgonzola pizza.

741
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,694
This is the steak sandwich,

742
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,821
this is the California burger,

743
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,490
and this…

744
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:16,408
Mine does look tasty, though. Right?

745
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:17,910
It's a delicious burger

746
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:20,079
if you like the cheese.

747
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:25,376
Gulp

748
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:31,048
Getting hungry watching himself eat

749
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,467
That looks delicious.

750
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:46,647
His face says everything about the food

751
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,945
What is this taste?

752
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:56,198
- It's a bit stinky, right?
- Yeah.

753
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,951
The steak sandwich is cooked medium rare.

754
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:01,745
Let's go.
Let's go, let's go. Are you ready?

755
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,500
- That was really delicious.
- Yes, that one was great.

756
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:10,838
-You ordered that as an extra side.
-Right.

757
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,506
I was so grateful for that.

758
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:15,551
"Finally confessing after all this time"

759
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,930
Crunch

760
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,098
Slurp

761
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:22,474
Slurp slurp

762
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,562
What are those sound effect subtitles?

763
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:28,063
It's fantastic.

764
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,566
"Those subtitles are hilarious"

765
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:32,568
That was delicious.

766
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,408
I only asked for one bite.

767
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:41,910
"I told him I'd eat one bite"

768
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:47,124
It would've been terrible
if you didn't order that.

769
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:49,251
- It was good.
- We devoured that.

770
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,503
We left all the sides.

771
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,671
It was nice.

772
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,131
I loved it.

773
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,717
"Work… Workplace."

774
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,302
"Stop. Stop."

775
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:00,804
"Stop Bus Co."

776
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,223
"Stop Bus Co."

777
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,308
What are you saying?

778
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,226
I remember that.

779
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,773
That's hilarious.

780
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:14,109
"What's wrong with me?"

781
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:16,195
"Stop Bus Co."

782
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,739
I can't read English.

783
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,116
"Embarrassed"

784
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,535
- Shall we go?
- Let's go.

785
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,288
That's when you got flipped over.

786
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:29,708
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

787
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:33,003
- Now I'm going to fall.
- You were so excited.

788
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,885
I don't like that zoom.

789
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:40,969
You're a pro.

790
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:44,890
Hey. Yes.

791
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:46,725
You did get on.

792
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:47,976
Yes, I got on

793
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,437
and then immediately flipped over.

794
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,107
You should never let your guard down.

795
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,983
I'm already leaning.

796
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:58,946
We're going!

797
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,657
Oh ho ho ho ho

798
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,914
And you just left.

799
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:11,959
Wow, you're such a jerk.

800
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,627
"Slightly embarrassed jerk"

801
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:17,214
But I was definitely worried about you.

802
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:19,717
I see it now,
I was leaning from the beginning.

803
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,468
I didn't know then.

804
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,429
It's an entertainment show

805
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,180
and I did just that, entertain.

806
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:29,476
One of the reasons why I was…

807
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,187
Isn't this what you wanted?

808
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:36,066
I must be cursed by water these days.

809
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:39,319
-Yes, it rained back then too.
-This must be a curse.

810
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:41,530
Seriously.

811
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,949
Look at Jimin.

812
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,665
- It's a bird.
- "It's a bird"?

813
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,709
The sky is so beautiful.

814
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,878
I wish Jimin would get flipped over too.

815
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,672
Wow, I really do

816
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,341
look like a jerk.

817
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,427
This is unfair.

818
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,387
I came back after going that far.

819
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:07,347
- It's nice and cool.
- That's good.

820
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:10,225
- You came back.
- I'm happy I created a funny scene.

821
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:11,560
Of course.

822
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,437
You don't have your microphone.

823
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,272
I knew I dropped it.

824
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:16,565
Right.

825
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,073
It's so beautiful.

826
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,286
So beautiful.

827
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:30,454
It really was.

828
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:37,753
Going back to that moment

829
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,384
You were so fast, I couldn't catch up.

830
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:50,432
But you looked a bit awkward.

831
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,559
He's hilarious.

832
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:53,644
Okay, bench press.

833
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:59,191
Right, that was the end.

834
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,823
-The editing is amazing.
-Exactly.

835
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,783
-We paddled for at least 20 minutes.
-Right.

836
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:09,159
You've got power, Jung Kook.

837
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,911
- I loved it.
- I loved it.

838
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,538
- Let's go eat.
- Okay.

839
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,540
What did we eat then?

840
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,166
I don't remember.

841
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:19,169
-Oh, we barbecued.
-Right, at the campsite.

842
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:20,462
Do you remember you…

843
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:22,047
Okay, camping, camping, camping.

844
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,299
It's when you almost died.

845
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,176
"Is that moment finally coming…?"

846
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,553
You didn't know that yet.

847
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,639
He doesn't know what's about to happen.

848
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:33,100
You don't know,
so you're still so happy.

849
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:36,061
It's a lot cooler
and better than I expected.

850
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:37,604
I'm now starting to look more alive.

851
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,398
I know
you're not curious about the bathroom,

852
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:40,482
but I'll film it anyway.

853
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,568
Even if you don't want to know.

854
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,613
It's too bright.

855
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:51,368
The aperture…

856
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,834
- I don't know how to do it.
- You can't do it.

857
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:01,587
What's wrong with me?

858
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,714
You don't know how to do it.

859
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,885
That goes well with meat.

860
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:10,762
He doesn't know what's about to happen.

861
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:16,143
Maybe I was all right until that point
because I hadn't eaten much yet.

862
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:19,771
What exactly went wrong after that?

863
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,692
The pork is being cooked.

864
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:26,028
These are the ones
I marinated in the sauce.

865
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:29,114
I think I dropped one.
Yes, I did drop one.

866
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:30,824
Let me try. Darn it!

867
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,160
"Three-second rule"

868
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:38,624
Jimin is rolling over a lot today

869
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,584
Twice.

870
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,252
I dropped it twice.

871
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,843
-That looks really delicious.
-It does look delicious.

872
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,553
-That looks really good.
-I know.

873
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:55,182
- You can use this for your bowl.
- Okay.

874
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:56,725
Do you have a bowl?

875
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:58,185
No, I'm very quick.

876
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,729
- What does that even mean?
- What does that even mean?

877
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:02,814
I put food in my mouth very quickly.

878
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:05,233
You'd burn your tongue, though.

879
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,655
This can be my bowl.

880
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,365
That'll take forever to eat.

881
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,659
This is like four bowls in one.

882
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,744
And it's disposable.

883
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:22,584
Jimin's joke was funny then
and still is now

884
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:25,045
I'm suddenly really craving ramyeon.

885
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:26,838
Should we eat the motsunabe?

886
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:28,298
The motsunabe?

887
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,759
Can we actually have more whisky?

888
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:32,594
We can. Do you want me to get it?

889
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,638
-Thanks, I'll pause this.
-No, you can watch.

890
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:38,684
Hilarious. This is really fun.

891
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,143
It looks like a fun show.

892
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,561
- Yeah.
- It really does.

893
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:44,272
We were worried a lot
while we were filming it.

894
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,151
Is this going to be okay?
Will they be able to edit this right?

895
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:51,279
We were also a bit worried.

896
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:53,615
But it's fun.

897
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:56,743
It's fun.

898
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,121
Is this how you do it?

899
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:01,832
No, you have to do it like this.

900
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:05,127
This isn't a lot.
Should we put one more in?

901
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:08,672
- The soup is…
- How fat do you want to make me?

902
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:10,590
We need more soup.

903
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,217
Aren't we supposed to add water?

904
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,219
-No.
-This is it, then?

905
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:15,846
Water will come out of the vegetables.

906
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:18,432
Can we at least have a taste?

907
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:21,143
No, this will be good. It'll be good.

908
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:23,061
I'll leave it to you then. I trust you.

909
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:24,563
Yeah, just sit and wait.

910
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:32,112
Is this Jung Kook's cooking show?

911
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,156
"Putting in the chili peppers"

912
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:36,950
Cooking is easy.

913
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:41,705
Kook's Cooking Class Soundtrack - DJ Jimin

914
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:49,796
It feels like I have to go super fast.

915
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,678
Chef Jung Kook: Ahhhhhh

916
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:57,763
DJ Jimin: Let's go again!

917
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,642
Why are you looking at the ramyeon?

918
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:04,895
"Just you wait"

919
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:05,979
Just wait.

920
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:15,155
This is the stuff

921
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:21,536
The last touch.

922
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,246
"Speedily making the sauce"

923
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:27,375
Mr. Jung Kook is
stirring the sauce with his chopsticks!

924
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:35,926
"The sauce is finally complete"

925
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,010
Okay.

926
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:41,389
Speed up again
if you're done with the sauce

927
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,071
He's tasting it!

928
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:01,493
How does the motsunabe taste?

929
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:05,413
It's good. It tastes good.

930
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:07,749
It just needs a bit of this.

931
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,585
It's done. It's delicious.

932
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:21,221
So how come you're adding more stuff?

933
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,561
It's good, it's good.

934
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:33,900
Let's take this
and eat it as we watch the video.

935
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:35,777
Now it's really starting.

936
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,237
"The special premiere continues
with motsunabe"

937
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:41,616
Thank you for this.

938
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,701
Yes, it's good.

939
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:45,203
I was in the bathroom.

940
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:46,496
Hey, Jung Kook.

941
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,541
- Are you finished?
- I almost died.

942
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:52,085
I'm starting to feel a bit chilly.

943
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:55,338
It might actually be a stomach bug.

944
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:57,549
- Maybe it is.
- I think it is.

945
00:52:58,216 --> 00:52:59,217
It's good.

946
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:06,224
Is that what happened?
So it started back then.

947
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,727
What's he doing?
What's he up to?

948
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:11,062
Yeah.

949
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:13,231
Yeah.

950
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,860
I was actually cold at that point.

951
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:19,487
I just suddenly felt cold.

952
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:23,366
Then another incident happened that night

953
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,213
"Jimin's night was full of surprises"

954
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:37,881
He elbowed me on my nose.

955
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:41,176
I got a long bruise right here.

956
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:44,095
You came
all the way here for nothing but pain.

957
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:46,806
I came so far

958
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:49,226
just to get

959
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:50,936
smacked by your elbow.

960
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:53,063
- And get a stomach bug.
- And a stomach bug.

961
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,359
I can't even eat.

962
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,736
Why am I even here?

963
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,114
And I have a fever.

964
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,450
That's hilarious.

965
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:08,578
This is nice.

966
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:10,747
- Did you have coffee?
- Hello, everyone.

967
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,832
- Yes.
- Good morning.

968
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,001
It's nicer here in the morning.

969
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,045
I can see the view better.

970
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:19,047
Wait… He's having fun on his own…

971
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,676
You elbowed me on my nose

972
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,636
-and still had time to enjoy the view?
-Yes.

973
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:26,429
Did you enjoy your coffee?

974
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:27,514
It was great.

975
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,809
You should take some medicine.

976
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,437
At least you got me to take my medicine.

977
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:35,522
Of course.

978
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:36,731
Shall we drink?

979
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,531
Should I build a stone tower?

980
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,409
My stone tower.

981
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:55,208
I made it taller than I thought I would.

982
00:54:58,295 --> 00:54:59,504
This is hilarious.

983
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,131
Please.

984
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,174
Please remove the toxins from my body.

985
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:04,926
Come on, make your wish.

986
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,970
Please remove the toxins from my body.

987
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:09,931
-Okay, next trip.
-Wow, that was fun.

988
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:11,558
It's fun.

989
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,355
It's fun. It's fun, it's fun, it's fun.

990
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:18,940
It was so fun.

991
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,859
- It's fun.
- Yes, it is.

992
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:23,069
Your nose played a big role.

993
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:24,612
We should go to bed now.

994
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:26,865
We have to get up early tomorrow
and drive too.

995
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:28,241
Okay, "Are You…"

996
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:35,874
"Are You…"

997
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:37,667
"This is your second chance"

998
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:39,377
"Are You…"

999
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,634
-"Are You…"
-"Sure?"

1000
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:50,513
It should be elongated.

1001
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:52,474
Or maybe not. Let's try again.

1002
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:54,559
-"Are You…"
-"Sure?!"

1003
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:58,688
Wait, how should I elongate it?

1004
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:00,690
The first season is just "Are You Sure?"

1005
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,275
Second is "We Are Sure!"

1006
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,069
-Yes, "We Are Sure!"
-Exactly.

1007
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:07,280
And the third is "We Are Sure…"

1008
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,740
-"We Are Sure…"
-"We Are Sure…"

1009
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:09,991
Is that not it?

1010
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:13,953
Sigh… I need another drink

1011
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:16,623
"Are You…"

1012
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,542
"Sure?"

1013
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:23,463
"Finishing up
with another one of his jokes"

1014
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,760
"Bye"

1015
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,063
My knees hurt so much.

1016
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:44,609
Mine are better now.

1017
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:46,319
Mine aren't.

1018
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:05,213
Their last night in Sapporo is here

1019
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:15,181
Dozing off

1020
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:18,810
Swaying

1021
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,230
- I'm sleepy.
- Yeah, I'm sleepy too.

1022
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:24,732
- I fell asleep just now.
- Let's go to sleep.

1023
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:27,402
I might snore a little because I drank.

1024
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:28,486
Me too.

1025
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,406
- What?
- Me too.

1026
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:32,991
But you always snore.

1027
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:36,202
I might snore even more.

1028
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:40,415
- Snore as much as you want.
- Don't let your guard down.

1029
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:43,710
I was fine on this trip
because I always fell asleep first.

1030
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:50,884
Sleeping Kookoo: Snoring

1031
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,510
Sleeping Jimin: Wheezing

1032
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:53,803
Sleeping Kookoo: Snoring

1033
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,930
Sleeping Jimin: Wheezing

1034
00:57:56,931 --> 00:58:02,353
Their last night
is filled with their symphony

1035
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:18,328
This town is so pretty.

1036
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:25,084
Jimin woke up early
and is enjoying the view

1037
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:46,940
I should go wake Jung Kook up.

1038
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:49,901
I'm tearing up.

1039
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:06,584
Let me wake Jung Kook up

1040
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:10,171
"So evident that he went skiing yesterday"

1041
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,673
Mine hurt even more.

1042
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:13,550
My upper body hurts more now.

1043
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,635
The front of my neck hurts.

1044
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:20,098
It hurts!

1045
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:25,353
Can't resist hunger even when he's hurting

1046
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,327
I'm eating so much on this trip.

1047
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:04,809
Drinking milk after a soak
in the hot spring is the best.

1048
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:06,936
Jimin, how about another jacuzzi dip?

1049
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:09,314
He's not even answering.

1050
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:17,947
Jimin doesn't like it

1051
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:20,950
when someone touches his head.

1052
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:24,996
But I'm touching it right now.

1053
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,546
Let me spray some perfume.

1054
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:35,548
- Mr. Jung Kook.
- Yes?

1055
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:39,052
Perfume really is essential to any outfit.

1056
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:40,928
- Of course.
- This is how you spray it.

1057
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,182
You don't need to spray a lot.

1058
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:45,892
"A light spray"

1059
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:49,646
Smell it. How is that?

1060
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,481
- I like it.
- Right?

1061
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:54,484
- It's pretty strong.
- This is what a perfume should be like.

1062
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:01,324
Jung Kook sprays a lot

1063
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:07,205
It has a very elegant scent.

1064
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:11,000
This is… How should I say it?

1065
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:15,046
It's something RM would like.

1066
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:19,634
These two are pretty similar.
They're pretty bold.

1067
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,136
I'm getting in the car.

1068
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:27,058
Heave-ho…

1069
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:33,856
Why are you groaning? I guess I did too.

1070
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:39,904
The harsh aftermath of yesterday

1071
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:42,281
-"Are You Sure?!"
-"Sure?!"

1072
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:45,076
Again. Two, three.

1073
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:47,453
-"Are You Sure?!"
-"Are You Sure?!"

1074
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:50,331
All right.

1075
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:55,962
I got too used to driving this way now.

1076
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:57,547
You'll go back to normal soon.

1077
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,801
It'll take about
three hours to get to the airport.

1078
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:03,720
-Let's eat something first.
-Yes, eat first.

1079
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:06,431
- It's 15 minutes until the restaurant.
- Yeah.

1080
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:09,517
We're eating don, right? Like katsudon

1081
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:12,145
- or gyudon.
- Right.

1082
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:14,689
A gyudon and a donkatsu would be perfect.

1083
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:18,109
Deep-fried…

1084
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,237
What was it again?

1085
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:23,156
-What?
-Deep-fried stuff.

1086
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:25,158
What's that in Japanese?

1087
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:26,993
Tempuri? Tempura?

1088
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:29,704
Doesn't tempura mean shrimp?

1089
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:32,373
Tempura is fried shrimp, I think.

1090
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:34,125
So is "pura" shrimp?

1091
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:37,044
-I can look it up.
-Tendon, tendon.

1092
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:38,921
-Tendon.
-Fried don.

1093
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:40,214
Deep-fried food in Japanese is…

1094
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:42,633
It's tempura.

1095
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:45,803
What's fried shrimp, then?

1096
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:47,430
Isn't shrimp ebi?

1097
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:48,723
Oh, right.

1098
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:51,851
You got the correct answer.
It was tempura.

1099
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:53,227
Tempura-don.

1100
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:55,646
- The first prize for getting it right is…
- There's a prize?

1101
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:56,731
How much is it?

1102
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:02,487
The prize is…

1103
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:03,571
How much is it?

1104
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:05,448
Three-day-old coffee.

1105
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:11,078
Thank you so much for driving.

1106
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:13,873
No worries,
I like driving when I'm abroad.

1107
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:14,957
I know.

1108
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:19,754
Driving…

1109
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:22,465
on the opposite side like this

1110
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:24,133
must be confusing.

1111
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:26,469
I actually prefer

1112
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:30,139
small streets like this
a lot more than large roads.

1113
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:31,933
It's more romantic like this.

1114
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:35,686
This is romance,
this is youth, and this is nice.

1115
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:36,938
"Romance, youth, and nice"

1116
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:39,357
Nice!

1117
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:43,778
Is it snowing?
I don't think this is rain.

1118
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:53,496
Incredibly addictive

1119
01:03:57,875 --> 01:04:00,503
"Super Tuna… Tuna is a fish…
Fish makes sashimi…"

1120
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:02,755
The sashimi was great too.

1121
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:08,469
My favorite sashimi was the halibut fin.

1122
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:09,887
That was delicious.

1123
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:11,806
The engawa.

1124
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:14,267
It feels like we're almost there.

1125
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:17,770
We're here.

1126
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:20,773
It only took 10 minutes.

1127
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,235
Let's go and eat.

1128
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:32,910
Mr. Jimin.

1129
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:33,995
Yes?

1130
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:39,834
I don't have energy yet
because I'm hungry.

1131
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:48,134
-Loud and repetitive actions…
-Repetitive actions…

1132
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:50,553
-…make Jimin very nervous.
-…make Jimin very nervous.

1133
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:54,140
Is it this way? To the left?

1134
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:56,434
- Where do we go?
- Isn't it here?

1135
01:04:56,517 --> 01:04:57,518
Is it here?

1136
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:00,229
- How do we go inside?
- Welcome.

1137
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:06,611
Wow, everything's already out.

1138
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:07,695
Thank you.

1139
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:15,244
The food's already out.

1140
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:16,829
Looks delicious. Should we eat?

1141
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:18,706
Yes. There are more options, though.

1142
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:22,460
Let's eat first and then order more.

1143
01:05:22,543 --> 01:05:24,337
Are we starting off with some beer?

1144
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:25,755
Of course we are.

1145
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:27,131
Should we order a few pieces of sushi?

1146
01:05:27,214 --> 01:05:28,215
Sounds good.

1147
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:30,051
We're in Japan. We should eat sushi.

1148
01:05:30,134 --> 01:05:32,178
- Oh, yes.
- Is this it?

1149
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:33,512
Okay.

1150
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,348
"Getting ready to eat"

1151
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:37,558
What should we order? This is sashimi.

1152
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:38,643
"And getting ready to order more"

1153
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:43,481
It's delicious!

1154
01:05:44,398 --> 01:05:47,151
I want to eat this the most.
The eel sushi.

1155
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:48,694
Eel? You should get that.

1156
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:50,863
I want the other one.

1157
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:51,989
The assorted set?

1158
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:53,574
No, the engawa.

1159
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:54,784
"A deep love for halibut fin"

1160
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:56,327
There's sea urchin roe too.

1161
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:59,997
How about we get an assorted set
and two pieces of this?

1162
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:03,084
How about it?

1163
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:05,544
Assorted set and eel…

1164
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:07,880
But I want to eat engawa.

1165
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:12,426
Then let's get the engawa,
this, and a small one of this.

1166
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:14,637
Yes, the small assorted set,

1167
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,473
the eel, the sea urchin roe…

1168
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:19,350
-The engawa.
-…the engawa,

1169
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:21,060
and the salmon.

1170
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:23,646
Try this first. It's good.

1171
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:25,314
Okay.

1172
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:29,068
Let's try this.

1173
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,405
I think I'll be full after this one.

1174
01:06:34,865 --> 01:06:35,950
Let's eat.

1175
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:38,202
Let's eat as much as we want.

1176
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:44,917
Excuse me.

1177
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:46,585
Yes?

1178
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:48,879
This one…

1179
01:06:49,296 --> 01:06:52,591
- Which one would you like?
- Oh.

1180
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:54,301
Ten?

1181
01:06:54,385 --> 01:06:55,636
Is that too much?

1182
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,555
No, that's the medium size.

1183
01:06:57,638 --> 01:06:59,640
Or we can get a small one.
It's up to you.

1184
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:01,100
Let's get ten. Ten, please.

1185
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:03,144
Two pieces of this.

1186
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:04,770
Two pieces of engawa.

1187
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:06,397
Two pieces of sea urchin roe.

1188
01:07:06,897 --> 01:07:08,649
Two pieces of salmon.

1189
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:11,235
We probably
won't need that then. Isn't that too much?

1190
01:07:11,318 --> 01:07:12,778
That makes almost 20 pieces.

1191
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:14,864
Can you eat them all?

1192
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:21,287
Let's just try it.
We can have the rest as takeout.

1193
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:22,371
Right.

1194
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:23,456
That's it.

1195
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:25,708
Draft beer too, please.

1196
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:28,669
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1197
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:34,633
What's this? Let's try it.

1198
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:37,261
Is this an eggplant?

1199
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:42,516
A mushroom.

1200
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:48,647
What's this?

1201
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:53,319
Is this a squid?

1202
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:54,904
Is it a squid?

1203
01:07:56,363 --> 01:07:57,364
What's this?

1204
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:00,910
-It's good.
-Yes.

1205
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:03,454
I like the shishito peppers.

1206
01:08:05,372 --> 01:08:06,874
Fried mushroom.

1207
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:10,169
Fried mushroom.

1208
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:15,299
It's good. Delicious, right?

1209
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:16,675
Right.

1210
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:18,844
I've had one of each.

1211
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:20,262
Okay.

1212
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:22,681
Thank you.

1213
01:08:23,682 --> 01:08:25,684
Wait, this means I can't drive.

1214
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:27,603
Don't worry about it.
Just enjoy your drink.

1215
01:08:27,686 --> 01:08:29,021
I'd feel too bad if I did.

1216
01:08:32,733 --> 01:08:34,485
I'm torn. Should I drink this or not?

1217
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:36,195
Because you have to drive?

1218
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:38,114
Yes, that

1219
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:40,658
and also for my figure too.

1220
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:43,160
When do you go back to America?

1221
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:44,245
Tomorrow.

1222
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:47,123
-What?
-I'm flying to America tomorrow.

1223
01:08:47,873 --> 01:08:51,001
It's a great opportunity,
but it's still hard, isn't it?

1224
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:52,086
It is.

1225
01:08:57,216 --> 01:08:59,510
The sushi set is here.

1226
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:01,220
Wow, the timing is insane.

1227
01:09:02,179 --> 01:09:03,806
Thank you.

1228
01:09:03,889 --> 01:09:04,974
Excuse me.

1229
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:06,392
Yes?

1230
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:09,311
- What's wasabi in Japanese?
- Wasabi is Japanese.

1231
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:11,230
More wasabi, please.

1232
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:12,898
Wow, engawa.

1233
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:14,817
This is engawa.

1234
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:16,694
Amazing, isn't it?

1235
01:09:16,902 --> 01:09:18,487
-Is that your favorite?
-Yes.

1236
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:27,580
So good.

1237
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:30,791
I love wasabi so much,

1238
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,128
especially with salmon.

1239
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:38,966
Sea urchin roe.

1240
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:41,427
"They even eat alike"

1241
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:46,307
My dear sea urchin roe.

1242
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:53,439
Is this good too?

1243
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:54,732
Yeah.

1244
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:57,026
"Eating Jung Kook-approved sea urchin roe"

1245
01:09:57,109 --> 01:09:58,110
Isn't it good?

1246
01:09:58,444 --> 01:09:59,445
Isn't it awesome?

1247
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:01,947
Wow, it's delicious.

1248
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:09,246
I used to not like sea urchin roe at all.

1249
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:10,414
I should have filmed this.

1250
01:10:10,497 --> 01:10:13,584
"A last-minute attempt at insert shots"

1251
01:10:15,836 --> 01:10:17,796
This one's already cleared.

1252
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,006
They're in his mouth.

1253
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:25,429
Let's play rock, paper, scissors

1254
01:10:25,512 --> 01:10:29,225
and the winner gets to choose
the order in which we eat these sushi.

1255
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:30,476
-We eat what we want?
-Yes.

1256
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:31,727
-With no resentment?
-None.

1257
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:33,270
-Okay.
-Just say "Eat!"

1258
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:34,438
Rock, paper, scissors.

1259
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:36,815
I'll start, then.

1260
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:41,320
I'll go for one more sea urchin roe.

1261
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:43,322
This one's texture is amazing.

1262
01:10:45,282 --> 01:10:46,408
Rock, paper, scissors.

1263
01:10:47,534 --> 01:10:48,661
What do you want to eat?

1264
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:50,496
Me? I want eel.

1265
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:53,165
You like engawa, so…

1266
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:55,167
That's not engawa, that's just halibut.

1267
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:56,710
Aren't they the same thing?

1268
01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:59,338
Engawa is halibut fin.

1269
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:01,924
I'm torn between these two.

1270
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:04,718
I'll go for the belly.

1271
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:06,929
So this one's your next choice?

1272
01:11:07,471 --> 01:11:08,931
-Yes.
-Take it, then.

1273
01:11:09,014 --> 01:11:10,266
"Showing generosity to the younger one"

1274
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:13,352
I actually want this one.

1275
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:18,274
Salmon roe.

1276
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:21,443
You don't have to dip this in soy sauce.

1277
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:25,364
The best salmon
I've ever tasted in my life was…

1278
01:11:26,323 --> 01:11:29,660
Do you remember that time in America

1279
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:32,955
-when Jin caught all that salmon?
-Yeah.

1280
01:11:33,038 --> 01:11:34,415
That was the best salmon.

1281
01:11:34,498 --> 01:11:35,499
Really?

1282
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:38,877
I didn't even like salmon back then,
but I ate a lot.

1283
01:11:40,087 --> 01:11:42,464
This one
actually kind of tastes like tuna.

1284
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:43,924
-Eel.
-Eel, yes.

1285
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:46,302
-This one's just…
-It's my last piece.

1286
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:54,143
"No more sushi"

1287
01:11:54,226 --> 01:11:55,477
We ate all 20 pieces.

1288
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:58,439
I got a message from Jin.

1289
01:11:58,522 --> 01:11:59,523
Really?

1290
01:11:59,606 --> 01:12:01,942
"Jimin, you were in my dream today."

1291
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:04,278
Wow, Jin.

1292
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:09,575
"Meanwhile, Jung Kook
is debating over the beer"

1293
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:11,869
- You didn't drink it yet?
- No.

1294
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:13,787
Then I'll just…

1295
01:12:14,872 --> 01:12:16,707
take a sip.

1296
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:20,753
"Drinking ASMR"

1297
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:22,379
Is it amazing?

1298
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:28,427
Is it good?

1299
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:30,596
Yes, it's a nice palate cleanser.

1300
01:12:31,096 --> 01:12:32,973
Do you want anything else?

1301
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:34,933
No, I don't.

1302
01:12:35,893 --> 01:12:38,395
Sea urchin roe…
The sea urchin roe looks good.

1303
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:41,023
There's deep-fried pollack roe too.

1304
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:43,400
- What?
- Fried pollack roe.

1305
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:45,235
Ordered more sea urchin roe
and deep-fried pollack roe

1306
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:47,112
Thank you.

1307
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:48,614
I'll have this

1308
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:50,240
with rice.

1309
01:12:55,829 --> 01:12:58,165
It's perfect with rice.

1310
01:12:58,665 --> 01:12:59,958
Is it that good?

1311
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:01,543
Yes, it's incredible.

1312
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:02,753
Let me try some.

1313
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:04,880
Come here.

1314
01:13:05,506 --> 01:13:07,132
The fried batter is great too.

1315
01:13:07,466 --> 01:13:08,467
Isn't it good?

1316
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:11,845
Come here, you.

1317
01:13:13,263 --> 01:13:14,890
I'll take the sea urchin roe.

1318
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:16,683
I'll take the beer.

1319
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:18,519
-All right.
-All right.

1320
01:13:18,602 --> 01:13:20,562
All right.

1321
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:23,607
I bet pollack roe and sea urchin roe
go well together.

1322
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:35,577
That was a great meal.

1323
01:13:38,163 --> 01:13:40,249
This is the best pollack roe
I've ever had.

1324
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:42,918
It abducted all my rice away.

1325
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:44,503
Why, you little…

1326
01:13:47,047 --> 01:13:48,382
Done.

1327
01:13:48,465 --> 01:13:51,009
The noir film, Catch the Rice Abductor

1328
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:52,302
- Did you get rid of it?
- I did.

1329
01:13:52,386 --> 01:13:54,221
"Rice Abductor Unit Jung Kook"

1330
01:13:54,304 --> 01:13:58,183
Rice Abductor Unit Jimin

1331
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:00,394
Bring it into custody.

1332
01:14:01,645 --> 01:14:03,105
These darn rice abductors.

1333
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:05,190
Wow, that was so great.

1334
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:07,109
That was amazing.

1335
01:14:07,192 --> 01:14:08,444
We managed to finish everything.

1336
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:11,780
Let's go!

1337
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:12,865
"To the last destination, the airport"

1338
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:14,867
I'll make sure you have a safe journey.

1339
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,285
It's an honor.

1340
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:21,915
The snow's melting.
Perfect timing, on the day we leave.

1341
01:14:25,335 --> 01:14:26,336
All right.

1342
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:28,380
Let's go, then.

1343
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:33,594
When will it snow in Korea?

1344
01:14:33,677 --> 01:14:36,805
We'll get to clean a lot of snow
when we start our military service.

1345
01:14:38,098 --> 01:14:39,433
Jin texted me.

1346
01:14:40,392 --> 01:14:42,060
You said he had a dream about you.

1347
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:43,729
He said it was about me in the military.

1348
01:14:44,229 --> 01:14:46,148
That's not a dream. That's reality.

1349
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:48,192
It's a premonition, then.

1350
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:49,443
Right.

1351
01:14:49,526 --> 01:14:52,446
Why wasn't I in the dream
when we're going together? I'm hurt.

1352
01:14:54,114 --> 01:14:56,200
There's no need to be hurt.

1353
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:59,495
We'll be in there for another year
after Jin comes out of service.

1354
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:00,579
That's right.

1355
01:15:01,371 --> 01:15:03,165
Jin really did go early.

1356
01:15:03,248 --> 01:15:04,625
Yeah.

1357
01:15:04,708 --> 01:15:06,835
Our service will feel long

1358
01:15:08,378 --> 01:15:10,255
when his service is over.

1359
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:11,340
Right.

1360
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:14,885
I want
to go back to the first day of our trip.

1361
01:15:16,803 --> 01:15:17,804
That mountain isâ€¦

1362
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:20,599
-Maruyama.
-Covered in fog and snow.

1363
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:26,563
You always feel a bit down
at the end of a trip, right?

1364
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:27,940
Yeah, I guess.

1365
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:29,024
Right?

1366
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:34,196
Trying to get hyped up again

1367
01:15:35,656 --> 01:15:37,574
Yeah.

1368
01:15:38,492 --> 01:15:39,660
There are a lot of trees.

1369
01:15:39,743 --> 01:15:41,328
"Even when they engage in small talk"

1370
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:42,454
Very dense.

1371
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:43,539
Why?

1372
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:45,624
-It's pretty.
-Why?

1373
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:47,209
It's pretty.

1374
01:15:49,461 --> 01:15:51,922
Even when they play music

1375
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:59,429
Even when they dance passionately

1376
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:10,148
They can't seem to get hyped up

1377
01:16:12,776 --> 01:16:13,777
All right.

1378
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:16,321
"Initiating the last resort"

1379
01:16:18,031 --> 01:16:19,116
That feels nice.

1380
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:21,785
That's nice.

1381
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:24,329
I feel alive.

1382
01:16:25,789 --> 01:16:28,292
This is it! I like it!

1383
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:29,668
"The cold Sapporo wind makes them talk"

1384
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:32,045
No, this is too cold. I can't do this.

1385
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:33,547
No, we can do this.

1386
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:37,801
We can do this!

1387
01:16:38,218 --> 01:16:39,469
Endure it!

1388
01:16:41,179 --> 01:16:43,181
Wake up!

1389
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:47,394
"Jung Kook opens the back window
when Jimin is distracted"

1390
01:16:50,397 --> 01:16:51,398
All three of them

1391
01:16:51,481 --> 01:16:53,442
are open except for this one.

1392
01:16:55,068 --> 01:16:56,486
Be stronger!

1393
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:57,904
-Be stronger!
-Let's be stronger!

1394
01:16:57,988 --> 01:16:59,448
Aren't we in this together?

1395
01:16:59,906 --> 01:17:01,491
We have to endure it.

1396
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:03,201
It'll be cold in the military as well.

1397
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,663
-Let's go!
-We have to endure it.

1398
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:08,040
This is what's romantic.

1399
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:09,333
Nothing's romantic here!

1400
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:11,501
There's no romance in me!

1401
01:17:16,173 --> 01:17:18,216
I love this show so much.

1402
01:17:18,675 --> 01:17:20,385
I love it too.

1403
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:24,348
There's so much I liked
about all of our trips.

1404
01:17:24,431 --> 01:17:27,893
Honestly, these were the best trips

1405
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:31,188
I've had in my life.

1406
01:17:31,271 --> 01:17:34,066
I liked climbing.
That was fun.

1407
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:36,109
Racing too.

1408
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:39,363
- We rode boats too, right?
- Right.

1409
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:42,491
We went out on the ocean.

1410
01:17:46,244 --> 01:17:47,579
I remember the motorcycles.

1411
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:48,914
Of course.

1412
01:17:49,414 --> 01:17:50,540
That was fun too.

1413
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:52,501
I liked that it was so cold here.

1414
01:17:52,584 --> 01:17:53,960
"The three different destinations…"

1415
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:56,505
Snowboarding was…

1416
01:17:56,588 --> 01:17:57,839
"Were filled with many experiences
and adventures"

1417
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:59,424
…harder than I thought,

1418
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,093
but I enjoyed skiing a lot.

1419
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:05,931
Honestly, eating took up
more than half of these trips.

1420
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:07,641
It was great
that we had lots of great food.

1421
01:18:07,724 --> 01:18:09,017
Yes, that's true.

1422
01:18:09,434 --> 01:18:11,895
We're creatures of habit.
I'm hungry already.

1423
01:18:31,915 --> 01:18:34,042
I really enjoyed myself.

1424
01:18:36,086 --> 01:18:40,382
It's like we were on a trip
but not on a trip at the same time.

1425
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:43,176
It was all over the place,
and that's what made it fun.

1426
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:45,679
Am I sure?

1427
01:18:45,762 --> 01:18:50,809
"Jimin & Jung Kook's travel log
broke down the boundaries…"

1428
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:52,436
This is Am I Sure?!, Are We Sure?!,

1429
01:18:52,519 --> 01:18:54,104
Are They Sure… Are You Sure?!

1430
01:18:54,187 --> 01:18:57,399
"Between everyday life and travel"

1431
01:18:57,482 --> 01:18:59,317
It was short

1432
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:01,945
but very impactful.

1433
01:19:02,028 --> 01:19:05,115
I was actually starting
to find these things a bit bothersome.

1434
01:19:05,699 --> 01:19:07,784
But this was an opportunity
to break away from that

1435
01:19:07,868 --> 01:19:12,289
and dive headfirst into these trips
for the first time in a while.

1436
01:19:12,789 --> 01:19:19,045
They wholeheartedly enjoyed
their three journeys

1437
01:19:20,505 --> 01:19:24,843
Traveling makes you happy
without even realizing it.

1438
01:19:25,343 --> 01:19:28,430
I hope you're enjoying yourself too.

1439
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:30,348
I hope you're enjoying your lives.

1440
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:33,393
We're probably enjoying ourselves
right now too.

1441
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:36,897
Salute.

1442
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:46,490
- I had a lot of fun.
- That was great.

1443
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:50,118
We're going to go safely back to Korea.

1444
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:51,912
Let's travel like this again

1445
01:19:52,412 --> 01:19:53,830
when we get a chance

1446
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:55,582
in the future.

1447
01:19:55,665 --> 01:19:56,875
We can reboot this.

1448
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:58,376
-We should.
-Yes.

1449
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,004
So long, Sapporo!

1450
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:02,714
Goodbye!

1451
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:03,924
You were beautiful!

1452
01:20:04,591 --> 01:20:06,218
- Jung Kook.
- Jimin.

1453
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:09,971
- "Are You Sure?! Huh?"
- "Are You Sure?!"

1454
01:20:11,723 --> 01:20:13,141
You shouldn't say "huh."

1455
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:17,979
Are You Sure?!

1456
01:20:21,733 --> 01:20:23,985
Well, everyone.
Let me tell you about traveling.

1457
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:27,614
If you can enjoy your trip
even when you go through stuff like me,

1458
01:20:27,697 --> 01:20:28,782
then you can go.

1459
01:20:29,699 --> 01:20:33,286
But if you get angry at this stuff,
then you don't deserve to go.

1460
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:36,957
You should enjoy it no matter what.
Am I right?

1461
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,125
-Yes, you were great. I respect you a lot.
-Look at me.

1462
01:20:39,209 --> 01:20:40,335
"Are You…"

1463
01:20:41,711 --> 01:20:43,755
"Sure?!" You have to do it with me.

1464
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:46,299
Could you do a harmony?

1465
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:47,884
No.

1466
01:20:48,051 --> 01:20:50,470
-"Are You Sure?!"
-"Sure?!"

1467
01:20:53,765 --> 01:20:56,393
"Are You Sure?!"

1468
01:20:57,143 --> 01:21:00,605
"Are You Sure?!" Let's go like this.
Like, "Yes, you're sure."

1469
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:01,690
I'm hungry.

1470
01:21:02,941 --> 01:21:04,651
"A letter from beyond"

1471
01:21:04,734 --> 01:21:06,444
"Are You Sure?!"

1472
01:21:06,778 --> 01:21:07,779
"Are You…"

1473
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,240
- "Are You Sure?!"
- "Sure?!"

1474
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:13,952
