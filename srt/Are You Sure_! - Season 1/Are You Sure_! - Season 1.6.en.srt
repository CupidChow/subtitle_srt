1
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:20,020
Are You Sure?!

2
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,271
Flight Information
Time until arrival, 0:03

3
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,777
Peeking

4
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,286
It's snowing.

5
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,163
There's snow.

6
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:43,585
I'm excited.

7
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,964
I want to go snowboarding.

8
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,969
It must be cold outside.
There's ice everywhere.

9
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,471
- It's cold.
- Yes.

10
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,891
It's been a long time
since I came to Sapporo.

11
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,770
Almost seven years, I think?

12
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,316
Apparently, we subconsciously said

13
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,652
that we wanted to come to Sapporo.

14
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:14,949
I remember visiting briefly
years ago for work.

15
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,869
We made some
great memories here back then,

16
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,288
like relaxing in a hot spring
under the snow.

17
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,540
I just wanted
to see Sapporo's scenery again

18
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,834
because of the fond memories
we made last time.

19
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,837
-And we went to Tokyo for our first trip.
-Yes.

20
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,589
That's why I wanted to come back.

21
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,682
Season 3 of Are You Sure?!

22
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,227
is now beginning.

23
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:44,938
Let's go.

24
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:48,858
We've arrived.

25
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,944
Come on, slow down for me.

26
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,821
"Let's begin the third trip
for Are You Sure?!"

27
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,287
We have arrived

28
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,414
in Sapporo.

29
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,669
What kind of adventure
will we have this time?

30
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:10,130
Will we be sure
about this trip or not?

31
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,422
I'm curious.

32
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,092
The weather

33
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,344
is nice.

34
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,930
Exactly what I want for winter.

35
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,559
Why does it smell like hotteok here?

36
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,102
- A little.
- Right?

37
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,186
Yes.

38
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,941
Do you see anything?

39
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,694
Yes, I can see a lot.

40
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:33,778
Thank you.

41
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,490
"Their first accommodation in Sapporo"

42
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,576
Welcome, welcome.

43
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,369
Welcome aboard.

44
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:44,956
What's up?

45
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,252
The streets are all covered in snow.

46
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:50,920
I love it.

47
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,590
- That's what I like.
- There's a subway right out front.

48
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:57,218
I know I can't dive into
the snow from this height, but it's great.

49
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,303
It's been a while.

50
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,017
There's beer.

51
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,810
There's beer here.

52
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,020
Yes, this is it!

53
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,779
I love it.

54
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,114
Cheers.

55
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,245
This is the stuff.

56
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:25,914
This is it.

57
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,752
Wow, this…

58
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,546
- You're starting out with beer?
- This sausage looks delicious.

59
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,341
I like this pungent smell.

60
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,343
Are we getting any food at all?

61
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,095
Is 11 p.m. too late for that?

62
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,180
Yes.

63
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,641
Let's go to a convenience store.

64
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,019
"He can't hear while eating"

65
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,146
This sausage is insane.

66
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,981
I think…

67
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,779
it's because of all the fat.

68
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,587
"How does it taste?"

69
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,672
It's salty.

70
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,800
Isn't it good?

71
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,426
You want beer now, right?

72
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,844
I do.

73
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,638
But I finished it all.

74
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,017
Beer!

75
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,104
Beer tastes so good after that sausage.

76
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,188
-Right?
-Yes.

77
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,482
-I told you.
-It's like

78
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:37,360
getting rewarded
after going through a rough time.

79
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,988
This is also beer.

80
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,866
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

81
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:51,833
You know my album's coming out, right?

82
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:52,959
- Yes.
- I filmed

83
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:56,296
a performance of one of the songs
with little kids.

84
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,256
Yes, I saw the video.

85
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,549
I told them

86
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,510
- to just call me Jimin, you know?
- Right.

87
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,470
But then they wrote me a letter.

88
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,972
Did they call you Mr. Park?

89
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,474
-No, "Uncle Jimin."
-Uncle Jimin?

90
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:12,020
I kept telling them to call me by my name,
and they kept calling me Uncle Jimin.

91
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,896
Those rugrats.

92
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,482
Kids obviously have a sense of age too.

93
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,860
- I'm old enough to be an uncle now.
- Of course.

94
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,612
I was exactly 20 years older than them,

95
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,614
-hence "Uncle."
-"Uncle Jung Kook."

96
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,534
That sounds wrong.

97
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,663
- Let's go.
- Are we really going out?

98
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,831
- Yes.
- Are we really?

99
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,000
Yes, I want triangle gimbap.

100
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,587
I ate just one and now I'm craving beer.

101
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,255
-Is it salty?
-Yeah, but it's good.

102
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,882
It's tasty.

103
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:48,973
Let's hurry.

104
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:50,850
Go.

105
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,560
Let's go.

106
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,355
Come on, don't forget the camera.

107
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,693
- I completely forgot.
- Think about your job.

108
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,155
Right, we're filming a show right now.

109
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:06,574
We're off.

110
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,619
Let's go!
Where's the convenience store?

111
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,538
Oh, wow.

112
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,415
Wow, it feels like Christmas.

113
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,209
You know we have to salute now…

114
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,543
-What do you mean?
-…on Christmas?

115
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,836
I know.

116
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,757
They begin their military service
on December 12, 2023

117
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,928
Salute!

118
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,854
That should be our intro.

119
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,651
Or a teaser video
at the end of the episode.

120
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,028
I love this!

121
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,738
When will this show come out?

122
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:55,331
It's so icy

123
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,058
"Embarrassed"

124
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,143
Oh, man.

125
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,867
Convenience store, convenience store.

126
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:32,827
It's freezing.

127
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,370
This is great.

128
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:41,294
Serious contemplation

129
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:44,797
Here it is.

130
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,508
Here's the basket.

131
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,428
This one is insane.

132
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,138
It's amazing.

133
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,768
I swiped all the tuna mayo.

134
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,647
What's insane?

135
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,232
I got everything I wanted.

136
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,444
You have to try the triangle gimbap I got.

137
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,904
You'll love it.

138
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:11,532
I just want one more. Which one?

139
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,288
This one.

140
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,377
These are really good.

141
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,302
-Let's just buy four cans.
-Okay.

142
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,476
-This is enough, right?
-Yes.

143
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,560
Okay.

144
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,979
These would taste great after a shower.

145
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,272
I told you we should do that.

146
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,857
We can just go wash up now.

147
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,359
But these will get cold.

148
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,487
Why are you so angry these days?

149
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,447
It's for the show.

150
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,823
I can take all of your anger.

151
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,786
Thank you.

152
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,329
Thank you.

153
00:08:58,829 --> 00:08:59,956
Let's go.

154
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:07,880
Setting up the midnight snacks
after a shower

155
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,800
Great.

156
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:12,927
All done.

157
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,308
Is this what you recommended?

158
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,352
It might taste bland at first,

159
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:24,397
but you feel the deeper taste
as you eat more.

160
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,316
Are they all the same?

161
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,277
Yes. Tuna mayo.

162
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,571
It's tuna mayo, right?

163
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,406
Yes.

164
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,287
It's good, right?

165
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,667
This is good.

166
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,128
Isn't it very rich?

167
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,421
It's delicious.

168
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,633
I love it.

169
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:56,220
Didn't we eat this a lot
at that restaurant last time?

170
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,305
Yes, yes, yes.

171
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,307
We waited for an hour and a half.

172
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,975
- I went there today.
- Mm.

173
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,519
-Was there a long line?
-There was a long line.

174
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,147
-Yes, I was in line the other day too.
-Mm.

175
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,482
We were the first two members to go there

176
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,484
after I asked Taemin about it.

177
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,529
-Really?
-Yes, that's why we went there.

178
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,115
We ate, then walked to Shibuya.

179
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,117
-Did we?
-I don't know how we walked

180
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,203
since Shibuya is like
20 to 30 minutes away by car.

181
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,747
-Really?
-Yes.

182
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,750
-I think it took us 30 minutes on foot.
-Right.

183
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,501
Didn't your feet hurt because of that?

184
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,129
-Yes, I was wearing dress shoes.
-Right.

185
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:31,505
My feet did hurt.

186
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,840
Shall I dig in?

187
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:34,967
It looks delicious.

188
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,430
It's so good.

189
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,352
Here's to gaining more weight.

190
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:45,978
It's okay.

191
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,230
You only live once.

192
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,650
-Well done for today.
-It was great.

193
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,777
I'm just… never mind.

194
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:56,530
Wow, Sapporo.

195
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:57,782
Oh, yes.

196
00:10:58,866 --> 00:10:59,867
Delicious.

197
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,382
It's so good.

198
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,141
- I like this one.
- Right?

199
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:27,978
I told you it had a deeper taste.

200
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,855
"Advocating tuna mayo's deeper taste"

201
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,399
I can eat at least three of these.

202
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,608
-Right?
-Yes.

203
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:40,616
Immediately clears two triangle gimbap

204
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,911
I understand what you mean now.

205
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:44,995
Good.

206
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:49,917
I'm going like this.

207
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,669
So delicious.

208
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,256
Back in Korea…

209
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,592
- Yeah.
- …I only ate once a day to keep my figure.

210
00:11:58,676 --> 00:11:59,677
Yeah?

211
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,054
And I didn't get that hungry then.

212
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,432
But my appetite's going crazy here.

213
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,059
That's good.

214
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,856
We're supposed to stop eating
after feeling a slight satisfaction.

215
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,526
But I actually end up eating
five portions more.

216
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,988
I'm not even kidding.

217
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,322
You go to the extremes.

218
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,615
That's what happens.

219
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,076
I only stop eating
when I can't possibly eat anymore.

220
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,621
I should've been on Problematic Men.

221
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,167
Yes, as the problem.

222
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,418
Right.

223
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:35,212
"How much can Jung Kook eat?"

224
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,131
"How much more will he eat?"

225
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,842
And I'd be upset
if RM doesn't get it right.

226
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,553
I don't think he can get it right.

227
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,349
RM actually wrote me a letter
for the first time

228
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,351
when I did my showcase.

229
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,687
- Really?
- Yes, a short one.

230
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,147
Is that so?

231
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,899
That's so sweet of him.

232
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,859
He said some nice words.

233
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,319
Nice words?

234
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,654
-What were they?
-Like…

235
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:06,327
he didn't know how to treat me
because I was the youngest,

236
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,581
and that he felt a lot of things
while watching me,

237
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,666
that I looked the coolest that day.

238
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,126
That's deep stuff.

239
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,254
Did he write it
on the day of the showcase?

240
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,589
-Yes.
-Did he come?

241
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:19,799
Yes, with flowers.

242
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,927
He stayed until the end.

243
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,595
I couldn't go because of my schedule.

244
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,056
It's all right, you were busy.

245
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,474
But I did watch it.

246
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,809
Thanks.

247
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,186
Our members…

248
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,735
I almost reached all the way there

249
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,362
for another triangle gimbap.

250
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,863
I didn't mean to.

251
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,032
Just eat it.

252
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,951
That's hilarious.

253
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,413
"Here you go"

254
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,498
You can eat this.

255
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,960
This is my third one.

256
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,589
Mm.

257
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,677
We shouldn't sleep right away.

258
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,804
I didn't sleep much last night,

259
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,597
so I think I can sleep well.

260
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,558
Good night, everyone.

261
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,144
Season 3 of Are You Sure?!.

262
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:17,815
Our Sapporo trip is about to begin.

263
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:23,112
Everyone, please pray for me

264
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,614
so I won't eat so much tomorrow.

265
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,991
"Dumping his worries on others"

266
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,536
Did you find out how to turn this off?

267
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,081
It's obviously this,
can't you see?

268
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,165
That wasn't it.

269
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,585
No?

270
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,379
- It's here.
- "Master."

271
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,925
I think it's this one.

272
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:47,469
It is.

273
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,054
That's right.

274
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,019
I turned the AC on because it's hot.

275
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,771
Turn it off.

276
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,233
"A light show to remind him"

277
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,860
- Turn it off.
- Okay.

278
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:06,864
Go to sleep now!

279
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,668
We have 20 minutes left.

280
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,047
- What?
- We have to leave in 20 minutes.

281
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,970
"Jung Kook is up"

282
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,997
I immediately looked
for the triangle gimbap.

283
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,457
"What's left of last night's feast"

284
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:05,756
I have to wash up.

285
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,557
Sapporo's pretty cold.

286
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,601
It's pretty cold.

287
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,022
Oh, wow! It's snowing!

288
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:24,942
It's snowing.

289
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,363
I'm going to start anew today…

290
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,993
and watch what I eat.

291
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,245
Look how puffy my face is.

292
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:37,579
Amazing.

293
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,207
My face feels good.

294
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,420
"First step of skincare: Toner"

295
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,923
Today, I'm going to savor my food

296
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,842
and try not to drink.

297
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,054
Why do you keep drinking so much, man?

298
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,265
Come on.

299
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,642
When Jimin's done washing up…

300
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,478
"Second step of skincare: Lotion"

301
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,109
We have to go…

302
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,363
on a long journey.

303
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:22,082
Jung Kook is currently doing
his skincare routine

304
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,460
It's snowing!

305
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,712
- Yeah?
- It's snowing.

306
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,214
There's more snow than yesterday.

307
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,216
It's still snowing.

308
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,137
No, I was wrong.

309
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,640
When it snows
during our military service…

310
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,725
Yes?

311
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,727
…I think I'll recall this moment.

312
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,817
Right now, we're watching
the snow from a hotel window

313
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,319
but soon we'll have to sweep it up.

314
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,870
That's a lot of snow to sweep up

315
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,048
Dark ones don't suit me.

316
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,132
I'm going with this.

317
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,057
It doesn't suit me.

318
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,693
It would be better
if I wear this higher up my nose.

319
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,695
This is probably my best.

320
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,406
Or maybe not.

321
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,451
I made my choice.

322
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,619
The color suits my outfit.

323
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:41,912
"Jung Kook's final final pick"

324
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,457
It's snowing.

325
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,632
I want to cut my bangs.

326
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,761
-Don't you want to get rid of your hair?
-Really?

327
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,263
Not by you.

328
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,348
I saw it in your eyes.

329
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,226
I can wear just about anything.

330
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,478
Okay, let's go.

331
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,650
That suits you.

332
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,026
It took a while to choose.

333
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,862
- What?
- It took a while to choose.

334
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,281
I feel great.

335
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,826
- My sunglasses…
- Come here, Mr. Jung Kook.

336
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,786
- What?
- Come over here.

337
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,871
What is it?

338
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,665
Let's take one last shot

339
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:30,127
since we made some memories here.

340
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,922
Say cheese. One, two, three.

341
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,510
It's going to look funny.

342
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,595
Yeah.

343
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,889
Should I just take random shots?

344
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,143
Is it okay if my hands are shaky?

345
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,561
Yes.

346
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,479
It'll have its own vibe.

347
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,315
- Blurry photos?
- Yes.

348
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,774
"Finally leaving
after some blurry pictures"

349
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:53,859
Let's go!

350
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,821
I'm excited.
I just love winter.

351
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,657
This is what I wanted to see.

352
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,160
I love it.

353
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,244
Wow, snow.

354
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,872
I can see my breath.

355
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,132
-I guess the ice melts in the morning.
-Mm.

356
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,009
-Right.
-The ice is gone.

357
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,763
And the temperature
is different from last night.

358
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,266
It's definitely warmer than the evening.

359
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:38,987
I love snow.

360
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:44,117
I was worried we wouldn't get to see any,

361
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,037
but we did.

362
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:49,873
Crunch, crunch.

363
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:50,958
Whoa!

364
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,834
This is great.

365
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,671
Isn't it great?

366
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,756
-What?
-The air.

367
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,800
The smell of winter.

368
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:02,886
Oh, this smell.

369
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,930
"Breathe in, breathe out"

370
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,556
I only smell food.

371
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,850
-That's right.
-Where's the winter smell?

372
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,186
- This is it.
- What are you talking about?

373
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,689
-The smell of food in cold weather.
-No.

374
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:17,192
-That greasy smell.
-That's not the smell of winter.

375
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,695
But it's snowing here.

376
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,363
This is winter, you know.

377
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,533
-But it smells like food too.
-I love this.

378
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,119
This is great.

379
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,205
I'm so happy.

380
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,582
I think it's here.

381
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,959
- Yes.
- Look at this.

382
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,045
- Doesn't that "Shin" mean spicy?
- Yes, "Shin."

383
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,047
"Shini…"

384
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,173
"Shini u…"

385
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:43,176
"Shini u… me…"

386
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,305
- "Men"?
- Isn't that "hi"? What is that?

387
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,723
I think that's "men."

388
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:49,891
"Shini umen."

389
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,227
- Oh, it's this.
- Yes.

390
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,729
But it should be smaller, then.

391
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,272
Oh! That's "ra."

392
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,149
- Oh yes, it's "ra." Yes.
- "Ramen."

393
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,900
- So it's "Shin Ramen."
- Right.

394
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,485
"Shin Ramen 24."

395
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,779
"Shini Ramen."

396
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,950
Wow, these look amazing.

397
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:11,079
It's akai… akai… akai ramen.

398
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,164
Let's just go in.

399
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:14,291
Akai ramen. Wait, is it "akai"?

400
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,667
- Hello.
- I don't know.

401
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,045
For two, please.

402
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,588
- Please sit where you'd like.
- Okay.

403
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,967
It's exciting.
I'm so excited.

404
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,178
Let's choose our menu.

405
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,596
Is there a menu?

406
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,139
- It's over there.
- Ah.

407
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,223
I see.

408
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,643
- Over here.
- Ah.

409
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:36,646
- Alright, look at this.
- Let's translate.

410
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,607
Let's be smart and use tools.

411
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,029
You can choose now.

412
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,697
- Are they all ramen?
- Yes.

413
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,324
This one's miso.

414
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:48,533
This is miso?

415
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,035
Is this the salt one?

416
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,245
I'm going for the second one.

417
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,998
There's also chashu don.

418
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,042
There's beer.

419
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,672
- What are you getting?
- Just anything spicy.

420
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,343
I'll go first.

421
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:07,719
1,000 yen's already in.

422
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:10,972
And mine…

423
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,852
I want to add something.

424
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,774
This is all one order anyway.

425
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:23,193
Let me just do it.

426
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,320
Done.

427
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:29,616
- Which one's the chashu?
- It's this one.

428
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:32,369
- Where's the egg?
- I also added scallions.

429
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,663
I don't need scallions. Is there no egg?

430
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:35,747
No.

431
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,083
I'll go with chashu don then.

432
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,794
And then the receipt.

433
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:41,878
"A smooth order"

434
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:42,963
Grab the change too.

435
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,714
Please choose the spiciness level.

436
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,342
- Dangye seven please.
- Level seven.

437
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,222
I'll have level four.

438
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,641
"Wait a minute…"

439
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,685
Isn't dangye Korean?

440
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,771
I just said dangye, and not "level."

441
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,524
- Level five?
- Yes, level five, please.

442
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,608
Okay.

443
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,069
I know I have to eat less,

444
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,822
but I can't help it
if the food's too delicious.

445
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,658
Do you prefer the left side of your face?

446
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:12,742
Why?

447
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,494
I want to be on the right side.

448
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,497
You can sit here. I don't mind.

449
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,207
- You don't mind?
- No.

450
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:20,959
Thank you.

451
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,254
I gave up on my face.

452
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,633
You can be the pretty one.

453
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,051
Okay.

454
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:38,059
This place has such a nice vibe.

455
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,853
We're making memories already.

456
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,023
I'll look back on this last trip
when we're in our military service.

457
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,609
Seat number eight.

458
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:48,195
"Customer Number 8"

459
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,489
I'm number nine.

460
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:51,823
"Customer Number 9"

461
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:56,077
"Making memories out of everything"

462
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,705
I have to stop.

463
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,582
You don't have to stop.

464
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,251
It's all for your happiness.

465
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,881
Everyone,

466
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,635
my face is even puffier
than it was yesterday.

467
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:16,181
Please observe how much
a human face can change over three days.

468
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,977
I'm going to eat a lot.

469
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,772
I'm worried mine's going to be too spicy.

470
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,649
-What level did you order?
-Level seven.

471
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:28,443
Level seven spicy miso.

472
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,488
You shouldn't start the day
with such spicy food.

473
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,995
The chashu

474
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,581
looks so pretty.

475
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:44,876
It looks delicious.

476
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,796
I can see the one that's clearly yours.

477
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,256
It's so red.

478
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,218
- The right one's mine.
- Yes.

479
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,679
Spicy miso with chashu.

480
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,222
Here, please.
Thank you.

481
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:58,306
Enjoy.

482
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:03,979
There's a ritual
that Jung Kook makes me do every time.

483
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:10,193
"Jung Kook's ritual"

484
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,867
Spicy miso with chashu level seven.

485
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,287
Thank you.

486
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,330
Is this the spicier one?

487
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,749
This is level seven,
the spicier one.

488
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,626
Level seven?
This is level seven?

489
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,795
- Yes.
- We have to swap.

490
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,297
Your scallion.

491
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,465
I have to film it again.

492
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,259
Lots of scallions.

493
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,844
"Jung Kook's ritual 222"

494
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:36,928
That's good.

495
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,221
I'll try the soup first.

496
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,395
-It's delicious.
-Is it?

497
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:46,479
Yes.

498
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,363
How is this like Shin Ramyun?

499
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:59,492
- Chashu?
- This is chashu don.

500
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:00,910
Thank you.

501
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:01,995
It's really good.

502
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,042
-I'll film the chashu don too.
-Level seven was just enough.

503
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,169
It's Shin Ramyun level.

504
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,253
Chashu don.

505
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,088
Level seven is the Shin Ramyun level.

506
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:17,969
Yes, this is the stuff.

507
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,433
Pour a little soup on the rice.

508
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,360
Can I try some of your rice?

509
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:34,444
Yes.

510
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:38,156
-It's better if you eat it with some soup.
-Okay.

511
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,118
A spoonful following Jung Kook's advice

512
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,248
It's delicious.

513
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,335
Delicious.

514
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,713
Should I also get a chashu don?

515
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,092
Where's our money?

516
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,010
"Off to order another chashu don"

517
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,224
Let me try your soup.

518
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,109
I think

519
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,444
mine tastes better.

520
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:27,622
It's so delicious

521
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,249
It's delicious.

522
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:30,875
Very delicious.

523
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,003
Hello.

524
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,547
My nose was sweating.

525
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,009
- Chashu don.
- Thank you very much.

526
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,430
"A chashu don for me"

527
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,641
It has just the right amount

528
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:47,851
-of rice.
-Yes.

529
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:49,978
There's a lot.

530
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,242
I'm stuffed.

531
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:05,702
I'm really full too.

532
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,164
One last bite of rice with noodles.

533
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,457
Just chashu for me.

534
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,083
A chashu here too.

535
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,468
I definitely prefer rice over noodles.

536
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:24,596
I'm Team Rice.

537
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,391
That was a great meal.

538
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,393
Thank you for the meal.

539
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,189
I'm so full.

540
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,399
I finished the rice

541
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,276
and also the ramen.

542
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,278
"Everything cleared"

543
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,322
That was awesome.

544
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:45,825
That was awesome. Now to get some air.

545
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,082
That was great.

546
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,003
So delicious.

547
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:58,505
The best.

548
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,174
I love this.

549
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:02,425
Should we walk a bit?

550
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,177
Where should we go?

551
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,512
- I love this.
- Hang on.

552
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,931
- What?
- I'm wearing a T-shirt underneath,

553
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,307
so all the wind is getting to me.

554
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,643
My arms are cold.

555
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,311
- Toughen up.
- What?

556
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:15,897
You should toughen up.

557
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,066
It's really pretty out here.

558
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,651
Gosh, it's cold. It's cold.

559
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,779
You're wearing all that and you're cold?

560
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:25,406
-You're the one who should toughen up.
-Toughen up.

561
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,367
"They got over the cold"

562
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,453
The vibes here are amazing.

563
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,330
I love it.

564
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,708
I usually hate walking,

565
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,585
but I like it in the winter.

566
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:39,337
You hate walking.

567
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,798
I do, but it's okay in the winter.

568
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:46,094
I feel like I can eat more
now that we've walked a bit.

569
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,178
No.

570
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,264
It's because you didn't finish your rice.

571
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,851
You'll regret it later
when you're in the military.

572
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,103
"Oh, I should've finished
that chashu don."

573
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,359
I really want to come here again someday.

574
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,237
Sapporo's the one for me.

575
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,656
-What?
-Sapporo's the one.

576
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,158
The vibes are great here.

577
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,078
How long has it been since we came here?

578
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:16,291
We were doing those
Hi Touch events back then.

579
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,959
-Yes, we did events.
-That was when.

580
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,670
-We saw little kids too, remember?
-That's right.

581
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,049
Has it been like six or seven years?

582
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,725
There it is, the station.

583
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:36,895
Sapporo Station.

584
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,939
I love it here.

585
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:41,774
We have 50 minutes left.

586
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:42,984
That long?

587
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,738
I've never been
on Japanese subways before.

588
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,865
I've been on a Shinkansen train.

589
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,535
I think Thailand's train system

590
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,579
-is called BTS.
-That's right.

591
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,415
BTS!

592
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,669
50 minutes, though.

593
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:07,300
Don't they sell any station snacks?

594
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:11,846
It'd be nice to eat something warm
in this cold weather.

595
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,641
-Like walnut cakes in Korea.
-How about some coffee?

596
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:15,850
Let's go get coffee.

597
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,936
-Coffee?
-Yes.

598
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:22,231
I usually don't drink hot Americano,
but I feel like I should drink one here.

599
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,316
Right.

600
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,611
How do you say "hot" again?

601
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,321
-Ata… atatakai?
-Atatakai?

602
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:31,449
"Hot" is atsui.

603
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:34,410
Hot, hot coffee.

604
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,537
Two, please.

605
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,581
- Is it here?
- Yes.

606
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,131
Two Americanos, please.

607
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,300
- Americano?
- Yes.

608
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:53,763
"Using all the words they know"

609
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,516
Doesn't this look good?

610
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:02,313
It looks delicious…

611
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:03,773
No, I have to resist.

612
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,901
Resist. Resist.

613
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,240
Everyone's studying here.

614
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,534
We shouldn't disturb them.

615
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:24,419
Came outside to show off his sunglasses

616
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,881
Thank you.

617
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,758
Thank you.

618
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,016
Thank you.

619
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:42,061
"Where's Jung Kook?"

620
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,652
Thank you.

621
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:53,865
"So warm"

622
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,284
Let's go.

623
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,286
Wow, this coffee…

624
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,747
feels different.

625
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:05,209
It's been a while since I've had
warm coffee in a cold place.

626
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,294
Me too.

627
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,130
I always drink iced coffee.

628
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,549
"Sapporo makes everyone drink warm coffee"

629
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:14,010
This means I'm old now.

630
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,094
There's…

631
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:18,097
something charming
about drinking warm coffee

632
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,348
in cold weather.

633
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,725
Yes, it's charming.

634
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,727
Don't you just love it?

635
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,241
I tried this on some cats,
and not one of them came to me.

636
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,285
It was all a lie.

637
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:42,080
Please stop making videos about that.
It doesn't work.

638
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,998
I tried every kind of "ma-ah,"

639
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,334
but they never came to me.

640
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:51,130
People with pure souls like me

641
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:55,051
take the risk of embarrassing ourselves

642
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,512
and try the "ma-ah" whenever we see a cat.

643
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:03,768
And you should see the way
those cats look back at us.

644
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,062
I love this.

645
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:08,940
"I just love everything here"

646
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,024
So good.

647
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,409
- Kookoo-san?
- What?

648
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,494
- Kookoo-san?
- What is it?

649
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:22,912
Shall we go?

650
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,833
I think those kids recognized us.

651
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,294
It's because you're so popular these days.

652
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,712
Isn't it because of you?

653
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,131
-I was behind you.
-What?

654
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,507
I was way behind you.

655
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,719
- Let's go.
- Did they recognize me?

656
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,644
This is Sapporo Station.

657
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:55,653
Sapporo Station

658
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,488
There are too many people here,

659
00:35:58,614 --> 00:35:59,866
so we'll get going.

660
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,492
We'll see you on the train.

661
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:02,577
Bye.

662
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,997
We're on a train!

663
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,625
Come on, everybody!

664
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:11,210
You walk too fast.

665
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,712
You have to go at my pace today.

666
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,463
But we have to hurry.

667
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:17,967
How do I do this?

668
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,219
"Replaced with illustrations
due to privacy issues"

669
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,638
It's fun. This is fun.

670
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,188
I'm filming on my phone, not the camera.

671
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,733
Ta-da

672
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,445
"Ta-da 222"

673
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,407
There are so many people.

674
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:47,038
"Where are we?"

675
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,504
That scared me.

676
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,176
"Look at that"

677
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,221
"Got you"

678
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,308
"I won't be fooled!"

679
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,188
It's here.

680
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,857
- Is that our train?
- Yes.

681
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,984
Do we just get on?

682
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,864
We're at A.

683
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,950
It's nice.

684
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,201
Yeah, it's nice.

685
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,285
I like it.

686
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:28,704
It's going great.

687
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:30,498
That hurt.

688
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:36,587
This is great. I haven't been
on a train like this in a while.

689
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,059
It's like we're in an anime.

690
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:51,852
-Right now?
-Yes.

691
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,605
You're the male lead?

692
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,315
I'm totally the male lead right now

693
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,109
who's going through a breakup.

694
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,737
Sentimental

695
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:04,573
We're listening to a Japanese song,
and he's really into it.

696
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:08,327
You know how they do this?
They look outside and…

697
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,413
"Wait… The female lead…!!!!"

698
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,292
Then they say
that they left something at home.

699
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,960
No, that's not it.

700
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,045
Then they get off the train and run back.

701
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,255
-Right.
-Something like that.

702
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:24,093
Male lead mode ON

703
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:28,514
Have you seen the clips
of golden retrievers crying?

704
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:29,890
Yeah.

705
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,392
"Brrrrr"

706
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,691
Sniff

707
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,651
Brrrrr

708
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:50,286
It's so pretty here.

709
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,041
There's the sea.

710
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,252
-The sea. The sea.
-Oh, yeah.

711
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,172
- Wow, it's like a movie.
- Whoa!

712
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:03,215
Incredible.

713
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,143
That's awesome.

714
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,107
This reminds me of Spring Day.

715
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:54,266
Let's go.

716
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:01,524
There's just one boulder over there.

717
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,317
How is that possible?

718
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,029
How is there just one?

719
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,782
Hang on, this is how you photograph it.

720
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:23,754
This is nice.

721
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,216
The sea really is pretty in winter.

722
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,394
Nice picture.

723
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:43,732
It's so pretty with the sunlight.

724
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,708
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

725
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,795
We have departed from Sapporo Station…

726
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,926
And we're arriving in ten,
no, five minutes.

727
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:14,555
Thank you for choosing
to travel with us, everyone.

728
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:18,684
"Basically saying they've arrived"

729
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,401
- Are we here?
- We're here.

730
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:29,236
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

731
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,404
That was great.

732
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,743
That was
a short but therapeutic moment.

733
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,870
We are here!

734
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,206
Where are we?

735
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,707
This is…

736
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,501
Sapporo.

737
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,006
She's so tiny.

738
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:55,346
When I think about having a daughter,

739
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,265
I just…

740
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,060
I'm getting teary already.

741
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:02,144
What?

742
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:06,148
I might cry every day if I had a daughter.

743
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,608
Why would you cry?

744
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,652
"You can't grow up!"

745
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,612
"You can't grow up."

746
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:13,739
She's so adorable.

747
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,413
There's a climbing place here.

748
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,790
-Let's go.
-What?

749
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:23,916
Let's go climbing.

750
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,501
That wasn't our plan.

751
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,419
I've climbed enough last time.

752
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,300
-Oh, wow.
-Is this it?

753
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,177
This is our car?

754
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:36,929
They drive on the left side here.

755
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,348
I'm a bit scared driving on the left side.

756
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,433
I did try it one time.

757
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,685
I'll try it now.

758
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,979
It's hard. Is this your first time?

759
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,064
- It's hard.
- I'm not even on the correct side.

760
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:48,399
- Is this your first time?
- Yes.

761
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,025
It's a lot tougher than you think.

762
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,987
I'll ride shotgun, then.

763
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,488
I actually have some experience.

764
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,408
- You're a left-side veteran.
- That's right.

765
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,159
Change my mindset.

766
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,495
Left-side driving.

767
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,289
Let's do this.

768
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,965
- It sounds like RM.
- It is RM.

769
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,550
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

770
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:23,058
Safe driving, Kookoo-san.

771
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,727
-Okay.
-Okay.

772
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,353
-Okay.
-Okay.

773
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:29,315
I have to drive carefully
because of the snow.

774
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,066
You can go slow.

775
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:37,323
It feels great driving on a snowy road.

776
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,911
- Wow, it's beautiful here.
- I know.

777
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,747
How is this place so pretty, Jung Kook?

778
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,373
Exactly.

779
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,833
It's just beautiful.

780
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,636
I like this song. It's cute.

781
00:43:58,719 --> 00:43:59,887
Jimin's playlist
Hate You - Jung Kook

782
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:10,814
You were great singing live.

783
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,485
-Nah, it wasn't that great.
-You surprised me so much

784
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:16,153
that I threw my phone.

785
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,738
What?

786
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,949
I was watching it and…

787
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,462
That's cute.

788
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:35,297
- Is it waving at us?
- Yes.

789
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,549
It's crying.

790
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,885
It must be listening to Hate You.

791
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,720
That car must be listening to Hate You.

792
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:43,305
That's why it's crying.

793
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,437
"Choosing the next song"

794
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:55,234
It's ridiculous
that he made a song titled Super Tuna.

795
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:57,903
Jimin's playlist
Super Tuna - Jin

796
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:01,865
How did he think of this?

797
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:09,707
It's bad news if it's a shark.

798
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:22,052
Are you watching the music video?

799
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,470
Yes.

800
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:24,638
It's hilarious.

801
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:30,227
So bizarre.

802
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:31,854
"Flap-flap."

803
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:39,069
Did you enjoy that, Jimin?

804
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,113
He's such a weirdo.

805
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:43,365
Everyone on our team is a weirdo.

806
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,409
I'm probably the most normal.

807
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:46,910
No, you're weird too.

808
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,370
Is that so?

809
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:50,581
Who sets the standard for "normal" anyway?

810
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,249
Don't be angry. That's just life.

811
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:53,542
Who sets the standard?

812
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,919
"Super Tuna is stuck in his head"

813
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:59,381
Our fans say that Super Tuna
is the only BTS dance they can do.

814
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:02,801
This is something only Jin can accomplish.

815
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:04,511
I want to listen to that.

816
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:07,473
What?

817
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,266
Wow, it's beautiful.

818
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:10,517
"Which song did Jimin choose?"

819
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,436
Do you remember this song?

820
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:14,813
Jimin's playlist
Christmas Day - Jimin & Jung Kook

821
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:17,357
Replaced with another song
due to copyright issues

822
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,244
My voice was so different back then.

823
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,538
Mine was very different too.

824
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:36,126
I think all of our members' voices
changed throughout the years.

825
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,378
I used to write lyrics by the Han River

826
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:39,838
in front of the restrooms.

827
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,900
I sound like a kid here.

828
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:04,613
We were so young.

829
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:09,117
19-year-old Jimin: Merry Christmas

830
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:11,161
That freaked me out. Did I really do that?

831
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:15,207
What was that?

832
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:18,418
That was a shocker.

833
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,795
We're here.

834
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:20,879
After feeling shocked, they have arrived

835
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,005
Shall we go?

836
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,674
"Whisky Distillery"

837
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,968
- This place is so pretty.
- I know.

838
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:28,470
It's like
we're in a Christmas fairy tale.

839
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,889
Want me to take your photo?

840
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:32,724
You don't need the flash, right?

841
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:34,226
No, it's bright enough here.

842
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:38,063
Take one of me.

843
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:40,899
One, two, three.

844
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:57,624
You don't look like a kid, but it's cute.

845
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:00,544
I do look like a kid.

846
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,090
It's snowing a lot.

847
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:07,885
It's snowing so much. I love it.

848
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,261
It's all crunchy.

849
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:22,024
Hello! Season 3 of Are You Sure?!.

850
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:26,194
We had some amazing ramen for breakfast.

851
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:27,738
Had quick cups of coffee.

852
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:30,157
Quick cups of coffee,
and now we're going to get some whisky.

853
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,326
It's snowing a lot right now.

854
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:33,744
Can you see?

855
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:35,787
Can you see the snow?

856
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,416
Wow, the snow here

857
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:41,919
is amazing.

858
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:44,129
Look at our clothes.

859
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:48,133
The snow's piling up on our jackets.

860
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,886
I love it.

861
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,389
-It's great.
-I love it.

862
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,099
Insane.

863
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:59,645
It's so beautiful here.

864
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:03,482
The 20% of me that's an F is taking over.

865
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:04,650
Aren't you an F?

866
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:07,194
- I'm 80% a T.
- Oh, you're a T and an N.

867
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,946
-No, an S.
-An S?

868
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:10,948
-Really?
-Yes.

869
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,616
I got 80% on T.

870
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:14,493
I'm an F.

871
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,454
- MBTI is not that important.
- Right.

872
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,123
This is great.

873
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:24,127
Wow, I really want
whisky now because it's cold.

874
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:26,004
Getting your insides warm.

875
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,763
The snow… The snow is…

876
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:39,142
"It's snowing too much to be sentimental"

877
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:43,981
The snow keeps getting into my eyes.

878
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,983
Yes, and in my clothes too.

879
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:48,819
The angle's just right for that.

880
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:51,655
It's just right, and now we're freezing.

881
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:53,573
Look at us right now.

882
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:57,703
I think we might die here.

883
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:59,746
I need to go inside.

884
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:00,831
I normally like the cold.

885
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,874
But this is too cold.

886
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,668
I like the cold a lot,

887
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:07,462
but this is almost blinding me.

888
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:09,089
It feels even colder.

889
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,215
Is it here?

890
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,509
- No?
- No.

891
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:13,635
It's not here?

892
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:16,054
How far do we have to go?

893
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,681
How far are we going?

894
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,474
How far up are we going?

895
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:20,559
Where is it?

896
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:21,935
"Where on earth is it…?"

897
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,020
I think it's there.

898
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,771
"Nikka Museum."

899
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,024
It says "Nikka Museum" here.

900
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:30,736
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

901
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:32,320
Finally going inside.

902
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,532
Look at our clothes.

903
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,579
Let's go. It'll melt when we're inside.

904
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:43,290
Wow!

905
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:45,876
Whoa!

906
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,135
-What is this?
-"Casks."

907
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,553
So they name it after the type of wood.

908
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:57,971
This is made from cherry wood.

909
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,057
- What's this one?
- This is a plum wood cask.

910
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,559
-"Bourbon"?
-This is chestnut wood.

911
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,394
That means chestnut?

912
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:05,520
Yes, chestnut wood.

913
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,147
Are you sure it's right?

914
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,399
It's chestnut wood. Isn't it?

915
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,902
A lot of whiskies are made

916
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:14,237
with plum or chestnut wood.

917
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,448
Let's get in there first.

918
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:18,325
There's a lot of stuff here.

919
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:23,997
So that's how it looks.

920
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:26,458
That must be the process.

921
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:28,460
Like this.

922
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:29,711
Let's see.

923
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,173
- Hey, come here.
- What?

924
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:34,925
You can read it like this.

925
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:39,763
Translating with the phone

926
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:41,264
There's a description here.

927
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:45,477
"It's crucial to capture every ingredient
to create a harmonious flavor."

928
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,561
Let's go.

929
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:49,481
-Let's go.
-"From the flavor itself…"

930
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:51,274
Okay.

931
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,611
This looks cool.
What is it? What does it say?

932
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:57,906
Jimin stops again after a few steps

933
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:59,574
It's over 20 years old?

934
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:02,828
You can read it all like this.

935
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:05,872
"Year 1965."

936
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:08,375
Okay.

937
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,505
A room with a pot still and a tasting bar

938
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:15,632
Is this a bar?

939
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,135
Please, thank you.

940
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:19,636
Thank you.

941
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:23,306
What is the most famous whisky here?

942
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,560
This Yoichi 10-year-old
single-cask whisky is the most famous.

943
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:29,563
- 10 years old.
- He says this one's the most famous.

944
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:30,981
-Should we try this?
-Sure.

945
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:34,067
- We'll have two of these.
- Two.

946
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,111
Sounds great.

947
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:38,780
Thank you.

948
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:39,865
"Whisky samples served right up"

949
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:45,078
You have to say hi to it.

950
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:46,621
Hello.

951
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,915
- Why do you have to say hi?
- How are you?

952
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,335
Is it lunchtime?

953
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,920
Good afternoon. Mm.

954
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,130
Good.

955
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:57,883
You have to do all this.

956
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:00,510
"Finally tasting it after a long hello"

957
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:09,853
It's great.

958
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:13,648
It's delicious.

959
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:14,733
It's good.

960
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:25,160
How about some jazz music,
like we're at a jazz bar?

961
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:28,413
Then they'd give us a free drink
sent to us from someone from the bar.

962
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:30,290
Something like this?

963
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,751
"At a Jazz Bar in Sapporo, Scene #1"

964
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:34,544
You're ridiculous.

965
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:39,299
This has already been paid for.

966
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:42,052
Could you ask them to pay for this too?

967
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:43,762
I don't have any money.

968
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:46,056
Can they buy another one for me?

969
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:47,724
"The show is finished"

970
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:49,684
Should we go? Are you good?

971
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:50,977
- Not yet.
- Okay.

972
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:56,233
He's taking a long time
to drink so little.

973
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:58,818
-Oh, I'm…
-I have to savor it.

974
00:53:58,902 --> 00:53:59,903
I'm sorry.

975
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:02,155
He heard me.

976
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:04,199
This is cute.

977
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:06,785
I want to buy one.

978
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:08,078
Buy it.

979
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:10,163
But it's cute.

980
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:12,707
I said you should buy it.

981
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,584
You have to buy it at the shop.

982
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,628
-The shop?
-Yes, not here.

983
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:20,757
This is great.

984
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:23,426
So relaxing.

985
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:24,552
Let's go.

986
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:25,637
"Still some left"

987
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:27,806
I'll go ahead, then.

988
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:29,808
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

989
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,688
Did he really leave?

990
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:37,565
Mm.

991
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,070
Thank you.

992
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:44,823
That was delicious.

993
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:48,785
"Jung Kook leaves
after savoring every last drop"

994
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:49,869
Where do I go?

995
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,371
Nikka, Nikka.

996
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:55,000
You didn't pay for the samples.

997
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:58,211
"You go"

998
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:02,382
Being a good older brother

999
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:05,760
Excuse me.

1000
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:13,643
I'd like to pay.

1001
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:15,353
Oh, no. Sorry.

1002
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:16,479
Cash only.

1003
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,106
Oh, I see.

1004
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:21,401
Younger brother comes with the cash

1005
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:22,485
Let's go.

1006
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:26,823
The set of three from earlier.

1007
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:27,949
Where is it?

1008
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,285
I don't know where it is.

1009
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:31,453
I don't see it.

1010
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:34,205
This is it. This is it.

1011
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:35,957
- Is it this one?
- Yes.

1012
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,584
This,

1013
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,002
this,

1014
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:40,211
and this.

1015
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:42,172
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1016
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:44,507
This one.

1017
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,763
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1018
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:52,891
Insert here, please.

1019
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:56,770
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1020
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,313
"Shopping complete"

1021
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:01,316
I got them.

1022
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:05,695
I got them.
I got them. I got them!

1023
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,030
Are you happy?

1024
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:08,156
Let's go!

1025
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:10,283
Let's go, Jung Kook!

1026
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:13,119
It's way less cold now.
Maybe because it's not very windy.

1027
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:14,204
I love it.

1028
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,206
This is great.

1029
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:20,418
I like that the ice here
isn't too slippery.

1030
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:22,003
Yes, it's quite soft.

1031
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:25,048
Snow should sound crunchy.

1032
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:26,966
That's what snow is all about.

1033
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,635
If this isn't snow,

1034
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:29,886
-then what is?
-Then what is?

1035
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,263
This isn't snow.

1036
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:34,182
This is water.

1037
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:35,975
This is snow.

1038
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,230
This is great.

1039
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:42,357
I love it, I love it.

1040
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,829
Hurry up

1041
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:15,056
A puppy excited by the snow

1042
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:24,232
"Grabbing some snow"

1043
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:27,318
Wow, this place is so…

1044
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:29,904
Wow, this place is so…

1045
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,241
"Dumbfounded"

1046
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:36,411
-Did you feel it?
-Yes.

1047
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:38,246
I only threw a little.

1048
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:39,622
What are you trying to pull?

1049
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,084
-Was that a challenge?
-Of course not.

1050
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,420
I only threw a little.

1051
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:48,715
This place looks nice.

1052
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,049
It's pretty.

1053
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:01,561
Sliding

1054
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,695
It's pretty.

1055
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:15,116
Is this on?

1056
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,784
Yes, it's on.

1057
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:18,244
It's so cute.

1058
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:29,964
Let's go!

1059
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,391
We're like puppies.

1060
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:44,479
"Two puppies having fun"

1061
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:46,981
Where do we go?

1062
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:49,234
- Right turn!
- All right!

1063
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:52,695
No, stop. You went past it!

1064
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,030
You went past it!

1065
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:56,824
Is it here?

1066
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:00,203
The snow clumps a lot here.

1067
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:04,374
In that case…

1068
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:13,258
There's something hard in there,

1069
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,426
like a stone.

1070
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:22,183
I missed.

1071
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,394
My hands got cold for nothing.

1072
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:34,821
You have to throw it from afar.

1073
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,739
It's cheating to throw this close.

1074
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,075
That's not right.

1075
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:40,868
- Why not?
- You have to step back.

1076
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:51,254
My hands are about to fall off.

1077
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:52,630
My hands are so cold.

1078
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:55,508
Gosh, they're freezing.

1079
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,598
- Are you going again?
- No, no.

1080
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:02,765
You're not, right?

1081
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,019
- Are you trying to go again?
- No, no.

1082
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:09,314
"He's acting suspicious…"

1083
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:15,278
I'm making a snowman.

1084
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:16,446
Me too.

1085
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:20,742
Made a 3-layered snowman

1086
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:27,415
My hands are so cold.

1087
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:32,003
Everything's fine except my hands.

1088
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,421
Me too.

1089
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:35,798
"Come here!!!"

1090
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,138
Come on, let's go inside.

1091
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:43,389
Let's go.

1092
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:46,809
Moshi moshi.

1093
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:49,228
Wait, do you only say that
when you answer the phone?

1094
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:51,981
Hello.

1095
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:55,652
- These must be our seats.
- Yes.

1096
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:58,321
Thank you.

1097
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:01,157
This is great.

1098
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:04,077
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1099
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:10,291
- I love it here.
- Yes, it's very warm.

1100
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:11,918
It's warm?

1101
01:01:12,877 --> 01:01:14,545
- This is the menu.
- Yes.

1102
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:15,672
Let's order.

1103
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:18,257
Wait… What's this menu?

1104
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:20,718
January…

1105
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:26,557
There's soup curry.
Chicken and seafood noodle soup curry,

1106
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:28,685
and also squid soup curry.

1107
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:31,646
and a 7-oz burger soup curry.

1108
01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:33,690
You mean hamburger steak?

1109
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:34,774
Oh.

1110
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,402
-Hambagu.
-Hambagu.

1111
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:38,945
Only 10 orders per day.

1112
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,406
- There's a dish like that?
- Yes.

1113
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:43,616
-This one looks the best.
-Yes.

1114
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:47,328
Is the pork cartilage soup curry…

1115
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:48,788
-Two, please.
-…available?

1116
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:49,872
- Of course.
- Okay.

1117
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:51,249
Two, please.

1118
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:52,750
- Two orders.
- Yes.

1119
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:58,005
You could have a lighter
or a thicker consistency for your soup.

1120
01:01:58,089 --> 01:01:59,716
Oh, the soup…

1121
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:02,051
You can have a light soup or a thick soup.

1122
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:06,222
Light consistency, please.

1123
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:07,849
What's "light" in Japanese again?

1124
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:10,059
Using his body

1125
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:11,144
Failed!

1126
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:13,146
I prefer thick soup.

1127
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:16,274
One of this and one of this.

1128
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:18,901
- Yes.
- Please.

1129
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:20,486
- Looks delicious.
- Yes.

1130
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:26,576
They put everything in here.

1131
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:30,163
That's so thoughtful.

1132
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:32,582
Excuse me, ma'am!

1133
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,293
You want to order something more?

1134
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:37,128
A draft beer.

1135
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:38,755
- Are you going to drink?
- Excuse me!

1136
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,757
One draft beer, please.

1137
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,049
We only have regular beer.

1138
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:43,843
Is that so?

1139
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:45,720
Sapporo.

1140
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:47,638
- Sapporo Classic.
- All right.

1141
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:50,266
- This one, please.
- One beer.

1142
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:55,521
You really like beer,
don't you?

1143
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:57,607
I love it.

1144
01:02:58,232 --> 01:03:00,985
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1145
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:14,373
So you've watched that clip
of how to properly pour beer.

1146
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:15,583
Yes, I just pour it straight.

1147
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:25,468
Should I try some?

1148
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:34,435
Thank you.

1149
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:36,687
Is it that good?

1150
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:38,189
The salad. Yes, it's good.

1151
01:03:38,272 --> 01:03:39,273
It's great.

1152
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,822
I prefer drinking from a glass to a can.

1153
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:46,906
Right.

1154
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,661
Hello

1155
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:57,834
I look so weird.

1156
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:08,594
This is good, so good.

1157
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:11,973
This is
ringo lassi. Do you know ringo?

1158
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:13,140
Bingo?

1159
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:15,226
Bingo lassi?

1160
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:16,561
What is this?

1161
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:18,604
- It's for spicy dishes.
- Ah.

1162
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:23,693
Oh, ringo.

1163
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:25,945
Didn't she say "bingo"?
Did she say "ringo"?

1164
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:27,029
She said "ringo."

1165
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,282
Like Ringer's solution?

1166
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:31,576
-No, "ringo" means apple.
-Like an IV drip.

1167
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:35,580
Thank you.

1168
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:37,456
The rice is yellow.

1169
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,375
Right, it's turmeric rice.

1170
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:46,132
It's actually a very light soup.

1171
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:49,927
I really wanted to try this.
This is the authentic stuff.

1172
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:51,554
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1173
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:54,015
A splashing soup.

1174
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:56,851
And the turmeric rice.

1175
01:04:58,102 --> 01:04:59,103
And the beer.

1176
01:05:00,354 --> 01:05:01,355
Insane.

1177
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:05,860
A show designed to fatten up
Jimin and Jung Kook from BTS.

1178
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:08,279
- It's like an animal show.
- An animal show?

1179
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:12,241
Like we're animals being fed.

1180
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:13,910
- You're right.
- Yes.

1181
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:15,244
But ARMY would love this.

1182
01:05:15,953 --> 01:05:17,538
They enjoy watching us

1183
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:19,874
gradually get raggedy and fat.

1184
01:05:19,957 --> 01:05:21,709
Thank you.

1185
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:24,921
Let's dig in.

1186
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:29,258
It's my first time trying soup curry.
I'm excited for this.

1187
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:35,640
So that's how it tastes.

1188
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:37,808
It tastes clean.

1189
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:43,689
"A big bite"

1190
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:47,109
It's comforting.

1191
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:48,694
I like it.

1192
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,196
I really wanted to try this.

1193
01:05:53,824 --> 01:05:55,493
It's not too heavy.

1194
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:58,079
I love it.

1195
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:00,247
Pumpkin.

1196
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:03,960
Koreans hate eggplants.

1197
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:08,714
Koreans hate carrots too.

1198
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:10,925
I don't like carrots.

1199
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:16,889
You get used to carrots as you eat them.

1200
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,182
I'm okay with stir-fried ones.

1201
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:19,892
When you stir-fry them,

1202
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:22,019
the bitterness is gone.

1203
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:24,563
- Carrots are bitter to you?
- Yes.

1204
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:25,856
Carrots aren't bitter.

1205
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,024
They are.

1206
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:30,486
Yeah.

1207
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:34,991
It's right up my alley.
I love it.

1208
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:39,954
The eggplants are good.

1209
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:42,623
- Right?
- Yes.

1210
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:45,084
It's fun trying all these vegetables.

1211
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:48,921
- Are you having fun?
- Yes, they're all in chunks.

1212
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:51,799
There are potatoes too.

1213
01:06:51,882 --> 01:06:54,468
The potatoes are good.
They taste like mashed potatoes.

1214
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:55,553
Potatoes.

1215
01:06:57,513 --> 01:06:59,181
- Broccoli.
- Mmm!

1216
01:06:59,598 --> 01:07:01,100
Aren't the potatoes good?

1217
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:04,979
Mmm!

1218
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:07,440
The potatoes are good.

1219
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:10,901
Cheers

1220
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:18,367
Swirl it again.

1221
01:07:29,086 --> 01:07:30,087
Delicious.

1222
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:33,382
It's so good.

1223
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:35,009
-Good.
-Good.

1224
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:39,513
-Good.
-Good.

1225
01:07:43,642 --> 01:07:44,977
-Good.
-Good.

1226
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,979
I knew exactly
what you were talking about.

1227
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:49,190
We watch the same kind of stuff
on YouTube.

1228
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:52,943
The meat with the shishito pepper.

1229
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:54,695
Did you say that?

1230
01:08:00,534 --> 01:08:02,536
-Wow.
-It…

1231
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:05,414
-I'm dead.
-It is really good.

1232
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:07,166
"Mind-numbingly delicious"

1233
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:11,337
Sick.

1234
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:12,797
So good.

1235
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:13,881
"Peeling off the skin"

1236
01:08:13,964 --> 01:08:15,341
You don't eat the skin?

1237
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:18,594
It's better without the skin.

1238
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:19,887
Give it to me. Wait, no.

1239
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,263
- Do you want the skin?
- No.

1240
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:24,016
Your fingers are all over it.

1241
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,101
Right.

1242
01:08:26,977 --> 01:08:28,604
Is that why you said no right away?

1243
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:30,022
Yup.

1244
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:31,941
It's a waste,

1245
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:33,275
but what can you do?

1246
01:08:34,568 --> 01:08:36,570
- Good.
- Oh, wow.

1247
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:38,364
"Telepathy"

1248
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:41,408
We think the same way.

1249
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:43,494
We do.

1250
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:48,040
Imagine if we met
as friends of the same age.

1251
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:49,125
Okay?

1252
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:50,960
We would've been copies of each other.

1253
01:08:51,043 --> 01:08:52,336
Good.

1254
01:08:52,419 --> 01:08:54,213
If we were the same age?

1255
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:56,757
Oh, man.

1256
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:59,760
Our teachers would have hated us.

1257
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:03,764
-What?
-They would have hated us.

1258
01:09:06,058 --> 01:09:07,351
We would've been troublemakers.

1259
01:09:07,434 --> 01:09:11,272
If you, V, and I were the same age
and got into trouble,

1260
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:15,401
then what would have happened?

1261
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:18,445
You've seen me and V fighting a lot.

1262
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:20,531
- Yes.
- You've mediated a lot too.

1263
01:09:20,614 --> 01:09:23,576
I think back, and our fights
were so adorable back then.

1264
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:25,995
They were because of such petty reasons.

1265
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:29,373
We could've just let things be
instead of fighting.

1266
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:35,546
You were grabbing
onto the table with rage.

1267
01:09:35,629 --> 01:09:36,630
I mean,

1268
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:39,550
I don't know why my body shook so much
when I was angry back then.

1269
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:43,888
I guess I wasn't good
at hiding my emotions.

1270
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:46,348
The worst was on that morning.

1271
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:48,017
- I remember.
- Before school.

1272
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:50,519
Yeah, I did that then

1273
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:53,147
- and also during the dumpling incident.
- Of course.

1274
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:55,191
I could see from behind

1275
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:57,902
that V was laughing on the stairs.

1276
01:09:57,985 --> 01:09:59,528
I could see he was going like this.

1277
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:00,779
"Mocking face"

1278
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:06,535
I couldn't take it.
That was when I lost it

1279
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:09,622
when I saw the back of his head
mocking me.

1280
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:16,337
It took a long time
for me and V to get this close.

1281
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:19,089
We got closer after that big fight.

1282
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:22,092
I don't think I've ever fought

1283
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:23,385
- that hard with someone.
- Right.

1284
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:24,678
I mean, who would I fight with?

1285
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:25,763
You're the type

1286
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:29,266
to annoy someone so easily.

1287
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:31,602
You know?

1288
01:10:32,186 --> 01:10:33,812
I remember a few incidents

1289
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:35,481
like when I kissed RM's forehead.

1290
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:37,775
-Remember that?
-I do.

1291
01:10:48,786 --> 01:10:50,996
RM told me I went too far with that one.

1292
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:56,126
"You're crossing the line, Jung Kook."

1293
01:10:57,962 --> 01:10:59,922
- But he laughed at that too.
- Right.

1294
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:01,882
At least three of us were crying.

1295
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:06,095
It was just too hilarious
how you kissed his forehead.

1296
01:11:06,178 --> 01:11:09,098
What's even funnier was
that RM went all red too.

1297
01:11:09,181 --> 01:11:10,391
He didn't know what to do

1298
01:11:11,058 --> 01:11:12,226
and went like…

1299
01:11:16,146 --> 01:11:17,648
It was so funny.

1300
01:11:18,148 --> 01:11:19,817
Back then…

1301
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:20,901
Yeah?

1302
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:24,863
Our members always had

1303
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:26,865
this anger

1304
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,743
inside of them, you know?

1305
01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:32,246
- We had a lot of resentment.
- We got angry

1306
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:33,872
because of trivial stuff.

1307
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:37,293
But that stuff
is nothing to us anymore, right?

1308
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:40,671
We're all pretty emptied up inside now.

1309
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:44,675
But back then, we got riled up
by the smallest things.

1310
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:47,928
We fought a lot and also cried a lot.

1311
01:11:49,346 --> 01:11:52,975
I think it's going to be fun
when we all finish our military service

1312
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:54,268
and go back on tour again.

1313
01:11:54,351 --> 01:11:56,020
- It'll be fun.
- A lot of fun.

1314
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:58,314
It's going to be hilarious
when we start touring again.

1315
01:11:58,397 --> 01:11:59,440
Absolutely hilarious.

1316
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:03,861
With everyone so old now.

1317
01:12:04,361 --> 01:12:06,739
Let's hurry up and finish our service.

1318
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:08,198
We'll be back soon enough.

1319
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:16,415
Mmm.

1320
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:18,876
It's good.

1321
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:21,920
I'm so full.

1322
01:12:22,713 --> 01:12:24,214
That was really delicious.

1323
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:26,717
It was.

1324
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:28,886
And so light too.

1325
01:12:28,969 --> 01:12:30,054
Really delicious.

1326
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:31,263
I loved it.

1327
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:32,931
This is nice.

1328
01:12:33,932 --> 01:12:36,268
- I wanted to come outside.
- It's cool now.

1329
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:37,770
I love this.

1330
01:12:38,645 --> 01:12:40,439
It's so nice and cool.

1331
01:12:40,564 --> 01:12:41,815
I'm so happy.

1332
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:44,693
"Can't forget to take a photo"

1333
01:12:45,402 --> 01:12:46,653
Let's go!

1334
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:51,283
Why does my face look so flat today?

1335
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,035
Who flattened my face?

1336
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:55,287
It's because you drank.

1337
01:12:57,081 --> 01:12:58,707
We look so young.

1338
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:01,043
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

1339
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:03,504
- Time to go!
- Let's go.

1340
01:13:04,421 --> 01:13:06,006
Shall we head to the hot springs?

1341
01:13:07,424 --> 01:13:10,052
A peaceful night in Sapporo

1342
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:14,223
A table full of delicious food

1343
01:13:14,306 --> 01:13:16,058
-It's good, right?
-Yeah.

1344
01:13:18,977 --> 01:13:21,814
Expect the unexpected

1345
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:23,023
Are you sure about this?

1346
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:24,858
You should be sure about this!

1347
01:13:24,942 --> 01:13:26,610
The two try snowboarding

1348
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:31,031
And do everything they can to do better…

1349
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:32,866
I can do it now.

1350
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:35,702
"Jimin gets used to it"

1351
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:37,955
While Jung Kook needs more work

1352
01:13:38,038 --> 01:13:39,998
A tribulation for the Golden Maknae

1353
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:42,668
What exactly happened here?

1354
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:44,253
Are You Sure?!

1355
01:13:44,336 --> 01:13:45,421
