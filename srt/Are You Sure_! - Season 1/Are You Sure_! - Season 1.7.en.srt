1
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:20,020
Are You Sure?!

2
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,022
The third destination of Are You Sure?!

3
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:23,940
Sapporo!

4
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,485
With even more laughter and craziness

5
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,739
Are you sure?!

6
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:33,324
The show's genre changed?

7
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,076
Eating midnight snacks

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,161
Eating breakfast

9
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:37,328
Eating more

10
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,664
After going through the snow

11
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:40,790
It's great.

12
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,167
A glass of whisky

13
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,293
It's like an animal show.

14
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:44,419
An animal show?

15
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,505
They saved the best trip for last

16
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,425
And spend even more free time together

17
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:55,388
What other adventures
await them in Sapporo?

18
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,736
Let me roll down the window to cool off.

19
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:15,992
That's a good idea.

20
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:22,457
Sometimes… I become one with the wind…

21
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,250
I haven't even
been watching any snowboarding videos,

22
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,961
but they're popping up
after just talking about snowboarding.

23
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,089
These snowboarders are awesome.

24
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,050
I learned how to turn too.

25
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,259
Really?

26
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,678
- You learned how to turn like that?
- I did.

27
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,180
Did you actually do it?

28
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:40,183
Yes, I managed to turn on the same spot.

29
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,268
Of course, I wasn't this fast.

30
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,895
I want to learn too.

31
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,355
How much can you do?

32
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,398
Me? Just S turns.

33
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,400
Isn't an S turn like this?

34
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,985
- Yes.
- Like this?

35
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,237
Then you must be pretty good.

36
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:56,574
I've only snowboarded once,
so I'm amazed by everything.

37
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,451
I've also only done it for three days.

38
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,870
I didn't even have lessons, actually.

39
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,330
- Really?
- Wait a minute.

40
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,540
I went with you.

41
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,458
Hang on. Really?

42
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,252
I just remembered I went with you.

43
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,296
"Thinking…"

44
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:11,798
I don't believe this.

45
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:12,924
Did you go with me?

46
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,008
Why can't you remember?

47
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,635
"Nice compliments"

48
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,512
Did we learn together?

49
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,099
Wait, it wasn't you. I'm sorry.

50
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,934
"The camera's shaking
as much as he's embarrassed"

51
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:26,688
- Did we learn together?
- Wait, it wasn't you. I'm sorry.

52
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:27,814
What the heck?

53
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,399
I went with your friends.

54
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,318
-What the heck?
-Sorry.

55
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,821
It's snowing so much.

56
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:35,905
"Meanwhile, the snow is piling up"

57
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,782
Wow, that's a lot of snow.

58
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,367
Everything's white.

59
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,706
I'm getting excited.

60
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:53,882
"Jung Kook's POV shot"

61
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,888
The snow makes it look
like we're going super fast.

62
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,973
I turned the flash on to capture that.

63
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,227
My hand is about to fall off.

64
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,278
Arrived at our accommodation already?

65
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:18,656
Nope! At a convenience store

66
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,336
The foodie is in deep thought

67
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,254
Hehehehehe.

68
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,885
This one should be good.

69
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:41,804
It's good.

70
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:42,889
"If it's good, then we get it"

71
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,390
Gimbap is the best.

72
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,770
Which is why he's here
for more triangle gimbap

73
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:03,451
Where's Jung Kook?

74
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:04,827
This looks good.

75
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,581
- Is it tuna mayo?
- Yes.

76
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,959
Thank you.

77
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,210
Thank you.

78
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,920
"Swiped all the triangle gimbap"

79
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,506
I heard these sweet potato chips are good.

80
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,344
Why are you listening to that?

81
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,054
Is there a problem?

82
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,931
I'm just asking
why you're listening to it.

83
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,641
You're just asking?

84
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:27,725
Yes.

85
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,185
Because I like it.

86
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,687
Let's listen again!

87
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:36,317
- You like it that much?
- Yes, I love it.

88
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,778
Why, thank you.

89
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,974
I wonder
if I could ever write a song like this.

90
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,564
Falling asleep to a lullaby

91
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,608
Sleeping Jung Kook:
Hello, this is Jung Kook

92
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,029
Sleeping Jung Kook:
I like listening to Jimin's lullaby

93
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,323
I'm sleepy.

94
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,407
You're sleepy?

95
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,491
Yes.

96
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,659
"Sleepy even while sleeping"

97
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,172
- Are we here?
- We're here!

98
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,590
That's awesome.

99
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,300
We have arrived.

100
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,302
I'm so excited.

101
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,428
Let's go.

102
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,474
Where do we go?

103
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:53,728
- I think we have to take off our shoes.
- Good evening.

104
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,355
Please take your shoes off.

105
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,648
Key, please.

106
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,733
"Checking in"

107
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,651
- Let's go.
- Did you get the key?

108
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,404
- Yes.
- Where are we going? Is this the way?

109
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,614
Let's find out.

110
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,908
Do we have to use the stairs
to get to the second floor?

111
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,117
Let's go.

112
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,453
I don't know, but let's just go.

113
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,121
I don't think this is the right way.

114
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,082
-Oh, it is.
-It is.

115
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,088
It's good.

116
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,929
-Even the floor looks comfortable.
-This place is great.

117
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,889
Let's just stay an extra day here.

118
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,140
Can't we just stay here the whole time?

119
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,101
No, wait. We have to go
snowboarding tomorrow.

120
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,311
It's awesome here.

121
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,522
Our Are You Sure?! crew is amazing.

122
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,148
We are sure about this.

123
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,401
- We are sure.
- This was the right choice.

124
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,277
Let's change the title to "We Are Sure."

125
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,612
"We Are Sure."

126
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,782
- Where's the shower?
- I can't find it either.

127
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,492
- Oh, wait. I have a feeling.
- It's here.

128
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,910
I think it's here too.

129
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,870
Oh, wow.

130
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,372
Awesome.

131
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:57,917
"They're greeted
by the jacuzzi and a sauna"

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,252
Let's get heated up.

133
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,713
I love it.

134
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,425
I love it here.

135
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,509
Me too.

136
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,054
Amazing.

137
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:14,350
This is our last moment of relaxation.

138
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,768
I love it.

139
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:19,105
I want to cut my bangs.

140
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,986
- You're going to cut your hair?
- Transformation time.

141
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,448
"Let's Transform
Composed and written by Jung Kook"

142
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,293
Okay.

143
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,752
Get some water on it.

144
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,464
"Step 1. Wet the bangs"

145
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:49,260
Step 2. Be bold with your first cut

146
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,266
Step 3. Check the length

147
00:07:57,268 --> 00:08:01,397
Step 4. Get deep in thought

148
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,567
It's too short.

149
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,862
That's not good.

150
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,072
Putting in some fancy touches

151
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,631
The final push

152
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,466
Done.

153
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,511
All done.

154
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,055
Now I'm done.

155
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,683
"Talking to himself in the mirror…?"

156
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,403
It looks like a bowl cut.

157
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,242
Tidying up after himself!

158
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:58,037
I somehow gave myself a bowl cut.

159
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,707
Why do you look so familiar?

160
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,585
It's the Jung Kook I knew
back in our trainee days.

161
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,837
This is too much like a bowl cut.

162
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,340
I never meant to cut it this short.

163
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,424
It's cute.

164
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,430
What should I do with this hair?

165
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,932
Oh, right.
You have to shoot a music video.

166
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:21,435
"This was before filming the video
for Standing Next to You - USHER Remix"

167
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,564
Yes?

168
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,984
"The crew came in to check on the jacuzzi"

169
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,986
Oh, wow.

170
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,362
It's too short, right?

171
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,406
You look so cute.

172
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,418
Oh, crap.

173
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,544
What happened?

174
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,338
What? Did you hurt your leg?

175
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,716
It hurts so much

176
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,426
Did you get another bruise?

177
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:54,510
It hurts.

178
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,678
"Delicious food
is more important than Jimin's pain"

179
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,762
This is tasty.

180
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,140
You're all right.

181
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,725
Yeah, I'm all right.

182
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:02,643
I'm not dying.

183
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,312
This is the milk you talked about, right?

184
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,396
Yes, it is.

185
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,981
It's good.

186
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,068
We're going to dinner soon.

187
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,361
I know.

188
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,073
I really want to eat this,
but I'm holding back.

189
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,118
I should hold back too.

190
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,620
This milk is delicious.

191
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:21,996
There's a deck of cards.

192
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:23,706
I bought it.

193
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,542
Let's bet with this gimbap.

194
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,377
So the loser has to eat it?

195
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,087
Yes, eat it right now.

196
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,797
"A game with
the triangle gimbap on the line"

197
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:32,882
Let's do it.

198
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,967
"The cards are under here"

199
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,013
I'm playing.

200
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,349
- You are?
- I'm playing.

201
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:45,770
I bet half of a triangle gimbap.

202
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,938
Are you playing?

203
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,315
Did you shuffle properly?

204
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,816
Of course I did.

205
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,777
I'll play too.

206
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,528
Half a triangle gimbap on the line.

207
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,613
I'm in.

208
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,406
- Let's go, then.
- All right.

209
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:58,991
Here's my first card.

210
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,243
Here's my first card.

211
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,412
What do you have?

212
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,289
An ace.

213
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,707
I have four of a kind.

214
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,628
Go eat that triangle gimbap.

215
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:11,962
Eat it now.

216
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,800
I have to eat it now.

217
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,302
"The person who suggests it
always gets it"

218
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:21,889
The triangle gimbap might
be too big. So how about you eat…

219
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,849
Never mind, eat it since it's open.

220
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:30,523
"Losing has never tasted so good"

221
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:31,982
It's really tasty.

222
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,820
Just one bite? Not the whole thing?

223
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:36,946
Yes.

224
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,280
The whole thing is too big.

225
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,366
That's true.

226
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:46,330
Both players check their cards

227
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,250
What will you do?

228
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,670
I'm in.

229
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,505
I think you're faking it.

230
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,299
- I'm in.
- I'm in too, then.

231
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,384
Let's play.

232
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,137
I have an ace again.

233
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,016
I have an ace again.

234
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,520
- I have nothing.
- Eat up, then.

235
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:12,148
- I have nothing.
- Eat up, then.

236
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,071
I don't want to eat this anymore.

237
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,119
But it's good.

238
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,913
The last bite is on the line.

239
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,707
It's a big bite.

240
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,627
I've already had two bites.

241
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,296
"You eat it, please"

242
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,006
What will you do?

243
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,468
I'm in again.

244
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,470
I'm in too.

245
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,807
The final result is…!

246
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,436
I guess I'll eat it.

247
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,687
I have a queen.

248
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,439
I have a four.

249
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,734
This is too big.

250
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,028
You're the one who suggested it.

251
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:01,947
That's it for the game.

252
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,908
Let's play again another time.

253
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,410
- Should we go wash up?
- Yes.

254
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,913
We're going to shower here, right?

255
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,498
Here?

256
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,000
We should turn off the camera.

257
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,502
- Should we?
- Yes.

258
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:15,836
We can turn it on again.

259
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,173
Yo!

260
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,803
You can tell

261
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,137
How hot it is

262
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,556
By their reaction

263
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,685
You have to put this on your head.

264
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:35,606
Why, though?

265
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:36,690
I don't know.

266
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,534
Is the water temperature okay?

267
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,202
It's just right.

268
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,578
- Is it?
- Yes.

269
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:51,997
Oops.

270
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,499
What happened?

271
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,709
Should we open the window?

272
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,253
Yes.

273
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,924
Wow, the wind is strong.

274
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,968
- This doesn't open wider?
- I think so.

275
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,136
I guess this is it.

276
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,934
- How is it?
- It's great.

277
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,689
Can you feel the wind?

278
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:17,773
Yes.

279
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:23,279
"Can he really feel the wind?"

280
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:28,868
"Enjoying the warmth"

281
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,079
It's getting hotter as I'm sitting in it.

282
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,251
"Going into the cold tub"

283
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,044
What is that?

284
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,796
It's like a hot pot.

285
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,840
With two different soups?

286
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,467
Is this a hot pot?

287
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,643
Sitting in the cold tub

288
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,521
Fail

289
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:58,939
You think you can do it?

290
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,649
- I think so.
- Yeah?

291
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:05,112
"Finally succeeded"

292
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,364
Try to look cool.

293
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,116
"Look cool…?"

294
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,951
I don't think so…

295
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,662
I can't stand this cold anymore.

296
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,374
- It's that bad?
- Yes, you try it.

297
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,502
Maybe a bit later.

298
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,130
Feel how cold I am.

299
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,803
"Courageously heading to the cold tub"

300
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:30,971
It's hot now.

301
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,309
It's cold, right?

302
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,196
How can it be this cold?

303
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,322
Why is it so cold?

304
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,406
I don't know.

305
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,700
Where did they get the water from?

306
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,040
"Messing around"

307
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,009
Splashing bravery into himself

308
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:14,848
Battling with the cold tub.

309
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:25,234
The manggae rice cake screams

310
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,735
You have to relax.

311
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,531
I can't relax yet

312
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:33,993
What is this?

313
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,285
I can't control my body.

314
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,209
"It's so cold it's hilarious.mov"

315
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,128
I'm going to freeze.

316
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,005
This must be ice water.

317
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,297
Yeah, ice water.

318
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,925
I'm all frozen.

319
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,553
"Their tongues are frozen too"

320
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,976
I can't stand this.

321
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,602
Should we go out?

322
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,687
Yes.

323
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:13,741
"Yes, this is the stuff"

324
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,746
This is nice.
I can feel the blood circulation.

325
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,540
Me too. You feel your blood rushing?

326
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,126
How nice.

327
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,212
This feels amazing.

328
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,799
Should we go for it again?
This feels great.

329
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,218
Let's try once more and go.

330
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,471
It really is great.

331
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,056
I love it.

332
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,102
I love it.

333
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,398
It felt amazing
when I got out of the water.

334
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:47,649
- Right.
- Yeah.

335
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,109
Let's get out now.

336
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,444
- All right.
- Shall we go?

337
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,116
The outside air feels warm now.

338
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,201
Right.

339
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:07,836
What is he doing…?

340
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,592
I'm going to be a soldier soon.

341
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,471
That's how you're going?

342
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,599
- We should head out now.
- Should we?

343
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,770
Suddenly in the sauna

344
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,731
This room is soundproof

345
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:31,151
So let's imagine what they're saying

346
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:37,199
Jung Kook: What's that on the wall?

347
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,410
Jimin: There's something on the wall?

348
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:47,626
Jimin: I think
it's to check the temperature

349
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,504
They're looking at this

350
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,381
This is what they're looking at

351
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,591
Jimin: Careful, it's hot
Jung Kook: Okay

352
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,553
Jimin: Let's go, we have to shower
and go get dinner

353
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,222
I'm doing this again tomorrow morning.

354
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,849
Let's go wash up.

355
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,476
I love it.

356
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:14,862
This feels great.

357
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,614
This is the stuff. This is the stuff.

358
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,038
How did it go next?
I always forget after a while.

359
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,249
It goes like this.

360
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,500
Oh, that's right.

361
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,254
Loading…

362
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,381
There was something like this too.

363
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,675
- What?
- There was something like this.

364
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,760
- Like this.
- Maybe only for you.

365
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,100
I can just look it up, but I never do.

366
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,602
Right.

367
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,147
I was just thinking you could look it up.

368
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,356
It's like this.

369
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:02,451
Jimin dances a whole song in silence

370
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,246
Let's go.

371
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,623
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

372
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,042
"It's finally time for dinner"

373
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,585
♪ Let's go downstairs ♪

374
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:12,961
I'm so curious.

375
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,464
I'm so curious.

376
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:19,635
Hello.

377
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,597
It's pretty in here.

378
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,850
I feel so fresh and great.

379
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,520
Hello.

380
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,356
Nice to meet you.

381
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,482
I think we just go in.

382
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,691
Thank you.

383
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,491
Amazing.

384
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,117
What's all this?

385
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,120
This is… Wow.

386
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,748
It's all set up for us.

387
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,334
This is for shabu-shabu.

388
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,503
Can you do that thing?

389
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,587
What?

390
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,673
The VJ's On the Scene thing.

391
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,133
Do the voice like that narrator.

392
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,218
Well…

393
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,725
We're in Sapporo.

394
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,437
I don't know how to do it.

395
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,065
We heard this was

396
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,818
a famous place in Japan.

397
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,324
Having fun with just a camera

398
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,118
You sound so weak.

399
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,079
We heard this was a famous place.

400
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,373
Our guests for today

401
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,167
are trying this great food.

402
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,794
Okay.

403
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,129
This looks delicious.

404
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,468
This is beef.

405
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,351
It's delicious.

406
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,524
Meat is the best

407
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,109
Let me taste them one by one.

408
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,069
What's this?

409
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,659
"What is this taste…?"

410
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,244
Hmm?

411
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,457
Hmm.

412
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,083
What's this?

413
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,626
It's miso soup.

414
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,131
Should I put this in?

415
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,841
What is this thing?

416
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,594
What is it?

417
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:27,637
Is it pickled radish?

418
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,353
Tasting the different dishes on the table

419
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,604
What's this?

420
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,942
I'm going to eat this crab

421
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:52,829
Is it good?

422
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,045
Hmm.

423
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,381
Hmm.

424
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:16,186
Gotta record this since it's good

425
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,979
I think this would be good.

426
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,775
Cut the tofu in half

427
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,611
and eat it with the crab

428
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,488
like this.

429
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:28,573
So there was tofu.

430
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,210
Should we put these in?

431
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,170
Yeah, the vegetables.

432
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,172
Should I put everything in?

433
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,008
Yeah.

434
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,093
Oh, wait.

435
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,763
"I can't hear anything…
I only see the vegetables"

436
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,598
-I don't know.
-Are we sure

437
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,559
we eat it like this?

438
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,310
You have to stop me

439
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,271
if you think I'm wrong.

440
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:00,564
You have to stop me.

441
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,985
The plate is already empty

442
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,654
Dunk the meat in here

443
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:10,198
and get it cooked just a little.

444
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,493
Then it goes straight into the sauce.

445
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,262
Try it Jimin

446
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,264
This is really delicious.

447
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:38,101
It's best when it's cooked only a little

448
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,811
and still a bit pink.

449
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,481
- It's amazing.
- Bring it over here.

450
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,323
Doesn't it taste great?

451
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,074
I love it.

452
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:58,497
I've never had clear-soup
shabu-shabu like this before,

453
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,748
but it's delicious.

454
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:03,919
This is the best.

455
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,714
Munch

456
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,674
Put a little of this on.

457
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,776
-I want to try the soup.
-Me too.

458
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,195
I'll use this.

459
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,450
And do this.

460
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,661
Good idea.

461
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,121
I think it'll be bland.

462
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:44,543
It only tastes like boiled vegetables.

463
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:47,921
It's just cabbage water.

464
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:49,714
What if

465
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:53,218
I mix in a little bit of the sauce?

466
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,344
"A little?"

467
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,309
That's too much.

468
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,276
Wait, there's sashimi too.

469
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,328
This here!!!

470
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,663
It's tuna.

471
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:22,998
Tuna.

472
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,042
Tuna.

473
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,639
I love the sashimi here.

474
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,475
Yes

475
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,936
I love it too

476
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,940
It's so good it makes him dance

477
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,568
I'm going to try the shrimp.
It looks good.

478
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:54,738
Look, it's already shelled.

479
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,489
Show it to the camera.

480
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,158
It looks so fresh.

481
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,536
Looks delicious

482
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,081
I'll dip the shrimp in the soy sauce.

483
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,419
For me, it's straight to the sauce.

484
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,387
Is it good?

485
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,389
This shrimp is amazing.

486
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,476
Eat another one. Oh, it's all gone.

487
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,227
-There is another one.
-You take it.

488
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,647
-No, you have to. It's amazing.
-Really?

489
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,940
Dip it in the soy sauce
and eat it with a bit of wasabi.

490
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,776
It's just amazing.

491
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:38,573
Isn't it good?

492
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,744
Wow, it's so sweet.

493
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,079
It's good, right?

494
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,163
Yeah.

495
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:48,833
I hope we remember this meal
when we're serving in the military,

496
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,752
but I don't think we will.

497
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,629
Remember what?

498
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:55,340
What I mean is…

499
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,133
Something like this

500
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,886
Wait, there's sea urchin roe.

501
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,972
-There's sea urchin roe?
-Yes, right here.

502
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,891
There are some here too.
Aren't these it?

503
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:10,063
You should've eaten that
with the sea urchin roe.

504
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:11,147
Why did I…

505
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,524
You have to eat it together.

506
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,401
Can we share that?

507
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,569
-Do you want half of this?
-Can I have it?

508
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:17,696
Yes.

509
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,572
You're so generous.

510
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,574
Here you go.

511
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,867
I'm so moved.

512
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,536
Thank you.

513
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,914
I'm going to make a ssam with this.

514
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:30,208
"Jimin's pick
Sea urchin roe + tuna ssam"

515
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,969
No.

516
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:47,600
Dip this…

517
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:52,564
The sea urchin roe + tuna
drowned in the soy sauce

518
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:53,815
No.

519
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:55,900
No.

520
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:57,861
It's salvageable.

521
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,989
It's drenched in soy sauce.

522
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,533
Should I wash this here?

523
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:12,167
The taste of hard-earned perfection

524
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:16,880
I love sea urchin roe.

525
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,423
It's really delicious.

526
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,300
I want

527
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,470
one more of the sea urchin roe and tuna.

528
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:27,515
- That was great.
- Should we order one more of this?

529
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,225
This?

530
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:32,312
"He wants it so badly"

531
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,272
We shouldn't.

532
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,401
"Second round begins"

533
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,736
I can't resist this.

534
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,529
I'm starting with the shrimp.

535
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,864
Of course.

536
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:45,700
The wasabi…

537
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:55,126
How is it this delicious?
I can't believe it.

538
00:29:56,461 --> 00:30:01,549
The irresistible sea urchin roe + tuna

539
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,102
This sea urchin roe is insane.

540
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:19,818
Can't forget the draft beer

541
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:23,988
I can't live without beer. I can't resist.

542
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,782
I usually don't drink beer,

543
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:29,911
but I'm drinking a lot of it on this trip.

544
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:33,289
You can't not drink draft beer
when you're in Japan.

545
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,083
I naturally can't handle much beer.

546
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,376
Okay, cheers.

547
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,587
Cheers.

548
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,339
- Come on.
- Okay.

549
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,675
Oh, wow.

550
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,177
-Okay.
-Let's go.

551
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:55,061
The cold beer
spreading through their bodies

552
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,441
It's delicious.

553
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,236
This reminded me of the cold tub.

554
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,445
It's very refreshing.

555
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:06,823
Eating another shrimp.

556
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,495
This shrimp

557
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,081
is amazing too.

558
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:20,503
I've eaten so much these last three days
that it worries me.

559
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,464
I just love this.

560
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:25,884
I'm going to sleep so well tonight.

561
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,805
I'm so relaxed.

562
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,557
I love it.

563
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,476
I'm so happy.

564
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,312
I'm going to pass out after this,

565
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,522
especially if we get a massage.

566
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,399
-We're getting a massage?
-No.

567
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,237
It's just what I thought.

568
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,574
You almost got me.

569
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:51,784
I'm so relaxed.

570
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,412
I was just saying what I wanted.

571
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:56,539
Let's head out.

572
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,126
That was a good meal.

573
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,210
Thank you for the meal.

574
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,881
This was a great finale.

575
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,674
Sea urchin roe was the best.

576
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,134
That was the best.

577
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,179
Thank you for the meal.

578
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,430
Thank you for the meal.

579
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,648
Should we play
some Texas hold 'em before we sleep?

580
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,400
- We're playing again?
- How about it?

581
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:28,488
It's fun to play for something
that'll be useful to one another,

582
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,281
like doing 10 pushups.

583
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,449
Or 15 burpees.

584
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,243
We have a lot of rounds to go.

585
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,704
How about just three pushups?

586
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,914
We should do at least seven.

587
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,666
-Per one round?
-Yes.

588
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,751
How about five pushups?

589
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,129
Five?

590
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,424
Five?

591
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,469
All right, let's start.

592
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:52,887
I have an eight.

593
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,975
What's the rest?

594
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,896
A ten.

595
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:08,236
I have a full house. Go and work out.

596
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,697
You have to do five pushups.

597
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:13,700
Two.

598
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,951
Three.

599
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,744
Four.

600
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:17,954
Five.

601
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,539
All right.

602
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,624
Second round begins immediately

603
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,836
Okay.

604
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,047
I'm in.

605
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,215
I'm in too.

606
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,720
I have an ace.

607
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,722
I have one pair.

608
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,598
One pair?

609
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,851
Open yours.

610
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:42,145
I actually have a straight.

611
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:49,902
A straight tops two pairs

612
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:51,696
I have a straight.

613
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,322
Hurry up and do your pushups.

614
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:58,786
Do it right. One, two, three, four,

615
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,330
five, six.

616
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,707
Why did I do six?

617
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,875
All right.

618
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:07,670
I just came out of the shower,

619
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,589
and I'm sweating again.

620
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:10,673
Thank you.

621
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:11,799
It's good for you.

622
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,973
Come on in!

623
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,977
Should I go in or not?

624
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:26,856
I'm in. Well, I have one pair.

625
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,358
I have one pair too.

626
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,485
Okay.

627
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,113
I also have a flush.

628
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,198
"Can you beat that?"

629
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,365
Okay, then.

630
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,162
I have a triple.

631
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,914
"A flush tops a triple"

632
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:45,249
How many times have I lost?

633
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,001
I did six last time, so should I do four?

634
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,921
No, that was your mistake last time.

635
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:54,300
One, two, three, four,

636
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:56,761
all right, five.

637
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,222
You're out of luck today.

638
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,641
This is why I never make bets.

639
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:04,060
But this bet is healthy.

640
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,895
Yes, it makes you work out.

641
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,272
Okay.

642
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:12,610
17, 18, 19, 20.

643
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,072
Two,

644
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,406
three,

645
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:18,950
four,

646
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,576
five.

647
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:23,871
You're doing well.

648
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:27,333
The game continues

649
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,255
I'm not going in.

650
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,216
I'm not going in.

651
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:40,596
I know when I should pass.

652
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,893
- Right, giving up's an option too.
- Of course.

653
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:49,689
Right… I could have… folded…

654
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:53,818
The next round immediately continues

655
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,737
I know folding's an option.

656
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,323
- I'm not going in.
- I'm not either.

657
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,700
I'm not going in.

658
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:02,034
I'm not going in.

659
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,370
Let's set a new rule.

660
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,414
It's twice as many if you fold.

661
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,209
So that's how it is.

662
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,753
Or should we do five squats if we fold?

663
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:13,880
Which do you prefer?

664
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,131
Let's do 10 squats.

665
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,257
- If we fold?
- Yes.

666
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,884
No, that's too much. Let's do five.

667
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:20,094
New rule:
5 squats when they fold

668
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,389
I have two pairs, five and ace.

669
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:26,058
I have two pairs, five and ace.

670
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:29,228
"Mine's a triple"

671
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,191
Okay,

672
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,276
let's do it properly.

673
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,531
Did you do 20?

674
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,241
This is good for me.

675
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,410
"Doing 20 already"

676
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:47,455
Two more wins and it's a tie.

677
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,664
Oh, come on.

678
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,959
You see how helpful this game is for us?

679
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,254
Let's each set our own level of workout.

680
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,842
-What was that?
-Something went wrong.

681
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:05,139
Taking turns to become healthier

682
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:17,568
Their workout continued
until late at night

683
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,487
Let's go to bed.

684
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,322
Let me go brush my teeth.

685
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,325
Come with me to brush my teeth.

686
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,129
I forgot my toothbrush.

687
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:39,465
It's in my suitcase.

688
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,342
I can't be bothered to get it.

689
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,304
Just go get it from your suitcase.

690
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,639
I'll go get it.

691
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,058
Is there one here?

692
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:50,768
There is.

693
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,355
It's almost the same as mine.

694
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:01,237
Jimin and Jung Kook's fun brushing time

695
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,240
I'm getting a bit bored

696
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:08,536
No effect whatsoever

697
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:12,039
Let's save this adorable moment

698
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,209
After gargling side by side,
the session's over!

699
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,086
Let's wash up

700
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:18,713
and go to bed.

701
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,472
Wait, I already washed up.

702
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,063
I couldn't eat what we bought today,
so tomorrow…

703
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,691
Tomorrow…

704
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,236
I'll pack them all up.

705
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:46,782
Let's go to bed.

706
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,702
We had a lot of fun and good food today.

707
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:50,828
Yes.

708
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:53,622
Good night.

709
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:55,499
Good night.

710
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,128
Good night.

711
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:00,963
Sleep tight.

712
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,967
We didn't do much in this room.
Anyway, sleep tight.

713
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,093
Bye.

714
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,430
I hope you have a good night.

715
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:16,020
This is such a nice place.

716
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:21,609
I'm sad we have to leave it behind.

717
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,196
It's too bad.

718
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,658
"Feeling sad
after touring around the cameras"

719
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,203
It would've been better
if we had more people here.

720
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,792
This is nice.
Let's sleep now for tomorrow.

721
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:40,920
- Bye.
- Bye!

722
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,048
Let's get it on with that night light.

723
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,674
You're not hot, are you?

724
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:47,676
No.

725
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:49,637
It's perfect.

726
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,473
- This pillow is super comfortable.
- Really?

727
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,434
Yes, it's a bit firm inside
but really comfortable.

728
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,520
Why did you turn that light on?

729
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,271
For a night light.

730
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,074
You're right, this pillow's great.

731
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,493
Isn't it really comfortable?

732
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,577
Yes.

733
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,704
- Hey.
- Yes?

734
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:16,872
I'm sleepy.

735
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:17,957
Then sleep.

736
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,500
Maybe I should.

737
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:22,128
My eyes are closing.

738
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,171
Then just sleep.

739
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,007
I should too.

740
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:29,844
Let's sleep.

741
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:47,528
All right.

742
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,239
I have one here too.

743
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:52,908
This is great.

744
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,035
There's one here too.

745
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,955
Wow, that's bright. Too bright.

746
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:01,250
I told you there was one here

747
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,752
I can just turn over.

748
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,089
"Provoking"

749
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,174
Let's sleep.

750
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,971
"You wanna go?"

751
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:22,271
Here's my counterstrike

752
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,196
It's not over yet

753
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:38,662
Let's sleep.

754
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,501
Let's go to sleep.

755
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,499
Why are you out here?

756
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,042
- Because it was hot.
- It was hot?

757
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,544
- Yeah.
- Really?

758
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,088
I guess it was a little warm.

759
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,095
Let's go shower

760
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,573
Zzz

761
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:35,571
+ Corn mayo bread acquired

762
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:42,244
Jung Kook's morning routine:
Eat as soon as you wake up

763
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,414
Munch

764
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,460
Jimin: @#$%^&!

765
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:56,175
Maybe I heard wrong…

766
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:57,760
Get out here!

767
00:43:58,427 --> 00:43:59,470
Come out!

768
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,138
"Surprised"

769
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:08,562
Whatever, this bread is delicious

770
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,789
Let's hurry and wash up

771
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:27,915
That was tasty.

772
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,634
All right, this is it.

773
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:41,387
Hi.

774
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:44,223
Did you dry your hair?

775
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:45,307
No.

776
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,976
I can't be bothered to dry mine.

777
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,187
Packing up is the worst.

778
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:54,149
I wore this already.

779
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,027
I wore these pants already.

780
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:59,154
Should I put sunscreen on now?

781
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:04,159
We have to wear sunscreen
since we're going on a snowfield.

782
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:07,246
We didn't put it on in New Zealand
and got so tanned.

783
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:10,249
Let's do it.

784
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:14,420
We should wear a lot of it.

785
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,922
A lot

786
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,886
It's not sticky.

787
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,434
We can't afford

788
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:30,769
to get sunburned.

789
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:33,272
"Please don't get tanned
Please don't get tanned"

790
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:34,982
Let me have some sunscreen.

791
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,233
Where is it?

792
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:37,609
It feels smooth.

793
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:38,944
What feels smooth?

794
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:40,946
The sunscreen feels smooth.

795
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,239
Let me have some, then.

796
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:43,991
Let me put some on.

797
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:49,663
I think my face got too white.

798
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,040
-But that's how you should wear it.
-Of course.

799
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,333
Are you ready?

800
00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:59,173
It's smooth, right?

801
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,175
"Very smooth"

802
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,177
I have

803
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,929
to spread it out like this.

804
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,139
Put it all over

805
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:08,515
down to my neck.

806
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:10,601
It does feel smooth.

807
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:13,228
- Yes, it's not sticky.
- Right.

808
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:14,354
That's true.

809
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,318
It's smooth. I like it.

810
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:21,945
Grab the sunscreen.

811
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,323
- All good.
- Are you ready?

812
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:25,657
Let's change into our skiwear.

813
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:26,909
Yes, let's go.

814
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,165
Skiwear?

815
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:36,043
Wait, I have to grab this food first.

816
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:38,378
You're grabbing the food first?

817
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:39,797
Yeah.

818
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:43,967
Taking all the leftover snacks

819
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,098
- Let's see, where is it?
- Here it is.

820
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:51,266
Get in.

821
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,561
This is it.

822
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,897
"It looks cool"

823
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,857
This, the sweater,

824
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:00,400
and the hat.

825
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,611
I'm excited. This should be fun.

826
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,531
- Are you ready to get excited?
- Yes.

827
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,407
I'm already excited.

828
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,034
No, don't get excited already.

829
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,494
Prankster mode

830
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,162
Don't get excited already. Do it again.

831
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,332
Get excited after we're all ready.

832
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:20,796
This is violence.

833
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:23,298
Actually, you didn't even touch me.

834
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:25,968
Nice.

835
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:27,052
What's this?

836
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,680
There are straps inside.

837
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,432
-Like backpack straps?
-Yes.

838
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,017
Should we put these on?

839
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:36,228
Like this?

840
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:38,730
Yes, and we can take it off
when it's too warm.

841
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,440
We can take pictures like this.

842
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,525
It's removable.

843
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:43,569
A beanie too.

844
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:44,862
"2024 F/W Skiwear line"

845
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,822
- So cute.
- It's like a bag.

846
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:52,452
- All right.
- There's something here.

847
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,413
Great. I'm all set.

848
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:55,539
Let's go!

849
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,210
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

850
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:02,504
Let's go.

851
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,678
"Looking around"

852
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,054
To the first floor.

853
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:19,229
We have to get in the car,

854
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,480
so I'll go down first.

855
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:34,745
Whose is this?

856
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:36,747
Isn't this Jung Kook's?

857
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:39,082
I think it's Jung Kook's.

858
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,169
Goodness.

859
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:54,139
Where am I supposed to go?

860
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:01,104
"Jimin passes the elevator"

861
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,909
And goes down the stairs

862
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,624
So heavy.

863
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:22,167
- Jung Kook.
- Yes?

864
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,044
Why do you keep forgetting your clothes?

865
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,171
-Right.
-You're so clumsy.

866
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:27,297
So that was mine.

867
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,883
Thank you, Jimin

868
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:32,010
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

869
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:33,595
- Should we move?
- Yup.

870
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:34,805
Let's go.

871
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:37,683
♪ Let's go, let's go, let's ♪

872
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:39,768
All right.

873
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:43,313
- Shall we?
- Please drive carefully.

874
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,940
I always drive carefully.

875
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:46,024
Let's go.

876
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:48,902
"To the ski slopes!"

877
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,489
It suddenly feels like we're not in Japan.

878
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,538
Doesn't it feel like Northern Europe?

879
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,790
Yes, it does.

880
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:04,418
Oh, wow.

881
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,920
What's that mountain?

882
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,214
There's a huge mountain.

883
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:12,509
It's Maruyama.

884
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:15,721
You think I'll believe you?

885
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:16,888
Don't test me!

886
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:18,432
How dare you try to fool me.

887
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,309
"Yama" means mountain, so "Maru-yama."

888
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,228
Let me look that mountain up.

889
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:25,022
It feels so unreal here.

890
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:26,940
That's Mount Yotei.

891
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:29,484
Mount Yotei? That's Maruyama.

892
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:30,569
Stop saying nonsense.

893
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,656
It's famous
for looking like a mini Mount Fuji.

894
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:37,242
You can get to the top by car.

895
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:38,326
You can ski there too.

896
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,039
Do you know what "cosmic horror" is?

897
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:43,123
I do.

898
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:45,125
It's when you

899
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:49,588
-fear something incredibly huge.
-Well, it's like feeling dejected,

900
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:51,173
like I'm nothing.

901
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:54,092
-Don't you feel that way with outer space?
-Yes.

902
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,927
I feel that way
when I see things like that.

903
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,679
Apparently, it's a thing

904
00:50:57,763 --> 00:51:01,099
and I kind of feel that way
when I see that.

905
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:03,560
Something big like that
can just trample you.

906
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:04,644
Right.

907
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,646
That mountain looks incredible.

908
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:09,191
It feels unreal, like it's a picture.

909
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:10,275
Yes.

910
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,951
It's so bright.

911
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:24,331
The sun's burning on my right side.

912
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,500
Thank goodness I wore sunscreen.

913
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,169
That annoying little sun.

914
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,132
The sun's really getting on my nerves.

915
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:36,426
It's so annoying.

916
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,928
I feel just fine.

917
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,390
That sun's so annoying.

918
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:46,561
For goodness' sake, that sun.

919
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,855
Don't hate on Youngbae.

920
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:50,774
I'll tell on you.

921
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:53,235
No, it's just the sun.

922
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:55,529
It won't leave me alone.

923
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:56,863
Should I call Youngbae

924
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,323
and ask him to make it go away?

925
00:51:58,406 --> 00:51:59,616
Yes, please call him.

926
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,701
Youngbae.

927
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:04,955
"To. Taeyang
You're hurting Jung Kook's eyes"

928
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:08,375
This is the perfect weather for hotteok.

929
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,127
I want a couple of them.

930
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:13,839
I want some tteokbokki
with fish cake soup on the side.

931
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:17,801
I think I'm digesting food
a lot quicker these days

932
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,971
because I've been eating so much.
I'm hungry already.

933
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:22,889
- Your stomach's stretched out.
- Yes.

934
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:27,352
That's how I feel.

935
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:28,895
I'm a bit hungry too.

936
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,105
"Thankfully, there's a rest stop"

937
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:31,982
All right, a rest stop.

938
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:33,733
Here we are.

939
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:35,735
Let's park

940
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,404
perfectly like this.

941
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,870
This looks delicious. Let's get this.

942
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:52,169
Do I press this?

943
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:55,589
"His finger doesn't know where to go"

944
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:56,673
"Cash."

945
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,550
I don't have any cash.

946
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,302
Huh?

947
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:01,636
What?

948
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,059
Ah!

949
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:19,279
Thank you.

950
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:21,406
"Ordering complete!"

951
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:27,412
It's going to take four minutes.

952
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:28,705
Is that okay?

953
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,749
- Yes.
- All right.

954
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:33,793
It's going to be so good.

955
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,296
Looks delicious.

956
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:37,672
Yes.

957
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,257
I ordered this.

958
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:43,762
This one, the cheese croquette,

959
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:45,472
and the sweet potato rice cake.

960
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:49,559
Tasty snacks make Jung Kook dance

961
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,441
Where's Jimin?

962
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:57,651
He's in the car.

963
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:00,028
He's just sitting there

964
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:01,696
playing games.

965
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:07,244
Is someone talking about me…?

966
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:10,121
I got something good.

967
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,206
What did you get?

968
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:14,376
Some bread with red beans
and cheese in it.

969
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:15,919
None for you, though.

970
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:17,504
Get some for me too.

971
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:20,507
Here's our food.

972
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,591
Thank you.

973
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,426
This is the croquette.

974
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,053
Oh, this must be it.

975
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,514
The one with the red beans.

976
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:30,267
"Munch"

977
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,311
Is it good?

978
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:34,396
What's this?

979
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,523
The red beans…

980
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:37,607
This one.

981
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,150
-That's the one with red beans?
-Yeah.

982
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,235
Let me try.

983
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:42,028
It's kind of like a sticky rice donut.

984
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:44,406
"Munch together"

985
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:45,490
It has rice cake inside.

986
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:49,452
- It's good.
- It is.

987
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,292
I like it.

988
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,501
"Ready to go with a snack in hand"

989
00:54:58,044 --> 00:54:59,546
They said this was the best one.

990
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,631
It's the fried potato one.

991
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:03,508
- What?
- This.

992
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:05,635
"I want to eat this…"

993
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:09,514
- What?
- Get one out for me.

994
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:10,640
Ah.

995
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:11,808
You want me to give you one?

996
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:12,976
Yes.

997
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:14,102
Here.

998
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:21,401
-Are these croquettes?
-Yup.

999
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:23,111
I'll take one.

1000
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:24,195
Okay.

1001
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:25,905
I can't pick it up.

1002
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,034
It won't…

1003
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:33,079
"But I want this…"

1004
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:39,878
Jung Kook, try this one.

1005
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:41,546
Is it good?

1006
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:49,512
This is the stuff.

1007
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:52,098
"Munch"

1008
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:54,726
Gosh, that's hot.

1009
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:57,979
The croquette's the best.

1010
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:00,065
I should've gotten more.

1011
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:01,983
I'll feed you another one.

1012
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,445
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

1013
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:07,614
It's going in.

1014
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:15,038
It's so good!!!!

1015
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:16,915
The croquette's crazy delicious.

1016
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:20,001
Lame…

1017
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,839
My stomach's finally pleased.

1018
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:26,716
- Well done.
- Yes, thank you.

1019
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,009
- All right.
- That was great.

1020
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,142
Is this a reservoir?

1021
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,896
- It looks like it.
- Yes.

1022
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:44,692
"R."

1023
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:45,985
Round 1
- A song with "R" -

1024
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,918
"Jimin loses Round 1"

1025
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:04,003
Round 2
- A song with "You , Love" -

1026
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:20,562
That's all you know, right?

1027
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:22,480
No, try me.

1028
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:23,606
I don't know any more.

1029
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:29,904
There's one more.

1030
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:36,077
Those aren't the lyrics.

1031
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:42,459
-What song is that?
-I just wrote it.

1032
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,252
It's from the Are You Sure?! soundtrack.

1033
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:45,879
No, our show will fail
with that soundtrack.

1034
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,297
Why?

1035
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:48,590
What do you mean "why"?

1036
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:50,091
I think it'll fail too.

1037
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,927
I can't wait to start snowboarding.

1038
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:55,054
I'm so excited.

1039
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:58,224
There's a ski resort on this mountain?

1040
00:57:58,892 --> 00:57:59,893
Of course.

1041
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:03,229
It feels like we're heading to the top.

1042
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,397
Yup.

1043
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:06,399
Wiper ON

1044
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:09,110
No, this is going
to make a mark.

1045
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,071
But you can't see anything.

1046
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,618
It's almost like you're driving blindly.

1047
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:17,869
No.

1048
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:19,746
Why won't you wipe it?

1049
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:22,665
It's a lot better when you wait

1050
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,792
until there's a lot of water
and then wipe.

1051
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,169
Like this.

1052
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:30,590
Wow, it's like wiping your glasses.

1053
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:44,103
I think we're almost there.

1054
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:47,232
Is that it?

1055
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:48,399
"Finally arrived at the resort"

1056
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:49,567
That was great.

1057
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:53,488
That was great.

1058
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,073
Thanks for driving.

1059
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:56,699
- Should I drive on the way back?
- No.

1060
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,660
-You don't trust me?
-No, I don't.

1061
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:00,578
You've never driven here.

1062
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:02,872
I can do it.
I just have to follow the road.

1063
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:05,667
This is going to be fun.

1064
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:11,839
It's exciting.

1065
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:15,468
I'm excited.

1066
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,137
Hurry, we don't have much time.

1067
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,868
We're at a ski resort!

1068
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:45,623
Ski Resort

1069
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:55,967
A Sapporo black bear sighting

1070
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:00,471
Is this right?

1071
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:07,228
You look cute.

1072
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:08,980
You look like a yeti.

1073
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:18,281
I'm not cute with goggles on.

1074
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:19,365
My left foot.

1075
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:22,118
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

1076
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:23,202
Thank you.

1077
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:24,871
Thank you.

1078
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:28,124
Let's go, we don't have much time.

1079
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:36,299
It's not that cold.

1080
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:39,469
Let's go. Wow, the snow.

1081
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:42,680
The snow feels great.

1082
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:46,768
Wow, so this is real snow.

1083
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:47,852
"Powdery snow everywhere"

1084
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:50,355
- JK!
- Wow.

1085
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:52,690
-Wow.
-JK!

1086
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:54,609
- I'm so excited.
- JK!

1087
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,418
The snow's all nice and crunchy.

1088
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:15,630
Where is the gondola?

1089
01:01:15,713 --> 01:01:17,674
- It's over here.
- The gondola.

1090
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:19,467
This is the gondola lift.

1091
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:21,928
Right, this is it.

1092
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:24,722
Gondola.

1093
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:29,435
I went snowboarding once seven years ago,

1094
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:33,981
so I don't know how I'll do today.

1095
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:36,025
- You can do it!
- I can do it!

1096
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:38,361
Go. Let's go!

1097
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:39,821
It's going to be fun.

1098
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:41,114
"We rented the resort
before it officially opened"

1099
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:57,588
As if someone was there.

1100
01:01:57,672 --> 01:01:58,798
There's actually no one here.

1101
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:02,427
I wonder
if I'd still remember how to ride.

1102
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:14,689
It's like riding a rollercoaster.

1103
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:16,232
Is this scary for you?

1104
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:19,652
No, it's not scary. It just feels shaky.

1105
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:22,780
And I feel like we're falling.

1106
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:24,991
Scaredy cat.

1107
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:27,785
I'm okay being a scaredy cat.

1108
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:30,705
- Scaredy cats live the longest.
- Scaredy cat.

1109
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:32,123
Wow, it's steep.

1110
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:35,209
- What?
- This slope looks steep.

1111
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:37,295
How do we board there? I can't do it.

1112
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:42,216
I might bump into a tree
while I go down and just disappear.

1113
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,218
You're going to fall right away?

1114
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:47,847
I'll just be one with the snow

1115
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:50,349
and show my union with nature.

1116
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:53,436
I think we're here.

1117
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:55,521
- Shall we?
- Let's go.

1118
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:07,116
I'm so excited!

1119
01:03:07,658 --> 01:03:09,410
I'm so excited!

1120
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,621
Where should we go?

1121
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:13,831
"So excited"

1122
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:19,128
Is this it? Here?

1123
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:20,922
Here?

1124
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:22,882
Wow, the snow.

1125
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,688
It's pretty slippery.

1126
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:42,568
Am I doing this right?

1127
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:46,781
Is this right?

1128
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:57,500
The left side.

1129
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:00,837
Here I go.

1130
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:04,799
I'm scared I might fall over immediately.

1131
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:10,680
His first slope in seven years

1132
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:19,981
How do I go down?

1133
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:26,654
Jimin never quits

1134
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:30,241
He just falls…

1135
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:34,954
Just hanging out at the top

1136
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:37,081
How do I do this? Wow, you're good.

1137
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:38,541
How are you so good?

1138
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:48,759
"Meanwhile, Jung Kook begins to ride"

1139
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:49,844
Falling leaf.

1140
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:03,733
This snow doesn't hurt at all!

1141
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:06,110
I love it.

1142
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:22,585
I keep getting stuck.

1143
01:05:23,377 --> 01:05:24,378
What do I do?

1144
01:05:28,132 --> 01:05:29,967
This snow's amazing, though.

1145
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:34,305
It doesn't hurt when you fall here.

1146
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:43,606
Slowly getting used to the powdery snow

1147
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:53,240
It's hard,

1148
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,201
but it's fun.

1149
01:05:57,662 --> 01:06:00,247
No time to rest

1150
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:05,294
Not a professional

1151
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:07,755
Not trying out for a competition

1152
01:06:10,424 --> 01:06:13,886
While Jung Kook dominates the slope

1153
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:22,019
"Jimin is busy hugging the snow"

1154
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:23,688
I'm tired.

1155
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,106
What did I get myself into?

1156
01:06:26,732 --> 01:06:30,444
But I'm going to show you
how fast I learn.

1157
01:06:32,613 --> 01:06:33,948
I'm just not used to snowboarding.

1158
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:35,032
Oh, no!

1159
01:06:48,462 --> 01:06:49,547
Open your arms.

1160
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,174
Open my arms.

1161
01:06:54,218 --> 01:06:56,554
Go like this.

1162
01:06:58,139 --> 01:07:01,434
"Magnificent teamwork"

1163
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:02,685
I'm tired.

1164
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:03,894
How will I get down there?

1165
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:16,115
How am I supposed to get down there?

1166
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:27,585
"Wow"

1167
01:07:27,668 --> 01:07:29,545
"I'm going"

1168
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:31,255
"Downnnn"

1169
01:07:31,338 --> 01:07:32,548
I'm doing it!

1170
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:37,803
"Finally gaining some speed
after lots of hard work"

1171
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:38,888
I'm doing it.

1172
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:40,681
I'm doing it!

1173
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:42,725
I can actually do this.

1174
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:54,445
First snowboarding record >> 00:33:01

1175
01:07:54,528 --> 01:07:55,529
Good.

1176
01:07:58,282 --> 01:08:00,409
- Just keep doing that.
- Okay.

1177
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:07,750
Let's go.

1178
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,210
Not here? All right.

1179
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:17,843
Bend over a little.

1180
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:32,149
Remember, this is a sport
that requires patience and perseverance

1181
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:42,201
Jung Kook is passing by

1182
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:47,957
Should I stop here?

1183
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:51,127
I'm a fast learner, right?

1184
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:52,795
Wow, next time…

1185
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:54,839
- Sorry?
- Next time,

1186
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:56,799
- you'd get down here at once.
- Right.

1187
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:04,390
It's hot here.

1188
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:06,725
The back of my head is burning up.

1189
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:09,854
I'll ride even cooler this time.

1190
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:10,938
Okay.

1191
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:14,900
- Thank you.
- No problem.

1192
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:17,403
"Going back to the starting point"

1193
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:18,487
Go!

1194
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:23,909
I think I can do better now.

1195
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:32,835
Oh, hello!

1196
01:09:33,752 --> 01:09:34,753
How have you been?

1197
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:35,838
I'm good.

1198
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:39,800
I loved it.

1199
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:47,516
I don't know how my hair is right now.

1200
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:56,650
I look like a really cool snowboarder

1201
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:58,944
on this camera.

1202
01:10:00,988 --> 01:10:02,156
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

1203
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,240
Should I go first?

1204
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:04,742
Yes.

1205
01:10:04,825 --> 01:10:06,076
Then I'm off.

1206
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:09,205
Let's go.

1207
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:13,250
I want to ride like this too.

1208
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:16,003
Do you know this?

1209
01:10:16,086 --> 01:10:17,922
It's carving. Like this.

1210
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:20,299
Yes, but I keep falling down
when I do that.

1211
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,677
I think it only works
if you have some speed.

1212
01:10:33,437 --> 01:10:35,522
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1213
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:43,489
Goodness

1214
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:47,701
- Are you okay?
- Of course.

1215
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:52,957
Think of the science.

1216
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:04,969
Okay.

1217
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:11,392
The tutoring was effective

1218
01:11:11,558 --> 01:11:12,559
Thank you.

1219
01:11:13,686 --> 01:11:15,854
Why did you fall over?

1220
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:20,025
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1221
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:31,704
I like going fast.
It feels great going fast.

1222
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:33,372
I want to go faster.

1223
01:11:40,587 --> 01:11:42,548
It feels great going fast.

1224
01:11:43,674 --> 01:11:46,010
So this is why you snowboard.

1225
01:11:46,093 --> 01:11:47,261
It's really fun.

1226
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,982
The clouds are so pretty.

1227
01:12:01,358 --> 01:12:02,651
Where did Jung Kook go?

1228
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:22,046
360° turn

1229
01:12:22,129 --> 01:12:23,130
This is fun.

1230
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:25,424
This is fun.

1231
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:28,302
I love it!

1232
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:34,808
Full of energy

1233
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:39,271
Meanwhile, Jimin is out

1234
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:46,862
So fun!

1235
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:55,954
This is a bit exhausting.

1236
01:12:56,997 --> 01:12:58,582
- What?
- It's exhausting.

1237
01:12:58,957 --> 01:12:59,958
Yes.

1238
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:03,170
It sucks the energy right out of you.

1239
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:04,755
My tongue is frozen.

1240
01:13:06,006 --> 01:13:09,426
It's hard going around the entire slope.

1241
01:13:10,427 --> 01:13:11,970
"I don't care"

1242
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:13,055
It's so fun.

1243
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:15,474
It's so fun. So fun.

1244
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:16,600
"Let's rest for now"

1245
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:18,394
- Jung Kook.
- Yes?

1246
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:19,478
Come here.

1247
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:22,231
- Why?
- Come here.

1248
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:23,524
Let's take a picture.

1249
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:26,151
Wouldn't it be better if you moved?

1250
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:37,121
- Skiing would be fun too.
- What?

1251
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:38,872
Skiing would be fun too.

1252
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:42,876
"His eyes asking for Jimin's approval"

1253
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,378
Do you want to try it later?

1254
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:46,964
But how do you ski?

1255
01:13:47,714 --> 01:13:48,715
I'm curious.

1256
01:13:50,634 --> 01:13:52,803
"First-timer's express tutor session"

1257
01:13:52,886 --> 01:13:55,764
- Do I have to push?
- Yes, press down with your shin.

1258
01:13:56,473 --> 01:13:57,641
Like this. Like this.

1259
01:13:58,308 --> 01:13:59,893
It's better to throw that away.

1260
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:02,271
- When I fall over?
- Yes, if you have those…

1261
01:14:02,354 --> 01:14:04,106
Jung Kook's going.

1262
01:14:06,233 --> 01:14:07,276
Let's go.

1263
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:12,406
Jung Kook immediately applies
what he learned

1264
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:21,039
I'd get hurt if I made a cross.

1265
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:24,751
I shouldn't bend my waist, right?

1266
01:14:29,089 --> 01:14:30,549
"Springs up"

1267
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:31,633
All right!

1268
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:35,304
That's it!

1269
01:14:35,929 --> 01:14:36,930
Okay.

1270
01:14:37,014 --> 01:14:38,640
"While Jung Kook
is getting the hang of it"

1271
01:14:39,266 --> 01:14:41,435
You can turn
by pressing down with your foot.

1272
01:14:43,395 --> 01:14:45,522
Stand still for a bit. That's right.

1273
01:14:47,524 --> 01:14:51,570
"Jimin also learns to ski solo"

1274
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:58,410
Let's go!

1275
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:04,791
What happened, Jung Kook?

1276
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:06,752
Wow, what's this?

1277
01:15:07,377 --> 01:15:08,545
Let's go!

1278
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:15,052
What happened, Jung Kook?

1279
01:15:15,427 --> 01:15:16,845
Wow, what's this?

1280
01:15:20,098 --> 01:15:24,394
His athleticism
isn't even surprising anymore

1281
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:26,688
I'm free!

1282
01:15:28,273 --> 01:15:31,485
Immediately finishes two turns

1283
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:33,946
It's fun.

1284
01:15:34,446 --> 01:15:35,697
Balance.

1285
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:37,324
Right.

1286
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:39,326
Turn left.

1287
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:41,745
Turn right again.

1288
01:15:43,413 --> 01:15:46,416
+ Another ski prodigy discovered

1289
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,502
You're doing very well.

1290
01:15:48,752 --> 01:15:49,753
It's fun.

1291
01:16:02,266 --> 01:16:03,850
Down. Up.

1292
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:05,894
Down.

1293
01:16:07,854 --> 01:16:08,855
Up.

1294
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:09,940
"Keeping up with the basics"

1295
01:16:10,023 --> 01:16:11,066
Down.

1296
01:16:12,442 --> 01:16:13,735
Up, down.

1297
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:15,362
It's hard.

1298
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:18,407
I think I prefer skiing.

1299
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:20,409
Use my shin!

1300
01:16:21,868 --> 01:16:23,120
My shin!

1301
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:30,669
Jimin got a speed boost with the skis

1302
01:16:36,508 --> 01:16:38,093
It's so fun.

1303
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:39,678
This is exactly my style.

1304
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:43,098
- Last one!
- One last time!

1305
01:16:44,057 --> 01:16:47,561
Up, down. Up, down.

1306
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:50,856
Are you okay?

1307
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:53,775
I'm not okay. My knees are out.

1308
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:55,360
Press with my right foot.

1309
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:56,486
You're doing well!

1310
01:16:57,362 --> 01:16:58,739
Let's go!

1311
01:16:58,822 --> 01:16:59,990
Up.

1312
01:17:00,657 --> 01:17:01,783
Down.

1313
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:03,201
All right, let's do it!

1314
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:04,995
Up, down.

1315
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:09,666
"Enjoying until the very last moment"

1316
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:11,460
It's so hard. So hard.

1317
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,128
Well done.

1318
01:17:13,378 --> 01:17:15,047
Wow, that was fun.

1319
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:18,008
Yes, I loved it.

1320
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:20,844
Thank you.

1321
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:24,848
Thank you.

1322
01:17:29,227 --> 01:17:30,604
Everything's so white.

1323
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:35,817
All the fur's in my mouth.

1324
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:38,320
I didn't fall over.

1325
01:17:39,529 --> 01:17:41,198
Skiing was a lot more fun.

1326
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:44,785
- Thank you.
- It was so fun I couldn't stop.

1327
01:17:44,868 --> 01:17:48,580
I rode through the pain shouting,
"Press with my shin!"

1328
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:50,874
"Press harder if you don't want to fall!"

1329
01:17:52,626 --> 01:17:55,295
I loved skiing so much.

1330
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:56,922
Snowboarding was fun too.

1331
01:17:57,130 --> 01:17:59,257
They were equally fun for me.

1332
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:02,469
I didn't wear covers,
and now my cheeks are frozen.

1333
01:18:03,303 --> 01:18:05,389
They're actually scalding.

1334
01:18:05,472 --> 01:18:07,849
You've got a line here.

1335
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:09,017
I'm all right.

1336
01:18:09,142 --> 01:18:11,561
I think you got sunburned.

1337
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:13,230
Below my eyes?

1338
01:18:13,313 --> 01:18:15,899
It's red and it made a line here.

1339
01:18:15,982 --> 01:18:17,651
It's like you're wearing a mask.

1340
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:20,445
Then I should just tan this part now.

1341
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:21,530
That's right.

1342
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:23,073
That was so fun.

1343
01:18:23,156 --> 01:18:24,574
Both of my knees are aching.

1344
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:25,659
That was fun!

1345
01:18:25,909 --> 01:18:27,994
I look like a clown.

1346
01:18:28,078 --> 01:18:31,415
Gosh, I feel my age now.

1347
01:18:31,915 --> 01:18:33,500
That was so fun.

1348
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,086
I'm out of energy. I need food.

1349
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:40,132
"At last, the final night"

1350
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:41,591
I had fun. It's our last night.

1351
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:42,676
Yes, our last night.

1352
01:18:45,637 --> 01:18:47,097
This is amazing.

1353
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:54,146
Their day comes to an end

1354
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:57,941
I think I enjoyed this trip
as much as I could,

1355
01:18:58,024 --> 01:18:59,651
so I'll be more relaxed when I get back.

1356
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:02,320
Laughing until late at night

1357
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:04,614
Chatting

1358
01:19:04,698 --> 01:19:06,825
And reminiscing

1359
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:09,286
To finish off their trip

1360
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:11,538
Be stronger!

1361
01:19:11,621 --> 01:19:13,123
-Be stronger!
-Let's be stronger!

1362
01:19:13,206 --> 01:19:15,834
How will Jimin and Jung Kook's trip end?

1363
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:20,380
Are You Sure?!

1364
01:19:20,464 --> 01:19:21,465
