1
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,810
Are You Sure?!

2
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:20,770
Jimin and Jung Kook promised a next trip

3
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,106
Their next destination is Jeju Island

4
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,191
Ask

5
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,693
And you shall receive!

6
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:30,321
The perfect day gets even better
with a guest

7
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,991
And that's V!

8
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,119
The youngest members'
Jeju Island trip begins

9
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,370
Three of them together

10
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,581
Means three times the energy

11
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,083
And three times the laughs

12
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,172
The puppy-like Jung Kook

13
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:50,633
With the 95 liners' best friend chemistry

14
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:56,014
Their first day on Jeju Island
was filled with laughter

15
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,143
What more adventures await them?

16
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,564
"This was filmed safely
in compliance with traffic laws"

17
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,447
When was the last time

18
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,491
you had an omakase?

19
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,825
- Me?
- Yes.

20
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,035
When I was in Japan.

21
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,621
- Recently?
- Yes.

22
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:21,456
- Mr. Jimin.
- Yes?

23
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,042
- Mr. V.
- Yes?

24
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,795
This is great.

25
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,964
Jung Kook.

26
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:31,674
Yes, Jimin?

27
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,051
Relax your shoulders a bit.

28
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,969
- Sorry?
- Relax your shoulders a bit.

29
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,392
He's cute

30
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,978
Riding a motorcycle really suits him.

31
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,105
It's so nice out.

32
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,107
It looks nice.

33
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,275
I love it.

34
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,447
He really seems
to enjoy riding it.

35
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,282
He looks excited.

36
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,787
The weather's amazing.

37
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,622
Yes, it's really nice.

38
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,920
Horses.

39
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,506
I see them.

40
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,259
What are they doing?

41
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,395
It's so great traveling with you guys.

42
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,480
Let's do this more often.

43
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,565
I'd love that.

44
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,091
- We're almost at the restaurant, Mr. V.
- Okay.

45
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,010
- Is it here?
- Yes.

46
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,221
I can't see.

47
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,559
Is this it?

48
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:05,685
Yes.

49
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,562
Is this the way?

50
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,815
There's nothing here.

51
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,906
Only darkness surrounds the path

52
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:19,657
Is anything even here?

53
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,703
There's an omakase place here?

54
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:24,913
There it is.

55
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,081
It really is here.

56
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,547
Japanese Restaurant

57
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,218
We're here to eat omakase.

58
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,844
This is the restaurant.

59
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,847
I heard the omakase here

60
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,225
is to die for.

61
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,476
All right, let's go in.

62
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,602
Let's go.

63
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,604
- Let's go.
- The moon's pretty.

64
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,856
It's the second moon on my back.

65
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,067
Right.

66
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,610
Something smells great.

67
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,528
Hello.

68
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,613
- Hello.
- Hello.

69
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:01,491
- Hello.
- Wow, it smells insanely good.

70
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,618
- I'm so excited.
- Me too.

71
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,536
- Hello.
- May I start serving?

72
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,330
- Yes, please.
- I can't wait.

73
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,456
I'm starving.

74
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,540
"Starting with tea"

75
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,087
I've never been

76
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,882
to an omakase place
and sat in front of the chef.

77
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,681
This is my first time.

78
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:28,142
"Carefully adjusting"

79
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:31,854
I should've worn more formal clothes.

80
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,815
Let me try this tea.

81
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,655
Here is the appetizer.

82
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:41,990
Thank you.

83
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,241
This is goma tofu.

84
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,867
- Thank you.
- Please enjoy.

85
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,204
Would you like
to have a drink to go with your food?

86
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,455
- Me?
- Yes.

87
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,499
- Just tea is fine.
- Okay.

88
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:52,875
Wow, this is it.

89
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,298
It's delicious.

90
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,924
Was tofu always this great?

91
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,093
- Wow, it's good.
- After the appetizer,

92
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,053
next is the croaker stew.

93
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,055
- Thank you.
- Jimin would love this.

94
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,433
It's best when you have it
with the sauce on the left.

95
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,685
You can put the bones on the orange plate.

96
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,353
Do I dip or pour this?

97
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,897
You can dip it
or pour it into the soup.

98
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,608
Keep in mind that it's tangy and salty.

99
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,693
Thank you.

100
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,570
"This is insane"

101
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,785
It feels like I'm eating at home.

102
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,705
I'm so happy.

103
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,921
I regret headbanging so much.

104
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:43,676
The aftermath of rocking out
earlier that day…

105
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,178
Where does it hurt? Here?

106
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,262
Here.

107
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:47,972
- Here?
- Yes.

108
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,141
Here, let me.

109
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,319
It's so delicious
it makes him unaware of others' pain

110
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,864
It's strange that my neck hurts so much
but Jung Kook is completely fine.

111
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,908
- He has a thick neck.
- What?

112
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,952
What? What did I do?

113
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,789
- What did I do?
- You and I did some headbanging together.

114
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:13,873
Yes.

115
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,333
So my neck hurts so much.

116
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,753
I'm not sure, but this is delicious

117
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,089
This is great.

118
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,591
I love this.

119
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,386
- What?
- I love this.

120
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:30,056
Up next is yellow corvina sushi

121
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,350
Mm.

122
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,687
It's like these fish are swimming
inside my mouth.

123
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,980
Thank you.

124
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,732
What?

125
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,484
But they're all dead.

126
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,319
- What?
- They're all filleted.

127
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,613
I mean that it's that fresh.

128
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,491
- What?
- I don't expect you to understand.

129
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:49,992
Just keep eating.

130
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:57,208
- It's so good.
- The saw-edged perch.

131
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,252
We don't always have that fish in.

132
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,630
"Serious about insert shots"

133
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,677
Let me taste the saw-edged perch.

134
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,054
He's pretending to be a YouTuber.

135
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,014
That's what you're supposed to do.

136
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,766
Why don't you do it, then?

137
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,226
I'll do it from now on.

138
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:21,983
The saw-edged perch.

139
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,652
He's good. You try it.

140
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,863
"Up next is the black-spot goatfish sushi"

141
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:27,947
So delicious.

142
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,412
Can you feel the black spots?

143
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,457
- It tastes like white spots.
- White?

144
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,293
You gave me white spots.

145
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,212
You should've gone like this.

146
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,552
Why do you do that?

147
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,179
For taking outline photos?

148
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,265
You just read that off somewhere,
didn't you?

149
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,933
You got me.

150
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:59,604
Do you mind?
I'm doing a mukbang right now.

151
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,439
You can't use this. Bye.

152
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,321
Whoa!

153
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,072
Can you see the sushi better?

154
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,161
Looks delicious

155
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,170
What, did someone shoot you? What's wrong?

156
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,889
What's next…?

157
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,526
Eyes glued to the front

158
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,652
I think

159
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,822
this is our first time
just waiting for food at an omakase

160
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,783
and not even speaking to each other.

161
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,785
- Like baby birds.
- Right.

162
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,874
The lighting is…

163
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,185
Wait, why can't I see this on my camera?

164
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,645
Oh, it works.

165
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,981
The camera doesn't do the color justice.

166
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:32,989
This is so delicious.

167
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,075
Please enjoy.

168
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,994
- I don't want to ruin this.
- I love urchin roe.

169
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,078
This looks unique.

170
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,373
I love sea urchin roe.

171
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,001
You're great at taking pictures of food.

172
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,296
- I learned…
- Oh, wow.

173
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:51,173
…that it's best to zoom in
when you take pictures of food.

174
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,050
- Let me see.
- He's really good.

175
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,511
He's good.

176
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,479
Mm.

177
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,452
Insane.

178
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,205
It's so good, I have to calm myself down.

179
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,373
It's not over yet.

180
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,250
Apple mango.

181
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,343
- It's delicious.
- It melts in your mouth.

182
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:39,847
This is reef squid.

183
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:40,931
Reef squid sushi?

184
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:47,229
The sushi relay continues

185
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,693
You eat it with the sauce.

186
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,507
This is insane.

187
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:21,681
I like this show.

188
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,182
- Me too.
- Right?

189
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,767
- Me too.
- Right?

190
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,936
Let's do this more often. I like it.

191
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,025
Why didn't RM come today?

192
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,194
- Here?
- Yeah.

193
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:39,115
Not everyone gets to come on this show.

194
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,575
It's actually for just the two of us

195
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,743
and we let you in.

196
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,371
You know, I felt that too.

197
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,539
Thank you for letting me in.

198
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,334
That was unexpected.

199
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,301
I want to eat this elegantly

200
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,680
but it's so delicious
that I can't control myself.

201
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,265
You're elegance itself.

202
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,892
- Was that nice?
- Sure.

203
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,103
Let me take your plate.

204
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,480
- Thank you.
- Is everything all right so far?

205
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,648
Everything's great.

206
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,569
Everything from the humidity
to the atmosphere is perfect.

207
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,738
- Thank you.
- How high is the humidity?

208
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:19,989
Glaring

209
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,032
I guess you don't know.

210
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,703
I can't believe
I can be this full with sushi.

211
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,496
I love it.

212
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,915
This is luxurious.

213
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,627
The dessert to top off everything

214
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,716
How will this taste?

215
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:40,968
It's tangy.

216
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,762
It's a perfect way to end the meal.

217
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,180
Thank you so much.

218
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,765
Thank you for enjoying the meal.

219
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,517
- That was great.
- I know.

220
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,602
The best.

221
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:53,230
I'll definitely come again.
Have a nice day.

222
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,440
Thank you.

223
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,816
Thank you.

224
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,818
Wow, this place is great.

225
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,446
Hello?

226
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:01,906
Hey, RM.

227
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:05,785
You know the unreleased song
you sang at SUGA's concert?

228
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,912
- Untitled.
- Yes.

229
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,997
Could you send me that song?

230
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,665
I'll send it to you.

231
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,043
Please do. I want to listen to it.

232
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,503
- Okay.
- Okay.

233
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,879
- Okay.
- Okay.

234
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,089
Okay.

235
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,258
Hey, hey! Let's get it!

236
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,719
Are you ready?

237
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,387
Yes.

238
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,103
RM sang this song at SUGA's concert.

239
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:34,897
Want me to take this off?

240
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,024
- This was the song?
- Yes.

241
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,236
I love this.

242
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,574
It's all right.

243
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,673
Oh!

244
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,217
How did he write such an amazing song?

245
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,095
I'm curious what goes inside his head.

246
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,810
Wow. So great.

247
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,912
I swear I'm going
to cover this song one day.

248
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,498
It's like RM…

249
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,252
brought to life

250
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,213
exactly the music I hoped for.

251
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,091
What you hoped for RM?

252
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:47,678
- No, he did what I hoped for myself.
- Ah.

253
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:51,849
It was the kind of music
I hoped I'd do once in my lifetime

254
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,310
- and he brought it to life…
- Mm.

255
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,730
…so I'm curious about his thought process.

256
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,275
Like, what was he thinking
when he made this?

257
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,360
What did he do…

258
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,114
to write this song?

259
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,995
When I say I want to broaden my spectrum,

260
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,415
it's probably because of RM.

261
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:37,853
Oh, yeah, yeah. Shout out to RM.

262
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,314
There's another song I like.

263
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,989
You knew I'd like this, right?

264
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,283
I actually didn't.

265
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,544
It was so hard
writing the lyrics for this.

266
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,173
I'd write it by myself
in the car and stuff.

267
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:11,762
You know what I thought of
when I listened to your album?

268
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,431
That time in Las Vegas
when you said you didn't know what to do.

269
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,850
- Oh, that time.
- We talked in your room.

270
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,186
You, j-hope, and I
talked in Jung Kook's room.

271
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,688
- With me.
- With you.

272
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,482
- Yes, the four of us.
- Yes, we were talking.

273
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:27,069
I talked to SUGA after that too.

274
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,654
And also RM.

275
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:33,158
Then I came back
and started writing this album right away.

276
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,417
Anyone who likes this song the most
in your album

277
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,753
would be very similar to me.

278
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:49,466
Thank you.

279
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,968
Hey, wait.

280
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:54,513
What? No, don't overthink it.

281
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,184
Let's go.

282
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,821
That was a good evening, everyone.

283
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,823
Good job, Jung Kook.

284
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,993
Good job.

285
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,206
Should we go for a swim to cool off?

286
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,542
- Should we?
- Mm…

287
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,419
The sun's down and all.

288
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,671
I hope it's cool in here.

289
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,507
Yes, this is it.

290
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,259
That was great.

291
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,263
Let me set this up right here
just in case.

292
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,183
Today was great.

293
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,978
This is what traveling

294
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,522
is all about!

295
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,107
What was it?

296
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,026
- What?
- I'm using the upstairs one.

297
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,948
Nostalgic Y2K vibes

298
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:57,993
You know, something like this?

299
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,704
Oh, right. Of course.

300
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:06,627
"The master singer appears in a swimsuit"

301
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,839
Aren't you swimming, V?

302
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,467
Give me some time. I'm still full.

303
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,052
Okay.

304
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,188
All right.

305
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,072
The water's nice and warm.

306
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,662
- Hey, Mr. Jimin.
- Hey, Mr. Jung Kook.

307
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,123
What's up?

308
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,000
It's nice and warm.

309
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,923
It's warm

310
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,466
It's all see-through.

311
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:13,735
This is fun.

312
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,283
I love this.

313
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,744
Take this

314
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,246
Splash attack

315
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,875
Jeju-raised seaweed

316
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,589
Inner peace

317
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,489
This is fun.

318
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,909
V should join us too.

319
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,203
Hey, the guest is coming.

320
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,372
He must be bored and wanting attention.

321
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,833
- He must be lonely.
- He's lonely.

322
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,044
This is super fun. Do you want to see?

323
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,420
Let's play rock, paper, scissors.

324
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:17,424
Host 1, 2: Watch this

325
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:25,599
A pair of hosts desperate for attention

326
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,356
He's going to bed.

327
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:40,197
Guest star V gets ready for bed first

328
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,660
V's combing his hair.

329
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,537
- He's the guest.
- Right.

330
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,164
Guests can comb their hair.

331
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,502
Yes, guests should look pretty.

332
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:59,549
But the hosts don't have to

333
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,134
Jung Kook: Bang

334
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,887
Jimin: Ouch, that hurts

335
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:07,516
Comfortable like your own bed

336
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:16,149
The Creation of JimKook

337
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:25,867
This was fun

338
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:34,918
That's enough.

339
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,214
Should we go shower?

340
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,428
You're done?

341
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,554
Yes.

342
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,265
That was fun.

343
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,935
Oh, it's cold. It's cold.

344
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,233
It's cold.

345
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,110
That was fun.

346
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,237
Great.

347
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,073
Now it's warm.

348
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:08,327
What should we do after washing up?

349
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,287
Do you want some ramyeon?

350
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,955
No, we shouldn't eat.

351
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,375
I bet you'll eat when I make some.

352
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,089
"Taking it out on the fire"

353
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,507
I'm craving some ramyeon.

354
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,764
What? You don't have to eat.
I can eat it all.

355
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:37,189
What's keeping you from eating?
What do you have to do in Seoul?

356
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,273
Shoot a music video.

357
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,608
- Your music video?
- Yes.

358
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,942
You'll just be eating today, so…

359
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,486
But I'll eat tomorrow too.

360
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,990
Eat carbs just until today

361
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,909
and only protein from tomorrow.

362
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:50,702
You won't eat at all?

363
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,913
- Me? You mean carbs?
- Yes.

364
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,498
Well, I'll be eating.

365
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,545
Take a shower first.

366
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,799
We might feel differently after a shower.

367
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,052
This might be because we just swam.

368
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,474
- Yes, let's wash up first.
- Yeah.

369
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,727
It's a good idea
to shower first and then decide.

370
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,270
Okay.

371
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:28,615
V is off to his dreams

372
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,457
Should we eat it or not?

373
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,543
I don't mind either.

374
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,294
- You're leaving it up to me?
- Yes.

375
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:42,504
All right.

376
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,589
If we do, let's eat next to V.

377
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,716
I heard he's unwell.

378
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,718
- What?
- He's unwell.

379
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:52,013
Everything tastes better
next to a sick person.

380
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,183
That's a good point.

381
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:59,563
Yes, it's like encouraging
your friend to get better soon.

382
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:03,275
I actually don't want it
that much anymore.

383
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,902
You don't? Okay, then.

384
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,030
Should I still eat it?

385
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:17,372
"Watching the performance video
of Standing Next to You"

386
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:18,790
The title song?

387
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,584
Yes.

388
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:23,920
I love the choreography.

389
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,257
So that's what you have to shoot.

390
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,341
Yeah.

391
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,052
This is cool.

392
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,598
It's actually better
that it's not too powerful.

393
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,184
You're relaxed and effortless.

394
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:41,021
I can do that
when all the dancers are with me.

395
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,148
But it'll be hard without them.

396
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,525
I know you'll go all out again.

397
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,362
I'm actually tired.

398
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,530
Let's rest, then.

399
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,615
You know,

400
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,993
I haven't slept at all since New York.

401
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,161
Right?

402
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:57,579
Yes.

403
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:00,081
- You didn't sleep on the plane.
- Right.

404
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,128
- I'm sleepy.
- Let's call it a night.

405
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:07,464
All right, let's go.

406
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,759
Let's go. I'm off to bed.

407
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,469
- Go.
- Go.

408
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,804
Go, go, go.

409
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,431
Let's go together.

410
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,987
Don't hit my nose today.

411
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,034
If you do, I'll hit you too.

412
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,582
Man, I'm exhausted.

413
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:46,354
Taking a photo of V right after waking up

414
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,449
My stomach's growling.

415
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,037
You have a stomachache?

416
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,289
You're hungry?

417
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,461
Jung Kook.

418
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:10,795
Yes?

419
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,091
Can you massage my neck?

420
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,302
What did you say?

421
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,304
I have a muscle cramp.

422
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,014
You have a cramp?

423
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,144
Where?

424
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:28,980
- Here?
- Here.

425
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,523
- Here?
- Yes.

426
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,693
No more headbanging for me.

427
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,075
I haven't slept that well in a while.

428
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,410
What?

429
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:47,540
I always wake up
every two or three hours.

430
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,180
Okay, that's all for now.

431
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,855
Did I get sunburned?

432
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,415
Hey, Mom.

433
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,458
- Hey, Son.
- Hi.

434
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,043
- What are you doing?
- I'm filming.

435
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,796
I heard you're with Jimin right now.

436
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,631
I was wondering

437
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,091
if you'd be back by the holidays.

438
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,509
Do you have a cold?

439
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:40,593
No.

440
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,679
Then why are you sniffling?

441
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,098
No, it's just the morning.

442
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,392
Is it because of your rhinitis?

443
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:48,476
Yes.

444
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,687
Are you filming with Jimin right now?

445
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,564
And V too.

446
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:53,898
Is that so?

447
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,442
- Yes.
- Did you have breakfast?

448
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,944
- We're going to get some now.
- Okay.

449
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:00,488
You're coming home for Chuseok, right?

450
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,656
I am.

451
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:05,452
All right,
be careful out there and have fun.

452
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,203
- Okay.
- I love you.

453
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,496
I love you.

454
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,623
All right, enjoy your breakfast.

455
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,542
- Okay.
- Okay.

456
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:15,128
"Eight kinds of vitamin Bs."

457
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,046
Whoa!

458
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,846
I got all sunburned
riding the motorcycle yesterday.

459
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:32,270
"Recharging with energy right away"

460
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:36,941
- Did you try it?
- I did.

461
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,613
- Jung Kook.
- Yeah?

462
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:45,492
- Do you have tweezers?
- Tweezers?

463
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,619
Why? I don't have any.

464
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:48,703
"V is also recharging"

465
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,955
I have this one long hair.

466
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,168
I don't think
you can pluck that, though.

467
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:57,212
That's why I needed tweezers.

468
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,130
Really? Let me see.

469
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,548
Where?

470
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,302
Want me to pluck it?

471
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,056
I'm good at it.

472
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,682
No, no.

473
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:13,353
I've been wanting to pluck
this hair out for a while.

474
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:20,276
"Leaving his mustache alone
and hydrating his skin"

475
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,320
- Give me.
- I'm already refreshed.

476
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,489
Do you want a cute T-shirt?

477
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:37,877
Great.

478
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,672
It's instantly hydrating.

479
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,132
I don't even have to wash up.
I'm already refreshed.

480
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,717
It's moisturizing.

481
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,386
It is, yes.

482
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,683
Sit down. I'll give you a massage.

483
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,277
That pesky cramp.

484
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,529
That cramp is hurting me.

485
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:05,613
This jerk.

486
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,910
- Did I swim too hard yesterday?
- What?

487
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,620
Swimming was a lot of fun.

488
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,705
Why? What did you do?

489
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,957
I saw you guys
slapping each other in the water.

490
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,125
Yes.

491
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,586
It was hilarious yesterday.

492
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,171
- My heart was with you guys.
- It's hot.

493
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,676
Thank you.

494
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:27,760
Of course.

495
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,971
This cramp isn't bothering me anymore.

496
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,642
- Mr. V.
- Yes?

497
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,978
Let's go
get breakfast. I'm hungry.

498
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,062
Okay.

499
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,565
I'm starving
because I didn't have ramyeon last night.

500
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,358
Let's go, let's go.

501
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,279
A three-way split is fun!

502
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,491
- Shall we?
- Let's go.

503
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,827
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

504
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,706
- Let's go, I'm hungry.
- Spicy braised chicken.

505
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,333
Spicy braised chicken.

506
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,126
Let's go
have some spicy braised chicken.

507
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:01,961
Sounds delicious.

508
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,505
It's pretty hot today.

509
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,095
Oh, it's hot. It's hot.

510
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,764
It's really hot out.

511
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,849
It gets cooler when you ride.

512
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:45,088
There's Jimin

513
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:55,598
Music on

514
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,063
Hey!

515
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,649
The music turns off when they make a sound

516
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,192
Be quiet.

517
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,863
Music on

518
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,370
Manual music off

519
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,456
Are you toying with me right now?

520
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,125
I can't hear you.

521
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,759
Hey, don't clap.

522
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,553
I forgot. I'm sorry.

523
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:40,977
Oops, sorry.

524
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,563
He has a habit.

525
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:48,359
Riding again in silence

526
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,490
I don't hear music, Mr. Jung Kook.

527
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,951
Maybe because of the wind.

528
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,619
Maybe it's because of your bike.

529
00:33:58,745 --> 00:33:59,787
It can't be.

530
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:03,166
Your engine is too loud. Turn that down.

531
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,043
How would I even do that?

532
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,003
Just slow down.

533
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:11,799
Mr. Jung Kook.

534
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,135
Yes? It doesn't work.

535
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,553
Word chain game.

536
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:16,637
"All of a sudden?"

537
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,181
Bike.

538
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,058
Christmas.

539
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,018
Sweden.

540
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,728
Denmark.

541
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,064
Crayon.

542
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,190
"Yon"?

543
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,566
Yon…

544
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,651
Yonderly.

545
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,987
"Ly"? "Ree"?

546
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:35,990
Retire.

547
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:41,370
"An intense battle"

548
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:42,955
Borrow.

549
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:44,665
Wallpaper.

550
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,626
Resilience.

551
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:48,169
"Ce"?

552
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:49,879
Ceiling.

553
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:51,422
Growth.

554
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,217
"Th"? Wow, you're good.

555
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,595
Thought.

556
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,680
Thwap?

557
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:00,765
Thought.

558
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,141
What's "thwap"?

559
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,226
Thought.

560
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,228
Oh. Thinking.

561
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:08,147
Oh. G…

562
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:10,566
You lose!

563
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,277
Wow, you're really good.

564
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,822
You threw me some tough letters.

565
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,115
I'm good, right?

566
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,158
Be quiet now, let's listen to the music.

567
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,351
We're here.

568
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,860
Let's go.

569
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,236
- What?
- Let's go.

570
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,865
I'm excited for this.
Spicy braised chicken.

571
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,412
We have to take a picture here.

572
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,165
That looks insane.

573
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,709
That's just…

574
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:13,754
This is just insane. I'm already drooling.

575
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,840
Wow, awesome.

576
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,675
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

577
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,677
- Hello.
- Did you see that?

578
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,137
This is awesome.

579
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,806
Aren't those gamasot lids?

580
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,934
Come on, that's just insane.

581
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,687
I'm even wearing red.
I'm ready for splashes.

582
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,439
It smells amazing.

583
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,733
I can't wait to eat it. My goodness.

584
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:35,902
Let's have some fun.

585
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,195
It's here.

586
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:38,779
Wow!

587
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,573
I'm going nuts.

588
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,035
Whoa!

589
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,370
Wow, sir.

590
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,998
This looks incredible. Wow.

591
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,168
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

592
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,045
I'm dying to eat it.

593
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,421
Anyone want some soda?

594
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:56,505
I'm all right.

595
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:57,632
Oh…

596
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,259
I never have anything sweet
before eating delicious food.

597
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,762
Jimin, you don't drink soda
with a meal, right?

598
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,722
No. Only after I eat.

599
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,933
Yes, I know Jimin very well.

600
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:08,517
Thank you.

601
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:13,439
All eyes are on the spicy braised chicken

602
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,818
Oh, they pour some broth
to cook ramyeon in there too.

603
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,321
How do they do it?

604
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,698
That's just awesome.

605
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,284
Whoa.

606
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,036
My goodness.

607
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,663
Will we have some rice right away?

608
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,707
Rice? We'll serve you ramyeon
first and make some fried rice next.

609
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,626
- Oh, fried rice.
- Thank you.

610
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:36,963
I see potatoes.

611
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,508
I just took the camera
that was filming Jimin.

612
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,176
Wow.

613
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,261
What's this?

614
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,513
Potato? I don't know.

615
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,890
- Is it sweet potato?
- Look at the size.

616
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,226
I'll put it back on Jimin.

617
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,731
Mm.

618
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,323
This is amazing.

619
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:15,251
"Dongchimi for Jung Kook"

620
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,586
- Here.
- Thank you.

621
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,671
Dongchimi for V

622
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,214
- Here.
- Why, thank you.

623
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,299
Sure.

624
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,260
Dongchimi for me

625
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,265
Is this potato or sweet potato?

626
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,146
This one's sweet potato.

627
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:43,112
V and Jimin are too focused on the dish

628
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,453
You scared me. Hold on.

629
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:54,498
So this is what "delicious spicy" is.

630
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,168
- This isn't spicy.
- It's just right.

631
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,086
Just spicy enough.

632
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,548
It's so good

633
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,468
Is the ramyeon done?

634
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,136
Time for the ramyeon

635
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,606
Wow, that was great.

636
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,024
- What?
- What?

637
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,484
- Are you done?
- I said it was great.

638
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:23,444
Are you done?

639
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,404
Let's dig in.

640
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,285
Come here, you.

641
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:45,549
Excited footwork

642
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:49,261
I can't eat less when it's this good.

643
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:52,848
What can I do?

644
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:54,809
- Are you angry?
- Yes.

645
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,191
Can I take the neck?

646
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,275
Yes.

647
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:06,445
I'm doing you a favor.

648
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,114
Thank you.

649
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,158
This is a wing.

650
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,368
You eat the wing.

651
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,957
My favorite part of a chicken is the neck.

652
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,875
"Serendipity" should have the wing.

653
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,419
- What?
- What?

654
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,380
Is this a carrot?

655
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,673
Yes, it is.

656
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,842
- Do you want sweet potato?
- No, I like carrots.

657
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,260
Wow, look at this adult.

658
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,388
- You don't eat carrots?
- No.

659
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:33,472
Me neither.

660
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,186
The fried rice is here.

661
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,813
Look here.

662
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,565
You take a spoonful of fried rice

663
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,775
and pour some soup on it.

664
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:45,860
Yes.

665
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,737
And have it with some shredded chicken.

666
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:50,781
Mm.

667
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,576
That's the stuff.

668
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:58,831
Insane.

669
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,708
I wasn't going to do this,

670
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:01,959
but let's put noodle on it.

671
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,337
No, that's too much. It's too much.

672
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,173
No, no. Just watch me.

673
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:08,716
Let me try it.

674
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,562
This is the stuff!

675
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:23,481
Are you angry?

676
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,072
I've been stuffed nonstop
since last night.

677
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,158
I'm stuffed again.

678
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,912
I'm done.

679
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:40,789
- You're done?
- Yes.

680
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,294
I think I've eaten twice as much as you.

681
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,421
You're not a big eater.

682
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,048
What?

683
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:50,466
You're not a big eater.

684
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,468
I ate a lot.

685
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:53,594
Really?

686
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,596
You're just eating loads.

687
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,724
Why do I keep eating when I'm full?

688
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,017
I'm still going.

689
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,736
This scallion.

690
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,198
V and Jimin are in awe of Jung Kook

691
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:22,581
That meal came and went like a storm

692
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,251
I ate like crazy.

693
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,794
I'm so full.

694
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,212
I'm stuffed.

695
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:30,339
It's like Tan is holding his paw out.

696
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,551
Is that really Tan?

697
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:34,802
I heard it is.

698
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,598
Isn't that the hat V always wears?

699
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,517
Oh, the red one?

700
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,768
Tan is so adorable.

701
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,647
- Tan…
- Tan loves his dad so much, doesn't he?

702
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,191
I know it because even when I hold him,

703
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,359
he only looks at V.

704
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:53,779
Tan looked great on camera
when he was on that music show.

705
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,573
- Yes, he did.
- Yes, he was super cute.

706
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,951
The supreme cuteness of dogs.

707
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,244
- He's so cute.
- Super cute.

708
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:02,705
I missed Bam when I saw that.

709
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,206
I need to go see him.

710
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:05,874
Why are you angry?

711
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:08,377
You can just go.

712
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:11,338
I'm too busy.

713
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:16,093
You know, dogs usually remember

714
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:20,848
the people who played with them
when they were young,

715
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,517
but Tan doesn't remember at all.

716
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,394
- What do you mean?
- But Tan was too young then

717
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:26,854
when we were living in Hannam.

718
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:30,274
But I practically raised him back then.

719
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:31,984
- I put him to sleep and all.
- Hey, that was…

720
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,611
That was only a few weeks.

721
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:34,862
Yes, a few weeks.

722
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:37,823
A few days, actually. Not a few weeks.

723
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:39,742
Yes, it was about a week,

724
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:42,119
but you should still be thankful
for that week.

725
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,996
Tan is already seven years old now.

726
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:45,873
He can't remember that one week.

727
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,082
I'm just sad.

728
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,628
We have to pay in cash.

729
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,421
All right. I understand.

730
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:55,215
Thank you. Do you take Kakao Pay?

731
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,301
No, I don't. Just wire me the money.

732
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,303
- Wire you?
- Yes, wire me the money.

733
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,849
Do you want my banking information?

734
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:05,851
Let's go.

735
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,394
Let's get some coffee.

736
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,021
Coffee!

737
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,484
This is pretty.

738
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,404
Coffee.

739
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:19,531
This is a café?

740
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:27,539
Café

741
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,416
This is a café?

742
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,377
Let's go, V. Coffee!

743
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,296
There was a café right over here.

744
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,509
Do you know this, Jimin?

745
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,678
- Jimin.
- Yes?

746
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,394
My Eonnyeon…?

747
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:51,188
Daegil…!

748
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,654
"To be continued…"

749
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:00,656
- Hello.
- Isn't this cute?

750
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,491
Yes, it's very cute inside.

751
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:04,410
Wow, this place is really

752
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,495
comforting somehow.

753
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:12,668
Whoa.

754
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,970
- Hello.
- Hello.

755
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:25,347
A Jeju multigrain latte, please.

756
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,599
- Iced?
- Yes, iced.

757
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,059
- Are you okay with milk?
- Hi.

758
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:32,855
Thank you.

759
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:34,189
You should order.

760
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,775
- Oh, what?
- A cat.

761
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:38,026
That wasn't a toy?

762
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:39,236
No.

763
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:41,655
It's reacting.

764
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:44,324
So adorable

765
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,579
- I love it.
- This place is great.

766
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,873
It's insane.

767
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:52,416
"Don't touch me"

768
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,548
What does this expression mean?

769
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:02,217
It's like it gave up on life.

770
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:03,594
"No thoughts at all"

771
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:04,928
So cute.

772
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,640
Why doesn't my meowing work?

773
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:10,476
"Too bad"

774
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:12,269
- I got the multigrain latte, misugaru.
- What?

775
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:13,812
- What about you?
- I got garden-ade.

776
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:16,064
Can I get an iced Americano?

777
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,399
One iced Americano.

778
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:18,734
Yes, thank you.

779
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:21,737
- This isn't mine?
- I love this place.

780
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:25,032
It's really nice here.

781
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,284
It has a nice vibe.

782
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:29,912
All right.

783
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:33,373
Look, it's stretching.
It's stretching.

784
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:35,959
Hi.

785
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,212
Go inside now.

786
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:41,840
I like it here.

787
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:49,348
Relaxed

788
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:51,517
It's like we're in Malta.

789
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,644
Malta was a lot of fun.

790
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:57,189
I really want to take a nap right now.

791
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:01,610
"Feeling drowsy"

792
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:03,195
Wow, look at those pictures.

793
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:04,655
I gave that to them.

794
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,406
They're both so cute.

795
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:08,450
Wow!

796
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:11,078
I guess the owner here likes cats.

797
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,414
There's a lot over here too.

798
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,959
Isn't that the cat from earlier?

799
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,504
So what time are you done working out?

800
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:25,008
It's an indoor gym?

801
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,260
That sounds so depressing.

802
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,597
Hello.

803
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,391
- Yes.
- Is this your first time here?

804
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:34,309
- No, it's my second.
- Really?

805
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,561
- Yes.
- Nice.

806
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:38,313
Don't you like it here? Nice, nice.

807
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:43,110
There's a song I play
for second-time visitors.

808
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,821
Your three drinks are ready.

809
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:47,364
Oh, thank you.

810
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:51,034
Thank you.

811
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:52,160
Thank you.

812
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:53,412
Thank you.

813
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:58,625
Wow, the server here is good-looking.

814
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,419
How do you feel about going on TV?

815
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:01,962
What are you talking about?

816
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,841
Maybe he's allergic to flattery.

817
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:06,925
"Too shy"

818
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,886
- He must be used to flattery.
- Excuse me, sir.

819
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,388
Sir, are you going
to drink all of that by yourself?

820
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,390
Yours isn't ready yet.

821
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:15,267
I heard the misugaru was ready.

822
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:18,186
Okay.

823
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,105
Which one is yours?

824
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,690
The big one is mine.

825
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:23,233
- The misugaru?
- Yes.

826
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:26,320
If you feel this is too thick,
you can mix in more milk.

827
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,404
Thank you.

828
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:28,614
Okay.

829
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,490
Thank you, sir.

830
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:32,784
And there's this.

831
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:34,453
Ah.

832
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,955
- Thanks.
- Sure.

833
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,582
- You're not very polite.
- What?

834
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:40,709
How old are you?

835
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:42,502
How old are you?

836
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:44,421
I'm 29.

837
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:45,672
- You're 29?
- Yes.

838
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,758
- How old are you?
- Get over here.

839
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:49,593
This guy is ridiculous

840
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:54,932
"We don't fight"

841
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:58,435
I like acidity in my coffee,
and this is very acidic.

842
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:02,648
This place has great coffee.

843
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,322
Yes, it's great here.

844
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:11,490
I like the misugaru.

845
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:28,548
This is great

846
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,425
Should I take a nap?

847
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:37,099
This is therapeutic.

848
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:44,982
- Should we go?
- Are you finished with your drink?

849
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:47,234
Yes. Thank you for everything.

850
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,986
- That was delicious.
- Thank you.

851
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:51,947
Now that we're full,
let's do some traveling.

852
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:53,865
Wow, that was great.

853
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:56,493
It's like we crashed back into reality.

854
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,453
- Yeah.
- Yes, this is Korea.

855
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:01,581
- Korea?
- It's like we were in Malta just now.

856
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,333
Korea.

857
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:10,298
To the next destination

858
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,138
You good?

859
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:17,556
V.

860
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,141
Can you hear me?

861
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:21,226
Yes, I can.

862
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:22,644
I can hear you.

863
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,563
Mr. Jung Kook!

864
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,189
Yes!

865
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,608
Do you see the ocean on our left?

866
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,652
Yes, I do!

867
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,612
What do you think?

868
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,823
It's marvelous!

869
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:36,908
That's great!

870
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,827
Yes, it's great.

871
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:41,079
Mr. Jung Kook!

872
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,539
Mr. Jimin!

873
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:46,668
Yo, yo. What's up, what's up? Hey, hey!

874
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:48,920
Mr. V!

875
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:50,881
Yes, yes, yes.

876
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:52,924
Did you see the police station
on our right?

877
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,509
Yes, I did.

878
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:57,054
Drive safely, okay? Drive safely.

879
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:58,680
Okay.

880
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:01,099
There's a speed bump.

881
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:03,977
- Speed bump!
- Okay.

882
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,854
And another one.

883
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:11,568
Look at the clouds
in front of you. They're pretty.

884
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:14,863
You're prettier, Jimin.

885
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:18,617
I didn't enjoy that comment.

886
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,124
Oh yeah!

887
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:33,298
We're here.

888
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,759
Wow, it's huge.

889
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:36,968
"Yacht"

890
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,386
Jin would've loved this.

891
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,849
This is Am I Sure?!, Are We Sure?!,

892
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,601
Are They Sure… Are You Sure?!

893
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:46,812
Don't you think we need another trip?

894
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:49,397
We should do "We Are Sure."

895
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:51,441
- What?
- "We Are Sure!"

896
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,401
- "We Are Sure"?
- "We Are Sure!"

897
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,280
Let's go.

898
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,533
Look how sunburned I am.

899
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,202
I can't even see because of your tattoos.

900
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,870
- You can.
- Where?

901
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,622
See here. Did I get sunburned or not?

902
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:08,625
I can't get any more sunburned.

903
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:19,302
Mr. Jimin.

904
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,263
You got too scared just now.

905
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:23,223
- What?
- You got too scared just now.

906
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,142
But he's a lot stronger than I am.

907
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,434
Where's your pride?

908
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:28,061
I don't have any.

909
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:33,316
Jung Kook may always overpower me,
but I'll never pretend to cower.

910
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,402
It's not pretend. You actually get scared.

911
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:37,154
I guess that's true.

912
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:41,241
I'm okay
with everywhere else but here.

913
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:42,492
You look…

914
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:45,245
You look…

915
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:49,916
like the ragged Jung Kook in New Zealand.

916
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,001
The ragged Hawaiian.

917
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:52,169
"Raggedy Jung Kook is back"

918
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:58,425
"Joining the raggedy club"

919
00:52:58,508 --> 00:52:59,801
- Hello.
- Hello.

920
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:12,814
I put some on him too.

921
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:14,316
What?

922
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:15,483
"The three raggedy brothers"

923
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:24,534
Let's do this for real.

924
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:25,952
"Let's put on sunscreen properly"

925
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:29,122
What are you doing?

926
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:35,003
Washing his face with it

927
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:42,052
- This is how you do it.
- Really?

928
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,386
How do I look, Mr. Jimin?

929
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:45,430
Who are you?

930
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,599
Are you Charlie Chaplin?

931
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:53,772
I wonder how this trip
and the America trip will turn out.

932
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,321
- Whoa.
- Awesome weather.

933
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,073
I love it.

934
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:06,451
The ocean.

935
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:09,871
It's insane.

936
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:13,041
The sea is practically calling us in.

937
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:15,210
- Right, it's calling.
- Let's get dressed for it.

938
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:17,462
- Right.
- I'll just watch you guys.

939
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:18,630
"Still reeling from his headbanging"

940
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:21,049
Should we go inside
and take a look?

941
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:22,968
Will we see anything?

942
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:25,387
It's hot.

943
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:40,694
I can't look back

944
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,279
Did you bang your head?

945
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:47,867
That hurts.

946
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,373
"A way-too-effective kiss of life"

947
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:55,000
Oh my, that hurts.

948
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:09,055
- I like it.
- It's nice.

949
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,267
What if we see a shark right away?

950
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:14,311
Then we'll fight it right away.

951
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:15,437
"Arrived at the snorkeling spot"

952
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,646
I think it's there.

953
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,398
We really have to dive in.

954
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:19,983
Yes, we should jump.

955
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:23,111
- That's good.
- Woohoo!

956
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:29,034
Don't hesitate and Go

957
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,422
It's colder than I thought.

958
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,090
- Mr. Jung Kook!
- Mr. Jimin!

959
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,842
Jung Kook.

960
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:06,780
Watch out for your head…

961
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:17,957
Acting as if nothing happened

962
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,801
I love this!

963
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:31,930
I haven't been in the ocean in a while.

964
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:34,766
Catch me some fish, Jung Kook.

965
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:37,268
- Catch some.
- But you ate a lot of fish yesterday.

966
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,437
That saw-edged perch was great.

967
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:41,481
Let's do some snorkeling.

968
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,525
Okay.

969
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:44,901
Catch me some fish.

970
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:50,907
Jimin gets in first

971
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:56,037
Casually adjusting the camera angle

972
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:02,210
As soon as he's in,
he's one with the water

973
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:08,425
As he slowly swims through the water

974
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:12,470
He encounters little sea friends

975
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,145
Jimin looks like he's having a blast.

976
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,274
- Having fun?
- I am!

977
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:25,900
Can you see well?

978
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:28,695
Look at the anchovies!

979
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:34,868
I'm a good swimmer.

980
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:36,619
Stretch your legs.

981
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:46,671
Breaking news! An underwater rabbit exists

982
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:01,352
Jaws incoming

983
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:04,689
This is fun.

984
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:14,616
Going deeper this time to see some fish

985
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:28,379
Anchovies glimmering under the sun

986
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:32,091
How many fish are there?

987
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:34,302
There's a lot.

988
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:36,930
There are a lot of small ones.

989
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:44,687
Jimin has acquired some fish feed

990
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:47,815
Underwater restaurant is open

991
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:50,026
Taste some of this

992
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:53,655
Customers start flooding in

993
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,991
They ate the feed

994
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:05,750
They ate it.

995
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:08,920
- What?
- The fish ate the feed.

996
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:13,591
Suddenly, a strange gigantic fish appears

997
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:17,971
"Please… Don't eat me…"

998
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:19,430
Jung Kook, hold on.

999
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:26,771
Oh, that's salty.

1000
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:33,611
They're like twins.

1001
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:38,866
This is how these twins play

1002
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:42,161
Jimin performs underwater ballet

1003
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:46,833
Jung Kook dances to Smoke

1004
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:50,587
Should we try
making air bubble donuts?

1005
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:55,883
Jung Kook is successful

1006
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:59,470
Jimin's turn

1007
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:02,890
He fails

1008
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:06,477
Jung Kook:
Do you want to catch some fish?

1009
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:08,855
Jimin: Yes

1010
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:13,484
Looking for fish

1011
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:15,903
Catching fish

1012
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:19,240
Fails

1013
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:22,910
- What?
- They're eating it!

1014
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:24,746
They're eating!

1015
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:29,042
Filling the water with feed

1016
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:34,422
The feed tastes nice!

1017
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:40,386
Happy memories for JimKook

1018
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:42,513
That was fun.

1019
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:43,848
That was really fun.

1020
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:46,351
Thank you for the ramyeon!

1021
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:47,685
Nice!

1022
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:51,064
Eating ramyeon after swimming

1023
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:52,565
- must be fantastic.
- That's right,

1024
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:54,400
I remember

1025
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:58,321
eating these in front
of the stationary store when I was a kid.

1026
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:16,547
Even Michelin-star restaurants
can't beat post-swim ramyeon

1027
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:19,842
This is great.

1028
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:21,928
We did go far.

1029
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:23,971
Hey, they're fishing over there.

1030
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:26,724
- Should we go fishing?
- Yeah.

1031
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,643
I love that idea.

1032
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:32,355
You look like a pirate.

1033
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:34,315
Right.

1034
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:39,195
Captain, we'd like to catch some big fish.

1035
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:43,950
Okay, here's the spot. I choose you.

1036
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:49,664
Watch out.

1037
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:53,918
Oh?

1038
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:04,220
The line snapped.

1039
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:07,056
"Someone who clearly messed something up"

1040
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,516
What should I do?

1041
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:13,688
This is harder than I thought.

1042
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:18,109
He's also just tossing it out

1043
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,653
How does fishing even work?

1044
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:23,531
I thought you knew.

1045
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:26,159
I'll show you.

1046
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:29,912
- Jung Kook.
- Yes?

1047
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:33,082
This is how you do it.

1048
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:35,376
You have to put your leg up like this.

1049
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,130
One of my bait is gone.

1050
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:43,885
- Is it your first time?
- Yes.

1051
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:46,637
"Help from the real captain"

1052
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:49,140
Thank you. Is this correct?

1053
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:51,434
Throw it out gently

1054
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:53,060
And then tug on it.

1055
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:55,021
- Oh, like that?
- Yes, tug.

1056
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:57,273
So there's no need to throw it out far?

1057
01:02:57,356 --> 01:02:59,066
No, just throw it right underneath you.

1058
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,151
I see.

1059
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:03,321
We've never done this in real life.

1060
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:04,614
If this goes down,

1061
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:06,199
- then pull up.
- Okay.

1062
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,283
Got it.

1063
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:17,752
Did I get something?

1064
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:21,088
It's bending.

1065
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:22,381
"Did I already get something?"

1066
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:23,966
Is it stuck on something?

1067
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:29,180
Of course, it's nothing.

1068
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:41,734
Oh?

1069
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:42,819
Did you get one?

1070
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:48,699
"Summoned the captain"

1071
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:50,827
- What is it?
- It's a big one.

1072
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,620
- Did I get a big one?
- Yes.

1073
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:55,331
- Really?
- Yeah.

1074
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:57,917
What kind of fish is it?

1075
01:03:58,417 --> 01:03:59,460
You caught Jeju Island itself.

1076
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:00,545
What?

1077
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:02,463
"Really…? I caught Jeju Island…?"

1078
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:03,548
Jeju Island?

1079
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:06,968
Thank you.

1080
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:08,553
It was a rock.

1081
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:10,012
Oh, you got me.

1082
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:11,931
That's what I meant by "Jeju Island."

1083
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:13,015
"Jeju Island = Rock"

1084
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:15,685
I thought I caught
the most popular fish on Jeju Island.

1085
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:19,021
He got me.

1086
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:23,901
Fish. Fish.

1087
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:25,820
Fish.

1088
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:31,367
What happened here?

1089
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:34,203
"The fish just took the bait and swam off"

1090
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:41,043
Are you getting any, Jung Kook?

1091
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:43,212
Oh?

1092
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:45,923
It took the bait and swam off.

1093
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,095
I don't think
we're going to catch anything.

1094
01:04:52,346 --> 01:04:56,601
Gave up on fishing
and is now just spacing out

1095
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:04,567
This is beautiful.

1096
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:08,613
I love it here.

1097
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:10,281
- What?
- I love it.

1098
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:12,909
- You love it?
- I love being on a boat.

1099
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:17,288
Are we really not catching any fish?

1100
01:05:17,371 --> 01:05:18,581
It's not up to us.

1101
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:20,833
- That's sad.
- Huh?

1102
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:26,589
It's all right.

1103
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,425
We were going to let it go anyway.

1104
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:32,094
Right.

1105
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:34,889
I'm not getting any.

1106
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:36,432
Should we go?

1107
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:43,064
What?

1108
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:49,362
What was that just now…?

1109
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:54,659
The drone dove into the sea

1110
01:05:57,745 --> 01:05:59,288
Was it supposed to do that?

1111
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:01,123
It just fell down out of the blue.

1112
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:02,917
It just fell down

1113
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,001
over there.

1114
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:07,338
It wasn't waterproofed, was it?

1115
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:10,800
- "RIP drone, you were great…
- The crew"

1116
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:14,512
That's unbelievable.

1117
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:18,307
Okay.

1118
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:20,685
"Just then, a welcoming sound"

1119
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:22,895
Did you get one?

1120
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:24,939
I think so.

1121
01:06:25,564 --> 01:06:27,149
V got one.

1122
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:31,904
- Okay!
- Wow, V caught one!

1123
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:34,031
- Let's see.
- He caught two!

1124
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:36,701
What are they?

1125
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:39,829
A cardinal fish after catching Jeju Island

1126
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:41,080
How did you do it?

1127
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:43,791
I totally caught two.

1128
01:06:43,874 --> 01:06:44,959
Whoa!

1129
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:48,587
The background's beautiful too.

1130
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:54,051
#Jeju_Island_fishing_successful
#Cardinal_fish

1131
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:55,928
Wow, nice.

1132
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:57,847
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1133
01:06:58,222 --> 01:06:59,223
Let me see.

1134
01:06:59,306 --> 01:07:01,142
- It was pretty heavy.
- How did you do it?

1135
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:02,518
How did you catch two?

1136
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:07,940
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1137
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:10,234
- One, two…
- Like I'm the one who caught them.

1138
01:07:10,317 --> 01:07:12,862
- Okay, here.
- One, two, three.

1139
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:19,201
Did you just go like this?

1140
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:21,871
Yes, like tapping and tapping.

1141
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:24,415
We got a great scene, though.

1142
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:26,834
The guest got us a great scene.

1143
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:34,633
It's beautiful.

1144
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:38,179
I love this!

1145
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:42,808
Isn't this what youth is all about?

1146
01:07:43,684 --> 01:07:44,685
This is romantic.

1147
01:07:47,104 --> 01:07:48,731
The sun's going down very fast.

1148
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:08,042
I love it here.

1149
01:08:13,297 --> 01:08:14,340
- Hey.
- Yeah?

1150
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:16,467
Doesn't that cloud
look like a whale's mouth?

1151
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:19,553
That part there
looks like a whale's mouth.

1152
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:22,723
- No.
- No? Look there.

1153
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:24,850
- It looks like a pig.
- No, just look.

1154
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:25,935
Look.

1155
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:28,979
It's a whale's mouth,
any way you look at it.

1156
01:08:29,063 --> 01:08:30,147
A shark. A shark.

1157
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:31,899
- Okay, I'll give you that.
- A shark.

1158
01:08:31,982 --> 01:08:33,734
- I'll give you that.
- Not a whale.

1159
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:38,239
It's a trophy.

1160
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:05,891
Come on, man.

1161
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:36,422
I love this.

1162
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:39,842
This is great.

1163
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:44,680
At this moment, it's "Yes, I'm Sure."

1164
01:09:44,763 --> 01:09:46,348
"Yes, we're sure!"

1165
01:09:49,393 --> 01:09:51,437
Sadly, the last night is here

1166
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,689
It's time to drain all our energy!

1167
01:09:57,902 --> 01:10:01,155
The youngest members
don't seem to get tired all night

1168
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:03,574
I'm the chef for today!

1169
01:10:05,492 --> 01:10:09,163
Jung Kook cooks something for the members

1170
01:10:09,246 --> 01:10:12,374
When this is done,
you're going to beg for soju.

1171
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:13,709
I don't think so.

1172
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:16,295
He gets soju right away

1173
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:17,713
Oh.

1174
01:10:17,796 --> 01:10:19,423
Do you want to be my girlfriend?

1175
01:10:19,506 --> 01:10:21,300
- This is incredible.
- This is great.

1176
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:23,385
What did Jung Kook make?

1177
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:25,095
Are You Sure?!

1178
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:27,181
