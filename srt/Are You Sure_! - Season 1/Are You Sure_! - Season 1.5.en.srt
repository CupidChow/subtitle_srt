1
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:18,810
Are You Sure?!

2
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:20,562
Jeju Island at nighttime

3
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:23,732
The first day comes to an end…

4
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:27,152
We can't end the first day like this

5
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:29,571
Two hosts craving their guest's attention

6
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,031
And the guest who wants to rest

7
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,158
Mr. Jung Kook!

8
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,701
V is recharged!

9
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:37,412
The second day begins with a buzz!

10
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,331
Come here, you.

11
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:41,541
Charging up before getting on the yacht

12
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,334
I'm stuffed again.

13
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,545
If you're full, move your body!

14
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,505
Enjoyed some snorkeling

15
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,467
- Okay!
- Wow, V caught one!

16
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,304
Finished off a perfect day
by watching the sunset on the yacht

17
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,682
At this moment, it's "Yes, I'm Sure."

18
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,350
"Yes, we're sure!"

19
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,935
"Will they continue being sure?"

20
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,022
That was amazing.

21
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:30,006
After driving through the dark night

22
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:36,179
They arrive to dinner

23
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,354
That was great, Jung Kook.

24
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,775
I thought I was full,
but I just looked at the sign

25
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,318
and got hungry.

26
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:52,529
"Barbecue Restaurant"

27
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,364
Hello. Hello.

28
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,491
Let me show you to your table.

29
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:57,575
- Great.
- Hello.

30
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,452
By the way,

31
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,329
you guys aren't hungry, right?

32
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:03,123
How about just
three five-layered pork belly?

33
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,583
What's the difference
between three-layered and five-layered?

34
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,127
The five-layered one has the rind.

35
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:08,753
The rind?

36
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,338
Then three portions of that, and…

37
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,632
What does this say?

38
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,636
Jimin's cute solo shot

39
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,097
Do you want doenjang stew or kimchi stew?

40
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,223
I want steamed eggs.

41
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,558
Let's have some steamed eggs.

42
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,478
- What? This one?
- Doenjang stew. Doenjang stew.

43
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,106
- And a soda, please.
- One soda.

44
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,774
All right, let's leave it at that.

45
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:30,859
I'll order now.

46
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,655
That was tough.

47
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,912
This grill looks a bit small
for five-layered pork belly.

48
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,248
Hello, we've heard
great things about this place.

49
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,332
You can grill it now.

50
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,460
- Okay, should I do it? Ahem.
- Please go ahead.

51
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,046
All right.

52
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,049
- It's very thick.
- Is it frozen?

53
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,301
No, just refrigerated.

54
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,804
Awesome, I'll grill the rind first.

55
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,311
You have to melt the fat like this.

56
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:11,482
Please melt, fat layers

57
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,571
That's it!

58
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,781
That's what I like to hear.

59
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:21,951
All right.

60
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:27,123
While the other two step out for a moment

61
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,100
Awesome.

62
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:54,400
♪ I love barbecue ♪

63
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,111
I can't make Jung Kook cook all alone.

64
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:01,282
I'm a master of barbecue, you know.

65
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,034
Do you feel confident about that?

66
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,162
Is this what you wanted?

67
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,581
"Jung Kook has a special way
of sprinkling salt"

68
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,339
"He's adorable"

69
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,758
It didn't really touch your arm though.

70
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:19,968
It's just for show.

71
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,724
I'm the designated photographer today.

72
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,769
Is the camera not ready yet?

73
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,945
"Looking for the best angle"

74
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,321
This is awesome.

75
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,622
That's hot.

76
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,341
Oh, wow.

77
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,261
See?

78
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,847
Is this for me?

79
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,349
- When did you give me this?
- I know, right?

80
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,143
Thanks for doing this for us.

81
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,020
Dip this

82
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,272
here

83
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,482
with some chili pepper.

84
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,694
Feed the chef first

85
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,404
What? No, I'm fine.

86
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,785
I should make this crispy.

87
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,788
"It's delicious"

88
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,755
This is insane.

89
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:44,010
Huh?

90
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,262
Should we drink some soju today?

91
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,724
I was actually
wondering the same thing too.

92
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,351
-What do you think, V?
-Huh?

93
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,394
-Do you want me to make you soju and beer?
-No, no.

94
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,979
I don't drink soju.

95
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,857
He doesn't want any.

96
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,026
I'm having some, though.

97
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,486
All right, let's have a little.

98
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,821
Do you want soju and beer or just soju?

99
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,198
Let me think.

100
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,325
- I'll choose.
- Let's go with soju and beer,

101
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,951
- somaek.
- Got it.

102
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,745
Wow, this is…

103
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,081
Isn't this a beauty?

104
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:14,749
They're all cooked now.

105
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:15,958
-Okay.
-Thank you.

106
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,960
- Thank you for this, Jung Kook.
- Mm.

107
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,047
Wow, how should I say this?

108
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,131
"They're diving in"

109
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,216
It's just so good.

110
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,429
Mm-hmm.

111
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:35,937
It's super delicious.

112
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,188
-What?
-I love it.

113
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,570
-It's so good.
-You don't like anchovy sauce?

114
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,823
- No.
- It's not for you?

115
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,664
- Jung Kook.
- Yeah?

116
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,667
It's really delicious.

117
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,252
The meat's amazing.

118
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:02,255
It's not just the meat
but the chef that's amazing.

119
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,468
I finally realized
how to grill pork properly.

120
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,513
You need to melt the fat slowly.

121
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,973
Why?

122
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,516
To make it tender.

123
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,892
Is there a scientific reason?

124
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,477
It's called meat tenderization.

125
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,645
Sorry?

126
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,689
-Meat tenderization.
-Okay.

127
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,732
- This is refrigerated meat.
- Right.

128
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:25,236
What would happen
if you heat it too quickly?

129
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,572
I don't really know.

130
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,282
The outside gets cooked

131
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,908
- while the inside stays cold.
- Oh, right.

132
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,119
But if you slowly heat the outside

133
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,998
and trap the juice inside, you know?

134
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:40,418
Get the juice to melt down inside

135
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,795
- and slowly coat the outside…
- I see. And then…

136
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,214
…then the meat gets insanely juicy.

137
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,259
You're sending the fat into the meat.

138
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,886
You're a great teacher.

139
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,430
That was great.

140
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,432
This is a piece of cake.

141
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,517
Mr. Jung Kook!

142
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,402
-Goodness.
-Wow.

143
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,196
My goodness.

144
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,531
This is the best

145
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:14,619
Does soju always make you go "Wow"?

146
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,287
- Of course.
- Why?

147
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,999
But the "Wow" for soju is different

148
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,292
from the "Wow" for beer.

149
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,211
How is the soju "Wow"?

150
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,712
It's different for somaek too.

151
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,048
-Is it like when you drink soda?
-Yes.

152
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,009
Having a beer after work
when you have a day off tomorrow…

153
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:33,346
-I don't know that feeling.
-And it's like, "Wow!"

154
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,932
Is it like drinking soda after work?

155
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,850
It's a lot different from soda.

156
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,227
Is that so?

157
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,522
I feel amazing right now.

158
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,572
The crew hasn't eaten yet

159
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,823
Jung Kook.

160
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,911
Let's give the crew a bite each too.

161
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,663
It'd be best if you do it.

162
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,582
This already has ssamjang sauce on it.

163
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,836
- It's a perilla leaf born to be fed.
- I see that.

164
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,630
It already knows its manners.

165
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:11,342
Perilla leaf doesn't go well with lettuce
most of the time.

166
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,511
I never thought it did.

167
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:14,887
-Oh, yeah?
-No.

168
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,639
But it makes the whole ssam bigger,

169
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,642
like I made an effort.

170
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,852
No, hang on.

171
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,856
You see the sliced pickled radish?
Put that on the lettuce.

172
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,900
- Oh, this on the lettuce?
- Yes.

173
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,151
And no perilla leaf?

174
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,320
Perilla leaf can be a risky choice.

175
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,072
Put that on the lettuce.

176
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,035
Then some ssamjang.

177
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,329
"Building the perfect ssam"

178
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,414
Now it's perfect.

179
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,752
Wait, they left.

180
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,589
What?

181
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:55,136
"The crew got up to go and eat"

182
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,470
Wait, they left.

183
00:09:58,973 --> 00:09:59,974
What?

184
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,058
They all left.

185
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,353
Our crew's all gone.

186
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,526
They left because
they didn't want to eat your ssam, Jimin.

187
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,451
I'll just make some for you guys, then.

188
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,588
Come on, Jung Kook.

189
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:32,882
Come here.

190
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,054
Delicious self-made ssam

191
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,014
Mh-hm.

192
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,771
A glass of soju, please

193
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,452
You taught him that, didn't you?

194
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,914
-Didn't you?
-I don't do that stuff when I drink.

195
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,292
Swirl +1 Combo

196
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,835
Hit bottle +2 Combo

197
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,629
Splash +3 Combo

198
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,095
That's fine.

199
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:32,066
"Look at this"

200
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,694
- When did you take this?
- Look at how I look.

201
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,824
I want to be good-looking too.

202
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,201
I want to experience what you two have.

203
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,161
But I'm not good-looking.

204
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,247
You're very handsome, man.

205
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,834
Tell that to Jin.
He's even physically well-built.

206
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:50,918
Jin's very handsome.

207
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,129
He looks the same
even in military service.

208
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:54,630
Right.

209
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:59,552
But you know when we take
our regular group photos?

210
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,636
Yeah?

211
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,974
I look at that and realize
we're all getting old.

212
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,268
Who do you think has aged the most?

213
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:10,354
If you look at the photos,
everyone aged the same.

214
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:21,699
10 years of growing up together

215
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,245
But our time is on pause for now

216
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,040
We have under two months left
until our service.

217
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:34,295
I've heard a lot of things
from our older members.

218
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,672
You know how Jung Kook and I
will be serving together?

219
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,924
According to Jin,
even best friends of 10 years

220
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,927
start to fight when they serve together.

221
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,637
I can see how that's true.

222
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,723
To be very honest,

223
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,601
-I'm not worried about us fighting.
-Me neither.

224
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,311
I think we'll help each other a lot.

225
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,687
- I agree.
- Yes.

226
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,440
Just having you next to me

227
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,567
with your shaved head…

228
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,360
"Morning bugle"

229
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,533
- I hope we sleep across from each other.
- Me too.

230
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,243
I'm not going to sleep next to you

231
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,204
because then you'd elbow me
in my face again.

232
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:13,542
I heard from the other members
that vacation time is precious,

233
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,003
so they try to get into special forces

234
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,590
by practicing their shooting
and exercising.

235
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,593
Let's tell all our stories here
when we finish our service.

236
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,054
It'll be, "We weren't sure."

237
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,098
That'll be our show's title,

238
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,517
"We Weren't Sure."

239
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,976
"We Weren't Sure is coming soon"

240
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,271
This Jeju trip is so fantastic,
I'm blown away right now.

241
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,816
I can't get over
that braised spicy chicken.

242
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,067
Did you like it a lot?

243
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,193
-That was great.
-Yes.

244
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,779
That was the best braised spicy chicken
I've ever had.

245
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,239
You know what he said yesterday?

246
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,490
What?

247
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:47,243
He actually
didn't want to eat a lot on this trip

248
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,203
because he wanted to lose weight.

249
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,997
So yesterday, he said
he didn't like braised spicy chicken.

250
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,210
But then he ate most of it.

251
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,505
I was actually trying to brainwash myself.

252
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:03,008
"Remember, you don't like
braised spicy chicken."

253
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,845
But it was so delicious
that it didn't work.

254
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,137
It's exactly what you said.

255
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,515
It was the best braised spicy chicken
I've ever had.

256
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,726
I wasn't sure I could eat all this
when we had ramyeon earlier.

257
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,770
- Right.
- I was very wrong.

258
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,689
You have a separate stomach for barbecue.

259
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,440
I think that's it.

260
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,902
We're having
such great food here in Jeju.

261
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,154
I'm so happy.

262
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,490
I'm stuffed.

263
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,783
That was a great meal.

264
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,995
- There's a cat there.
- What?

265
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,121
A kitty.

266
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,302
I'll let you pat my butt

267
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,220
Even here?

268
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,724
I'll let you do more

269
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,733
That feels nice

270
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,402
All right, all right, let's go.

271
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,405
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

272
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,242
"A race in the middle of the night"

273
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:11,785
Run! All right!

274
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,787
You have to run more.

275
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,459
"In that case, let's have another run"

276
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,795
I'm tired.

277
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,213
Sit.

278
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:24,965
Sit. Sit.

279
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,217
Lie down.

280
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,097
Lie down.

281
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,351
You have to earn your treat.

282
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,602
Very good.

283
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,358
Sit.

284
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,402
Good job.

285
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,406
It's delicious, right?

286
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,241
You like that.

287
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,910
Sit. Sit.

288
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,244
Bang!

289
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:55,955
Grab

290
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,962
Touch

291
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,421
Stop that.

292
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,267
You like being petted, don't you?

293
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,746
See you later, puppy.

294
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:44,628
"So long, humans"

295
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,630
Okay, let's play some ballads.

296
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,341
I trust your selection.

297
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,426
Okay.

298
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,610
Why am I so red today?

299
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,738
-You?
-I only had one bottle.

300
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,573
One bottle is still a lot.

301
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,491
My face is so red.

302
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,827
It's burning up.

303
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,123
It's not cooling down.

304
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,792
Can I turn the AC up?

305
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,960
Of course you can.

306
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,303
Thank you.

307
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,773
Didn't this come out
when we were in elementary school?

308
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:46,857
It did.

309
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:30,692
I don't know the lyrics.

310
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,256
-Thank you, V.
-We're here.

311
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,340
All right.

312
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:57,511
Arrived at the house

313
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:04,184
I really want to wash off the saltiness.

314
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,859
Home sweet home.

315
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,124
I want to dive into the pool again.

316
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,584
-Should we?
-Should we?

317
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,377
Can you go for another swim?

318
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,546
- Can you?
- I think I can.

319
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:33,755
V says he can.

320
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:34,923
In that case…

321
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,134
-Should we go in?
-Should we go, then?

322
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,970
Let's just go for a quick swim.

323
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,054
All right.

324
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,640
We're going for a swim!

325
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,229
It's cold when you step out.

326
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,289
Why isn't this working?

327
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,335
Hang on, mine isn't working.

328
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,562
No, wait!

329
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:32,773
Hold on.

330
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:38,403
Jung Kook joins in

331
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,574
That stings.

332
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,117
-It's quite strong.
-That stings.

333
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,235
That's so scary.

334
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,242
That's a wrap.

335
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,953
- I'm off to bed.
- Let's all go.

336
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,623
Underwater-sleeping Beauty Jung Kook

337
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,422
I wish I could film you down there
with my phone.

338
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:39,589
With your phone?

339
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,011
I'll film you sleeping down there.

340
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,846
"Camera acquired"

341
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,567
Now this is a water bed

342
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,196
That was such a short nap.

343
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,489
It's too hard.

344
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,991
I slept so well.

345
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,786
You only slept for about 20 seconds.

346
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,208
I'll try lying down face up.

347
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,002
Your nose will hurt if you face up.

348
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,056
I'll show you how it's done.

349
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,183
-Do it.
-See how I do it.

350
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,143
I'm sleepy.

351
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,854
Goodness.

352
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,121
Doesn't your nose hurt?

353
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,456
Doesn't your nose hurt?

354
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,832
I just go with the pain.

355
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,503
How do you do that?

356
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:06,885
Underwater pushups

357
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,936
You keep springing up with your hands.

358
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,313
- Should I try without my hands?
- Yes.

359
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,232
How do you even do that?

360
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,692
How do you do it without hands?

361
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:37,207
Thankfully saved by Jung Kook

362
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,723
- Sorry.
- I thought we were going easy.

363
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,686
- That was a slap.
- No, come on.

364
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:01,231
Finger flick match this time

365
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:11,992
I heard something pop.

366
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,162
It hurts.

367
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:16,746
Let's do it again.

368
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,091
Let's go again.

369
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,386
-Go again.
-This is hilarious.

370
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,264
It hurts.

371
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,694
- Are you heading inside?
- Yes.

372
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,613
Should we head in?

373
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:58,246
V & Jung Kook come in first

374
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,623
I locked the door.

375
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,754
What is this bad feeling?

376
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,967
Always keep the doors locked

377
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,132
You took way too long.

378
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,551
Come here.

379
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,388
-You took too long.
-It's too cold here. Too cold.

380
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,224
It's too cold!

381
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,354
You ready?

382
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,619
Let's stop this. I'm not a kid anymore.

383
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,746
I turn 30 next year.

384
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:29,462
Stay.

385
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,594
That was fun.

386
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:39,764
V is already asleep

387
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,224
I'll sleep down there tonight.

388
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,642
No, I'll sleep down there.

389
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:43,768
You can sleep on the bed.

390
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:44,978
No.

391
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,397
I don't like overly soft beds.

392
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:51,026
- Aren't they the same mattresses?
- They're not.

393
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,278
This is made of springs, and these aren't.

394
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:49,918
I'm hungry.

395
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,519
Jung Kook.

396
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:11,147
We're going to eat stir-fried black pork.

397
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,664
Stir-fried pork sounds great.

398
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,265
Jung Kook.

399
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,017
- Morning.
- Get up.

400
00:28:53,231 --> 00:29:00,238
This is an alarm for Jung Kook to wake up

401
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:07,662
Snaps into reality

402
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:14,836
Where's V?

403
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,881
V's spot is empty

404
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:22,552
7 a.m. that morning

405
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,018
- You're up?
- What?

406
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,729
- Are you going out?
- I'll be back.

407
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:38,860
V is off for a morning workout

408
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,322
Let's go.

409
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,073
"They planned to meet at the restaurant"

410
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:45,950
Come on!

411
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,704
- What did you say?
- Let's go!

412
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,505
Oh, man.

413
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,681
What should I do now…

414
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,371
Photosynthesis…

415
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:33,748
done.

416
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:39,254
Meanwhile, Jimin is styling his hair

417
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:53,852
Wait.

418
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,186
What?

419
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,195
Is that not how you do it?

420
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,072
Just forget it.

421
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:08,783
What is this?

422
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:10,994
We have to go.

423
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,078
Not yet.

424
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,454
What do you mean?

425
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,291
A must before going out

426
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,505
Come and spray some perfume.

427
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:23,590
It smells nice.

428
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:24,674
- This one?
- Yes.

429
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:26,593
I don't wear perfume,

430
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,595
but I'll try it for the first time.

431
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:33,308
That's not how you do it.

432
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:36,060
- How do you do it cool?
- Like this.

433
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,114
This smells great.

434
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:49,866
Let's go.

435
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:50,950
Let's go.

436
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:52,785
I'll get in the car.

437
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:53,870
Okay.

438
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:08,134
Off to the restaurant!

439
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,443
Hi

440
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,428
Cider?

441
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,932
V arrives just in time from his workout!

442
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,686
- Aren't you tired?
- What?

443
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:00,770
Aren't you tired?

444
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,480
You haven't slept much.

445
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:03,648
I'm okay.

446
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,441
-How was your workout?
-Good.

447
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:09,946
I think it's here.

448
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:11,823
- Here?
- Yes.

449
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,742
- Hello.
- Welcome.

450
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:15,827
- Table for three?
- Hello.

451
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,246
- Yes.
- Let me show you your seats.

452
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,039
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you.

453
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,667
All right.

454
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:24,419
So we…

455
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,838
We only serve one menu,

456
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,798
so we'll bring you
a meal for three shortly.

457
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:30,633
- Okay.
- It'll only be a moment.

458
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,844
It says anything delicious
is zero calories.

459
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:34,887
I'm exhausted.

460
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,264
Look at that.

461
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,807
Delicious food makes me fat, though.

462
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,142
If something's delicious,

463
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:41,227
it's usually over 1,000 calories.

464
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,774
I need to check how I look in the mirror.

465
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:48,609
Is there a mirror?

466
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,069
Over here.

467
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,239
Jung Kook clearly just got off his bed.

468
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:56,784
Like you were sleeping, and Jimin
woke you up to rush you over here.

469
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,910
"I know everything"

470
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,037
Isn't that right?

471
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,246
-Yes.
-You're exactly right.

472
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,748
I'm exhausted right now.

473
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:02,874
What time did you sleep?

474
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,751
- At 4 a.m.
- He slept at 4 a.m. too.

475
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:09,422
I slept while Jimin was
scrolling through his phone.

476
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:12,300
I actually dropped it.

477
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,843
- While you were scrolling?
- Yeah.

478
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:14,927
I was scrolling…

479
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,389
then I knew I had to sleep.

480
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:22,060
My face looks pretty bad on camera.

481
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,227
Mine too.

482
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,022
Do you want my glasses?

483
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,900
- I want your hat.
- Okay, then.

484
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:31,027
We're taking everything.

485
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,654
I look even worse with these glasses.

486
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,364
With this hat, I look…

487
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,284
Is this right?

488
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:40,953
Are these prescriptions?

489
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,080
They are.

490
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:46,834
I want to try them.

491
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,211
They're similar to mine.

492
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:51,589
Actually, my eyesight is worse than yours.

493
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,347
They're not that far off.

494
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,681
"I love this"

495
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:01,766
from my prescriptions.

496
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:04,894
Excuse me, here are the side dishes.

497
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:09,232
- The pork.
- Just a moment.

498
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,525
This is cute.

499
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,110
Awesome, Mom!

500
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,528
You're calling your mom?

501
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,029
This feels like home.

502
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:19,575
The soup, rice, and all side
dishes including the pork can be refilled.

503
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:20,743
- Wow, really?
- Yes.

504
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,662
Let me know if you need more.

505
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:23,746
- Okay.
- Yes, thank you.

506
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,040
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

507
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,125
Enjoy, everyone.

508
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,335
I'm going in.

509
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,672
Wow. It's good.

510
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,050
Let me try the pork.

511
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,306
Mm!

512
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,350
Do you like it?

513
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:45,685
Yeah.

514
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,234
Everything's great.

515
00:35:58,906 --> 00:35:59,907
"Trying the braised radish"

516
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:00,992
Wow, this is…

517
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,326
This brings me back.

518
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,413
-This is so familiar.
-Right.

519
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,540
Is this taste from Gyeongsang-do?

520
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:10,501
Yes, like the dish
that comes with braised mackerel.

521
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,004
Yes, like the dish
that comes with braised mackerel.

522
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,299
- You're right.
- Yes.

523
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,094
I used to hate these kinds of dishes.

524
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,722
- It's delicious now.
- This one's great.

525
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,850
Let's dig in properly

526
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,065
This is a perfect breakfast.

527
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:43,868
The pumpkin too.

528
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,912
I'm eating this!

529
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,455
Isn't that a Cheongyang pepper?

530
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,293
That's going to be spicy.

531
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,170
"This is nothing to me"

532
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:55,254
Isn't it spicy?

533
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,385
- What is it?
- What is it?

534
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:03,054
It's spicy at the end.

535
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:12,813
Please save Jimin…

536
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,318
What's this?

537
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,529
-It's ham.
-No, it's pink sausage.

538
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:21,822
"A sudden argument"

539
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:22,949
Pink sausage.

540
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,159
Taste it. It's ham.

541
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,327
How is this ham?

542
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,079
-It's pink sausage.
-Try this.

543
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:30,122
Is it ham or pink sausage?

544
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,376
It's obviously pink sausage.

545
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:34,460
It's ham.

546
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,254
- This is ham?
- Yes.

547
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,464
-How is this ham?
-Try it again.

548
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,425
And look at its color.

549
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,222
You dummies.

550
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,767
This is pink sausage.

551
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,060
-What?
-What?

552
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,397
It's definitely ham.

553
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,606
It's not ham.

554
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,483
Excuse me!

555
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:01,320
- Excuse me!
- Is this ham or pink sausage?

556
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,030
It's pink sausage.

557
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,826
Hey, that reaction was a bit much.

558
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:08,077
I mean,

559
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,913
I knew it was pink sausage.
I was just joking.

560
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,416
Exactly, I was just joking around.

561
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:14,583
Why would you go…

562
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,668
"Heartbroken"

563
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:16,961
I'm done eating.

564
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,964
I'm too heartbroken to eat.

565
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,590
I'm too heartbroken to eat.

566
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:22,675
Stop eating, Jimin.

567
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:23,759
"I'm leaving because I'm hurt"

568
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,303
Show your resistance.

569
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:28,472
-More sausages!
-Could we have some more pink sausages?

570
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:30,933
Okay, let's stop.

571
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,185
You got me worried about your taste buds.

572
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,151
Why aren't you leaving?

573
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:42,987
I wanted to get an apology.

574
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,365
- Apologize for that reaction.
- How?

575
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,450
Okay.

576
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:50,161
Apologize for saying it was ham.

577
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:51,746
Never.

578
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,748
Wait, hang on.

579
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,292
Hang on. Time-out.

580
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,877
Wasn't it really like ham?

581
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:00,755
Did you really think it was ham?

582
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:01,881
I did.

583
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,424
- Not at all.
- Really?

584
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:04,508
No.

585
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,552
I really thought it was ham.

586
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:09,263
I was just supporting you

587
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,640
and almost got punched by this fist.

588
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,394
-You should apologize.
-You apologize to me.

589
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,229
Shouldn't you apologize?

590
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,233
I'm sorry.

591
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,611
But I almost got punched.

592
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,112
I had to apologize to Jung Kook

593
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,447
for being stubborn.

594
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,532
Nice to see you.

595
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,370
I'm full.

596
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,497
I need some more.

597
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:38,542
Should we ask for more rice?

598
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:39,627
Yes.

599
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,338
- Do you need more pork?
- Yes.

600
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:43,881
Can we have more lettuce

601
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,549
and these?

602
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:46,801
Could you give me a moment?

603
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,427
Please take your time.

604
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,721
Do you want some abalone, Jimin?

605
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,056
No, I'm about to explode.

606
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,601
I'm in trouble.

607
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,019
I'm still not full.

608
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,104
That's all right.

609
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:01,065
As long as you're happy. Are you?

610
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,691
- Yes, I'm happy.
- All good, then.

611
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,360
Delicious food makes me happy

612
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:05,820
- Thanks for waiting.
- That was so quick.

613
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,863
Here you are.

614
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:11,784
We're frying the sausages now,
so it'll be here in a moment.

615
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:12,868
- Okay.
- Thank you.

616
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,913
Now that we have more pork…

617
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,581
Oh, hello.

618
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,834
It feels like we just came in.

619
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,336
This is a lot.

620
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,214
I didn't know
they give the same amount in refills.

621
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:28,884
- Are you full, V?
- Yes.

622
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,851
Eating

623
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,437
Eating

624
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,148
And eating some more

625
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:45,484
Are you full?

626
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,695
I'm not sure.

627
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,328
Jung Kook drinking soda means…

628
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,916
round three has just begun.

629
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,714
Our Jung Kook's a big eater.

630
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,757
It's not me who's a big eater.

631
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,926
- Am I a small eater?
- Yes.

632
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,387
But we both cleared one portion each.

633
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,222
I've eaten the average amount.

634
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,307
Yes.

635
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,017
"That's not enough"

636
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:20,394
Oh, my.

637
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,023
"Fascinated"

638
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,649
I'm still not full yet.

639
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,067
Oh, really?

640
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,402
"Jung Kook begins round 3!"

641
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,752
Finally, I'm full.

642
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,922
That was an amazing meal.

643
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,968
Finishing off with the soda

644
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,512
made me full.

645
00:41:55,846 --> 00:42:00,809
Burning glare

646
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:01,894
I apologize.

647
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:03,812
I'm sorry, okay?

648
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,903
You want our fans to apologize too?

649
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,029
Apologize to me.

650
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,740
I'm getting fat because of you guys,
so you should apologize.

651
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,826
Apologize now!

652
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,498
Let's go.

653
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:25,334
- Thank you for the meal.
- Thank you.

654
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:26,418
Thank you so much.

655
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:34,843
Back to the house after a grand meal

656
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:54,363
Wow, that looks gorgeous.

657
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:58,158
Look over there

658
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,452
Wow, the sea looks beautiful.

659
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,830
It really is beautiful.

660
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,963
We drove here before.

661
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:13,882
Stop speaking nonsense.

662
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,009
Excuse me?

663
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,260
"Nonsense."

664
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,681
What was that?

665
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:24,018
Comfort? No.

666
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,394
Stanford.

667
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:09,563
Arrived at the house while V was asleep

668
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,568
V.

669
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:17,613
We're here.

670
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:21,325
Half asleep

671
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:39,176
Back to his dreams again

672
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:49,019
I ran into two bikers on the way.

673
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,396
- What?
- I ran into two bikers

674
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:53,023
-on the way.
-I saw you waving at them.

675
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,191
- Really?
- Yes.

676
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,194
It's like what bus drivers do.

677
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:58,278
What?

678
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,155
Like when bus drivers wave at each other.

679
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,116
But one of them didn't wave back at you.

680
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:03,534
They just drove by.

681
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:06,537
No, they just
had a different way of saying hello.

682
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,914
Oh, right. I have to do this right now.

683
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:18,424
What are they trying to do now?

684
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:20,050
Hello.

685
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,343
"A few days ago
at a restaurant in New York"

686
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,137
They have to come in here.

687
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:28,434
Time for sukiyaki!

688
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:43,991
This is good sukiyaki.

689
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,284
Yeah, it's delicious.

690
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:46,410
It's so good.

691
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:52,166
This is something
you can easily make at home.

692
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:55,127
Exactly, it's easy to make
any kind of stew like this.

693
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:57,755
We have to eat

694
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:00,007
beef shank stew.

695
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:04,136
Do you want to make that in Jeju?

696
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:06,680
I can do that.

697
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,265
- Really?
- Yes.

698
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:11,685
Whole black pepper, garlic,
green onion, and onion.

699
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,438
You know the recipe by heart?

700
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,857
Of course. Recipes are easy to memorize.

701
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,943
Jimin would love it.

702
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:25,407
And so he's making the beef shank stew

703
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:26,867
Drain the blood from the sirloin.

704
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:29,369
- The blood's all gone.
- Yes.

705
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,079
Do you have to do that in advance?

706
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,123
It needs to be in the water for an hour.

707
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,000
You can make suyuk with beef too?

708
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,544
I've never tried boiled beef like this.

709
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,380
Beef suyuk is just like that stew…

710
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:43,258
That North Korean dish.

711
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,260
North Korean?

712
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:47,513
I've never had North Korean food.

713
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:50,307
Where did you try some?

714
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,475
I just…

715
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:55,813
Cooking is all about your intuition,
you know?

716
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,773
Let's do this the Korean way.

717
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,317
Just put everything in.

718
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,694
Put this in.

719
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,571
And this.

720
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:08,992
And this.

721
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:16,291
Let's go.

722
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:24,758
Wow! It's a stew!

723
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:29,221
When this is done,
you're going to beg for soju.

724
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:30,931
I'm going to beg for soju?

725
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,433
I don't think so.

726
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:37,729
You don't think so?

727
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:40,232
"Then I'll show you how it looks"

728
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,277
It's boiling nicely.

729
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:56,206
Finished.

730
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:00,836
This isn't really for me.

731
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,964
I'm making this for our crew.

732
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:08,594
The sauce.

733
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,971
I have to finish it by four.

734
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,681
"It's time to make the sauce"

735
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,447
Something's not right…

736
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,991
What was the sauce again?

737
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:35,203
Right.

738
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,164
Ah.

739
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:38,957
Uh-huh.

740
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:46,214
Checking to see how the beef is doing

741
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:48,884
Now to upgrade the sauce

742
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,694
This goes into the fridge.

743
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:11,657
All right, then.

744
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:18,997
In the corner of the quiet living room…

745
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:30,133
V is also fast asleep

746
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:35,222
Two worlds under the same roof

747
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:41,019
We also had this.

748
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:42,896
I didn't know.

749
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,450
I could've done this later.

750
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:09,673
I don't know why they do this
to the mushrooms.

751
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:12,426
But it does look pretty.

752
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,433
Jimin's sound asleep.

753
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,605
How is this going? Great.

754
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:28,525
Please cook well.

755
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:32,696
Just look at this.

756
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,116
This suyuk looks amazing.

757
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:38,910
Are you finished already?

758
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:39,995
No.

759
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,622
I have to take a shower now

760
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:44,583
and let this simmer.

761
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,878
I'm going to shower. I'll be very quick.

762
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:58,847
Should I shower again?

763
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:19,409
V also got up for a shower

764
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:33,965
Jung Kook is back to cooking

765
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,951
Come over and eat

766
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:06,832
Let me try some, JK.

767
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,416
Thanks for making this.

768
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:12,462
- Should I dip this in the sauce?
- Yes, here.

769
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,056
-This is insane.
-What's this called?

770
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,851
It's just beef stew.

771
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,154
It's so good.

772
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:50,083
Come and eat!

773
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:52,085
You have to eat it now!

774
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:54,129
What Jung Kook said!

775
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:57,007
Hurry or you'll get an earful from him.

776
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:59,593
He's scary when he's angry.

777
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,351
Dishes.

778
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:13,440
- This is seriously delicious.
- Thank you.

779
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:14,566
It's so good.

780
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:17,569
"The crew flocking in for delicious food"

781
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:19,070
Dip it in that sauce.

782
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:29,706
- Isn't it amazing?
- It is.

783
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:32,042
It's delicious.

784
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,210
- Right?
- Yes.

785
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:36,630
I love that you're a great cook.

786
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:40,759
There's no one else I know
who can make a stew like this.

787
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:46,223
It's been a while
since we've traveled lightly like this.

788
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:49,684
It felt like I was younger again.

789
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,228
You know,

790
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,063
I agree with what V said.

791
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:58,401
I don't usually…

792
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:02,072
I don't express my emotions like this
anywhere else.

793
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:05,200
I… usually don't react to things as much.

794
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,703
But because I was with our members,

795
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:10,622
and especially because V was here,

796
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:14,584
I became my younger self
and had a fun time.

797
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:15,877
You became too young.

798
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:18,838
I've gotten like seven years younger.

799
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:21,716
It's like you're a school kid again.

800
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,927
That's exactly how I feel.

801
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:28,098
I like all of our members,

802
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:30,976
but it was fun because I was
with the younger members.

803
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,061
It was fun.

804
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:34,688
Not that I don't like the older members.

805
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:37,357
I love you all.

806
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,192
Are you hearing this, RM?

807
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:40,860
He's on the phone.

808
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,237
It doesn't matter if he heard.

809
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:45,156
Anyway,

810
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:46,950
it was great.

811
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:49,119
It was better because V was here.

812
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,290
-It's an honor.
-Of course.

813
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:54,624
-It's an honor.
-Of course.

814
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:01,381
Hello.

815
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:04,217
Hello, we are…

816
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:07,887
V.

817
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:09,723
JM.

818
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:11,891
And KJ.

819
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:13,393
KJ?

820
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,438
Kook Jung?

821
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:17,522
That's us.

822
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,900
Thank you for watching our show.
