1
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,030
I was naive.

2
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,970
I was a little confused because I was a newbie.

3
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,250
That's when my eyes opened.

4
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:41,310
What are you doing?

5
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,470
Oh, I'm wearing a seat belt.

6
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,790
So, we were working overtime together, and we ended up on that ladder.

7
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,570
And then...

8
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,990
Hey, what happened to the light bulb?

9
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:04,670
We have to fix it.

10
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,490
What about the broken light bulb?

11
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,230
We have to fix it.

12
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,750
What about installing a light bulb at the entrance?

13
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,870
We have to do that, too.

14
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,500
I asked you to install it cheaply, but you guys...

15
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,120
You guys don't know anything.

16
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,940
But you're a young leader.

17
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,160
You only wrote the draft, but you didn't do anything right.

18
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,640
Oh, I have a lot to do.

19
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,740
What about you?

20
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,580
Oh, I'm not this leader.

21
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,760
I'm not this leader.

22
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,400
I'm doing my best for the happiness and prosperity of this village.

23
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,640
But why doesn't it show at all?

24
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,220
That's also an ability.

25
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,440
I think it's a little comfortable these days to see the empty mouth.

26
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,340
How do you make a big deal out of the president's boring daily life?

27
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,320
I was really serious.

28
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,880
I'm sure he's going to step on Lee Yeon-soo.

29
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,640
He asked me to wait a little bit.

30
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,740
I did, but I was stupid to believe him.

31
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,020
Hey!

32
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,850
Did you hear that?

33
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,210
Huh?

34
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:44,550
It's very poor.

35
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,350
Brother, come on!

36
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,260
You don't look like you're pushing me to save me.

37
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,480
Where are you looking at?

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,680
Huh?
Are you crazy?

39
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,560
Where to install the pavilion.

40
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,820
Let's find it.

41
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,280
Where are you going?

42
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,280
Hey, where are you going?
Stay there!

43
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,100
One, two!

44
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,540
The president!

45
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:48,540
Downloaded From Katmovie18

46
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:07,200
Dear residents of Parkchon Village, I am Park Bong-sam, the head of the village.

47
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,860
As you all know today, There is a purification work in the village.

48
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,000
Please attend until 2 o'clock.

49
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,400
You can't say, I'm sorry, but you can't come out.

50
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:22,880
It's a fine.

51
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:28,470
Good morning.

52
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,190
Good morning to you, too.

53
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:32,810
At the same time?

54
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:34,410
Are you going to the president's house?

55
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:35,890
Is it a wish?

56
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:38,330
It's

57
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,180
a broadcast.

58
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,880
Good morning.

59
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,260
It's not a buck, it's a hook.

60
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,800
It's too much, Minji, Minji.

61
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,380
Oh, Minji's mistake.

62
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,400
My husband always makes fun of me.

63
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,480
The only thing that calls my name properly in this village is a hook.

64
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,460
Minji, Minji.

65
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,720
The name sticks to your mouth like gum.

66
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,200
Oh, gum?

67
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,160
Thank you.

68
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,820
Oh, not here, but here.

69
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,280
I give up.

70
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,200
Oh, my.

71
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,420
Oh, my.

72
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,700
Oh, our hook is strong.

73
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,340
Isn't this heavy?

74
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,360
It's not heavy.

75
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,960
It's good to be young.

76
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,200
Why?

77
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,060
Minji is still young, too.

78
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,300
Oh, me?

79
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,060
What are you going to do?

80
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,320
I wish my husband would follow your hook.

81
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,310
Give it to me, too.

82
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,250
Wait patiently.

83
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:33,170
What are you doing?

84
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:33,210
Minji?

85
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:35,550
Yes.

86
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,590
Minji is lying down.

87
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:42,110
Minji is changing clothes.

88
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,630
Wow, sisters are so nice.

89
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:56,250
I want to lie down next to her for 30 seconds.

90
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,970
Why 30 seconds?

91
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,150
I think that's enough.

92
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:09,690
Oh, you have a bright future.

93
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,070
I'm going to make it short and thick.

94
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,690
Give it to me.

95
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,850
I almost got hurt.

96
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,530
Give it to me.

97
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:21,410
You're greedy.

98
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,370
I have something else to see.

99
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,360
I can't see it.

100
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,040
Why can't I see it?

101
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,800
Do I have to take it out?

102
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,200
It's going to break.

103
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,580
Clothes are hard.

104
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,920
This and this part.

105
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:58,920
That's right.

106
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,960
She's standing.

107
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,270
She's been standing for a long time.

108
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,930
I'm going.

109
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,110
Who?

110
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,270
Jiyoung.

111
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,230
What are you doing in the morning?

112
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:44,950
Shut up!

113
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,050
Why is your voice so loud in the morning?

114
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,600
What are you doing?

115
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:11,750
What are you doing?

116
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,010
What did you order this for?

117
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,610
Is she a doctor or what?

118
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,410
How much is it?

119
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,010
You scared me.

120
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:28,800
Why?

121
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,120
I guess you're not going to the mart today.

122
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,380
You came all the way here.

123
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,440
I ran out of soy sauce.

124
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,660
You only buy a little here when you're sad.

125
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:45,940
Beer.

126
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,780
I was going to buy some beer.

127
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,700
Please pay for this, too.

128
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,580
18,000 won.

129
00:13:59,220 --> 00:13:59,860
Here you go.

130
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:06,790
I guess your sisters have a lot of heat in their bodies.

131
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,370
Pardon?

132
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:11,670
No.

133
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,810
Oh, yeah?

134
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:19,210
I was so hot that I thought I was just wearing underwear.

135
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,530
I just wore it comfortably.

136
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,050
You dress like a village girl.

137
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,770
Do you want me to buy you one if you don't have one?

138
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,690
No, that's...

139
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,170
Oh, who is this?

140
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,670
This is Seon-young, a village resident.

141
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,430
Hello, Mr. Chairman.

142
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:42,830
Nice to meet you.

143
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:44,850
How are you?

144
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,690
I bought everything I could buy.

145
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,490
Take this.

146
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:48,530
Oh, it must be heavy.

147
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,690
I'll carry it for you.

148
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,510
Why are you carrying this?

149
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,270
It's heavy.

150
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,190
Are you crazy?

151
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,030
Are you out of your mind?

152
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,370
And this.

153
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,710
Where did you buy this for?

154
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,710
Why are you ripping off other people's stuff?

155
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:09,930
Other people?

156
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:11,570
Are we other people?

157
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,770
Don't you know what unboxing is?

158
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:15,890
It's like ripping off a nuclear bomb.

159
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,270
You don't know anything.

160
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,830
I don't know how to rip your head off.

161
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:21,910
Don't do this to me.

162
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,710
I can't live like this.

163
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,440
Choose the one you like and head to your favorite place.

164
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,660
When the squat goes up to the top, the decoration will begin.

165
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,080
Oh, Seon-young.

166
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,100
What is this?

167
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,650
Do you have me in your heart?

168
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:43,110
This is why

169
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,400
he's mean.

170
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,280
Seon-young, let's eat.

171
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,020
Why can't he get up?

172
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,300
What did he hear?

173
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,660
He's still sleeping.

174
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,200
The couple is about to fall asleep.

175
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,920
But the woman is still trying not to leave the squat.

176
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,690
That's weird.

177
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,370
Seon-young, I made breakfast.

178
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:32,310
Eat it when you get up.

179
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,890
I'll go to Mr. Park's house today.

180
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,820
Isn't that Ji-hyuk?

181
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,700
Oh, my.

182
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,040
Ji-hyuk, you are so beautiful in the morning.

183
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,040
Where are you going in the morning?

184
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,100
I have to go to school in the morning.

185
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,020
So I have a lot of places to go.

186
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,840
I see.

187
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,400
If you need anything, call me.

188
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:37,620
Call me.

189
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,380
Ji-hyuk?

190
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,660
Are you going to work?

191
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,020
Yes.

192
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,820
Where are you going today?

193
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,160
Mr. Park's house.

194
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,860
I'm going to be late.

195
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,120
Okay.

196
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,540
See you soon.

197
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:03,920
Wait.

198
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,240
Mr. Park's house.

199
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,740
Mr. Park's house?

200
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:12,440
I'm serious.

201
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,940
It's going to be rainy season soon.

202
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,660
I couldn't come because I had to clean up all night.

203
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,380
Since when did you work so hard?

204
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,620
You're always working in a big place.

205
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,820
I work when I have to.

206
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,180
Oh...

207
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,340
You worked until your face turned red?

208
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:37,860
Ouch!
It hurts!

209
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,400
Oh, my God.

210
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:46,380
You've been saying sorry and apologizing.

211
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,220
You talk too much.

212
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,400
So stop talking nonsense.

213
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,600
Hurry up and tell me the truth.
Why didn't you tell me?

214
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,060
Why didn't you come home?

215
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,440
Why didn't you listen to me?

216
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,260
You should have told me the truth.

217
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,260
The truth?

218
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,160
You talk too much.

219
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:22,500
Are you done talking?

220
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,340
No, I'm not done.

221
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,940
I'm not done.

222
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,380
You bastard!

223
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,140
Minji!

224
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,360
Minji!

225
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,560
I'm going to hit you.

226
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,260
You're too slow.

227
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,580
You're too slow.

228
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,000
You're too slow.

229
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,000
No, no, no.

230
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,460
I'm going to hit you.

231
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,220
Minji, Minji.

232
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,180
Let go!

233
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,420
I'm going to hit you!

234
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,600
Where is she?

235
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,100
Ouch!

236
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,220
What's wrong with your hand?

237
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,400
This?

238
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,820
I got bitten.

239
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,580
By what?

240
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,420
By a dog.

241
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,880
You know, a crazy dog.

242
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,960
I got bitten by a dog.

243
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,860
That's my neighbor's dog.

244
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,480
It must have hurt a lot.

245
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,680
It hurt a lot.

246
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,460
But I like it.

247
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,080
What's wrong with your face?

248
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,980
That's my wife's work.

249
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,500
And this is a piece of...

250
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,380
What's wrong with you?

251
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,720
I slept in the sun.

252
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:30,300
How?

253
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,140
I was sleeping.

254
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:41,220
You didn't sleep at home?

255
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,320
No way.

256
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,560
Did you stay up all night?

257
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,160
No.

258
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,700
I was concentrating on something.

259
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,580
I didn't know time was passing.

260
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,620
Your face is red.

261
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,180
It must hurt a lot.

262
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,440
It hurts a lot.

263
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,380
But I like it.

264
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,240
You have a good personality.

265
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:23,640
How about a glass of makgeolli today?

266
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,290
Let's go.

267
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,410
You are the chairman of the youth association.

268
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,590
You know how to read people's minds.

269
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,650
It's cold.

270
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:46,890
Let's go inside.

271
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,570
Let's go.

272
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,230
Shall we go inside and have another drink?

273
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,100
So, what's next?

274
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,020
I once forced myself to drink a lot.

275
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:13,300
And you didn't touch me?

276
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,840
You are gay.

277
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,020
What?

278
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,480
No, I'm not.

279
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,640
But it turns out that my friend came to me later.

280
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,520
Why did she come?

281
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,120
She must be your boyfriend's girlfriend.

282
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,600
Your boyfriend is good-looking and has a good body, right?

283
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,680
Yes.

284
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,100
He touches you often, right?

285
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,100
No.

286
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,980
That's a surprise.

287
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,420
You are a fake gay.

288
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,100
What?

289
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,440
I'm a gay?
Yes, you are.

290
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,620
Then what else do you have?

291
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,220
You should have consulted me earlier.

292
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,840
Cheers!

293
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:05,990
It's bitter.

294
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:10,270
Have you ever thought about meeting a guy like me?

295
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:17,490
I thought about being the opposite of you.

296
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:19,670
I'm curious.

297
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,710
He must have fallen in love with me at first sight.

298
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,230
He confessed to me not long ago.

299
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,930
So did you sleep with him right away?

300
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,070
No, well...

301
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:34,930
He said he hadn't been married for a long time, but he doesn't like me.

302
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:44,340
But now that I think about it, he didn't want to leave the family.

303
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,300
He just thought of me as a sexy and enjoyable person.

304
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,620
I was blind.

305
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,320
He's a bastard.

306
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,820
That's right.

307
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,040
He's a son of a bitch.

308
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,680
He had a perverted taste.

309
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,560
If he wanted to do it, he told his teammates to go home.

310
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:02,440
What?
At the company?

311
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,520
How was it?

312
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,580
Well, it was okay.

313
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,600
No, actually, it was good.

314
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,840
And then?

315
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,320
It's obvious.

316
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,040
After that day, once, twice, three times.

317
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,420
I did it day and night.

318
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,800
But I was sick of just doing it.

319
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,200
One day, I started to put in various props.

320
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:26,880
Props?

321
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,920
I started with something light like stockings.

322
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,280
I wore a school uniform or a uniform and acted.

323
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,760
What is it?

324
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,640
Was your sister like that?

325
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,360
Hey, if you have any questions, ask me everything.

326
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,620
Because this sister is very crispy.

327
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,360
These days, kids listen to basic songs one by one.

328
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,640
Do you want me to recommend it?

329
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,360
No, it's okay.

330
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,100
I like natural things rather than artificial things.

331
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,780
Hey, it's because you haven't seen a machine that doesn't get tired.

332
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,300
Innocent girl.

333
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,340
Am I innocent?

334
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,300
Of course.

335
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,720
You're still a baby, my sister.

336
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:21,850
Why?

337
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,940
You're finally awake.

338
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,460
You must have been drinking a lot.

339
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,720
Let's not make a big deal out of it.

340
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,210
Sisters.

341
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:33,710
Listen to me carefully from now on.

342
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:41,470
If you help me stay here for a few days, nothing will come out.

343
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:49,530
I've been watching this house for a few days, so it's better not to deceive me or report it.

344
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:03,660
I don't know if the people in the neighborhood will think it's weird, so I don't have a child, but I live like usual.

345
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:16,060
You know what I mean, right?

346
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,680
I don't know.

347
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,100
I need an insurance, too.

348
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,620
Are you okay?

349
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,580
Answer me.

350
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:37,880
Yes.

351
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:48,740
My sister has to go to work as usual, so get dressed and get ready.

352
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,910
You can stay with me.

353
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,490
Okay?

354
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,530
Okay.

355
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:22,970
Let's have a meal.

356
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,470
I'm not feeling well because I had an overdose yesterday.

357
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:36,290
No, not yours, but mine.

358
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:45,470
I haven't had a proper meal for a few days, so

359
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,370
please.

360
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,970
Why aren't you coming?

361
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,580
Why are you standing like that?

362
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,440
Aren't you going to do it today?

363
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:54,880
Is it that day?

364
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,930
This wasn't it.

365
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,350
Yes, sir.

366
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:25,810
Where are you?

367
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:31,690
Sir, I can't speak well, so I'll call you later.

368
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,870
Why?

369
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:46,050
Is he crazy to close the conversation window before I close the phone?

370
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,650
I'm here to meet the legend of the pumpkin.

371
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:54,730
Isn't this Ji-young?

372
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,430
Nice to meet you.

373
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:00,970
Is he sick?

374
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,750
Why are his eyes open?

375
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,360
Is it possible?

376
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:47,000
Isn't it time to sober up?

377
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,260
Let's have breakfast.

378
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,760
No, I'm fine.

379
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:57,900
Don't do it.

380
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,140
I'm fine.

381
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,480
Don't do it.

382
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,440
I'm serious.

383
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,720
Don't do it.

384
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,530
I'm serious.

385
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:46,410
Okay?

386
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:50,370
Good?

387
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:46,450
Are you here?

388
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:48,530
I'm here.

389
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:52,570
It's so weird.

390
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:54,730
It's amazing.

391
00:40:56,150 --> 00:41:00,370
Is this possible?

392
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:02,050
Why did you suddenly hit the curtain?

393
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:05,890
Curtain?

394
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:08,250
What's wrong?

395
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,510
Didn't Hyun-young go out?

396
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:15,410
No, I didn't see her going out.

397
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:18,770
It will end in a few days.

398
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:22,350
How can a person change overnight?

399
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:25,090
Now?

400
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,350
It's not that easy.

401
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,350
Let's be patient.

402
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,070
Oh, it's frustrating.

403
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,180
Are you here?

404
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:09,120
You didn't have anything to do, did you?

405
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:11,020
Yes.

406
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,340
Did you

407
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,800
have anything to do?

408
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,660
Yes.

409
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,100
It was good.

410
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,800
No, it's not that.

411
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,760
Anyway.

412
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,680
You didn't have anything to do?

413
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,380
Oh, I liked it, too.

414
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,640
No, I didn't have anything to do, either.

415
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,240
Let's be careful.

416
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,000
So that the people in the neighborhood don't know.

417
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:47,860
What's that?

418
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,220
What?

419
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:54,100
It's a sponge I got from work today.

420
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:05,170
I'm going to wash up.

421
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:12,750
What's wrong?

422
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:15,930
Are you going to take that in?

423
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:23,300
What are you going to do?

424
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:30,990
I'm wearing my seat belt while I'm sleeping.

425
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:34,310
Even if it's uncomfortable, I hope you understand.

426
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:38,710
Yes.

427
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,160
Good night.

428
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:21,970
Go in.

429
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:46,550
What are you doing?

430
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:51,410
Why?

431
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:16,850
Don't do this.

432
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:21,880
Get in.

433
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:40,900
Don't do this.

434
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,200
Get in.

435
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:07,940
Do

436
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:16,400
you think I'm kidding?

437
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,460
Don't do this.

438
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,820
Stay

439
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:38,500
still.

440
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:40,140
Don't do this.

441
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:48,370
It's my first time.

442
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:50,210
Brother?

443
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:56,090
Then I'll make you an unforgettable night.

444
00:46:58,210 --> 00:46:59,910
What are you talking about?

445
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:01,550
Don't do this.

446
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:06,950
Just leave your body to me.

447
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:07,670
Relax.

448
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:09,230
Don't you believe me?

449
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:27,580
Don't do this.

450
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:04,410
Aloidy.

451
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:06,470
It's cool.

452
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:09,050
It's sexy.

453
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:14,370
It's sexy.

454
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:18,670
Who else is here?

455
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:23,370
It's more delicious because Minji gave it to me.

456
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:26,310
Is everything okay?

457
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:28,470
Welcome.

458
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:30,210
Why are you here?

459
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:31,070
Are you a farmer?

460
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:33,190
You are just a farmer.

461
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:38,610
No, I'm not a farmer.

462
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:41,090
How much money do you have left?

463
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,570
You only did illegal treatment.

464
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:46,330
Go and work.

465
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:48,370
How is it?

466
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:51,130
Is it good?

467
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:52,990
Is it good?

468
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:56,570
Why are you talking to a hard-working person?

469
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:57,250
What are you talking about?

470
00:49:58,870 --> 00:49:59,870
I'm here for a while.

471
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:02,390
Then why did you come here?

472
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:04,550
You said you didn't like me.

473
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:07,930
That's an old story.

474
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:11,550
I've been through a lot.

475
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:15,270
Go.

476
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:21,090
Please cooperate.

477
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:24,910
I'm a wanted man.

478
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:28,350
Please put it on the wall outside the store.

479
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,340
You're handsome.

480
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,980
You don't have anything to do.

481
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:53,290
What's wrong with you?

482
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:55,510
Stay still.

483
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:40,160
I haven't seen you for a few days.

484
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,440
It's not fun to live.

485
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:54,270
Are you repairing it from day to day?

486
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:55,490
What's that?

487
00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:01,690
I think a baby came to this neighborhood.

488
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:03,210
A baby?

489
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:06,530
It's terrible.

490
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:08,650
Why did you come here?

491
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:09,090
What are you doing?

492
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:16,570
You have to cut it off so that you can't do that.

493
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:26,050
You're so easy to say.

494
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:31,310
By the way, how do I look today?

495
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:32,870
Newspaper?

496
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:36,770
How much are you going to scratch?

497
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:40,250
Oh, I have to buy two.

498
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:44,510
Don't do that.

499
00:56:45,830 --> 00:56:47,110
Look at me.

500
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:51,570
Minji, you look a little different today, right?

501
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:54,490
Yeah, you look different.

502
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:55,550
You're old.

503
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:58,930
I don't want to see you talking.

504
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:09,490
What's wrong?
It's hot.

505
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:10,410
Don't pour it.

506
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:13,030
Come in early today.

507
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:14,430
Why?

508
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:17,490
It's our 25th wedding anniversary.

509
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:23,750
That's why I prepared a special meal for the first time.

510
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:28,070
What do you keep preparing?

511
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:35,030
You look so pale and lethargic these days.

512
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:36,910
I'm fine right now.

513
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:46,170
I'll grill eel for dinner tonight, so don't be late and come in early.

514
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:55,090
And it's been a long time since we talked on the phone.

515
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:59,330
I don't think this is a family thing.

516
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:01,850
What kind of family is this?

517
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:03,830
Am I a family member?

518
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:06,590
My husband is fine, so I have to do what I have to do.

519
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:07,990
Did you call me earlier?

520
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:11,690
I made up my mind today.

521
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,980
Hello, Mr. Chairman.

522
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

523
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:27,440
Oh, well, is everything okay these days?

524
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:28,620
Of course, everything's fine.

525
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,080
You're always watching over me.

526
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,680
Did you know everything?

527
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,780
Of course.

528
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,980
My sister knows everything.

529
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:41,860
You too?

530
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:43,100
I'm really worried.

531
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:46,380
You have to do it moderately now.

532
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:51,080
Yeah, I should stop now.

533
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:52,720
Then goodbye.

534
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:14,000
Why are you so late?

535
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:16,700
Take a shit in advance.

536
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:20,360
Even if you take a shit and come quickly, there's nothing to see these days.

537
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:22,980
Damn shit.

538
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,100
I think we're shit.

539
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,360
What do you mean shit?

540
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:27,140
Why?

541
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,680
I think I'm caught by my sisters.

542
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,920
I met Ji-young on the way here.

543
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:36,780
I feel like I know everything.

544
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:37,220
I don't know what to do.

545
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:44,860
Then Ji-young doesn't do it outside these days.

546
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:45,880
She doesn't?

547
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:53,360
Are you saying you got caught stalking her?

548
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:55,960
Does Ji-young even stalk?

549
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:00,380
That's not important.

550
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:04,300
What do you mean?

551
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,660
Didn't I tell you to stop?

552
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:11,920
What is this?

553
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,960
Are you going to hang this?

554
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:19,620
Who brought this?

555
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,280
Who brought this?

556
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:25,380
Who filled this up?

557
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:28,020
I told you.

558
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,660
You can't make a hideout like this.

559
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:30,820
I'm going to be caught.

560
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:32,660
I'm going to steal this.

561
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:34,680
Who doesn't know?

562
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:37,520
Are you covering me up?

563
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:40,860
Who told you to put this on the list?

564
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:44,340
Who turned away from their wives?

565
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,740
I'm not trying to cover it up.

566
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,200
We have to do a meeting.

567
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,320
Why do you keep saying that?

568
01:00:58,440 --> 01:00:59,900
Not today.

569
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:01,500
My wife is coming home early.

570
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:03,320
Why?

571
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:05,340
It's her wedding anniversary.

572
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,280
I have to take care of my husband at least once a year.

573
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:14,300
I can't just sleep with him all the time.

574
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,180
What about you?

575
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:22,880
Don't you have any tissues?

576
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:34,490
I'm done.

577
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:37,390
Let's go together.

578
01:01:38,290 --> 01:01:39,430
Let's go, let's go.

579
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:40,890
No, not that.

580
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:43,350
I'm going to the bathroom.

581
01:01:54,160 --> 01:02:01,700
This is just my opinion, but I think you came to my house very well.

582
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:06,000
You talk too short.

583
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,380
If you're drunk, you should go to bed.

584
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:09,780
Why?

585
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,000
Can't I talk to you?

586
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:16,080
I think you forgot.

587
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:19,280
You guys are my hostage.

588
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:21,540
Why are you being so scary?

589
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:28,780
You're frowning again.

590
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:34,700
Honestly, can't I do this much?

591
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,280
I made you a delicious meal.

592
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,180
Not just a meal.

593
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:43,420
I made you a meal.

594
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:46,700
Not just a meal.

595
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:48,500
That's enough.

596
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:50,780
That's enough.

597
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:54,780
You're having a hard time.

598
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:56,920
Relax.

599
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:00,240
Relax.

600
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:03,160
Relax.

601
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:16,390
Huh?

602
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:18,790
The alcohol is empty.

603
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:30,420
Good night.

604
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:36,160
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, don't think I'm weird when I'm sleeping.

605
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:40,480
[SPEAKER_00]: My brother is still young.

606
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:43,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think about anything else.

607
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:46,040
[SPEAKER_00]: I warned you.

608
01:05:17,930 --> 01:05:20,730
Wake up.

609
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:49,440
Hello?

610
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:50,960
It's me.

611
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:52,580
Sangchul?

612
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:53,740
Yeah.

613
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:55,540
Everything's fine, right?

614
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:00,140
Here?

615
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:04,120
I'm so tired.

616
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:06,980
If you treat me a little better, I'll let you go.

617
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:09,200
I'm tired.

618
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:13,440
Anyway, see you tomorrow.

619
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:37,020
Okay.

620
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:39,080
Can you look at my back?

621
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:41,660
Back?

622
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:52,380
It's okay.
Turn it on.

623
01:08:00,830 --> 01:08:01,750
Are you okay?

624
01:08:02,010 --> 01:08:03,050
You're a normal girl.

625
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:04,990
Let me see.

626
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:07,470
Wait a minute.

627
01:08:10,530 --> 01:08:10,730
Oh.

628
01:08:23,590 --> 01:08:25,060
I think it's done.

629
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:30,080
It's delicious.

630
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:31,820
Are

631
01:08:41,730 --> 01:08:43,930
you up?

632
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,660
Sister, tissue.

633
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:58,870
You must have been very sick these days.

634
01:08:59,410 --> 01:09:00,730
You fell down alone earlier.

635
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:02,890
Me?

636
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:03,930
Yes.

637
01:09:04,790 --> 01:09:06,650
Then you fainted when you woke up.

638
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:09,870
No, I'm not.

639
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:11,190
How did this happen?

640
01:09:12,010 --> 01:09:14,750
If I hadn't asked you to change the light, this wouldn't have happened.

641
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:16,450
I'm sorry.

642
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:20,030
Oh, I did first aid.

643
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:24,430
Oh, look at that.

644
01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:27,450
Jiyoung, bring it.

645
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:42,620
It's good for you.

646
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:43,720
It's okay.

647
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:45,420
Drink it.

648
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,840
How much is this?

649
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,360
What if you spill it?

650
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:01,260
You have to eat it to get well soon.

651
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:06,680
Drink it all.

652
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,340
It's cold.

653
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:21,640
His eyes are like a beast looking at food.

654
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:42,780
What is it?

655
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:47,660
I was watching this.

656
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,320
You have a bad gut.

657
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:55,060
Your face has been rotten since the day.

658
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:57,960
You have a bad gut, too.

659
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,980
The whole village was shaking last night.

660
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:07,360
I thought there was an earthquake.

661
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:08,840
What are you talking about?

662
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:13,360
I haven't done anything in a long time.

663
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:16,320
Didn't you get hit by your wife?

664
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:18,920
No way.

665
01:11:22,330 --> 01:11:23,150
You got hit.

666
01:11:23,150 --> 01:11:24,730
You got hit by your wife.

667
01:11:25,170 --> 01:11:26,290
Hurry up.

668
01:11:31,730 --> 01:11:34,080
Why don't you want to work?

669
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:38,980
I can't work because of my wife.

670
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,200
Are we going to be okay?

671
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,040
That's why I can't sleep these days.

672
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,540
So what?

673
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,020
Your face is rotten.

674
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:53,320
My face is food.

675
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:58,080
Isn't that Ji-young?

676
01:11:58,500 --> 01:11:59,240
That's right.

677
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:00,360
Turn around.

678
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:02,560
Walk naturally.

679
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:06,520
Sir!

680
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:25,020
Did you go somewhere?

681
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,100
Yes.

682
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:28,640
Please buy this.

683
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:36,640
I thought you went on a trip because you couldn't see Tong these days.

684
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:41,980
I want to go, but I can't because I'm busy all of a sudden.

685
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:44,880
What's that?

686
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:47,060
Are you sick?

687
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:48,920
Oh, this?

688
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:50,260
No.

689
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,280
I have to take care of my health since I was young.

690
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:54,500
That's right.

691
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,280
You have to take care of yourself in advance.

692
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:57,880
Right?

693
01:12:58,580 --> 01:12:59,320
That's right.

694
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,840
Health is the most important thing.

695
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:03,140
I'm waiting for you.

696
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:04,680
I'll go first.

697
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:05,520
Yes.

698
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:06,780
You have to go.

699
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:08,740
Sir.

700
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:09,800
Yes?

701
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:14,580
By the way, this is for men.

702
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:16,260
Peek-a-boo.

703
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,180
Yes, I guess so.

704
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:25,540
Then I'll go.

705
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:28,260
Yes, go.

706
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:37,390
How do you feel?

707
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:43,050
Do you think we're okay?

708
01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:46,310
I don't think Ji-young knows.

709
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:48,390
I don't know.

710
01:13:50,670 --> 01:13:54,390
Then I'll find out in secret.

711
01:13:57,750 --> 01:13:59,590
You work alone today.

712
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:22,210
I'm here.

713
01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:23,590
Yes, I'm here.

714
01:14:25,870 --> 01:14:26,850
Are you peeling beans?

715
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:28,850
It's fun.

716
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:33,070
You peeled a lot.

717
01:14:35,290 --> 01:14:36,690
Where's your brother?

718
01:14:37,330 --> 01:14:37,890
That...

719
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:39,390
What?

720
01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:40,910
He was there.

721
01:14:53,670 --> 01:14:54,230
Brother.

722
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:57,210
Why are you hiding here like a rat?

723
01:14:59,470 --> 01:15:01,450
My poor brother.

724
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:03,630
His face is half closed.

725
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:08,470
What is the most important thing in a person's life?

726
01:15:10,830 --> 01:15:11,950
Health.

727
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:15,650
Health is the best, brother.

728
01:15:40,350 --> 01:15:41,290
What is a man?

729
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:44,070
One shot.

730
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:17,140
Oh, my God.

731
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,200
What?

732
01:16:25,430 --> 01:16:27,930
I'm sure it was a man's voice.

733
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:30,910
Are you okay?

734
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:32,150
Take off your pants.

735
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:33,270
What's wrong with you?

736
01:16:36,490 --> 01:16:38,290
Ji-young, get out of here.

737
01:16:40,530 --> 01:16:41,130
Don't do it.

738
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:46,470
Don't do it.

739
01:16:47,190 --> 01:16:47,990
Don't do it.

740
01:16:49,590 --> 01:16:50,270
I can't do it.

741
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:51,330
Take off your underwear.

742
01:16:52,030 --> 01:16:52,170
What?
I'll wash it for you.

743
01:16:54,230 --> 01:16:54,810
Don't do it.
Don't do it.

744
01:17:05,010 --> 01:17:05,750
What's wrong with you?

745
01:17:06,050 --> 01:17:06,450
Are you crazy?

746
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:10,290
Oh, my God.

747
01:17:13,990 --> 01:17:15,490
It hurts.

748
01:17:22,210 --> 01:17:24,550
It's 100% a man's voice.

749
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:19,000
Where did it go wrong?

750
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:24,160
He's not afraid of me anymore.

751
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:25,080
He's enjoying it.

752
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:28,540
My heart is pounding.

753
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:30,720
I feel fear.

754
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:43,660
I don't have the strength to stand up, but I have to get out of here.

755
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:45,300
That's the only way to live.

756
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:48,000
Brother.

757
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:53,540
I put your pants in the washing machine.

758
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:55,600
Change into this.

759
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:43,540
It must be the wind.

760
01:19:50,790 --> 01:19:54,630
You woke me up.

761
01:19:57,610 --> 01:20:00,950
Now that it's like this, it's a deal.

762
01:20:02,270 --> 01:20:02,970
Deal?

763
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:05,570
What deal?

764
01:20:10,490 --> 01:20:12,930
It was really good this time, too.

765
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:19,210
I'm glad you're okay.

766
01:20:20,290 --> 01:20:22,130
You saw it earlier, right?

767
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:25,950
We were so worried about you.

768
01:20:28,930 --> 01:20:33,010
I want to be nice to you until you stay here.

769
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:42,020
Are you listening to me?

770
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,040
Me?

771
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:57,300
That's weird.

772
01:20:58,740 --> 01:20:59,880
So soon?

773
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:08,540
Go.

774
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:13,500
Sit down.

775
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:43,500
Visit Katworld.net

776
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:34,260
No way.

777
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,160
What?

778
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,900
Are you

779
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:05,490
okay?
Why?

780
01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:07,650
What's going on?

781
01:23:08,130 --> 01:23:11,190
There was a condom on the sofa.

782
01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:15,210
Oh, this?

783
01:23:17,230 --> 01:23:18,870
I... at dawn...

784
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:22,730
What?

785
01:23:25,370 --> 01:23:26,250
You too?

786
01:23:30,030 --> 01:23:30,730
What?

787
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:35,270
Is that

788
01:23:43,170 --> 01:23:44,230
true?

789
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:47,450
How many times do I have to tell you?

790
01:23:49,490 --> 01:23:53,370
I heard your voice clearly in that house yesterday with these sensitive ears.

791
01:23:54,490 --> 01:23:56,010
It's not a woman with a thick voice.

792
01:23:57,210 --> 01:23:58,430
It's frustrating.

793
01:23:58,430 --> 01:23:58,670
What are you looking at?

794
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:12,950
Can't you tell the difference between a man's voice and a woman's voice?

795
01:24:14,990 --> 01:24:17,110
I gave you a boyfriend because I was lonely.

796
01:24:18,770 --> 01:24:23,070
I was afraid it would be a rumor in the neighborhood, so I packed it up.

797
01:24:23,930 --> 01:24:25,110
You don't know.

798
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:27,890
I don't know if it's a boyfriend or a passerby.

799
01:24:31,430 --> 01:24:32,910
I have to check it with my own eyes.

800
01:24:35,150 --> 01:24:36,590
Come out.

801
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:43,080
Huh?

802
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:45,240
Why are you going out?

803
01:24:49,820 --> 01:24:52,020
I don't think he went far.

804
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:53,380
I think he went to the city.

805
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:56,960
Look at the room.

806
01:24:57,720 --> 01:24:58,440
Don't worry.

807
01:24:59,040 --> 01:24:59,880
Can

808
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,940
you see anything?

809
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:20,300
There's no one.

810
01:25:24,570 --> 01:25:26,830
Isn't he alone?

811
01:25:40,250 --> 01:25:41,350
Right?

812
01:25:41,690 --> 01:25:42,250
Right?

813
01:25:42,330 --> 01:25:43,810
This isn't good.

814
01:25:53,070 --> 01:25:54,170
Why?

815
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:00,340
Then... then...

816
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:01,270
The guard...

817
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,050
The one who was at the supermarket...

818
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,370
Here, here, here.

819
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:07,860
You bastard.

820
01:26:08,380 --> 01:26:09,160
You were hiding here.
Are you scared?

821
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:10,800
What should we do?

822
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:13,880
It's good.

823
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:15,860
Let's catch him.

824
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:19,640
Let's retreat for now.

825
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:20,920
Yes, yes.

826
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:15,280
Where are you going?

827
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:17,400
I'm not going anywhere.

828
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:20,280
What if you get misunderstood because of COVID-19?

829
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:23,220
It's scary to see someone who can't even walk.

830
01:27:24,460 --> 01:27:29,540
If it's known that you're here, not only you, but we'll be in big trouble.

831
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,980
So stay quiet until you feel better.

832
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:37,360
We'll take care of the rest so that you can get out safely.

833
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:38,740
Yeah.

834
01:27:39,660 --> 01:27:40,580
Let's go in.

835
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:42,560
We're going to have a party today.

836
01:27:45,930 --> 01:27:47,470
A big party.

837
01:27:48,330 --> 01:27:49,150
Party?

838
01:27:57,010 --> 01:27:57,490
What's wrong?

839
01:28:03,830 --> 01:28:07,970
You can't miss a good drink on a good day.

840
01:28:15,770 --> 01:28:17,330
You like it, too.

841
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:25,600
I talked to Ji-young.

842
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:30,420
I think she's a good person.

843
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:32,220
That's right.

844
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:34,600
It's fun thanks to you.

845
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:45,120
So I decided to match it as much as possible.

846
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:47,600
What?

847
01:28:58,260 --> 01:29:03,100
I put in a little more because I'm older.

848
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:22,060
Ji-young, do you have anything else to buy?

849
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:24,760
Sister.

850
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:27,060
What is it?

851
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:42,900
Why is this guy doing this to my sister?

852
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:47,860
Brother, I think we have an extension.

853
01:29:48,650 --> 01:29:49,080
Shall we go?

854
01:29:50,570 --> 01:29:51,420
Stay still.

855
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:53,300
Why?

856
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:54,120
Are you scared?

857
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:56,560
I'm not scared.

858
01:29:57,420 --> 01:29:58,000
I'm thinking about it.

859
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:01,560
But he's obviously an escapee.

860
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:04,600
We might get in trouble if we fight without knowing.

861
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:04,980
It's not a big deal.

862
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,800
Then should I just hit my nose on the cow?

863
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:16,340
It's not even the name of your dog.

864
01:30:18,940 --> 01:30:20,920
I don't think the sisters know yet.

865
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:24,360
Explain in detail and we'll catch him.

866
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:28,740
Well, if it's that money, it's a paradise.

867
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:30,940
I can't tell you.

868
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:35,600
Catch the bad guy and wash our image.

869
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:38,260
I'm going to hand it over to him.

870
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:43,160
Make sure you eat it.

871
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:45,740
I'm going to catch him.

872
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:10,960
Let me go.

873
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:19,300
Did you wake up?

874
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:19,980
What is this?

875
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:21,880
Oh, my God.

876
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:23,020
What is this?

877
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:25,900
Even if it's uncomfortable, stay for a moment.

878
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:28,560
We need an insurance, too.

879
01:31:29,820 --> 01:31:30,740
Are you okay?

880
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:34,920
Answer me.

881
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:38,080
Why are you doing this to me all of a sudden?

882
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:39,260
You need to explain it to me.

883
01:31:40,220 --> 01:31:42,380
You know that better.

884
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:47,280
How do you know my name?

885
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:51,100
We all know.

886
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:54,300
That's why I tied this up.

887
01:31:57,320 --> 01:31:59,280
No, we've been close.

888
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:01,440
Why are you doing this to me all of a sudden?

889
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:03,040
Huh?

890
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:06,420
Why are you doing this to me all of a sudden?

891
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:08,100
No, why are you doing this to me all of a sudden?

892
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:11,720
The village chief and the young chairman.

893
01:32:12,620 --> 01:32:15,380
They always steal it and take it secretly.

894
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:18,240
The young chairman?

895
01:32:20,860 --> 01:32:21,980
He's just...

896
01:32:21,980 --> 01:32:22,780
It's real.

897
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:30,120
Who is it?

898
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:43,640
If you don't tell me, I'll bite your mouth.

899
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:55,660
It's been a long time.

900
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:56,920
What are you doing here?

901
01:32:57,300 --> 01:32:57,660
I know everything.

902
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:00,100
Where is that guy?

903
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:01,760
There was a tip-off.

904
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:03,000
A tip-off?

905
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:07,640
Wait a minute.

906
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:08,920
Oh, Mr. Chairman.

907
01:33:31,810 --> 01:33:32,310
No, Mr. Chairman.

908
01:33:32,710 --> 01:33:34,250
We have a private life, too.

909
01:33:34,690 --> 01:33:36,130
You can't just come in like this.

910
01:33:36,850 --> 01:33:37,790
There was a tip-off.

911
01:33:38,690 --> 01:33:40,550
We'll catch him, so don't worry.

912
01:33:41,390 --> 01:33:41,890
No...
Yes.

913
01:33:52,830 --> 01:33:53,870
Someone must have tried to steal us.

914
01:33:54,670 --> 01:33:56,250
It's really not me.

915
01:33:56,570 --> 01:33:56,990
Tell me.
Who gave you the tip-off?

916
01:33:58,550 --> 01:33:59,230
Oh, why...

917
01:33:59,870 --> 01:34:00,870
I'm busy right now.

918
01:34:03,390 --> 01:34:04,230
Where are you going?

919
01:34:07,530 --> 01:34:07,850
Oh, Mr. Chairman.

920
01:34:09,260 --> 01:34:10,810
Oh, it's a big deal.

921
01:34:13,270 --> 01:34:14,210
Oh, my God.

922
01:34:14,830 --> 01:34:16,150
Here you are.

923
01:34:16,330 --> 01:34:17,610
Sir, here you are.

924
01:34:18,910 --> 01:34:19,530
What?

925
01:34:21,890 --> 01:34:22,210
Are you looking for me?

926
01:34:26,330 --> 01:34:27,150
What are you doing?

927
01:34:48,450 --> 01:34:51,010
Where did you learn this?

928
01:34:52,050 --> 01:34:54,190
I'm a little meticulous.

929
01:34:56,970 --> 01:34:57,510
Wait a minute.
So...

930
01:34:58,650 --> 01:35:01,350
This is the wanted criminal we were looking for.

931
01:35:02,130 --> 01:35:03,930
And the chairman took a hidden camera for a few months.

932
01:35:06,110 --> 01:35:08,970
And the young chairman stalked his brother.

933
01:35:09,630 --> 01:35:10,310
Is this it?

934
01:35:11,090 --> 01:35:11,810
Yes.

935
01:35:12,350 --> 01:35:13,430
There's no one to believe.

936
01:35:15,210 --> 01:35:17,870
Why are there so many sexual criminals in the village?

937
01:35:19,430 --> 01:35:20,650
Hey, Kim Seung-kyung.

938
01:35:21,290 --> 01:35:23,010
You tend to talk a little bit.

939
01:35:24,430 --> 01:35:29,370
We are the heroes who rescued the villagers from this foot.

940
01:35:32,010 --> 01:35:33,650
What the hell are you talking about?

941
01:35:36,170 --> 01:35:40,630
I saw him spying on this house on that hill the other day.

942
01:35:42,210 --> 01:35:42,890
What?

943
01:35:43,790 --> 01:35:45,590
This mysterious bastard was watching it all?

944
01:35:45,910 --> 01:35:46,810
You guys saw it.

945
01:35:47,670 --> 01:35:49,010
What the hell are you talking about?

946
01:35:49,030 --> 01:35:50,370
Oh, get out of here.

947
01:35:50,850 --> 01:35:51,330
Get out of here.

948
01:35:51,330 --> 01:35:52,370
Kim Seung-kyung.

949
01:35:53,070 --> 01:35:54,870
This is the cell phone of the chairman and the young chairman.

950
01:35:55,830 --> 01:35:56,950
You can check it out.

951
01:35:57,790 --> 01:35:59,010
It's all on the Kakaotalk that the two of them shared.

952
01:36:01,350 --> 01:36:03,730
The evidence of stalking will come out when you look at the CCTV of the old house.

953
01:36:06,530 --> 01:36:09,850
Ji-young, don't do that to your brother.

954
01:36:11,150 --> 01:36:12,530
Why are you pretending to be close?

955
01:36:13,530 --> 01:36:14,210
What's going on?

956
01:36:15,130 --> 01:36:15,930
What's going on in our village?

957
01:36:16,690 --> 01:36:17,770
Catch him.

958
01:36:17,970 --> 01:36:20,410
Stop him.

959
01:36:21,330 --> 01:36:21,670
Stop him.

960
01:36:24,030 --> 01:36:26,510
Are you kidding me?

961
01:36:26,630 --> 01:36:28,250
No, I'm not.

962
01:36:29,070 --> 01:36:30,750
You son of a bitch.

963
01:36:31,650 --> 01:36:34,910
Does it hurt?

964
01:36:35,110 --> 01:36:35,890
It hurts.

965
01:36:36,370 --> 01:36:38,590
That's why you should have just killed him.

966
01:36:43,370 --> 01:36:46,090
I can't live in a place like this.

967
01:36:51,330 --> 01:36:52,290
Oh, my God.

968
01:36:53,630 --> 01:36:57,610
I saw

969
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:05,440
it.

970
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:09,950
Shut up.

971
01:37:17,650 --> 01:37:20,950
What's wrong with you?

972
01:37:21,850 --> 01:37:23,230
Save me.

973
01:37:24,890 --> 01:37:25,990
Save me.

974
01:37:28,650 --> 01:37:30,770
What are you going to do now?

975
01:37:30,770 --> 01:37:32,250
What are you going to do?

976
01:37:32,830 --> 01:37:33,950
You can't even do a good deed.

977
01:37:35,470 --> 01:37:36,230
Just die.

978
01:37:37,190 --> 01:37:38,710
Oh, my God.

979
01:37:51,050 --> 01:37:53,710
Min-ji, Min-ji, what are you doing?

980
01:37:54,470 --> 01:37:55,130
What am I doing?

981
01:37:55,690 --> 01:37:56,130
I'm working.

982
01:37:56,790 --> 01:37:58,250
Don't work.

983
01:37:59,090 --> 01:38:02,050
Let's go for a drive with Bok.

984
01:38:02,270 --> 01:38:02,870
Drive?

985
01:38:03,890 --> 01:38:04,990
No, thanks.

986
01:38:04,990 --> 01:38:05,070
I don't want to.

987
01:38:07,670 --> 01:38:09,410
Don't be like that.

988
01:38:10,410 --> 01:38:10,950
Let's go for a drive.

989
01:38:12,050 --> 01:38:14,650
Let's go to Pattaya and eat rice noodles.

990
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:17,210
Pattaya?

991
01:38:17,830 --> 01:38:19,810
Pattaya, Pattaya.

992
01:38:22,510 --> 01:38:24,450
Aren't you going, Min-ji?

993
01:38:25,310 --> 01:38:26,750
Bok isn't going either.

994
01:38:28,510 --> 01:38:29,690
Let's go together.

995
01:38:29,690 --> 01:38:31,610
Let's go to Pattaya.

996
01:38:33,510 --> 01:38:34,030
Rice noodles.

997
01:38:34,790 --> 01:38:36,470
What's the big deal about eating noodles?

998
01:38:40,330 --> 01:38:41,710
Let's go to Pattaya.

999
01:38:42,550 --> 01:38:43,210
Awesome.

1000
01:38:44,110 --> 01:38:45,310
Min-ji, you're the best.

1001
01:38:46,130 --> 01:38:47,270
Let's go to Pattaya.

1002
01:39:07,630 --> 01:39:08,470
It's nice.

1003
01:39:09,390 --> 01:39:11,170
Now I feel at home.

1004
01:39:13,210 --> 01:39:15,090
There's no one looking at me.

1005
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:22,060
Why?

1006
01:39:23,020 --> 01:39:25,020
It smells weird.

1007
01:39:27,660 --> 01:39:28,360
Smell?

1008
01:39:28,980 --> 01:39:30,120
What smell?

1009
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:36,480
The smell of young and healthy male.

1010
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:43,560
Wait a minute.

1011
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:47,840
What's wrong?

1012
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:49,380
He's so handsome.

1013
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:51,300
Let me see.

1014
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:54,420
He's

1015
01:40:01,550 --> 01:40:02,050
coming, he's coming.

1016
01:40:02,270 --> 01:40:03,230
I need to put on some makeup.

1017
01:40:08,590 --> 01:40:09,230
Hello.

1018
01:40:11,750 --> 01:40:12,390
Welcome.

1019
01:40:15,850 --> 01:40:18,130
If you're okay, please come in.

1020
01:40:22,830 --> 01:40:24,270
Love, wait for me.

1021
01:40:24,310 --> 01:40:24,930
I'm coming.

1022
01:40:26,230 --> 01:40:28,890
Love, wait for me.

1023
01:40:29,650 --> 01:40:31,130
Love, wait for me.

1024
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:31,990
I'm coming.

1025
01:40:33,410 --> 01:40:35,730
Love, wait for me.

1026
01:40:44,910 --> 01:40:50,190
From some point, you're getting farther away from me.

1027
01:40:51,870 --> 01:40:53,930
I can't catch you.

1028
01:40:54,330 --> 01:40:57,330
When I look back, my heart hurts.

1029
01:40:59,070 --> 01:41:00,670
You turned around.

1030
01:41:01,730 --> 01:41:07,610
I don't think you'll come to me again.

1031
01:41:07,610 --> 01:41:09,730
The sky seems to collapse and the ground seems to die.

1032
01:41:10,390 --> 01:41:11,750
I think I'm going crazy.

1033
01:41:13,110 --> 01:41:17,350
How can this be?

1034
01:41:20,310 --> 01:41:24,950
I can't do this to me.

1035
01:41:33,870 --> 01:41:39,070
How can I forget all the stories you've told me?

1036
01:41:42,190 --> 01:41:44,090
Love, wait for me.

1037
01:41:44,210 --> 01:41:44,930
I'm coming.

1038
01:41:45,870 --> 01:41:48,230
Love, wait for me.

1039
01:41:49,290 --> 01:41:51,210
Love, wait for me.

1040
01:41:51,350 --> 01:41:52,210
I'm coming.

1041
01:41:53,210 --> 01:41:55,210
Love, wait for me.

1042
01:41:57,150 --> 01:41:58,330
Love, wait for me.

1043
01:41:58,410 --> 01:41:59,130
I'm coming.

1044
01:42:00,110 --> 01:42:02,310
Love, wait for me.

1045
01:42:03,790 --> 01:42:05,430
Love, wait for me.

1046
01:42:05,550 --> 01:42:06,430
I'm coming.

1047
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:09,410
Love, wait for me.

1048
01:42:24,420 --> 01:42:26,000
You turned around.

1049
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:29,280
I don't think you'll come to me again.

1050
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:34,920
The sky seems to collapse and the ground seems to die.

1051
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:37,080
I think I'm going crazy.

1052
01:42:38,220 --> 01:42:42,660
How can this be?

1053
01:42:45,860 --> 01:42:50,320
I can't do this to me.

1054
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:04,480
How can I forget all the stories you've told me?

1055
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:09,400
Love, wait for me.

1056
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:10,260
I'm coming.

1057
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:13,800
Love, wait for me.

1058
01:43:14,660 --> 01:43:16,540
Love, wait for me.

1059
01:43:16,660 --> 01:43:17,600
I'm coming.

1060
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:23,720
Love, wait for me.

1061
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:24,460
I'm coming.

1062
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:27,600
Love, wait for me.

1063
01:43:28,900 --> 01:43:30,760
Love, wait for me.

1064
01:43:30,860 --> 01:43:31,780
I'm coming.

1065
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:34,680
Love, wait for me.
