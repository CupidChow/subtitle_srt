00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,800
It's said that the Blades of Grievance Punishment consists of 81 stabs.

16
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,800
Every stab is like going through an ascension trial.

17
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,200
Not just that.

18
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,500
The Grievance Blades will break up within the body.

19
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,800
It will cut and shred his skin, flesh, tendons, and bones.

20
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,300
His inside will be cut into pieces, leaving only his skin intact.

21
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:56,900
Ying Yuan, if you confess and tell us how you colluded with the Devil Clan,

22
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:02,400
considering your past achievements, I can give you one last chance.

23
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,000
That is what I should be telling you.

24
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,400
When they carry out the punishment later,

25
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,900
look away.

26
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,200
Don't be afraid.

27
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,500
You are irredeemable.

28
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,200
Execute him!

29
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,000
Wait!

30
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,100
Flower spirit, are you going to persuade Ying Yuan to confess?

31
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,400
He is not guilty.

32
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,400
There is no reason to persuade him.

33
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,800
If he is wrongfully executed and dies here, how can I live in this world by myself?

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,600
Today, I shall take the punishment with him.

35
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,200
Yan Dan!

36
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,200
Such a genuine and deeply in love couple.

37
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,300
All right. As you wish.

38
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,600
You won't survive this punishment.

39
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,200
How silly of you.

40
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,400
Wherever you go, I will be there.

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,300
Heavenly Emperor, for your own interests,

42
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,000
you disregarded lives and instigated the war among the Three Realms.

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,500
You are unqualified to be an deity, let alone to lead the Three Realms!

44
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,400
How insolent!

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Even if we die today, justice won't be gone!

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,400
All deities, you must not let this sinful person distort the truth again!

47
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,800
Yan Dan!

48
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,900
Are you all right?

49
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,800
Can you still take it?

50
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,300
All right.

♫ <i> For a single teardrop, I'm drowning myself in sorrow, obsessing with forgetting you </i> ♫

53
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:35,000
♫ <i> If we'd have to walk till we separate, to where would you want to go? </i> ♫

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,000
♫ <i> Turn around and become the delusion of my life</i> ♫

55

56
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,200
♫ <i> My loneliness and longing for you</i> ♫

57
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,000
Don't be afraid.

58
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,000
♫ <i> I still have an image of you imprinted in my mind</i> ♫

59
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,800
It just looks painful.

60
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:09,400
♫ <i> Life after life, this is the longing I missed the most</i> ♫

61
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:17,400
♫ <i> You are the breeze of a fallen flower in the world of flowers adding to the mound of fallen flowers </i> ♫

62
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:23,600
♫ <i> Will you shed tears over the truth of the mortal world? </i> ♫

63
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,500
♫ <i> You're like the unattainable Autumn Moon in the vast sky, don't dare to shine bright yet not hesitate to shine</i>♫

64
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,280
When you cut out your heart and were being punished for me,

65
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
you must have been in a lot of pain, too.

66
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,100
Don't cry.

67
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,800
Don't cry.

68
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,300
They have taken 80 stabs. Yet they are still alive.

69
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,800
Could it be that they are meant to live?

70
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,300
As the God of War, he should be capable of surviving this.

71
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,100
However, the 81st Grievance Blade comes from the depth of Nine Abysses.

72
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,800
Its power is greater than the first 80 blades combined.

73
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,400
It would turn even the ancient gods into ashes.

74
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,600
Ying Yuan actually broke the Heavenly Gate with the Grievance Blade.

75
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,400
Let's go.

76
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,400
Go!

77
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,000
Ying Yuan!

78
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,400
Yan Dan.

79
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,000
Sister.

80
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,400
This is Blood Vine Pill.

81
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,500
It will regulate your heart meridian.

82
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,200
Sister, what's wrong with you?

83
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,800
Why are your hands so cold?

84
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,100
I'm fine.

85
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,600
You should go now.

86
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,200
All right.

87
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,000
Are you all right?

88
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,700
I'm here to help you.

89
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,320
Sister!

90
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,180
Sister, what are you doing? Come back!

91
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,720
Come back!

92
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,100
Sister!

93
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:44,160
I will always protect Yan Dan.

94
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,280
This time...

95
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,360
I won't break my promise.

96
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,220
Sister! Sister!

97
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,340
Come back, Sister! Sister!

98
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,660
Sister, I'm begging you.

99
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,540
I'm begging you. Come back, Sister!

100
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,280
Sister! Come back!

101
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,400
Sister!

102
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,320
Leave!

103
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,460
Sister!

104
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:41,040
<i>Yan Dan. Before we can ascend, you know</i>

105
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,300
<i>we will have to head to the Mortal Realm to go through the Eight Hardships.</i>

106
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,740
<i>But I’ve never left the Nine Heavens.</i>

107
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,840
<i>I'm a little worried.</i>

108
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,760
<i>Zhi Xi, don't worry. I'm here.</i>

109
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:04,080
<i>I'm not scared because I have to protect you forever.</i>

110
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,280
<i>I've collected all the stars.</i>

111
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,920
<i>Your punishment is, from now on,</i>

112
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:22,860
<i>only death will do us part.</i>

113
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,420
<i>Will you still take me as your sister?</i>

114
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,180
<i>Well, of course.</i>

115
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,680
<i>What about you?</i>

116
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,580
<i>Do you ever regret having me as your sister?</i>

117
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,160
<i>Never.</i>

118
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,860
<i> Let's never part again.</i>

119
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,380
<i> I... will always protect you.</i>

120
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,440
<i>This time...</i>

121
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,020
<i>I won't break my promise.</i>

122
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,200
<i>Yan Dan, it's me.</i>

123
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,340
Come in.

124
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:02,240
Yan Dan, I'm sorry.

125
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,240
If I hadn't given false testimony for the Heavenly Emperor, this wouldn't have happened to you.

126
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,480
And Fairy Zhi Xi wouldn't have died.

127
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,520
I have hurt you for selfish reasons.

128
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:20,620
I can never atone for this. Once Xuan Xiang is rescued, I will beg for your forgiveness.

129
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:26,900
Even if Heavenly Emperor didn't use you, he wouldn't have spared us.

130
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:32,120
You were hurt in order to protect us. Are you all right?

131
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:37,200
After all we have been through, you still care about me.

132
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:48,300
Yan Dan, will you let me be your older sister?

133
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:53,220
I want to look after and protect you on behalf of Zhi Xi.

134
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:05,000
During the Divine-Devil War, I witnessed and even experienced numerous separations and deaths.

135
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,740
All lives eventually end, but when that moment really comes, it feels quite different.

136
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:18,860
Actually, it is a blessing to die for your loved ones.

137
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:23,760
I believe that love is a long-lasting companionship,

138
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,060
an irreplaceable connection.

139
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:33,240
If we can gladly accept such a blessing, can we still call that love?

140
00:16:33,966 --> 00:16:38,106
<i>You promised me. As long as I helped you, you would report my efforts.</i>

141
00:16:38,106 --> 00:16:41,060
<i>Why are you the one who was selected in the Tianji Pavilion assessment?</i>

142
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:47,320
<i>You belong to the Bird Clan, which is as petty as the Merman Clan that protects the temple.</i>

143
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,120
<i>You are only fit to be a cleaning attendant.</i>

144
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:55,620
<i>How can your humble background compete with me, who is of the Divine Clan and was born human?</i>

145
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:01,160
<i>Working for me... is an honor to you.</i>

146
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:09,360
<i>The curator told me animal clans aren't presentable.</i>

147
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,220
<i>But you are good for running errands.</i>

148
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:23,960
<i>In fact, the curator never considered promoting you.</i>

149
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,680
<i>Since you have caught me in the act, you can do whatever you want to me.</i>

150
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,120
<i>Those who judge others by their origin deserve to die.</i>

151
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:58,000
<i>If you want to destroy the body and get rid of the evidence, you should do it flawlessly.</i>

152
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,480
<i>Why are you helping me?</i>

153
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,180
<i>Because I was once like you.</i>

154
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,700
Every kind of love in the world is different.

155
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,100
How can you assert that this is not love?

156
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:38,200
Sister Tao, Liu Weiyang will definitely hold on until the end and reunite with you.

157
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,320
You won't have to suffer the pain of separation again.

158
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,600
In fact, over the past few days, I wanted to leave and find Xuan Xiang by myself,

159
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,620
but I couldn't get out because of Zhao Lan.

160
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:58,780
The barrier she set up cut off all communication between the South Sea and the Heavenly Court.

161
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,220
She's probably worried that I would alert them.

162
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,100
Zhao Lan did it for our own good.

163
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,400
The Heavenly Emperor is searching for us everywhere. It's dangerous out there.

164
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:17,000
Keep in mind that Liu Weiyang will be fine as long as you are safe.

165
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,620
I heard that this barrier was created by Yu Mo.

166
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:26,280
Yet the South Sea is so vast, can he really be sure that it is unbreakable?

167
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,200
Yu Mo is a Nine Fins.

168
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,340
His barrier won't have any problem.

169
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,400
That's good.

170
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,140
But sheltering here for the long term won't solve our problem.

171
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,360
What do you plan to do next?

172
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,800
I'm not in the mood to think about that.

173
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,400
We'll see to that after Yu Mo wakes up.

174
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,600
Brother Yu Mo.

175
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,200
Brother Yu Mo, stop hurting yourself.

176
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,400
There is no fire that water can't extinguish.

177
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,300
Water extinguishes fire. Fire melts the ice.

178
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,400
Fire and water are incompatible.

179
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,400
The only exception is Nine Fins' Power of Water and Fire.

180
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:30,400
I need to make my fire spirit resistant to water, in order for it to merge with the water spirit.

181
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,700
Other than this, there is no other way.

182
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,000
But you are trying too hard to improve your spiritual practice.

183
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,100
You made only a little improvement after going through a lot of hardships.

184
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:45,900
Once this ice is poured on you... you will have to start all over again.

185
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,400
Brother Yu Mo, why don't you take it easy?

186
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,400
It's never easy for Nine Fins to cultivate the fire spirit.

187
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,400
In the past, I didn't mind spending a few hundred years doing it.

188
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,000
But now, not only have I not exacted my vengeance,

189
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,700
but there is also a formidable foe awaiting me outside.

190
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:12,300
I need to cultivate the fire spirit as soon as I can and regain the Power of Water and Fire.

191
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,900
Only then can I conquer the formidable foe.

192
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,000
Zhi Xi was a good sister.

193
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,600
How is Yu Mo now?

194
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,200
He is getting a lot better.

195
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,800
He will recover in a few days.

196
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:43,200
What about you? How is your injury?

197
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,400
Thanks to Zhi Xi's Blood Vine Pill.

198
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,800
It protected my heart meridian.

199
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,300
That's why I recovered so soon.

200
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,200
I feel like a loser.

201
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,200
I can't do anything right.

202
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,900
When I was in the Nine Heavens, I was just an immortal attendant.

203
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:19,800
All I wanted to do at that time was mess around and have fun.

204
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,400
Under your protection and Zhi Xi's care...

205
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,000
I lived a carefree life.

206
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,200
I was contented enough as long as my friends and family were around me.

207
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,400
After I learned what responsibility is,

208
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,400
what love is...

209
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I cultivated hard every day.

210
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
But I later realized...

211
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,800
I still can't do anything right.

212
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:57,600
If it weren't for me, you wouldn't have been sent to the Heavenly Gallows, and Yu Mo wouldn't have been injured.

213
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,100
Sister...

214
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,800
Sister wouldn't have died because of me.

215
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,400
I feel like I've failed everyone.

216
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,200
Silly girl,

217
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,700
I am to blame for all this.

218
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
If you don't stop crying, you'll look like a dirty kitten.

219
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,900
Look.

220
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,600
We are not the only ones waiting here tonight.

221
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,700
I wonder who she is waiting for.

222
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,400
Coming here at such a late hour with a smile on her face,

223
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,100
she's probably waiting for her sweetheart.

224
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,100
We dolphin clan have very good ears.

225
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,000
We can hear your whispers.

226
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,200
Actually, I'm celebrating my sister's birthday.

227
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,600
She loved watching fireworks since she was little.

228
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,000
We promised to set off fireworks together every year on our birthdays.

229
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,300
Why are you the only one here?

230
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,000
Where is she?

231
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,200
She got married and moved to the North Sea.

232
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,800
Since then, we haven't been able to celebrate our birthdays together.

233
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,800
But every year on her birthday, I set off fireworks on the beach.

234
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,400
We dolphins have the most acute hearing and vision in the Four Seas.

235
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,800
No matter where she is, she will see it.

236
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
No matter where she is...

237
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,300
how far away she is...

238
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,600
can she really see it?

239
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,800
Even if her eyes can't see it...

240
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
her heart will.

241
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,600
That's it. We are sisters.

242
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,700
Our hearts will always be together even if we are far apart.

243
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,600
It's okay to cry.

244
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:44,000
Sister and I promised that we would watch the Star-Catching Ceremony together.

245
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,800
But now I'm the only one left.

246
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,800
I left her up there.

247
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,200
I broke my promise.

248
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,800
She must be very angry with me.

249
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,500
Will she...

250
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,400
Will she come back?

251
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,600
I have lost...

252
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,600
my sister forever.

253
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,700
When you were in the Mortal Realm, you couldn't see Zhi Xi,

254
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:33,100
but she was thinking about you in the Nine Heavens.

255
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,000
It's the same now.

256
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,800
Zhi Xi is always here with you.

257
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:11,100
As long as you think about her, you can watch every stars shower.

258
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,000
Sister.

259
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,400
Is that you?

260
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,600
Are you watching it with me?

261
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:29,300
As long as you have her in mind, she will always be with you.

262
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,600
From now on, she is with the stars,

263
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,400
she is the flowers,

264
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,400
she is the rain.

265
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:42,500
Zhi Xi protected the one she loved the most.

266
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,800
The Four-Leaf Lotus would rather break than bend.

267
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:51,100
Even if you are forgotten, you never fall.

268
00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:00,000
I know you will not let your sister down, right?

269
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,000
Sister!

270
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,800
We will be sisters again in the next life.

271
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,000
It's better I be the older sister, and you the younger sister.

272
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,800
I will protect you.

273
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,800
I want you to live happily and worry-free.

274
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,120
Don't worry!

275
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,800
I will live on for your sake.

276
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,820
Sister!

277
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,500
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

278
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,860
Your Majesty. What is the meaning of this?

279
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:31,960
Yu Mo, the Nine Fins has always been supreme among the Aquatic Clans.

280
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,220
The Four Seas can never repay your great kindness.

281
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,340
Today, all the elders of the Aquatic Clans

282
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:42,140
from the Dragon Palaces in the Four Seas have gathered here.

283
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:48,140
After our discussion, from now on, no matter what you do,

284
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,720
no matter who you're against, even if it's the Heavenly Court,

285
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,420
all the Aquatic Clans in the Four Seas are at your disposal.

286
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,680
We won't back down.

287
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,320
<i>Aquatic Clans of the Four Seas, at your disposal.</i>

288
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,540
<i>We will fight for the Nine Fins.</i>

289
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,360
Please get up, everyone.

290
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,320
What's this about?

291
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,840
Does he not agree with this?

292
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,120
Zhao Lan...

293
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:32,220
Everyone, this time, I'm being pursued by the Heavenly Court,

294
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:36,400
it's the South Sea's protection that has kept me safe.

295
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:41,300
There is no need to bring up the past favor.

296
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:47,080
On behalf of the Nine Fins, I thank you for your kind gesture.

297
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,000
- Brother Yu Mo...
- What I'm about to do is extremely dangerous.

298
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,140
I won't, and I can't, put the Aquatic Clans in danger.

299
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:02,180
Brother Yu Mo, we are supposed to...

300
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:09,820
The survival of the Aquatic Clans of the Four Seas is the greatest wish of my clan.

301
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,880
The Heavenly Emperor has launched a manhunt for us.

302
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,900
Before we solve this crisis, we must look into someone.

303
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,140
<i>- Tao Ziqi.</i>
- That's right.

304
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:31,180
Do you remember we saw her sending a message outside when we were at the Shenxiao Palace?

305
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:36,340
She always says she loves and cares for Liu Weiyang, but she never wears the earrings that he gave her.

306
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,300
She behaves very strangely.

307
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:43,120
I feel that her feelings for Liu Weiyang are not as sincere as she claims.

308
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:52,380
I asked her how she and Liu Weiyang were caught and where Liu Weiyang was being kept.

309
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:57,020
There was nothing wrong with her answers, but she was too calm.

310
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:01,240
If she truly wants to save him, she would recall all kinds of details,

311
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,380
rather than repeatedly blame herself for getting him involved.

312
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,820
That's right.

313
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:11,240
Sister Tao often visits me and she behaves just as she used to.

314
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,480
Yet she is particularly concerned about the South Sea's barrier and our plans.

315
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,980
I started to suspect her when we were in the Heavenly Gallows.

316
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,380
She chose to be on the Heavenly Emperor's side in order to save her lover.

317
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,620
Then why did she risk her lover's safety and help us in the end?

318
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,740
Wouldn't that put her in a terrible position?

319
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,020
Why did you save her if you were suspicious of her?

320
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:35,980
If Tao Ziqi is a friend, for the sake of Liu Weiyang, saving her was the right thing to do.

321
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:40,080
If she's an enemy, we need to keep her by our side as the witness.

322
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,980
She will be our trump card to expose the Heavenly Emperor.

323
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,400
But even if Tao Ziqi is on our side,

324
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:53,140
as long as Liu Weiyang is being kept, she may turn to the Heavenly Emperor's side again.

325
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,360
So we have to be more cautious

326
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:02,100
when we talk and act, in case she finds something she can exploit.

327
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,100
During the fight at the Heavenly Gallows,

328
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:07,400
you suddenly attacked the Heavenly Emperor's waist. Did you notice anything?

329
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:13,780
After his belt was pierced, a cold light emitted from it, along with a crisp sound of swords gliding.

330
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,750
<i> I recognize the sword in his waist.</i>

331
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:21,300
That is the personal weapon of Star Deity Ji Du, Huan Qin.

332
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:28,890
But why would the Heavenly Emperor carry the sword of the late star deity?

333
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:30,700
I tested him once.

334
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:35,210
There was this one time, he accidentally brushed off the pieces on my GO board,

335
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:38,280
and he managed to put the pieces back to the same spots.

336
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,360
Only a GO player is capable of doing that.

337
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,400
But the Heavenly Emperor doesn't know how to play GO, and he never drinks.

338
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,560
Now... it's like he has become a different person.

339
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,560
That's right. A different person.

340
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,300
Zhi Xi said the same thing before.

341
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,800
She said since the Divine-Devil War, the Heavenly Emperor had changed a lot.

342
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,800
He used to be stern and old-fashioned,

343
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,600
but now, not only did he amend the Heavenly Laws more than once,

344
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,440
but he also relaxed the punishment of love.

345
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,600
Also, he held banquets for the immortals.

346
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:10,260
Do you think it could be that he's actually a different person?

347
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,380
Since that mystery man can master the Puppet Spell,

348
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:20,640
the Heavenly Emperor can be anyone, which means anyone can be the Heavenly Emperor.

349
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:27,140
I have been mentored by His Supreme Majesty since I was a child.

350
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,300
He used to care about the world,

351
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:34,760
so I couldn't understand why he'd suddenly become so credit-hungry and bloodthirsty.

352
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,980
He already holds the highest position.

353
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:42,920
He has no reason to brutally kill the emperors, let alone me.

354
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:49,120
But if someone is impersonating His Supreme Majesty with the Puppet Spell, it all makes sense.

355
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,060
But where is...

356
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,680
the real Heavenly Emperor?

357
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,720
Could it be...

358
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:11,880
Ying Yuan, this person knows the orbital pattern of the Nine Planets,

359
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,280
and he wears a sword at his waist.

360
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,040
He is also skilled in the art of GO.

361
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,620
Don't you think he is a lot like Huan Qin?

362
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,640
The Golden Cicada's Wings were put in the Star Setter Pavilion.

363
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,840
All these years, no one has ever found out about it.

364
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,660
Could it be that he put it there himself?

365
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,140
Huan Qin is dead.

366
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,980
I checked his divine body.

367
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:40,760
And his divine spirit... is gone, too.

368
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,220
It's very likely that the Heavenly Emperor may be a different person.

369
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:50,220
That divine body may not be Huan Qin's either.

370
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,680
We know Huan Qin and you were close.

371
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,060
We don't want that person to be him either.

372
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:02,860
That day in the Divine Cemetery Forest, are you sure you checked every corner?
