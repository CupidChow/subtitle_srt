15
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,960
Aside from the bodies of those who went down into the tomb with us, the rest belong to some pretty strong men.

16
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,440
They haven't been dead long either.

17
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:44,000
If a lot of able-bodied men disappeared in Qingshi Town in a short period of time, it would naturally cause a stir.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,600
Therefore, their disappearance is caused by...

19
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,580
The Consort's Tomb!

20
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,900
The tomb is a complete trap.

21
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,640
There's no treasure in there at all.

22
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,860
Groups of treasure hunters just rushed in to their death.

23
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:01,720
I finally understand why greed is placed first in the Five Sufferings.

24
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,820
Do you think Miss Shen killed them all?

25
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:10,730
Don't you think that, after we came to the Shen Residence, all the clues came too easily?

26
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:18,250
Miss Shen is suspicious. But all the evidence that points to her comes from Master Shen.

27
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,020
Hearing isn't everything. Seeing is believing.

28
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,140
All right. Let's go and meet Miss Shen.

29
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,020
It's so pretty!

30
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,680
Miss Shen is quite cute.

31
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,960
You can't tell she's playing dumb.

32
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,580
Do you really think she is pretending?

33
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,880
Haven't you noticed that Miss Shen looks childlike?

34
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,300
She plays until she has mud all over her body, except for her face, which is completely clean.

35
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:03,620
When I first saw her outside the tomb, I noticed that trees ripped her dress while running the whole way.

36
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,060
Except for her face... It stayed nice, clean, and pretty.

37
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,360
Makes one unable to resist touching it.

38
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,780
You are a girl... a demon...

39
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,560
Why do you use such frivolous words?

40
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,620
Please! "Frivolous"?

41
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,980
This is a normal reaction when you see a beautiful woman.

42
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,160
Master Shen wants you to marry his daughter, but you are uninterested.

43
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,380
Looks like you're destined to be a bachelor in this lifetime.

44
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,980
No problem. I'll just pass my lifetime with a noisy demon, then.

45
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,800
I was just kidding! I was just kidding!

46
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,080
Go away! Go away right now!

47
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,940
I don't want to play with you! Quickly! Go away!

48
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,820
Go away!

49
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,260

Wifey, calm down!

52
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,600
I knew it. I just knew you would come looking for her!

53
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,100
You can't resist what the Shen family is offering you, right?

54
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,220
Tang Zhou! We've been together since we were sixteen.

55
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,160
How many promises did you make to me?

56
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,240
But now... now you want to be with her!

57
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,940
I won't accept this!

58
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,160
Let me explain!

59
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,580
"Explain," my foot!

60
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,460
Thank you.

61
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,180
Miss Shen, you're quite agile. You don't look dumb.

62
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,940
Dad said that I'm not dumb.

63
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,520
I know... a lot of words.

64
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,940
I can also recite the Three Character Classic.

65
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,320
“Men on earth, good at birth.”

66
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,340
- "Good..."
- Once is enough. If you continue to pretend, you won't be able to dodge my strike.

67
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,100
Madam Hu will be back soon.

68
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,600
If you two want to know the truth, come to my room tonight.

69
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,580
We're safe.

70
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,440
Tell us. Why did you pretend to be crazy and dumb?

71
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,920
Did my father tell you?

72
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:35,500
He still won't let me go... and wants to kill me.

73
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:44,300
Actually, when I was very young, I personally saw him kill my mother.

74
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,600
I was afraid he would kill me too. So I pretended to be traumatized.

75
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,460
My father spread rumors about the Consort's Tomb and killed many people with traps.

76
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,160
I've always wanted to do something. However, Madam Hu is always watching me.

77
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,640
I could only pretend to be psychic.

78
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,620
I ran to the Consort's Tomb to warn the treasure hunters.

79
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,960
No wonder you kept rejecting our offer to exorcise your house.

80
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,300
"Bone collecting burial ritual."

81
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,540
It sounded familiar when I heard Master Shen mention it before.

82
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,200
I read a journal before called "Strange Tales of Clans."

83
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:26,040
It states that the bone collecting burial ritual is a closely guarded technique of the Duoxi Clan.

84
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,640
It's protected by a saintess.

85
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,120
But the last saintess eloped with a man ten years ago.

86
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,820
Since then, the Duoxi Clan has disappeared.

87
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,560
If you do not mind, let me guess.

88
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,400
Was your mother that saintess?

89
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,200
Yes.

90
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,200
My father killed her just to get the clan's secret technique.

91
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,000
He has already practiced it for many years.

92
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,260
No ordinary practitioners can fight against him.

93
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,800
I beg you two. You have to save me.

94
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,660
This is Master Shen. This is Miss Shen.

95
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,940
Master Shen's fear looks real.

96
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,240
Miss Shen's tears feel sincere, too.

97
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,640
But the only one who can testify is already a skeleton.

98
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,400
Who do you think is the actual murderer?

99
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,700
It doesn't matter. It's important that we just wait patiently.

100
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,340
Makes sense.

101
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,620
The real murderer will rack his brain as long as we're here.

102
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,940
Let's see who has more patience.

103
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,540
But are you really sure you can catch the murderer when he appears?

104
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,240
As long as you stay out of my way.

105
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,300
Don't underestimate me.

106
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,280
Sometimes it's useless to fight and kill like you do.

107
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,060
The most important thing...

108
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,510
is to use this. Wisdom. Understand?

109
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,100
Is it?

110
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,220
Yes.

Taoist Master Tang! Save me! Save me!

114

What's wrong? What is the matter?

115

Taoist Master Tang. You were born with good looks.

Any woman who meets you, likes you.

Actually, I don't want to turn you into a shriveled skeleton either.

118

But I have no choice.

119
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,140
You know too much.

120
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:18,000
You are a mortal who can turn people into skeletons.

121

Is it the Seven Star Deity Jade?

122
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,460
You even know about this?

I'm really don't want to kill you now.

125
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,140
or am I prettier?

126
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:47,070
If you were given another chance to choose, would you choose her or me?

127
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,500
Just kill me. I do not have time to chat with you.

Do you despise me that much?

Shen Xiangjun! Are you seducing my husband behind my back?

00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,700
Didn't you fall into the well?

133
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,880
You think a cheap move like that can trap me?

134
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,240
You underestimate me.

Yes.

140
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,800
If it wasn't for you, how would I have discovered that Master Shen was so handsome when he was young?

141
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,760
He also could paint well. Can you see what it says here?

142
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,450
"On the 3rd day of the 3rd month, Yijun and I went for an outing with my sister-in-law, Xiangjun."

143
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:45,840
So it seems you and Master Shen are brother-in-law and sister-in-law.

144
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,980
Then why do you claim to be father and daughter?

145
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,320
Just because your sister died, did you blot out her face?

146

This doesn't concern you!

147
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,820
Calm down. How does it not concern me?

148
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:02,760
The old master already promised me that if I kill you, he'll regain his youth, and I can stay young forever.

00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,380
This way we'll never have to part.

150
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,080
Do you think I should agree to it?

151
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,160
He wants to be with you?

152

That's right.

153
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,060
You killed your sister, the one he loved most.

154
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,460
If not me, who else? Should he be with you?

155
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,980
I'll kill you!

156
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,640
She isn't what we thought. Neither are you.

157

You were just going to lie there and watch the show?

158
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,700
This isn't the first time you've played dumb to take advantage of others.

159
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:41,020
Before, you tricked the thieves at the inn. Now you tricked Miss Shen.

160
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,880
I just wanted to see what she's capable of.

161
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,760
You knew, yet you still came in.

162
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,040
I was afraid that you'd fall into her trap.

163
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,060
If you turned into a skeleton, I'd have to suffer too.

164
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,180
You're quite self-aware.

165
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,540
Did Master Shen tell you everything?

166
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,220
Of course... not.

167
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,540
I just played a little trick and stole this painting.

168
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,400
Everything else was guesswork.

169
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,780
When acting, it has to be according to the situation.

170
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,720
Master Shen misses his late wife so much that he uses the painting to help him remember her.

171
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,600
How could he blot her face out?

172
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,200
A woman would blot out her own sister's face for only one reason.

173
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,600
Jealousy.

174
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,880
The sister-in-law fell in love with her brother-in-law.

175
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,040
This is too old-fashioned.

176
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,980
Bai Piaoliang, you are indeed amazing.

177
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,240
I am all right.

178
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,060
Taoist Master Tang, hurry and save me! She's insane!

179
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:45,700
If you come any closer, I'll kill him!

180
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,960
Why?

181
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,520
I love you so much, yet you still won't forget Shen Yijun.

182
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,020
Do you know how painful that is for me?

183
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:08,320
For you, my sister gave up the chance to live forever as a saintess.

184
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,840
She left her whole clan behind and eloped with you.

185
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,280
Yet you killed her in the end!

186
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,880
And you think you have the right to miss her?

187
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,100
That's because you forced me to do it!

188
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:27,120
Back then, you stole the jade and drained the whole clan's essence and blood.

189
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,040
After your spiritual skills improved, you caught up to Xiao Yi and me.

190
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,740
I begged you for mercy, to let me go.

191
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,760
But you insisted that I kill Xiao Yi first.

192
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,440
My goodness.

193
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,700
At first, I thought Master Shen was quite pitiful.

194
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,960
To my surprise, no one is innocent.

195
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,260
Now Xiao Yi is dead.

196
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:54,000
You still won't let me go and keep me locked up here.

197
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,940
You turned me into this...

198
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,500
while you keep yourself young forever.

199
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:08,930
I thought that, by making you old, you'd never fall in love with another woman.

200
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:13,240
Originally, it was you who knelt and said that you loved me.

201
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,660
That was why I spared your life. Did you forget that?

202
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,620
You liar!

203
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,220
Woman, what's wrong with your brain?

204
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:26,060
You forced him to kill his beloved, and then made him old and senile.

205
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:30,240
How could he fall in love with a selfish and terrifying person like you?

206
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,760
Xiangjun, listen to me.

207
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,760
Xiangjun, don't you like my paintings?

208
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,760
I was going to draw you a painting with only you and me in it.

209
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:51,400
The two of us will never be separated in life or death. All right?

210
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,780
Xiangjun, please let me go.

211
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,400
Believe me.

212
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,020
Xiangjun, you must not listen to their provocations.

213
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,620
They forced me to tell them about Xiao Yi.

214
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,780
Don't you know they want the Seven Star Deity Jade?

215
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,580
I'm not lying to you.

216
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,040
Believe me.

217
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,720
Xiangjun.

218
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,320
It's you two.

219
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,890
You really are stupid.

220
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,820
You would believe such nonsense from an unfaithful man?

221
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,400
Tang Zhou!

222
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,080
Why?

223
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,320
Why did you have to do this to me?

224
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,380
Didn't you say you loved me?

225
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,760
You said...

226
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:55,680
that... we'll be together forever.

227
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,860
I just realized today that human greed and obsession...

228
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,960
are more terrifying than demons.

229
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,140
Don't drag us demons into this!

230
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,740
Demons' feelings are the purest.

231
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,300
The two of them were too crazy.

232
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,900
There are Eight Sufferings in the Mortal Realm.

233
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,440
Birth, old age, sickness, death, being apart from those you love,

234
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,700
being with those you hate, not obtaining what you want,

235
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,620
and the raging blaze of the 5 skandhas.
<i> (T/N: 5 components creating body and mind)</i>

236
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:33,280
Master Shen first tried to avoid death by parting with the older sister.

237
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,380
Then he ended up staying with the younger sister he hated,

238
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,860
and became old and senile.

239
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,500
There's no harsher punishment than this.

240
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,700
Miss Shen suffered the five skandhas and became obsessed.

241
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,180
In the end, Master Shen never loved her.

242
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,640
Both tried to avoiding suffering,

243
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,700
yet they endured the Eight Sufferings in the end.

244
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,740
Your memory is quite clear.

245
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,180
You're different from others.

246
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:03,080
You're a demon... yet you love mortal things.

247
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You didn't expect demons like me to have lofty ambitions, right?

248
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,360
Seven Star Deity Jade.

249
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,620
You came to the Consort's Tomb for this, didn't you?

250
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,020
It was only a question. I'm not trying to take it. You're so petty.

251
00:20:53,660 --> 00:21:00,880
Qi Hu, Qi Niu, Qi Bao, Miss Jin, and other unsung brothers, rest in peace.

252
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,960
Your murderer is dead.

253
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,960
Tang Zhou and I have already destroyed all the magical arrays in the Consort's Tomb.

254
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,080
No one will ever die there again.

255
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,560
In the next life, please don't risk your life for money again.

256
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,820
Just live a good life and be worry-free.

257
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,260
I have another wish!

258
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:27,260
I hope Taoist Master Tang can hear my heartfelt words!

259
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,860
In the past, I never hurt a human!

260
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,620
I have always been a very good demon!

261
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:38,420
But I hope I can strive to be an even better demon in the future!

262
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:42,720
Why don't you speak louder so all the gods and Buddha in heaven can hear you?

263
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,880
All right, Sir.

264
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,260
Take care.

265
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,200
Why did you buy jewelry?

266
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,700
Do you really have a fiancée? Will you give this to her?

267
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,400
Give me your hand.

268
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,000
Why?

269
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,700
I am called "Bai Piaoliang" because I am both fair and beautiful.

270
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,800
People do find it hard to resist me.

271
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,400
However, humans and demon are not the same.

272
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,800
Also, you're a demon catcher.

273
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,800
I am just a little demon.

274
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,400
- I shouldn't...
- Shut up.

275
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,000
Shut up.

276
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,000
You may leave now.

277
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,800
Really?

278
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,500
I'm free to leave?

279
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,300
Taoist Master Tang, you really do live up to your name.

280
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,200
You have an extraordinary demeanor! Farewell!

281
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,600
Three.

282
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,600
What happened? What did you do to me?

283
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,400
Save your energy. Stay within three steps from me.

284
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,600
I used my Distance-Keeping Lock on this bracelet.

285
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,000
You can only take the steps I dictate.

286
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,800
Don't even think about removing it. It's no use.

287
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,200
I don't believe you.

288
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,600
I do now.

289
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,000
Why are you doing this?

290
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,400
Didn't you just say you would set me free?

291
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,600
I thought about it. You are right.

292
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,000
In the future, you can set an example for more demons.

293
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,700
So you have to stay by my side a little longer to learn from me by example.

294
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,700
No! I don't want to! I don't like this.

295
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,600
Based on your daily performance, I'll adjust the number of steps.

296
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,200
Conduct yourself well.

297
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,560
<i>[Jun Yue Inn]</i>

298
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,100
Your Highness.

299
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,100
Your Highness, the elites we sent all perished.

300
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,400
But we did obtain this.

301
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,800
Incompetent fools!

302
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,200
I apologize.

303
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,000
I can't delay anymore.

304
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I must go there myself.

305
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,700
Living Deity! Living Deity!

306
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,600
I was wrong. Really, I was wrong.

307
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,200
I definitely won't ever badmouth you behind your back again.

308
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,100
Consider my hard work. Please have a heart.

309
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,400
Ten steps.

310
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,800
Can I have ten steps?

311
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,200
If not ten, how about eight steps? Eight steps is okay, right?

312
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,000
How about this?

313
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Let's seal the deal. Five steps.

314
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,700
Five, okay?

315
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,300
The little girl is hardworking. She simply wants to read some books.

316
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,600
You should agree.

317
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,800
I'll buy it for her if you won't.

318
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,400
Thank you, Sir. But there's no need, really.

319
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,500
I wouldn't be able to reach it anyway.

320
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,200
Do you like reading that much?

321
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,000
Then copy the "Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment."

322
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,400
If you do it well, maybe I'll consider changing the number of steps.

323
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,100
No problem.

324
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,400
Sure. Copy a book?

325
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
I can even do it ten times!

326
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,800
Here. Please have some water.

327
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,400
Enjoy.

328
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,000
<i>Go ahead and torture me.</i>

329
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,200
<i>I'll make you taste that pain in your heart.</i>

330
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,400
<i>Even though I can't defeat you,</i>

331
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,300
<i>I know that you keep the Seven Star Deity Jade that you desire in here.</i>

332
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,400
Felt enough?

333
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,800
You naughty little demon.

334
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,900
It'll be hard to indoctrinate you in merely three to five years.

335
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,300
Are you a human or a demon?

336
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,000
How do you know how to do astral projections?

337
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,600
Wait.

338
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,200
Taoist Master Tang, this is a misunderstanding.

339
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,000
It's all a misunderstanding.

340
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,300
Just now, I... I didn't want to steal from you.

341
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:15,800
I only want to see how amazing this treasure is.

342
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,300
Plus, it won't take that long to indoctrinate me.

343
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,000
At most, three to five months.

344
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,500
I'll definitely improve and mend my ways.

345
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,000
When this thing leaves my body...

346
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,000
the scars really will reappear.

347
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,600
Were you poisoned or hurt somehow?

348
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,800
How can this treasure heal your scars?

349
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,400
My injury makes my soul unstable.

350
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,700
Occasionally, my soul leaves my body at night.

351
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,200
Someone told me before... that I'm not me.

352
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,200
Only if I find the four divine tools... can I become my true self again.

353
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,800
Who on earth are you?

354
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,800
Could it be that you were a demon in the past?

355
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,000
Would you believe that I was a divine deity?

356
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,600
If you were a divine deity, then was the Queen Mother of the West.

357
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,400
If you're just healing your wound, heal it.

358
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,600
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

359
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,900
I carry the burden of the Lingxiao Sect.

360
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:42,900
My master and Sect Leader were kind to me.

361
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,000
I can only repay my sect if I stay alive.

362
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,600
You have the world and your sect in your heart.

363
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,600
You have to banish demons and devils and also look for divine tools.

364
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,300
After that, you have to find yourself too.

365
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,200
Aren't you tired?

366
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,800
I feel tired just listening to you.

367
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,700
It's true. As a human, what's most important is happiness.

368
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:09,500
It's useless to think too much about the past, present, and future.

369
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,400
I didn't expect there to be a day where a little demon would lecture me on how to be human.

370
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,500
"Little demon"?

371
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,400
You look like you're in your early twenties.

372
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,400
You're only a young man.

373
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,800
Don't judge me by my youth and beauty.

374
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,200
I'm definitely older than you.

375
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,400
I definitely have more experience than you too.

376
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,200
Listen to the advice of an older sister.

377
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,200
The future is like a dream.

378
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,200
Follow your destiny and let it be.

379
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,600
As a human, you can't torture yourself.

380
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,600
Let it go when you need to.

381
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,800
How about you set me, this cute lotus demon, free?

382
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,200
It's not time yet.

383
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,000
What's the hurry?

384
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:15,000
<i>[Lingxiao Sect]</i>

385
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:26,000
Even if you won't let me go, you don't have to take me back to your sect to risk my life.

386
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,800
You don't have a demon aura. Whether you live or die is up to you, my sworn sister.

387
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,800
What did you say? "Sworn sister"?

388
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,300
What about it?

389
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,800
The Sect Leader's birthday is approaching.

390
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:42,300
You'll get to experience the honorable sect practice and cleanse your demon heart.

391
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,300
If someone asks you anything after you go inside, you better act your part.

392
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:51,000
If something goes wrong, I won't be able to save you.

393
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,600
Senior Brother, you're finally back.

394
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,800
I know you love to eat crabs.

395
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,800
So I specially kept a few big, fat ones for you.

396
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,800
Senior Brother, who is this?

397
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,000
This is my sworn sister, who I met during my journey.

398
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,600
My name is Qin Qi. What about you?

399
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,800
Yan Dan.

400
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,100
What are you chatting about?

401
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,600
Eldest Senior Brother, how come you're back too?

402
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,000
Eldest Senior Brother.

403
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,800
The Chief will celebrate his birthday three days from now.

404
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,100
I came back especially for that.

405
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,400
It has been several days since you both left the mountain.

406
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,800
Having both of you back will definitely make the Sect Leader very happy.

407
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,000
<i>- Senior Brother Tang!
- Senior Brother Tang.</i>

408
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,400
Senior Brother Tang.

409
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
The sect brothers have missed you.

410
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,400
Please stay a little longer this time.

411
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,900
I want to ask you about a few spells.

412
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,000
<i>Eldest Senior Brother.</i>

413
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,000
Friendly feelings in the sect really make people blind.

414
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,900
- We finally have a girl on this mountain.
- Hey!

415
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,600
Aren't we girls too?

416
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:23,200
Actually, all these years, we only thought of you as our junior brothers.

417
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,400
I...

418
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,000
This is Miss Yan Dan.

419
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
She's Senior Brother Tang Zhou's sworn sister.

420
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,200
I advise each of you not to get any funny ideas.

421
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,200
I'll be taking care of her while she is here.

422
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,300
They'll accept anyone.

423
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,300
Be careful. Don't be deceived by them.

424
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,200
- I heard that Senior Brother Tang stays away from women.
- That's right.

425
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,600
Why did he accept you as his sworn sister?

426
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,400
How did you two meet?

427
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,460
It's a long story.

428
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:07,140
You can't tell by looking at me, but I was the oldest daughter of an influential family.

429
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:11,000
We encountered a mountain bandit. My whole family was killed.

430
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,420
The bandit thought I was pretty and wanted to keep me.

431
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:22,510
Just when heaven and earth had stopped listening,
<i>(T/N: everything was hopeless)</i>

432
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:26,440
who knew... Those bandit turned out to be a toad demon!

433
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,660
That toad was powerful.

434
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:33,760
My sworn brother fought long and hard to defeat the toad.

435
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,940
He sent coal during a snowstorm.
<i>(T/N: timely help)</i>

436
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:42,920
I wouldn't be able to repay his great kindness even if I worked like a horse!
<i>(T/N: Work extremely hard)</i>

437
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,900
Correct. That's how it happened.

438
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:52,000
Senior Brother, after you saved her, why didn't you find her a place to stay, instead of bringing her here?

439
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:59,520
After I bid farewell to him, that toad's remaining followers fancied me.

440
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,700
I was afraid they would seek revenge and never let me go.

441
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,700
So I begged my sworn brother to take me with him.

442
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:08,190
He saw that I was alone and helpless, with no one to rely on. So he agreed.

443
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:12,840
I became his sworn sister, and so he brought me to the sect.

444
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,620
You and Senior Brother Tang Zhou share a very similar fate.

445
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:24,720
No wonder he sympathizes with you.

446
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,580
<i>Were Tang Zhou's parents killed by evil demons?</i>

447
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:35,020
<i>I made up a story randomly. Any similarity is purely coincidental.</i>

448
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:38,400
Fate is unfair. You have suffered, Miss.

449
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,180
However, you can relax now.

450
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:46,420
Now that you are in the Lingxiao Sect, we will all protect you.

451
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,580
Thank you, Eldest Senior Brother.

452
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,900
Eldest Senior Brother, it's getting late.

453
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,440
Let's go and visit the Sect Leader.

454
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,840
He has been practicing in seclusion lately and will be out in three days.

455
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:02,180
That being the case, we should just leave the demon-trapping bottles here.

456
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,800
- Let's not disturb his practice.
- All right.

457
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,500
<i>[Yiyun Abode]</i>

458
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,140
Why the temper tantrum?

459
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,420
Are you venting your anger on a tortoise?

460
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,800
What kind of hero are you?

461
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,220
<i>Vile person. No wonder Zi Lin sleeps in a coffin.</i>

462
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:33,420
<i>How did I manage to bump into a weirdo who loves to flip tortoises?</i>

463
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:38,020
<i>In the scripts I write in the future, I'll definitely have to add a villain who flips tortoises.</i>

464
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,080
Weren't you going to "work like a horse" to repay your savior?

465
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,920
Go on. It's time to repay me.

466
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,900
We're only acting.

467
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,480
If you get too immersed in the act, you'll go crazy.

468
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:58,620
We must do the full play. Otherwise, how can anyone believe you? Right?

469
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,400
Yan Dan.

470
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,940
Wash it well!

471
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,400
Eldest Senior Brother, I will cook the crabs for my sworn brother.

472
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,620
Hurry up! Go have your dinner with the others.

473
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,600
It's fine.

474
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,900
Give it to me. You have worked hard.

475
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,780
Miss Yan Dan, you're the guest.

476
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,190
My junior brother makes you cook.

477
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,840
As your eldest senior brother, I can't be that rude.

478
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,300
- Let me do it.
- Really, it's all right.

479
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,630
- Let me do it.
- Yan Dan.

480
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:39,880
Senior Brother Tang Zhou saved you and escorted you here. You were together day and night.

481
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,000
Are you in love with him?

482
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,540
That's absolutely impossible!

483
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,660
Kindness and love are two different things.

484
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,800
Yes, yes, yes. Older brother's spells are amazing.

485
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,340
But his character is hard to describe.

486
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,460
I believe you know that too.

487
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,060
You've misunderstood older brother.

488
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:05,220
You two have a lot in common, but his past is more tragic than yours.

489
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,280
He‘s kind, but looks aloof because of that.

490
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,700
What happened to him? Does he have a story?

491
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,480
Tell me.

492
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,400
Senior Brother was an orphan ever since he was little.

493
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,980
His master brought him here to raise him when he was young.

494
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:23,600
They were master and apprentice, but they were like father and son.

495
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,840
But later, his master was murdered by a demon.

496
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,220
No one in the family was spared.

497
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,800
Since then, his temperament changed drastically.

498
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,960
He swore by his master's coffin... that he'd get rid of all evil demons.

499
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,440
He would punish evil and promote good without mercy.

500
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,480
He'd protect the Lingxiao Sect his whole life.

501
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,800
<i>So this is what caused his deep prejudice against demons.</i>

502
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,900
<i>Fortunately, I don't remember anything from my past.</i>

503
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:57,780
<i>If I had such a miserable life, I wouldn't be able to live such a carefree life.</i>

504
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:02,360
Miss Yan Dan, actually, the disciples of the Lingxiao Sect can get married.

505
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,680
Only the Sect Leader must uphold justice and be free of human desires.

506
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,720
He can't have feelings of love and needs to accomplish what others cannot.

507
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,200
So he must do what others can't.

508
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,860
Although I am the most senior one here, I'm not as hard-working as Junior Brother Tang.

509
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,520
Plus, he's very talented.

510
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,620
So everyone in the sect knows that he's the sect leader's successor.

511
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:26,780
No wonder he always stays away from women and is immune to flattery and coercion.

512
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,680
So that's how it is.

513
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,920
However, being your sect leader is way too difficult.

514
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:35,540
He's a mortal... except he is required to be like a divine deity.

515
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,600
One has to make sacrifices to uphold the right path.

516
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,460
It's ready. The duck soup is ready.

517
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,580
I'll go take it over to the Sect Leader.

518
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:59,100
Eldest Senior Brother, why don't we taste two crabs first before we send any to my sworn brother?

519
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,740
All right.

520
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:15,720
You have to dip the crab in ginger and vinegar to stay healthy even if you overeat.

521
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,520
You're so considerate, Eldest Senior Brother.

522
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,280
You and Tang Zhou don't seem like brothers at all.

523
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:27,820
Junior Brother Tang has great ambitions, while I feel at home wherever I am.

524
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:31,740
Isn't that a coincidence? Me too! Me too!

525
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,880
- Is it tasty?
- Delicious!

526
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,500
Have one more.

527
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,280
You scared me standing there!

528
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:00,880
You think you won't interact with girls when you become the sect leader.

529
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,680
You don't know how to be kind to women.

530
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,460
A lotus demon is in the Lingxiao Sect.

531
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,560
Pay attention to what you say and do.

532
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,440
Don't deceive and mislead my senior and junior brothers.

533
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,240
Who deceived them? Who misled them?

534
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,560
Don't cruelly judge the heart of a demon, all right?

535
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,520
Eldest Senior Brother is warm and concerned about me.

536
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,500
Of course, I'll respond warmly.

537
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:35,480
I won't be like you. You're aloof and disappoint people who have good intentions.

538
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,500
You must not get too close to them.

539
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,080
They do not know your identity.

540
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,900
Can you bear the responsibility if they misunderstand?

541
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:58,900
Speaking about being "too close", should we deal with that issue too?

542
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:04,020
So noisy. Peel your crabs.

543
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,460
Did I say you can eat?

544
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,380
Can't I pick my teeth?

545
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,580
<i>[Yiyun Abode]</i>

546
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,920
<i>I wonder what Yu Mo is doing right now.</i>

547
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,540
<i>I've been missing for so long. He must be worried sick right now.</i>

548
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,100
Eldest Senior Brother caught the fish for you.

549
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,220
Why are you just staring at it and not eating?

550
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:53,480
To be honest, my good friend's real form is a fish.

551
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,720
I was with him for so long that I stopped eating fish.

552
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,840
When you leave the sect, you'll miss them.

553
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,540
I have been away from my friend for so long. I miss him a lot too.

554
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,000
Plus, he doesn't know where I am right now.

555
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,580
He must be very worried about me.

556
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:11,600
Aren't you a flower spirit? Why do you have a fish friend?

557
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,320
Don't even think about escaping.

558
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,020
After you eat, bring in the books that are drying outside.

559
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,860
You ungrateful, vile person.

560
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:25,720
Since you said I'm ungrateful, don't expect me to set you free.

561
