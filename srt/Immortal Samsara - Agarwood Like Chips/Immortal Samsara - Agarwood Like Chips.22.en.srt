15
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,940
That was uncalled for!

16
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,440
It was supposed to be an act, and you actually started to fight.

17
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,400
Elegant enough for a gentleman, and lethal enough, as a weapon.

18
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,860
Advisor Lotus, you did a great job modifying this fan.

19
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,840
From now on, you'll get two extra dishes for supper. What do you think?

20
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,600
Thank you, Master.

21
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,720
Were all of you lying to me?

22
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,060
Yan Dan?

23
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:12,740
Yu Mo hitting Yan Dan was a lie, but it is true that he cherishes her a lot.

24
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,580
Therefore, they planned this entire show so you could withdraw voluntarily.

25
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:23,340
Princess Lin Lang, Mountain Chief has spoken, so I have to play along, no matter what.

26
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,140
Please don't be angry.

27
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,540
You know, until now, I have never fooled around with anyone, and I am still unmarried.

28
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:38,040
If you have to deliver your side of the promise, why don't you consider me?

29
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,580
Yan Dan saved me.

30
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,800
Even though she lied to me, she is still my savior.

31
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,900
We are in a legitimate master-servant relationship.

32
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,880
Also, we're very intimate. Please don't be a third wheel.

33
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,980
Advisor Lotus, this way.

34
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,960
Don't thank me. Really.

35
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,920
Yan Dan! Yan Dan!

36
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,920
Consider me, please.

37
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,080
Let go!

38
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,820
My savior!

39
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,760
Why are you dressed like this? What are you doing here?

40
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,300
I'm here to give you a bath.

41
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,380
- No need. I can do it myself.
- Come on.

42
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,740
- You're too kind. Really.
- Sister Yan Dan.

43
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,200
I got you a bouquet of flowers.

44
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,600
Zi Yan, why are you here?

45
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,780
I'm here to repay her kindness.

46
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,520
Me too.

47
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,140
Yan Dan. You're taking a bath at noon.

48
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,720
- Why didn't you close the door?
- I...

49
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,920
Hey, Lotus Demon!

50
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,040
Have you seen Lin Lang?

51
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,580
You're here.

52
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,200
People, please. I want to take a bath.

53
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,360
Can you show me some respect?

54
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,240
What fine weather we have today!

55
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,760
The weather is good. I must spend the day with my Advisor Lotus.

56
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,060
Don't come near her.

57
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,880
Lin Lang. I appreciate your kindness.

58
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,260
Back then, it was he who picked my disfigured self from all the flower demons.

59
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,160
He even gave me the Yanbi Pill so I could retain my demonic power.

60
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,540
Truthfully, without him, I wouldn't be standing here.

61
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,860
He is your savior, by extension.

62
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes, I can vouch for it.

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,840
When she first came, she had gray spots all over her face.

64
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,720
Heaven knows what Yu Mo liked about her.

65
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,680
Yan Dan... Is this real?

66
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,600
It is.

67
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,300
Are you lying to me again?

68
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,960
- No, we're not.
- Really.

69
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,260
Tomorrow, I'll start training in solitude.

70
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:19,100
Today, no one should disturb us.

71
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,560
Let's leave them alone.

72
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,600
Come on. Let's go. Come.

73
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,380
Yan Dan!

74
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:35,300
That entire act just now was a bit too much, but if that could persuade her to stop, it's worth it.

75
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,580
Thank you!

76
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,420
You're welcome.

77
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,880
Who are you?

78
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,860
Why won't you show yourself?

79
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,300
Who are you?

80
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,020
Why do you want to kill me?

81
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,980
Ying Yuan!

82
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,040
Ying Yuan. Ying Yuan.

83
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,110
<i>Even though his dissipating divine power has been stabilized for now,</i>

84
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:44,640
<i>I'm still not strong enough to repair His Majesty's celestial vest.</i>

85
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,940
Yan Dan gave me her flower petal!

86
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,220
Perhaps it'll help for a while.

87
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:18,020
I apologize for my late intervention. Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

88
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,140
What?

89
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,220
Tang Zhou of Lingxiao Sect.

90
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,420
Your real identity is a venerable Emperor in the Nine Heavens.

91
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,000
You are going through the Mortal Realm trials.

92
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,380
Your memory and divine power were sealed inside your celestial vest.

93
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:46,080
Your mortal vessel cannot contain divine power.

94
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,340
Someone tried to destroy the celestial vest that protects your power inside your body.

95
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,280
They want you to be killed by your dissipating divine power.

96
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:59,500
If that happens, your mortal vessel will burst open, and your divine power will be destroyed.

97
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:05,060
Not only will you be unable to return to the Heavenly Realm, but you will also cease to exist.

98
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:09,560
If I truly am an emperor, who wishes to kill me?

99
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,740
And how did you know I was in danger?

100
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:19,300
When you jumped into the Pool of Eight Hardships, I noticed a peculiar light in the water.

101
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:24,840
I found it puzzling and have been observing you every day.

102
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,040
However, my power is too weak.

103
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,440
I managed to temporarily seal your divine power back into your vest.

104
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,080
However, it won't work in the long run.

105
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,000
If you want to repair the celestial vest and stabilize your divine power,

106
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,140
you have to look for the Four Divine Tools scattered in the Mortal Realm.

107
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,880
You said we knew each other in the Heavenly Realm.

108
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,780
Tell me then,

109
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,380
why did you save me?

110
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:58,580
A good friend who saved me asked me to look after you.

111
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,820
I'm just doing my duty.

112
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,120
Overturning the Sky and Earth, transform the abstract into reality.

113
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,640
Hear me now, immortal spirit. Only the way of Tao prevails!

114
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:29,040
I'm trying to fake your divine power being destroyed, so your enemy will let his guard down.

115
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,520
Your Majesty, the locations of those divine tools will have abundant odd phenomena.

116
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,680
Trust Duster, Paper and Ink, Ground Block, and the Seven Star Deity Jade.

117
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,840
They correspond to the saying "When the war is over, life will prosper.”

118
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,060
“Without a source, one life for millennia."

119
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:51,340
Please retrieve those divine tools as soon as possible, complete the Eight Hardships, and return to the Heavenly Court.

120
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,780
I have to leave now.

121
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:19,480
<i>Only when an Emperor dies does a comet appear in the Nine Heavens in broad daylight.</i>

122
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,920
<i>Did Emperor Ying Yuan...</i>

123
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,860
During His Majesty's trial, he was injured by an evil demon.

124
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,560
His celestial vest was damaged…

125
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:39,020
and his divine power was shattered.

126
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:44,360
He is gone, leaving no trace of his body.

127
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,700
My condolences, Your Supreme Majesty.

128
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:02,800
<i>Due to my lack of judgment, I was separated from my sister and His Majesty was killed.</i>

129
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,820
<i>I wouldn't be able to atone for it, even if I died a hundred times.</i>

130
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,680
In your solitude training this time, you lost more spiritual power than before.

131
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,860
I have infused these petals with my vital essence so that you'll recover quicker.

132
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:07,680
No matter how warm the water is, or how beautiful the petals are, nothing can compare to your egg fried rice.

133
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,920
Yu Mo, why do you have so many scars on your hands?

134
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,900
I never noticed them before. Where did you get them?

135
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,320
They are just scratches.

136
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,200
Don't worry about it.

137
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,880
The Yanbi Pill you gave me can remove these scars.

138
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,680
Why did you give it to me instead of taking it yourself?

139
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,100
No one will see the scars on my hands.

140
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,480
So I don't care about them.

141
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,340
Besides, don't you care more about your appearance, Bai Piaoliang?

142
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,720
Yanbi Pill is more important to you.

143
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,520
Am I wrong?

144
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,120
Thank you, Yu Mo.

145
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,860
My current divine power is too weak to get rid of those scars for you.

146
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:52,880
However, I believe that, in this vast world, I'll find a better way to remove your scars someday.

147
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,900
Yu Mo! Something bad has happened.

148
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,160
I just received news of an uprising within the Fox Clan.

149
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,560
Lin Lang's father is imprisoned and in danger.

150
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,560
What should we do?

151
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,940
Intervene, of course.

152
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,540
Gather the Wolf Clan and the Avian Clan.

153
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,600
Ask the Aquatic Clan to guard the mountain.

154
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,540
Zi Yan is their heir. We can't put him in any danger.

155
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,580
I'll get change now. You go first.

156
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,040
All right.

157
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,820
Yu Mo, you can't go now.

158
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,700
You're too weak. It's like giving your life away.

159
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:26,100
Don't worry. I've absorbed your vital essence.

160
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,260
I'm fine now.

161
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,860
You take care of everyone, and I take care of you.

162
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,580
Either way, you have to stay here until this incense burns out.

163
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,140
I appreciate this, Advisor Lotus.

164
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,660
But Zi Lin and Lin Lang are in danger now.

165
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,420
What if something bad happens to them?

166
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,820
I need to assess the situation. Every second counts.

167
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,080
I can't delay it any further!

168
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,720
How about this? It'll take some time to gather everyone.

169
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,660
Why don't you stay here until then?

170
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,740
Conflict is inevitable when you want to suppress a revolt.

171
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,440
The more you've recovered, the more likely you are to win. Right?

172
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:16,520
Here, take this.

173
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,810
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

174
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,360
One meat bun, and one vegetable bun.

175
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,040
Sure. Please wait for a moment.

176
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,580
Where are my buns?

177
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,220
Where are the buns I just steamed? Where are my buns?

178
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,320
What's going on?

179
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,540
Where did they go?

180
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,060
I was still hungry after breakfast.

181
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,520
Fortunately, a stupid Taoist Master let me steal his meal.

182
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,560
You can't come in here.

183
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,920
You're just a dog with no demon cultivation.

184
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,980
All you can do is bark at me!

185
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,460
You… Let me go!

186
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:27,040
Thanks to you, I found the hideout of Flower Spirit Clan.

187
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:34,200
Remember this. Pay for your own meals. Don't steal.

188
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,120
Grandpa, there's a demon catcher here! Run!

189
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,380
Don't worry.

190
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,300
I'll take your entire family with me.

191
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,820
I won't separate your family. All right?

192
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,300
That demon catcher is a scary one.

193
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,820
Fortunately, this forest is dense and provides good cover.

194
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,200
That person is not familiar with this place. Our leader did his best to buy us some time.

195
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,100
That's how the others and I managed to escape.

196
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,320
Unbelievable!

197
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,200
Our Flower Spirit Clan never harms anyone. Why is he hunting us?

198
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,140
Yan Dan, I heard you're Mountain Chief's concubine.

199
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,640
He listens to you.

200
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,020
If you talk to him, he'll help us.

201
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,040
The Flower Spirit Clan is counting on you.

202
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:19,700
Since everyone relies on me, I have decided. I'll go to help.

203
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,460
The Tribe Chief risked his life so I could ask Mountain Chief to intervene.

204
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,820
Not you.

205
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,760
Both mountain chiefs are now dealing with the uprising within the Fox Clan.

206
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,820
No one knows when they'll return.

207
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,800
Don't worry. I've been with Mountain Chief for more than a decade.

208
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,620
This is easy.

209
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,540
Besides, we outnumber him.

210
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:44,080
He's just a mortal. He can't fight us.

211
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,480
This is my plan.

212
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,840
You will stay here to treat your injury.

213
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,360
If Mountain Chief returns before I do, tell him to save me. Understood?

214
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,980
Look. Behind this mountain is the territory of the Three-tailed Snow Foxes.

215
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:15,180
My father trusted Xue Tu, but he usurped my father's throne when I took Zi Yan out for treatment.

216
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,740
I wonder if my father is all right.

217
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,860
Is he in danger?

218
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,800
<i>Quiet, now. Don't let him hear us.</i>

219
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,700
Tribe Chief, we'll stay here.

220
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,240
You should retreat now.

221
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,180
The Flower Spirit Clan will not forget your sacrifice.

222
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,020
Tribe Chief! I'm here to save you.

223
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,800
Is Mountain Chief Yu Mo here? Where is he?

224
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,960
Mountain Chief Yu Mo is busy. I'll deal with it.

225
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,320
Don't worry. This is my plan.

226
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,040
Don't let everyone hide in the same place.

227
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,820
Their dense demonic aura is too noticeable.

228
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,660
Split up and get out of the forest.

229
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,220
Seek refuge in Yelan Mountain. I will hold him off.

230
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:16,740
Remember, if you manage to escape, light fireworks. Okay?

231
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,920
Move!

232
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:23,560
Wait! Listen, you don't know how strong the demon catcher is.

233
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,500
You may be smart, but none of us can fight him.

234
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,520
We're all about to meet our doom here!

235
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,700
Have you forgotten? I don't have any demonic aura.

236
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,740
A demon catcher only catches demons.

237
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,840
They don't catch humans.

238
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:01,540
<i>This silhouette... it's just like the person in my dream. </i>

239
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,200
- If you come closer, I'll kill her!
- Help! Help!

240
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,360
If you release her, you will be spared.

241
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,940
If you kill her, you will surely die.

242
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,680
He's lying. I'm here. He won't do anything.

243
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,220
Just say the lines. Say it!

244
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,880
Make sure you sound scary. Say it now!

245
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,700
I don't believe you!

246
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,580
Flower Spirit Clan never harms anyone. Do you really need to eliminate us?

247
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,420
I really will kill her if you come any closer!

248
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,260
I think he's serious.

249
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,060
Hit me now. Hit me. Hit me.

250
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,540
As hard as you can. Hit me.

251
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:37,000
Thank you for rescuing me, Taoist Master. Many thanks.

252
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,660
The forest where the flower demons reside has a barrier.

253
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,240
How can a mere mortal like you enter?

254
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,060
My name is Bai Piaoliang.

255
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:49,580
Two months ago, my father died from an illness.

256
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,660
I sold myself so that I could bury my father.

257
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:56,840
I met a gentleman, and he brought me here.

258
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:01,350
I thought he would look after me,

259
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:06,640
but the night before my wedding, I realized he was a flower demon.

260
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,560
His friends are all flower demons.

261
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,040
He forced me to marry him.

262
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,460
But I'm a mortal. I can't marry a demon!

263
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,600
Naturally, I refused.

264
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,700
Now that you're safe, I'll escort you out of the mountain after I capture them.

265
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,800
Can you spare them?

266
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:33,080
You were detained here, and that demon wanted to kill you.

267
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,160
Why are you protecting them?

268
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:42,560
Actually, I was just upset. Those were only angry words.

269
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,010
That male flower demon is treating me quite well.

270
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:51,650
Even though he keeps me in the mountain, he is deeply in love and courteous to me.

271
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:54,600
He never forces me to do anything I don't want to do.

272
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,140
And those female flower demons look just like me.

273
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,820
They don't hurt anyone either.

274
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,960
That demon from just now was the clan leader. He did that because he was desperate.

275
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,440
I understand him.

276
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,860
I can vouch for their kindness. They never hurt anyone. Really.

277
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,380
Enough.

278
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:12,700
Forced confinement is wrong, either way.

279
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,860
Besides, you were stuck in the mountain.

280
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,000
How would you know if they've hurt anyone outside the mountain?

281
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,340
You can't repay their cruelty with kindness.

282
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,820
This is why you're a Taoist Master.

283
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:29,540
Your perception and worldview are eye-opening.

284
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:32,800
I was being too sentimental just now.

285
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,720
In that case, let me help you find them.

286
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,380
- I know this place very well.
- All right.

287
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,040
Come on.

288
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,240
You go that way. You go this way.

289
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,860
You three, go that way. Hurry!

290
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,240
<i>She said she would show me the way, but she's taking me in the wrong direction.</i>

291
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,180
<i>Is she a flower demon spy?</i>

292
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,300
Taoist Master, what happened to your hand?

293
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,840
None of your business. Just lead the way.

294
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,420
Sure.

295
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,700
<i>Do you want to test me?</i>

296
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,040
<i>I'll make this journey even longer.</i>

297
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,180
<i>You won't be able to leave the Forest of Hidden Flower Mountain even after nightfall.</i>

298
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,720
Taoist Master Tang, why are you standing there?

299
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,980
Help me. Look how swollen my foot is!

300
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,040
It's inappropriate for a man to touch a woman.

301
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,740
Seriously?

302
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,000
You're a Taoist Master. Do you care about those rules?

303
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,380
I hate being in pain.

304
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,880
If this worsens, it'll become so swollen, like a pig's hoof.

305
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:28,860
You don't even have a tender heart for women. Will you stand and do nothing?

306
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,780
I didn't expect you to be so well-educated.

307
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:38,000
Of course! I might come from a modest background, but my family is highly educated.

308
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,360
I also aspire to be the best scriptwriter in this world.

309
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,460
"Educated," you say.

310
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,260
Why did they give you a silly name like Bai Piaoliang?

311
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,140
My family is bad with names.

312
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,660
I have a cousin. His name is Yu Heitu.

313
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,220
Come here.

314
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,860
Lin Lang.

315
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,420
Father! How dare they do that to my father?

316
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,820
Beware of traps!

317
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,020
Father!

318
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,460
Snow Flame Array?

319
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,660
This is my clan's strongest spell.

320
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,600
Once you're in it, even if you don't die, your skin will be severely burnt.

321
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,800
I need to wake my father. He can break this spell.

322
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,060
You expended too much of your power when you healed Zi Yan.

323
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,540
It's okay. Let me help you!

324
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,400
No! The spell is getting stronger.

325
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:16,400
I'm afraid my father's demonic essence will burn out before he wakes up.

326
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:20,260
Yu Mo! Yu Mo's element is water. Can you bring him here?

327
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,140
He's fighting Xue Tu.

328
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,740
Don't worry. Let me save you.

329
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,520
What are you doing?

330
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,660
This is my demonic essence.

331
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,420
Why is yours different from ours?

332
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:48,780
I haven't tried it before, but it might extinguish this flame.

333
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:04,720
Zi Lin! Zi Lin!

334
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,620
Father.

335
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,380
Your element is metal.

336
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:32,040
Fire counters metal. How did you break the spell?

337
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,660
Real metal isn't afraid of fire.

338
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:37,300
As I said, I'm the mountain chief. I'm different from other demons.

339
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,940
See? I'm not weaker than Yu Mo.

340
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,560
Are you all right?

341
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,140
Father! Wonderful. You're awake!

342
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,660
Father!

343
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:56,100
Yelan Mountain and the Fox Clan are equals.

344
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,520
There's no need to kneel before me.

345
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,120
Get up now.

346
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,140
Father.

347
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,680
Are you okay?

348
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:14,640
My daughter, you wrote in your letters that the Yelan Mountain demons were kind to you.

349
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:21,540
Why did the Yelan Mountain Chief send an underdog to save me?

350
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:24,860
My daughter, are you injured?

351
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,320
I'm not, Father.

352
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,430
Leader of the Fox Clan, I am not usually this weak.

353
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,320
I'm like this because I saved you.

354
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,140
Lin Lang is our most esteemed guest at Yelan Mountain.

355
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:38,680
Both mountain chiefs have come to quell this revolt.

356
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,760
Both of them are here?

357
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,460
Where are they?

358
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:51,320
I am one of them! I am Zi Lin.

359
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:57,260
Yes, Father. He is one of the Yelan Mountain chiefs, Zi Lin.

360
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:00,960
He just used his power to get us out of the Snow Flame Array.

361
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,360
A frivolous mountain chief.

362
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,720
I hope Yelan Mountain is truly as good as its reputation makes it out to be.

363
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,680
Leader of the Fox Clan, you are mistaken.

364
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:16,340
On Yelan Mountain, Yu Mo and I work together to make up for each other's shortcomings.

365
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:20,240
It's all right. Soon, you'll recognize my strengths.

366
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,220
Father.

367
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,420
That's Mountain Chief Yu Mo's signal.

368
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,020
He must have subdued Xue Tu.

369
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,560
Father, let's head back and rest.

370
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,700
Father!

371
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,720
Leader of the Fox Clan. Let me carry you.

372
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,300
Come on.

373
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,100
You're very eager to please me. You must be up to something.

374
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:50,000
Tell me now. Do you like my daughter?

375
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:56,480
Leader of Fox Clan, you have to take care of clan affairs later.

376
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,880
Please rest now.

377
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,940
Besides, it's time for you to see how strong I am.

378
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:07,260
Indeed, Father. Yelan Mountain is helping Fox Clan.

379
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,300
Also, Mountain Chief Zi Lin is kind to offer his help here.

380
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,800
We shouldn't turn him down.

381
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,220
I saw you extinguish the snow flame.

382
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:19,780
Is your element water?

383
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:23,400
I wonder what your true form is.

384
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,700
My element is metal.

385
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,420
But since I hold immense demonic power, I could extinguish this flame.

386
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,920
As for my real form...

387
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,060
My origin doesn't matter. Let's forget it.

388
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:38,660
Such ambiguity. You're shady.

389
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,300
Just so you know, the Three-tailed Snow Foxes are of noble descent.

390
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:49,920
My daughter's suitor will have to be carefully selected.

391
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,980
Unlike Yelan Mountain members, who don't care about one's origin.

392
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,780
Right. Get down now.

393
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,240
- Get on, please.
- Go!

394
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:15,980
Taoist Master, I can't walk anymore.

395
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,060
Also, it's dark now.

396
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,320
Those demons must have escaped.

397
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,300
We won't be able to catch them. Why don't we rest here?

398
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,080
Demon-catching doesn't tire me.

399
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,000
Furthermore, beasts roam around at night.

400
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,260
We shouldn't stay here. Let's go.

401
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,730
You can handle the beasts.

402
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:34,780
I'm not afraid.

403
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,160
If I walk any more, I'll be a cripple.

404
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:42,080
If I become crippled, will you be able to take care of me?

405
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:47,440
Taoist Master. As you said, it's inappropriate for a man to touch a woman.

406
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,180
In this kind of situation, you can't carry me.

407
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:56,250
Besides, look how thin you are. You can't possibly be strong enough to carry me.

408
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,260
It's okay. I understand.

409
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:05,920
Taoist Master, isn't this inappropriate?

410
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,640
You talk too much.

411
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,640
All reality is fake.

412
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,300
In order to catch demons, I can ignore some taboos.

413
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,840
That's not what you said before. You sure change your mind easily.

414
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:21,980
Also, I'm as beautiful as a flower. How can my beauty mean nothing to you?

415
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,680
I admit your beauty is quite heavy.

416
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,180
<i>Yan Dan, control yourself.</i>

417
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:34,920
<i>This is all a play that will end soon. Don't ruin the last act.</i>

418
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:32,120
<i>When the others are safe, I can finally say goodbye to this stupid Taoist Master.</i>

419
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:42,240
Taoist Master. You must have captured a lot of demons on your journey.

420
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,620
Are they all in this calabash?

421
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:49,480
All of them have to fit in this small space. Won’t it be too crowded?

422
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,980
When they fight, will they tear this calabash apart?

423
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,240
You talk too much.

424
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,960
The flower demons are a kind species indeed, for not killing you.

425
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,180
In that sense, do you have extremely evil demons in your calabash?

426
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,920
Was it difficult to capture them?

427
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,360
Were you injured?

428
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:11,600
No evil demons are as troublesome as you are.

429
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,060
I like your sense of humor!

430
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,280
- You're so funny!
- Don't—

431
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:28,280
I admit I was weak that day. But now, we have strength in numbers.

432
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,300
I'm sure all of us here can defeat you, a mere mortal.

433
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:35,880
Kill him today. Otherwise, none of you can leave. Charge!

434
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,820
- Move aside.
- Monsters!

435
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,320
Run. Escape!

436
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,040
Okay.

437
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:59,420
<i>Even though he can be pretty mean, he's still a kind person.</i>

438
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:03,220
<i>If he dies here, I'll have to carry the guilt forever.</i>

439
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:20,100
Taoist Master Tang! My lotus petal can heal your wounds.

440
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,380
If you can't defeat them, just flee. Don't force yourself!

441
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:26,060
Let's not meet again. Farewell!

442
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,440
Run!

443
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,300
I will remember you. Bai Piaoliang, the lotus demon.

444
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,400
I made this Butterfly Lantern.

445
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,680
I captured all the butterflies in it on my own.

446
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,120
Isn't it beautiful?

447
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,920
Yes.

448
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:47,580
If you like it, you can have it.

449
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,980
You want to give it to me？

450
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,360
I can't take it.

451
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:56,260
You helped me enough yesterday. I cannot accept something so precious from you.

452
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,600
But I made it myself.

453
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,260
If you refuse this gift…

454
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,580
Just take it.

455
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,340
No, you should keep it.

456
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,860
- Take it. If you don't take it—
- No, you keep it.

457
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,260
Look!

458
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:55,720
It's so pretty!

459
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,560
I didn't mean to break the lantern.

460
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,560
I'll find those butterflies again.

461
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,020
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

462
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:28,540
Like I said, I want you to be happy.

463
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,030
Thank you.

464
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,420
Come here.

465
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,960
Master!

466
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,160
You worked hard to quell the uprising in the Fox Clan.

467
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,820
Let me deal with everything else.

468
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,460
Let me impress Lin Lang.

469
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:04,360
I already said I don't care about you two.

470
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:08,100
Just tell me why you brought me here.

471
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:13,960
Someone wants to apologize to you. She asked me to bring you here.

472
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:20,440
If she truly wants to apologize to me, she would have come here herself.

473
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:26,060
What if she wants to, but she's unable to come here?

474
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,100
Unable to come here?

475
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:41,620
Master. You always said you would bury me.

476
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,660
Now I've buried myself.

477
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:47,120
After you water me, will you stop being angry?

478
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,180
Will you forgive me for leaving without permission?

479
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:59,980
The fifth day of May is the day when human energy is strongest in Mortal Realm.

480
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,680
It is also the toughest day for all demons.

481
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:06,820
You have always been weak, but you refused to recuperate in the mountain.

482
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,620
You left this place and overworked yourself.

483
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:12,480
If you were injured, you'd come crying to me for help.

484
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,900
I'd have to use my divine power on you again.

485
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:18,560
And if you die, who will deal with the contract we signed?

486
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,880
Do you get it?

487
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:26,060
From now on, no matter what happens, you cannot leave without a message.

488
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:29,120
Yes. You're right, Master.

489
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:33,100
You're always right. I won't do this again.

490
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,480
Master, you can punish me.

491
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,040
But if you starve yourself while doing it, it won't be worth it.

492
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,420
If you're not angry with me anymore, let me cook for you.

493
