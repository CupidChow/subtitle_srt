<i>The depth and peculiarity of his techniques are hard to find in this world.</i>

16
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,880
<i>Even Tang Zhou and I have a hard time fighting him.</i>

17
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,720
<i>How come Liu Weiyang, though still not powerful, can go toe-to-toe against him?</i>

Ying Yuan.

19
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,640
Yan Dan.

20
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,280
None of you would have expected...

21
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,880
that one day, I could get out of my petrification.

22
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,780
<i>If someone dispels the petrification mist surrounding the petrified ones</i>

23
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,740
<i>within 49 days, the victim shall regain freedom.</i>

24
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,480
<i>Unfortunately, due to prolonged petrification...</i>

25
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,040
<i>this leg of mine can never recover.</i>

26
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,340
All the mist here is gone.

27
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,720
Something must have happened to the devils.

28
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,240
I was a fairy in the Heaven Realm...

29
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,800
but the emperor tried to kill me

30
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,320
and yet I was saved by the devils.

31
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,500
What a laughable irony!

32
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,920
Since heaven helped me...

33
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,760
Ying Yuan.

34
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,460
Yan Dan.

35
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,720
I'll make sure you pay the price for what you did.

36
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,920
Yan Dan.

37
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,220
Yan Dan!

38
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,520
Careful!

39
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,780
Young Master, you're finally awake.

40
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,600
Why am I here?

41
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,260
Why am I back here?

42
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,320
Fu Shuang brought you back.

43
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,180
She said you and Palace Master fainted in the Illusion of Devils.

44
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,340
Both of you were brought back to Indulgence House.

45
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,720
I was given the task to take care of you.

46
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,720
No need! Look at me.

47
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,360
I'm as healthy as a horse. You can get back to your work.

48
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,520
Young Master.

49
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,200
- It's okay. I can handle it myself.
- Yu Mo. Yu Mo!

50
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,820
How are you? How is your injury?

51
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,780
Advisor Lotus, you came at a perfect time.

52
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,480
I'm having an unbearable pain.

53
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,680
I need you to take care of me.

54
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,340
Master, don't you worry.

55
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,500
We'll take good care of you.

56
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,200
"We"?

57
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,100
Suddenly, I feel good now.

58
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,380
See? I can even sit up.

59
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,620
Indeed, you're much better.

60
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,760
Let's talk business, then.

61
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:54,160
After Yan Dan and I got the divine tool, before we left the palace... a mysterious force took us out.

62
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,480
When we awoke, we were back in Indulgence House.

63
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,180
Tell us. What happened out there?

64
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:07,060
When we were fighting, Liu Weiyang almost saw the face of the mysterious man.

65
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:12,120
However, that person exploded and released a massive amount of spiritual power.

66
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,860
I'm as clueless as you about what happened after that.

67
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:22,080
Devilish beasts and a powerful mysterious man are roaming in the Illusion of Devils.

68
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,040
Does this have anything to do with the Devil Clan?

69
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,500
<i>If that's the case, I'll get to the bottom of it as it concerns the death of my master.</i>

70
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,800
We have to investigate this!

71
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,440
This shall be the new chapter of my journal regarding immortal adventures.

72
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,820
Sure!

73
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,820
I'll tag along.

74
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,960
Why? Weren't you here for Truth Duster?

75
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,040
You already have it.

76
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,740
You even chanced upon the third divine tool in the Illusion of Devils.

77
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,900
You have what you came for. Why are you still following us?

78
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:03,760
If the Devil Clan is wreaking havoc in the Mortal Realm, as a disciple of the Lingxiao Sect, I have to intervene.

79
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,380
I have to investigate it, too.

80
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,440
We're looking more and more like a team.

81
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,940
Although we have different goals, we're heading in the same direction.

82
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,560
On our journey, we practice heroism.

83
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,960
I'll write these tales in my journal.

84
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,960
Mortals and demons work together to protect the world.

85
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,540
It'll be a bestseller!

86
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,120
I wonder who would read that.

87
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,380
- I will.
- Enjoy it, then.

88
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,080
Enough. Stop mocking her.

89
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:38,240
Besides, the array within the Illusion of Devils didn't look like the work of the Heaven Realm.

90
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,480
In the palace, the mysterious person said to Liu Weiyang, "You're back."

91
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,300
This means that they know each other.

92
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,720
He claimed that his memory would return upon entering the Illusion of Devils.

93
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,260
But then, so many things have happened.

94
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,600
We shall see if he's an ally or an enemy.

95
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,200
Where is your Palace Master? I'm looking for him.

96
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,740
He felt unwell inside the Illusion of Devils and is resting now.

97
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,340
He doesn't wish to see anyone.

98
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,960
Is that so? What sickness does he have?

99
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:23,160
We have the potent medications from the Demon Realm and the special regimen of the Lingxiao Sect.

100
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,580
Whatever diseases your Palace Master has, maybe he'll recover after we have a look.

101
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,600
Does he simply not want to see us or does he dare not to see us?

102
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,540
Since Palace Master said he doesn't want to see anyone,

103
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,620
regardless of your reasons, you will not be allowed in.

104
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,460
Please return.

105
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,080
You're very bold, indeed.

106
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,840
What if we just barge in?

107
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:53,400
Although both of you are powerful, this is Shenxiao Palace's territory.

108
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,700
If you wish to fight, I will gladly oblige.

109
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,660
That's the fang of the Nine-Tailed Hydra. Watch out!

110
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,100
Kill me now and he will die, too.

111
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,780
The toxin is within him.

112
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,880
Even though the wound has closed, the toxin has entered his body.

113
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,740
Without due treatment, his arm will be gone.

114
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,060
I'm fine.

115
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:36,520
Liu Weiyang. Why should we believe your words?

116
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,640
The Nine-Tailed Hydra is a venomous creature of the Three Realms.

117
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,660
If it bites you, your flesh and skin will rot.

118
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,040
The toxin within you can only be extracted by its fangs.

119
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,900
How do you know about this?

120
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:05,780
You must have regained your memory. Otherwise, you wouldn't be this strong.

121
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,180
Speak now. Who are you?

122
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,690
I lived in ignorance for several decades.

123
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:21,940
Now that I was given the truth... I only feel pain and no joy.

124
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:26,360
I'm also utterly confused. Can you give me some time alone?

125
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:34,180
All of you have helped me, so I will definitely repay you.

126
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:40,320
Once I sort out my past, I'll tell you what you want to know.

127
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,480
The toxin within your body has once been extracted.

128
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,580
I spent three years of my power to concoct this antidote.

129
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,220
Apply it to your skin and you shall be healed.

130
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,830
His techniques were the same as that of the mysterious man in the Illusion of Devils.

131
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,320
It is very suspicious.

132
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,180
That said, I admit that I underestimated him.

133
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,770
Liu Weiyang was telling the truth. The antidote was very effective.

134
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,180
It countered all the toxins in your body.

135
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:28,130
If he is an enemy, why did he give you the antidote?

136
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,970
Whether he is an ally or an enemy,

137
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:35,940
he's cunning and we cannot trust him before learning the truth.

138
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,000
Since the Illusion of Devils was found on Zhucui Mountain,

139
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,280
the local Soil Guardian should know something about it.

140
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:49,800
We'll investigate at night. Hopefully we'll find something.

141
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,300
Really?

142
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,700
Every demon here shares this belief.

143
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,180
I also went through the Pavilion of Books and found relevant information.

144
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:08,030
It says that demons with tails will wag their tails when they encounter individuals

145
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:12,560
or creatures that they like.

146
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,000
Don't you believe me?

147
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,220
You said there would be food. Where is it?

148
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,440
You're right!

149
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,800
In that case, I have a way to tell if Lin Lang is fond of me.

150
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,800
Bai Ling, you're a great help!

151
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,760
You know what? I'll take care of all avian demons' laborious tasks from now on.

152
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:55,220
That said, she is fiercely protective of Zi Yan. How did you get him here?

153
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:00,600
For some reason, Lin Lang is nowhere to be found tonight.

154
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,920
My sister disappears for one day every sixty years.

155
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,520
I'm already used to it.

156
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,140
"Sixty years"?

157
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:17,960
The sexagenary cycle is a cycle of sixty terms where Yin and Yang interchange.

158
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,600
Three-tailed Snow Foxes are naturally fond of the cold, and female foxes contain more Yin.

159
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,480
During the night of a full moon when Yin is the most present,

160
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,960
they will be greatly weakened and might even revert partially to their original body.

161
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,080
Is that tonight?

162
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,500
Hang in there, Lin Lang. For the honor of your clan.

163
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,280
<i>Lin Lang!</i>

164
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,040
- Why is he here?
- <i>Where are you?</i>

165
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,300
- He's probably here because he has heard about the tail wagging rumor.
<i>- Lin Lang!</i>

166
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,950
He's here to find out my feelings.

167
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,220
No! I can't let him see me in this state.

168
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,420
I know you're here!

169
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,860
Lin Lang! You're weak tonight.

170
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,860
You'll be in danger. I'm here to protect you.

171
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,660
Stop pretending!

172
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,560
You just want to see my tails. Go away! I won't come out!

173
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,300
Don't come near me!

174
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,920
I'm the Yelan Mountain Chief. I won't take advantage of you.

175
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,680
You know what? I'll turn around.

176
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,840
I won't see anything.

177
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,280
See?

178
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,250
Close your eyes, too.

179
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,780
Turn around.

180
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,940
Done.

181
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:16,640
I'm telling you now. When I come out, you cannot take a peek.

182
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,600
Did you hear me?

183
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,680
Are you here to check on my tails?

184
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,360
Of course not!

185
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,740
See? I'm here to give you some medicine.

186
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,400
I don't know what the Fox Clan usually uses as medicine so I got some from the demon's apothecary.

187
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,850
You'll find soothing herbs, demon-stabilizing broth, nutritious tortoise shells, and qi-condensing pills.

188
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:56,640
They can help you survive the night for sure.

189
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,060
Should I hand them to you?

190
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:04,320
- Don't come near me!
- I won't turn around. I won't.

191
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,180
I can feel the immense demonic power from the tortoise shell.

192
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,780
It must be from a millennial tortoise demon.

193
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,570
I've never heard of such a demon.

194
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,780
Where did you get it?

195
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,800
From the apothecary. It might be the physician's private collection.

196
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,100
- Don't worry. As long as I'm here tonight...
- Careful!

197
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,680
Lin Lang. Are you okay?

198
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,680
I'm fine.

199
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,200
Did you see them?

200
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,590
It's cold today and your body is weak.

201
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:34,120
I'll find you some firewood to keep you warm.

202
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:07,600
Palace Master, you have successfully entered the Illusion of Devils and have regained your power.

203
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,400
Why are you frowning?

204
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:15,260
Back then, I was troubled by my amnesia.

205
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:21,800
Now it is cured, but it generated thousands of worries.

206
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,980
My wish is unfulfilled... and my pain is unabated.

207
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,420
Just this once, let me do as I wish.

208
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:35,220
It seems like Liu Weiyang was telling the truth.

209
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,720
He's not feeling well.

210
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,520
This talisman only lasts for the time it takes one incense stick to burn.

211
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,620
Should we leave or show ourselves?

212
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,230
He said his wish was unfulfilled.

213
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:53,460
If we can fulfill his wish, will he tell us what is going on?

214
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,790
Look how defeated he is.

215
00:21:55,790 --> 00:22:00,780
Even if we interrogate him, I doubt he'll open up to us.

216
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,360
We should investigate on our own.

217
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:19,050
I'm excited to meet a deity for the first time! Do you think the deity is as elegant and graceful as the ones in novels?

218
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,740
Dispel.

219
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,280
Who summoned me?

220
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,660
I'm a disciple of the Lingxiao Sect.

221
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:41,600
I'm passing by here on my demon-catching journey and wish to consult the annals of Zhucui Town.

222
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,440
Do you have any offerings?

223
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,770
We rushed here and forgot to bring offerings with us.

224
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:51,320
Please excuse us. We will bring extra offerings next time.

225
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:57,040
A young human Taoist has no right to seek a deity's favor.

226
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,860
I won't help you.

227
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:05,560
You don't look like a proper deity. You don't look as good and are frankly quite materialistic, too.

228
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,660
That's so different from how the novels portray them.

229
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,220
Insolent mortals. How dare you make fun of a deity!

230
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:19,160
You're just a local guardian, but you have a haughty attitude.

231
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,520
Even a greater god from the Nine Heavens does not behave like you.

232
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,980
Fine. You won't entertain a mortal. What about a demon like me?

233
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:34,240
If you won't lend me the annals, I will burn your mustache.

234
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,500
A demon? I perform my duty in earnest and follow the rules.

235
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,210
I am not afraid of a demon like you!

236
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,760
I am innocent and have done no wrong.

237
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,280
Deities in the Heavenly Realm, I seek justice from you!

238
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,080
Stop shouting already!

239
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,700
What I want to say is that we were indeed too rude.

240
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,800
Forgive our intrusion.

241
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:03,300
You know what? To make amends, why don't you allow me treat you to something enjoyable?

242
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,300
What do you think?

243
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,100
For a liquor this divine,

244
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:30,900
the mortals are willing to commit a crime.

245
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,600
Such poetic words! Very poetic!

246
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,800
You sure are very eloquent.

247
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,600
How admirable.

248
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,700
Come. A toast for your literary talent.

249
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,600
Okay. Come.

250
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,400
Cheers.

251
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,800
You are truly exceptional, Divine Deity.

252
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,700
Even your alcohol tolerance is exceptional.

253
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,200
You're one of a kind!

254
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,600
Come. Another toast to you!

255
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,800
- Sure. Let's drink again.
- Here.

256
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,800
Sir, finish this glass, and you'll live a long life.

257
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,100
Cheers.

258
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,800
A long life...

259
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,000
What a good drinker you are!

260
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,200
That's great, Sir.

261
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,000
- Another glass.
- I can't.

262
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,300
Sir?

263
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,500
Sir? Sir?

264
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,800
He's out.

265
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,800
You demons sure are a sly bunch.

266
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,900
No wonder they warn us against the words of demons.

267
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:43,400
Yan Dan did the right thing. If your legal, virtuous method had worked, we wouldn't have had to use our way.

268
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,800
I found the divine tool that keeps the annals.

269
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,300
<i>[The devils sought refuge here after the loss suffered during the war.]</i>

270
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,900
Look! It's here.

271
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,400
<i>[Zhucui Town, Zhucui Mountain, previously owned by the Devil Clan]</i>

272
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,200
So Zhucui Mountain used to be the devils' territory.

273
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,660
It says here,

274
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:45,400
"The Devil King sealed the source of the power of the Devil Clan in Zhucui Mountain."

275
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,600
Do you think this power refers to the Illusion of Devils?

276
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:54,300
Perhaps the powerful individual inside the Illusion of Devils is the Devil King.

277
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,400
If the Illusion of Devils comes from the Devil Clan, how can Liu Weiyang absorb its power?

278
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:08,400
The mysterious man in the Illusion of Devils is also out of our league, even when we fight him together.

279
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,310
Yet Liu Weiyang went head-to-head against him.

280
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:14,520
After he came out from the Illusion of Devils, he became much stronger

281
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,100
and could use the same tricks as the mysterious man.

282
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:23,600
If he's a devil, then everything can be explained.

283
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,100
But if Liu Weiyang truly is from the Devil clan, why did he help us out of the Illusion of Devils?

284
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,200
Why did he give you the antidote?

285
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,410
Since Liu Weiyang is upset, why not get him drunk?

286
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,880
One of us can try to get him to reveal something

287
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,600
while another can scout his residence to look for some clues.

288
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,840
He's avoiding us because he is wary of us.

289
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,400
How can you get him drunk?

290
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,600
Tell him there's a liquor that can fulfill his wish and solve his troubles.

291
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,400
And allow him drown his sorrows away.

292
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,600
- What liquor is that?
- There is a liquor called As Desired.

293
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,000
It's made from the root of a lotus.

294
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,200
Once you drink it, you'll see what you desire in your dream exactly as you'd like it.

295
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,300
And I happen to know how to brew it.

296
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,000
Where will you find a lotus root?

297
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,200
Look.

298
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,700
That day in the desert, you created a root to save Tang Zhou.

299
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:22,000
There was one broken piece and I have kept it till now.

300
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,400
Who would have thought that my root can be used to brew liquor?

301
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,500
Who taught you this?

302
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:32,500
Someone who had a lot of wishes and who always used liquor to have her wishes fulfilled.

303
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,100
If you want the recipe, I can give it to you.

304
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,800
Sure.

305
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:07,300
<i>To increase my power... within the shortest time frame,</i>

306
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,000
<i>I have to rely on extreme measures.</i>

307
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:18,400
<i>The flower demons will only have Yan Dan to blame for their suffering.</i>

308
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,300
Who are you? Why did you come to the land of the Flower Spirit Clan?

309
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,000
You are flower spirit demons?

310
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,600
Yes.

311
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,200
I am Yan Dan's friend.

312
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,700
I was heavily injured by a villain.

313
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,600
Grandpa. It is Yan Dan's petal.

314
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,800
Indeed.

315
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:16,000
Yan Dan said she has insufficient power to cure my condition.

316
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,400
She said that the flower spirit demons were kind and generous.

317
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:28,500
She said they would help me and gave me this petal, so I could come here to get treated and be protected.

318
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:33,900
Yan Dan single-handedly saved us from the hands of a Taoist.

319
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,600
We owe her a favor. Come.

320
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,800
Bring her in and treat her wound.

321
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,600
<i>Yes, Sir</i>

322
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,400
Come, Grandpa.

323
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,940
Miss.

324
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,000
Careful.

325
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,200
Grandpa...

326
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,600
Grandpa.

327
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,100
Grandpa.

328
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,200
Grandpa.

329
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,600
How are you, Grandpa?

330
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,400
Why did you attack us?

331
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,900
I wouldn't be here if not for Yan Dan.

332
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:59,200
Blame Yan Dan for everything.

333
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,200
You're a mortal but you swallowed my demonic essence.

334
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,600
Aren't you afraid of turning into a demon? Or if it backfires on you?

335
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,200
I want to turn into a demon.

336
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:19,400
Only then can I become stronger.

337
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,400
"Backfiring"? That's nothing.

338
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:28,600
I have experienced worse.

339
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,000
My child. Tell everyone to run.

340
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Run!

341
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,800
No. No, Grandpa.

342
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,400
Thank you.

343
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,200
Yu Mo, teach me a fire spell.

344
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:11,600
I know the flower demons are wood-based, and it'll be difficult for us to study fire-based techniques.

345
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,400
But this spell is very practical.

346
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,100
I don't want to be protected by anyone.

347
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:19,200
I want to protect those who I wish to protect.

348
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,400
You didn't sleep last night.

349
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,900
The liquor will still need some before it's ready.

350
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,300
Why don't you rest first? I'll teach you later.

351
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,900
Sure.

352
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,200
At the moment, Tang Zhou has retrieved three divine tools.

353
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,400
One more left and he'll be done.

354
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:49,600
Even though the three of us are happy together, we'll split up one day.

355
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,700
You've experienced so many things in the outside world.

356
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,600
Do you still... want to return to Yelan Mountain?

357
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,400
The outside world can be beautiful, but we all have a home to return to.

358
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,400
As for that vile person...

359
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,800
Forget him.

360
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:11,700
Yu Mo. Water and fire don't go together but the Nine Fins can wield both elements.

361
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:16,100
Before you got your human form, was your training extremely difficult?

362
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
The techniques of the Nine Fins have seven levels.

363
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,600
The first six levels are water-based.

364
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,700
You have to learn them in the deepest and coldest waters.

365
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,980
The final level is fire-based.

366
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,110
You have to forget what you learned

367
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,500
and use fire to suppress the cold, almost destroying your own cultivation.

368
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,800
That's how you can obtain the fire essence.

369
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:44,100
I didn't know it was that hard for an ancient bloodline to get a human form.

370
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,900
It's so complicated.

371
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:52,400
It's difficult. But only by going through this do you learn when to hold on and when to let go.

372
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:57,300
You can then wield the flame of rebirth and protect the one you love.

373
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,300
If cold water is good for our training and can protect the Nine Fins,

374
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:10,000
then the fire is to amplify our power to protect our loved ones at our...

375
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,780
own expense.

376
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:23,220
<i>Yan Dan, I hid my true feelings so that you could remain happy forever.</i>

377
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:27,880
<i>And now, you're in love with someone and you have to suffer this pain.</i>

378
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:33,860
<i>I would rather take you back to Yelan Mountain to keep you away from the mortal desires.</i>

379
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:41,700
<i>I see you have long had feelings for her.</i>

380
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,260
The liquor is ready. Are you here to get her or the liquor?

381
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,920
Carry her back.

382
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,560
You've been hiding for so long. Finally, I found you.

383
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,900
I'm not here to fight.

384
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,880
This is "As Desired" liquor.

385
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,860
Drink it and it can fulfill your wish in your dream.

386
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:06,500
Although the reality will remain the same, it will offer comfort to your mind.

387
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:10,640
Once you feel better, we'll talk about the Illusion of Devils.

388
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,660
Why are you helping me?

389
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,080
The Illusion of Devils remains mysterious.

390
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,360
If it creates chaos, it will be hard to restore peace.

391
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,980
You are the solution to this mystery, so I come to you.

392
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,640
Besides... we have been through death together.

393
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,820
We have a bond.

394
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,520
I don't need a reason to help a friend.

395
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,280
You remind me of an old acquaintance.

396
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,640
Like him, you are compassionate.

397
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:48,260
He talked about how he was responsible for all beings and he worked tirelessly in the Three Realms.

398
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:53,100
Compared to him, you are more humane.

399
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,580
Today, I want to know more about you.

400
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:58,260
Just like me, you're an amnesiac.

401
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:01,140
Do you want to remember your past?

402
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,980
You regained your memory... and along with it, misery.

403
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,980
Suffering from depression.

404
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,920
Maybe we should let go...

405
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,300
of the past and live in the present.

406
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:30,540
Once I have this liquor and have my wish fulfilled...

407
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:33,880
I will tell you everything tomorrow.

408
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,700
Go now.

409
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,600
Foolish man.

410
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,160
If you don't know the past...

411
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:03,260
how will you know what you should cherish now?

412
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:10,890
I have a debt to pay... and you have the person you have to repay.

413
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,700
Emperor Ying Yuan.

414
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,840
Be careful when you investigate in the future.

415
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:47,560
They say honesty is often the solution to problems.

416
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:53,060
Tonight, tea will replace liquor, and we'll ask each other three questions.

417
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:56,040
Drink it if it's a "Yes." Pour it away if it's a "No".

418
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,740
What do you think?

419
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,480
First question. You put the Distance Keeping Lock on Yan Dan

420
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:20,720
not to monitor her, but for your selfish desire. Am I right?

421
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,440
The loved one you mentioned. Is it Yan Dan?

422
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,840
Second question.

423
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:43,440
You won't take the Pearl of Memory and refuse to regain your memory.

424
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,120
Is it because of Yan Dan?

425
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:54,600
Have you confessed to her?

426
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,680
Third question.

427
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,980
Once you collect the Four Divine Tools,

428
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:14,380
will you cut ties with her and send her away?

429
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:32,140
Why does the tea taste like liquor?

430
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:45,140
If you don't want to answer... just tell me frankly.

431
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,960
I won't force you.

432
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,140
There's no need to do this.

433
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,920
This tea...

434
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:19,175
