15
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,280
Still no word?

16
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,000
Your Supreme Majesty, we've searched through the Mortal Realm.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,700
Yelan Mountain was deserted.

18
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,980
We found the Cloud-Steering Boat at the North Sea.

19
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,300
We searched through the North Sea, but they were still nowhere to be found.

20
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:48,900
The Cloud-Steering Boat being in the North Sea was only a little trick to distract us.

21
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,820
What about Tao Ziqi?

22
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,480
- Still no word from her.
- Still no word from her?

23
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,120
That means she's trapped.

24
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,340
Get Tai You over here.

25
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,620
Yes, Your Majesty.

26
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,140
Why didn't you tell me that Ying Yuan was the Young Lord?

27
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,060
You even tried to kill him.

28
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:26,920
Don't forget that you swore to serve His Majesty for all eternity and to restore the entire Asura Clan.

29
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,240
I'm helping him.

30
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,920
He's obsessed with love.

31
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,560
How could he assume such a great responsibility?

32
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,880
He must go through hardships so that he can take over the great task of restoring the clan.

33
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,060
He was nearly killed by the Blades of Grievance Punishment.

34
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,860
You don't want to restore the clan at all.

35
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,320
You're just using us to achieve your ambition.

36
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,440
Where is your real form?

37
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,900
Are you really trying to revolt?

38
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:04,160
For all these years, I've always trusted you and followed your orders.

39
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,040
So what if you achieve the Universe Enchantment?

40
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,860
His Majesty's blood runs in Ying Yuan's veins.

41
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,660
You can't defeat him.

42
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,700
Greetings Star Deity.

43
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,320
These are all tributes specially picked by the new master of the Night Forgetting River.

44
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,420
They are offerings to be sent to the Divine Cemetery Forest.

45
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,940
Did it scare you, Star Deity? Please forgive us.

46
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,260
Seriously. What's wrong with the Night Forgetting River?! Even the fish are agitated.

47
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,940
Star Deity, these are the most valuable and precious Three Pools Carp of the Night Forgetting River.

48
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,180
Okay. You may leave.

49
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,740
Let them go.

50
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,940
I'm fine.

51
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,460
Yi Zang, thank you.

52
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,760
The heavenly soldiers conducted a rigorous inspection.

53
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,100
Without your help, I'm afraid we couldn't have gotten into the Divine Cemetery Forest.

54
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,540
We've been friends for 800 years.

55
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,560
Of course, I'll help you if you ask.

56
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,060
Besides, the previous Underworld King was such a tyrant.

57
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,180
It's all thanks to Emperor Ying Yuan for imposing sanctions on him.

58
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,460
Everyone in the Night Forgetting River has always remembered this kindness.

59
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,100
People who do good deeds bear good fruit.

60
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,100
It's unnecessary to bring up the past.

61
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,220
You three should go conduct your search.

62
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,440
I'll guard the entrance.

63
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,560
I'll definitely get you back to the Mortal Realm safely.

64
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,100
Thank you.

65
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,260
We'll know if it was him in just a moment.

66
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,980
It's in the shape of a crescent moon.

67
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,800
Zhi Xi told me about this before.

68
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,020
During the War of Genesis, in order to save the ancient bloodline, the Blood Eagle Clan,

69
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,440
His Supreme Majesty once used the divine tool, Crescent Blade,

70
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,020
to rip out his blood and flesh to feed the eagle,

71
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,300
so that the Blood Eagle Clan could survive.

72
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,520
But the wound on his body could never heal.

73
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,880
Its shape was like a crescent moon.

74
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,380
This is the scar left when His Supreme Majesty ripped out his flesh to feed the eagle.

75
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:57,120
This immortal body... belongs to him.

76
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,240
Someone cast a Puppet Spell on His Supreme Majesty's immortal body.

77
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,820
It was swapped with Huan Qin's and hidden here.

78
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:08,120
So it seems that the real Heavenly Emperor has already been...

79
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:13,420
Then, the current Heavenly Emperor is Huan Qin?

80
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:20,120
Who exactly is it that could deceive everyone like this?

81
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,820
That day when I was restoring the barrier,

82
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,600
His Supreme Majesty prevented me from becoming a demon with a wisp of his primordial spirit.

83
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,500
Now that his immortal body is here, and I've got his primordial spirit,

84
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,740
I'm sure I can bring His Supreme Majesty back to life.

85
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:51,920
If His Supreme Majesty could be revived, then Huan Qin's crime will be revealed.

86
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,900
Your Supreme Majesty!

87
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,380
Your Supreme Majesty!

88
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:16,120
Ying Yuan, you've finally discovered the secret that I've been keeping my entire life.

89
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,640
Is it Huan Qin?

90
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,840
It turns out that I was wrong about him.

91
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:39,360
Right from the beginning, it's because

92
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,520
I realized everything too late.

93
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,260
The treacherous are cunning.

94
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,980
You can't blame yourself.

95
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,640
You are a worthy Emperor.

96
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,040
If your mother was still alive, I am sure she would be proud of you.

97
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,160
My mother?

98
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,000
That's right.

99
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,140
In Nine Heavens, why are you the only person

100
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,520
who can repair the Heaven-Demon Barrier that the Primordial Lord left?

101
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:18,820
Because Primordial Lord, Ran Qing, is your biological mother.

102
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,820
Soul Ripping Sword, come!

103
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:42,260
When your mother destroyed her own primordial spirit, it shattered Xuanye's Moment-Turning Gear.

104
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,220
The broken pieces of the Moment-Turning Gear are hidden inside the Soul-Ripping Sword.

105
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,240
It retained some traces of residual memories.

106
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,580
The past and grievances between your mother and Xuan Ye is inside it.

107
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,800
<i>The Asura Clan slaughtered other clans. It's an injustice.</i>

108
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,120
<i>If you don't stop right now,</i>

109
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,580
<i>it'll be a declaration of war against us, the Deity Clan.</i>

110
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,500
<i>Are you all right?</i>

111
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,320
<i>- Thank you for your help.
- What's your name?</i>

112
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,400
<i>Why are you here alone?</i>

113
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,820
<i>After I was born, my entire family died.</i>

114
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,700
<i>I've lived in exile since then.</i>

115
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,920
<i>I don't have a name.</i>

116
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:36,780
<i>Ran Qing, the Asura Clan will start war sooner or later.</i>

117
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,980
<i>This person's identity is unknown. How could you let him stay in the Nine Heavens?</i>

118
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,140
<i>He was born out of a calamity. His family was broken apart.</i>

119
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,300
<i>Of course, no one knows about his identity.</i>

120
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,980
<i>I've already looked into his spiritual essence. He's just a demon who has little spiritual power.</i>

121
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,040
<i>If we send him back to the savage region, I'm afraid he'll certainly die.</i>

122
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,790
<i>There are no survivors in the places the Asura Clan soldiers have visited.</i>

123
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:59,400
<i>If he did really had such little spiritual power,</i>

124
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,980
<i>how could he stay alive long enough for you to rescue him?</i>

125
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,500
<i>Saving lives is the reason why I go onto the battlefield.</i>

126
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:10,080
<i>Ignoring a life over mere suspicion and cowardice is not what a merciful person should do.</i>

127
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,780
<i>Ran Qing.</i>

128
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:21,340
<i>Fine. I know you have a gentle heart.</i>

129
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,640
<i>How about this?</i>

130
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,520
<i>I'll transfer some divine power to him, so that he can fight regular soldiers from the Asura Clan.</i>

131
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,740
<i>Will that do? Just send him back to the mortal world.</i>

132
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,340
<i>It's blessing enough for me to be alive.</i>

133
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:41,340
<i>I won't be insatiable and covet divine power.</i>

134
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,640
<i>Greater God, Ran Qing, means well.</i>

135
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,980
<i>I shouldn't put you in a hard spot.</i>

136
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:57,360
<i>Oh right, this is the tea I just made for you two.</i>

137
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,240
<i>Please enjoy it.</i>

138
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,480
<i>Greater God.</i>

139
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,740
<i>Your Supreme Majesty.</i>

140
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,640
<i>Careful. Are you hurt?</i>

141
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,220
<i>I'm fine. I... didn't have a good hold on it.</i>

142
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,420
<i>Your Supreme Majesty, I was careless.</i>

143
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,380
<i>Greater God, thank you for your help during this time.</i>

144
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:50,640
<i>I am willing to return to the Mortal Realm now.</i>

145
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,160
<i>Ran Qing!</i>

146
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,960
<i>You got what you wanted. Others put pressure on me and you do as well.</i>

147
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,920
<i>I didn't touch him just now. He was pretending.</i>

148
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,360
<i>His injury hasn't healed yet. I'll take him back to the Mortal Realm.</i>

149
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,280
<i>Then, I'll come with you.</i>

150
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,840
<i>It's not necessary. There are many affairs in both the Deity and Divine Realms that demand your attention.</i>

151
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,280
<i>There's no one in the world that can hurt me.</i>

152
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,840
<i>Are you all right?</i>

153
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,660
<i>I am fine.</i>

154
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,800
<i>You are a Greater God.</i>

155
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,440
<i>I am a demon.</i>

156
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,790
<i>We'll eventually part ways. You don't need to mind it.</i>

157
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,720
<i>The Asura Clan is ambitious.</i>

158
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,080
<i>They came to provoke us many times before.</i>

159
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,160
<i>That is why those immortals are suspicious.</i>

160
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,800
<i>Do not take it personally.</i>

161
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,000
<i>You care about the well-being of the world.</i>

162
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,060
<i>It makes sense for you to look at the big picture.</i>

163
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:10,040
<i>It's just that I often see you stay up all night discussing military matters.</i>

164
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,100
<i>I was thinking that... maybe I could give you a hand.</i>

165
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,820
<i>But that's not in our destiny.</i>

166
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,080
<i>If I can survive the war,</i>

167
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,840
<i>will you come to the Demon Realm to be my guest and name me?</i>

168
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,380
<i>All right.</i>

169
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,820
<i>It's a deal.</i>

170
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,800
<i>It's people from the Deity Clan.</i>

171
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,720
<i>Killing them can give us massive spiritual power.</i>

172
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,090
<i>We, the Asura troops, are stationed here.</i>

173
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:15,920
<i>Today, you'll certainly die.</i>

174
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,400
<i>Attack!</i>

175
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,060
<i>Are you all right?</i>

176
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,220
<i>Why did you take the hit for me?</i>

177
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,100
<i>You knew that with my divine power, they can't hurt me.</i>

178
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:58,120
<i>Even so, I'm still worried that they'll hurt you.</i>

179
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,900
<i>You saved me once.</i>

180
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,200
<i>I should repay your kindness.</i>

181
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,380
<i>Their troops should be around here.</i>

182
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,900
<i>Hurry and go. Don't worry about me.</i>

183
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,920
<i>Let me take you to heal your wounds.</i>

184
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,800
<i>Thank you. You saved me once again.</i>

185
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,720
<i>With the protection of the Seven Star Deity Jade, you'll be all right.</i>

186
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,480
<i>Just get some good rest here.</i>

187
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,500
<i>This is the place where I meditate.</i>

188
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,360
<i>Hundreds of flowers will blossom during the flowering season. It's very beautiful.</i>

189
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,100
<i>Unfortunately, I've been busy with political affairs for many years.</i>

190
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,660
<i>I've never properly enjoyed the flowers before.</i>

191
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,420
<i>Let me try it.</i>

192
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,480
<i>Maybe I can make the flowering period start sooner.</i>

193
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,540
<i>I was transformed from trees.</i>

194
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,520
<i>I can reverse the life cycle of flowers and plants.</i>

195
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,520
<i>Hundreds of flowers are in bloom. It feels like springtime.</i>

196
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,560
<i>Not bad.</i>

197
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,600
<i>The beauty of the blossom lies in the sincerity of a waiting heart.</i>

198
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,120
<i>If we don't experience the coldness in the winter,</i>

199
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,160
<i>it would be hard to understand the warmth of the springtime.</i>

200
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,900
<i>It's a beautiful view.</i>

201
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,160
<i>But unfortunately, I've got work to do.</i>

202
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,180
<i>I must leave now.</i>

203
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,600
<i>You always say that you're busy with work, and you haven't seen the flowers in a long time.</i>

204
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:53,600
<i>Why don't... you stay here and enjoy the moment?</i>

205
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,900
<i>Only after experiencing the coldness of the dusk</i>

206
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,820
<i>can you know the warmth of the spring.</i>

207
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,380
<i>I'll call you Mu Han.</i>

208
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,920
<i>How about it?</i>

209
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,680
<i>Cover the hot furnace when it's cold at dusk.</i>

210
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,160
<i>Shape the eyebrows on a warm spring day.
(T/N: it's a play on words using their names)</i>

211
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,340
<i>That's good.</i>

212
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,040
<i>Is it sweet?</i>

213
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,540
<i>Look.</i>

214
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,120
<i>I've stayed here for many days.</i>

215
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,640
<i>I don't dare keep bothering you.</i>

216
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,320
<i>Have you been happy during this time?</i>

217
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,360
<i>What do you mean?</i>

218
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,080
<i>Are you... going to leave?</i>

219
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,680
<i>The past is the past.</i>

220
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,500
<i>We can't dwell on it.</i>

221
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,540
<i>It's time for us to say goodbye.</i>

222
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,340
<i>What if I insist?</i>

223
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,200
<i>A shooting star is beautiful,</i>

224
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,480
<i>but it's fleeting.</i>

225
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:02,840
<i>I wonder if our happiness will be like this as well.</i>

226
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,160
<i>By the way, do you have a mirror?</i>

227
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,260
<i>Things in the world change.</i>

228
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,780
<i>Just like the rise and fall of the stars and the waxing and waning of the moon.</i>

229
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,180
<i>If one day you regret it,</i>

230
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,280
<i>at least you can look at the view in the mirror.</i>

231
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,880
<i>It'll look the same as before,</i>

232
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,140
<i>we will never part.</i>

233
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:09,160
<i>No matter how things change in the world, you'll always be my husband.</i>

234
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,860
<i>Always and forever.</i>

235
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,660
<i>What's wrong with the Jade?</i>

236
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:38,520
<i>Eternal Darkness? It really is you.</i>

237
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,420
<i>Xuan Ye.</i>

238
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,320
<i>Ran Qing.</i>

239
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,880
<i>I still like it better when you call me Mu Han.</i>

240
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,100
<i>You found something was wrong.</i>

241
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,040
<i>You must've used the fake Jade.</i>

242
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,160
<i>Then, are you hurt? That's why you used it?</i>

243
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,360
<i>Stop pretending.</i>

244
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,200
<i>Everything in the past was a sham.</i>

245
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,780
<i>You approached me just to steal the Jade and slaughter the helpless,</i>

246
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:17,486
<i>in order to achieve the Asura Clan's ambition of ruling the world!</i>

247
00:29:17,486 --> 00:29:20,480
<i>My family has short lifespans.</i>

248
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,540
<i>Even if we have strong divine power, it'll be hard for us to subdue every clan.</i>

249
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,420
<i>So I borrowed the Jade.</i>

250
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,940
<i>But I'm in love with you.</i>

251
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,160
<i>There is no lie in that.</i>

252
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,480
<i>Whether it's the world</i>

253
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,780
<i>or my lover,</i>

254
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,140
<i>I'll never give them up.</i>

255
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,940
<i>Ridiculous.</i>

256
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,060
<i>I mistakenly trusted you once.</i>

257
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,380
<i>It won't happen again.</i>

258
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,340
<i>I failed to distinguish good from bad, and I fed the beast.</i>

259
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:11,340
<i>Today, I must personally eradicate the evil to atone for my sins.</i>

260
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,640
<i>It's useless, Ran Qing.</i>

261
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:21,760
<i>Now, I've obtained the Seven Star Deity Jade already.</i>

262
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,860
<i>My Eternal Darkness has already reached its peak.</i>

263
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,960
<i>The Moment-Turning Gear can even reverse time.</i>

264
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,440
<i>No matter what the outcome of this war is, you can never kill me.</i>

265
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,600
<i>Just let it go.</i>

266
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,500
<i>Or you'll get yourself hurt.</i>

267
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:45,960
<i>I was fooled by the enemy and betrayed by my husband.</i>

268
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,060
<i>Hasn't it hurt me enough?</i>

269
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:56,280
<i>Now that the truth has been revealed, why are you still pretending?!</i>

270
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:09,500
<i>When I become the ruler of the world, I'll still keep you company and wait for the flowers to blossom.</i>

271
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,140
<i>Then, you'll know that my heart is true.</i>

272
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,960
<i>Wait for me.</i>

273
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,840
<i>Ran Qing. Why are you here?</i>

274
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,980
<i>The Jade has been broken.</i>

275
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,440
<i>Just stop.</i>

276
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,300
<i>Stop?</i>

277
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:27,820
<i>I've extended my life for thousands of years already.</i>

278
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,480
<i>So what if you destroyed the Jade?</i>

279
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,240
<i>You can't die.</i>

280
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:38,840
<i>I want you to see with your own two eyes, when I unify all the clans and open up the Six Realms.</i>

281
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:46,300
<i>Killing me and obtaining the world, will you get what you want this way?</i>

282
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:51,480
<i>You said before... that we'll never part.</i>

283
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,160
<i>Now,</i>

284
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,220
<i>you broke your promise after all.</i>

285
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,220
<i>If I could go back in time...</i>

286
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,360
<i>I'd still want to meet you.</i>

287
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,780
<i>It's just that I don't want things like this to happen.</i>

288
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:20,980
<i>But... I won't have that chance anymore.</i>

289
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,150
<i>I've loved you.</i>

290
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,050
<i>I won't regret it.</i>

291
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,560
<i>I won't break my promise, Ran Qing.</i>

292
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,440
<i>Wait for me.</i>

293
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:27,360
<i>I can rewrite our ending.</i>

294
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,580
<i>Why didn't you avoid it?</i>

295
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,620
<i>Why are you staring at me like this?</i>

296
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,480
<i>Do we... know each other?</i>

297
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,660
<i>I've always admired the formidable reputation of the Greater God, Ran Qing.</i>

298
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:24,260
<i>Now that I get to meet you, I am stunned.</i>

299
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,940
<i>I knew that you</i>

300
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,100
<i>would definitely come to rescue me.</i>

<i>What's your name?</i>

302
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,000
<i>Why are you here alone?</i>

303
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,340
<i>Cover the hot furnace when it's cold at dusk.</i>

<i>Shape the eyebrows on a warm spring day.</i>

00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:30,400
♫ <i> Even the star frost can't stop the fleeting time </i> ♫

309
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:38,770
♫ <i> I once borrowed your eyes to warm the coldest moment </i> ♫

310
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:45,800
♫ <i> I've traveled across the Night Forgetting River, but it's hard to forget this fate </i> ♫

311
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:51,970
♫ <i> I followed you across the endless seas reluctant to leave you </i> ♫

312
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:58,620
♫ <i> It seems too hard to profess my love, the words are caught in my throat </i> ♫

313
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:06,770
♫ <i> I've wasted a millennium thinking about how to let go of my endless longing for you </i> ♫

314
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:13,470
♫ <i> Love can only be redeemed if the deadline is forgotten </i> ♫

315
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:23,400
♫ <i> Deep love is engraved in my heart with just one look, I'm willing to take the leap for you </i> ♫

316
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:30,400
♫ <i> As epiphyllum withers, I'm willing to sink in deep and never let you down in this life </i> ♫

317
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:38,650
♫ <i> I'm keeping the last glimpse of you, so I won't fear missing you after reincarnation </i> ♫

318
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:46,420
♫ <i> Your heart is still beating in my chest </i> ♫

319
00:38:55,100 --> 00:39:02,300
♫ <i> Deep love is engraved in my heart with just one look, I'm willing to take the leap for you </i> ♫

320
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:09,200
♫ <i> As epiphyllum withers, I'm willing to sink in deep and never let you down in this life </i> ♫

321
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:17,520
♫ <i> I'm keeping the last glimpse of you, so I won't fear missing you after reincarnation </i> ♫

322
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:24,470
♫ <i> Your heart is still beating in my chest </i> ♫

323
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:34,270
♫ <i> The flowers bloom and fall, even though I say nothing and you hear nothing </i> ♫
