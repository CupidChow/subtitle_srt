I found it!

16
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,680
"Illuminate all darkness."

17
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,420
"Protect and shield those deceased."

18
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,940
"Turn those ghosts into earthly beings."

19
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,040
"Revert what's been done and bring back the spirit."

20
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,000
Are you okay?

21
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,380
Ziqi!

22
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,200
Xuan Xiang.

23
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,980
Xuan Xiang.

24
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,680
Ziqi.

25
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,460
Shouldn't I be dead?

26
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,540
Why am I here?

27
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,580
A millennium ago... it wasn't me who killed you in front of the array.

28
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,680
I know.

29
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,020
Even though that man looked like you...

30
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,310
I can recognize your eyes.

31
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,060
I knew it wasn't you.

32
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,680
I'm sorry.

33
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,880
I was late.

34
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,200
You suffered a lot.

35
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,560
Is the Divine-Devil War still going on?

36
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,140
How did you resurrect me?

37
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,940
Where is this place?

38
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,940
We're at the Night Forgetting River.

39
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,520
I used Paper and Ink to revive you.

40
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,160
The Divine-Devil War ended more than 900 years ago.

41
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,660
I'll tell you everything later.

42
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,260
I have been dead for nine centuries?

43
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,140
What was the outcome of the war, then?

44
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,520
Don't worry.

45
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,140
The Heavenly Realm won.

46
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,520
Even though I couldn't prevent the war...

47
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,960
From now on, we can live how we had wanted to live.

48
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,880
<i>It doesn't matter if Tang Zhou is already in love with someone else.</i>

49
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,400
<i>Let bygones be bygones.</i>

50
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,780
<i>Living in the present is the most important.</i>

51
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,440
<i>Feelings come from the heart.</i>

52
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,440
<i>Once someone enters your heart, this feeling will be inevitable.</i>

53
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,300
<i>We might as well confront it.</i>

54
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,040
Oh, Ziqi.

55
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,840
It's all thanks to these three that I could revive you.

56
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,600
I owe my life to you.

57
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,080
You're welcome.

58
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,380
Liu Weiyang's determination was what brought you back to life.

59
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,700
Despite the hardship you had to go through, you can now continue to live happily.

60
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,240
Congratulations to the both of you.

61
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,260
Congratulations, Sister Tao.

62
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,020
Can I call you that?

63
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,480
I'm Yan Dan.

64
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,640
Your love story is more touching than any novel that I have read.

65
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,760
Can I include your story in my journal?

66
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,440
If one day the story is performed on stage, it will be an amazing and popular one.

67
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,760
Of course! I'll keep two VIP seats for you two.

68
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,280
You must come and watch the performance.

69
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,540
Ziqi!

70
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Although Ziqi regained her human form... her soul was trapped in Bone Mountain for too long.

71
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,660
She is overwhelmed by ghostly energy.

72
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,100
I will leave with her soon.

73
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,420
Don't stay here for too long, too.

74
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,880
<i>Sister Tao has the same gray spots I had.</i>

75
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,480
<i>Perhaps before I lost my memory, I was also here.</i>

76
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,620
As expected of a demon.

77
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,940
You can never stay still in one place.

78
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,330
Aren't you the same?

79
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,880
Why are you here at this hour?

80
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,030
You must be up to no good.

81
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,460
You're the one who is curious about this place.

82
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,280
What... are you unhappy now?

83
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,400
I also don't know.

84
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,840
I... When I see this place, I feel weird.

85
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,800
Almost uncontrollably.

86
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,620
While we were by the shore just now, I saw many passengers crossing the river with lanterns.

87
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,360
It looked familiar to me, too.

88
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,740
Me, too. It just looked so familiar.

89
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,200
I saw this place in the Illusion of Devils.

90
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,200
I was alone with my lantern.

91
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,040
I was crossing the river.

92
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,620
It was hot and cold at the same time.

93
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,020
The fire from the lantern kept burning me.

94
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:48,620
Do you think we can regain our memory... here?

95
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,740
It works!

96
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,880
I get it now.

97
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,140
It's no wonder all passengers carry it.

98
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,080
This is Death Fire.

99
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,900
Who would want to cling to their past... when they're being burned by it.

100
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:18,100
If it were me, I would forget everything within a day.

101
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,620
Coward.

102
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:30,380
I believe... that some people will not forget... even if they are being scorched.

103
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:39,460
Is that why you can't forget the person in your dream?

104
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,580
Maybe you should carry this lantern and walk in the river a bit.

105
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,940
You might be able to remember the person in your dream.

106
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:58,020
You might find out what you did to wrong her.

107
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,680
Do you want me to recall my past that badly?

108
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,020
Do you not have the courage, or are you not willing to face the past?

109
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:11,320
Is it possible... that you truly wronged a woman?

110
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,940
Yan Dan.

111
00:11:26,656 --> 00:11:28,840
You have no memory, too.

112
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,840
If you don't care about your past...

113
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,740
why should I?

114
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:43,350
♫ <i> I blame time for the mortal world's woe is on your shoulder </i> ♫

115
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:48,150
♫ <i> Like the surging tides of stars, I continuously ask where the origin of love comes from </i> ♫

116
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,480
You're the future sect leader of the Lingxiao Sect.

117
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,460
I'm a headstrong lotus demon.

118
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,210
Why do you treat me this nicely?

119
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,490
♫ <i> In my momentary childishness, I now understand that all living things wither away </i> ♫

120
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:05,860
The magical bangle on your wrist is also binding your heart.

121
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,220
When it was vibrating earlier, I want to know...

122
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,160
if it's because of me?

123
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:24,170
♫ <i> The beauty is in the burning agarwood incense, there's still hope when the ashes settle </i> ♫

124
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:31,570
♫ <i> Hear the beautiful prose with a fine beauty and a picturesque view, they pair well together </i> ♫

125
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:35,320
♫ <i> Sew two hearts together and a stem sprouts forth </i> ♫

126
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:41,980
♫ <i> Understand the wind, think about the rain, and do not awaken from the dream </i> ♫

127
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,980
Tang Zhou! What's going on?

128
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,840
Don't come near me. Go away!

129
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,700
- Oh no! Are you...
- Leave!

130
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,380
I'll lose control soon. Run!

131
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,500
Let me pass my energy to you!

132
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,440
<i>She is my beloved one.</i>

133
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,320
<i>Unfortunately, our time together is short. It will come to an end soon.</i>

134
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:29,680
<i>May she forget her past and live a happy life.</i>

135
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,070
You're back.

136
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,860
<i>The Tortoise-Flipping Deity? It's you?</i>

137
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,300
<i> My title is Qingli Emperor Ying Yuan.</i>

138
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,160
<i> A refined, happy face, but harsh brows filled with sadness. </i>

139
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,120
<i>Embellished words lead to emptiness, while simple phrases have deeper meanings.</i>

140
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,980
<i>The younger sister is Yan Dan.</i>

141
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,240
<i>This is a Distance-Keeping Bracelet. I have placed a Distance-Keeping Lock on it.</i>

142
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,020
<i>When you're within 15 steps of me, you will be pushed away like just now.</i>

143
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,230
<i>Let me ask you. If one day, I fell in love</i>

144
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:02,740
<i>but I harmed no one and did nothing wrong, would you kill me?</i>

145
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,420
<i>I will kill you.</i>

146
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,320
<i>You're smart.</i>

147
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:13,440
<i>In a GO game, the best way to resolve a deadlock... is to withdraw.</i>

148
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,400
<i>Otherwise, both parties will be hurt.</i>

149
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,180
<i>Whether it was in Yanxu Heavenly Palace, or in the cottage by the Land Under the Horizon,</i>

150
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:27,380
<i>no matter the time, the location, or the nature of your feelings,</i>

151
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:32,580
<i>did you ever have me in your heart?</i>

152
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:41,200
<i>My heart is devoted to all beings. There is no room for anything else.</i>

153
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,660
<i>I have tasted every kind of pain.</i>

154
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:50,630
<i>A gouged heart, thunder strikes, shred to pieces as I jumped off the Bridge of Emptiness,</i>

155
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,740
<i>scorched by the Death Fire.</i>

156
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,060
<i>None of them is as painful as heartbreak.</i>

157
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:02,500
<i>I must forget him and never look back.</i>

158
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,970
Ying Yuan.

159
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:17,900
♫ <i> After bidding farewell, when Spring becomes Autumn, where can I find my heart in this world? </i> ♫

160
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:23,970
♫ <i> Several lifetimes will not be enough for our parting </i> ♫

161
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:28,550
♫ <i> As I watch lovers enjoying fireworks on the riverbanks, my love and longing for you makes my pain unbearable </i> ♫

162
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:32,740
Yan Dan. I had a lapse of judgment just now. Sorry.

163
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,940
- Don't...
- Don't come near me!

164
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,920
Don't come near me.

165
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:47,120
♫ <i> When the lotus blossoms again, you and I will be together </i> ♫

166
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,660
You've come to me by yourselves.

167
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,020
Run!

168
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,620
Tang Zhou, are you okay?

169
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,440
I'm fine.

170
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,060
Sheng De.

171
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,600
Tang Zhou.

172
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,400
You're still alive.

173
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,440
I guess my time is not up yet.

174
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,820
But today, your time is up.

175
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,980
If this carries on, his celestial vest will shred to pieces.

176
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,800
I will get the emperor's divine power

177
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,590
Aren't you two inseparable?

178
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,140
Then why not die together?

179
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:03,980
Ying Deng. From the Heavenly Realm to the Mortal Realm, why can't you let it go?

180
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,900
You regained your memory.

181
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,160
Very well.

182
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,660
At least, you know why you will die!

183
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,260
Yan Dan.

184
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,180
His Majesty doesn't remember you at all.

185
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,720
Does your heart... ache?

186
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,820
Oh, wait.

187
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,400
You only have half a heart now.

188
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:42,420
You won't feel as much pain as I do.

189
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:47,420
You ruined yourself for someone who doesn't even love you.

190
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,980
Can you still not understand?

191
00:20:54,420 --> 00:21:02,300
If I can't get it... then let us all burn into ashes.

192
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,960
Why does your spiritual power contain Flower Spirit Clan's spirit?

193
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:30,220
My power got a massive boost... all thanks to the entire Flower Spirit Clan.

194
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:37,160
Your clan mates had limited power, but they were numerous and the demonic essence was pure.

195
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,420
It's perfect for me to use!

196
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,740
Remember.

197
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,520
They died because of you.

198
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:51,380
When you live a day longer, the people around you suffer a day longer!

199
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,080
You're insane!

200
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,550
I've now regained my memory of the Heavenly Realm.

201
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:53,740
I can now fight you with my divine spell.

202
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,260
When you make one mistake...

203
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,780
it leads to another.

204
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,560
There is... no turning back!

205
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:21,190
You killed my entire clan, hurt His Majesty,

206
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:26,530
provoked Zhi Xi and me against each other, and put me on that Heavenly Gallows twice.

207
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:30,560
Today, you will pay the price!

208
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,400
Why?

209
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:54,320
I trained for a millennium... to become a fairy.

210
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,120
I could have had a happy life and a bright career.

211
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,180
But I turned love into hatred because of His Majesty.

212
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:10,560
Now, I'm neither a human nor a demon.

213
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,900
Do I deserve to disappear into thin air?

214
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,140
I gave my love to the wrong person.

215
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,740
Was that...

216
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:29,340
my mistake from the very beginning?

217
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,480
I lost half of my heart.

218
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,660
Jiang Chen lost her life.

219
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:37,800
You... deserve this.

220
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,220
<i>Yan Dan, oh, Yan Dan. You sure are foolish.</i>

221
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:08,960
<i>Whether in the Heavenly Realm or the Mortal Realm, you fell in love with him again and again.</i>

222
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,420
I've suppressed his leaking divine power for the moment.

223
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:30,200
However, his celestial vest is severely damaged and won't last long.

224
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,240
We will need the fourth Divine Tool to turn the tide.

225
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,960
But the Three Realms are so vast. Where should we start looking?

226
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,640
I can save him.

227
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,380
Even the Devil King failed to repair his vest.

228
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,280
What can you use to save him?

229
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,080
If I didn't make him come with me on the boat, he wouldn't be like this.

230
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,100
I caused this mess.

231
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,020
I'll deal with it.

232
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,620
Don't worry. My body is full of medicine.

233
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,880
There must be a way.

234
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:06,500
Besides, the future sect leader of the Lingxiao Sect will surely owe me this one.

235
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,120
We'll wait outside.

236
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,640
Let us know if—

237
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,160
Stop nagging me.

238
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,840
If you have the time, make me supper.

239
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,960
Once I'm done, we'll have it together.

240
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,440
Go.

241
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,700
Yan Dan. Call me if anything happens.

242
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:29,140
Why is it... that I remember you at the end

243
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,700
but you forgot about everything?

244
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,280
Whatever.

245
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,120
You already owe me a lot.

246
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,640
I guess you can continue to owe me.

247
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,980
Yan Dan.

248
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,240
What did you do to save me?

249
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,460
Nothing. It was just a few petals.

250
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,900
You're awake now. You should rest.

251
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,860
I should go.

252
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,880
What about Sheng De?

253
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,860
Were you hurt in the fight?

254
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:28,380
Paper and Ink is a very powerful Divine Tool.

255
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,800
I used it to get rid of Sheng De.

256
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,680
She's dead.

257
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,700
It turns out you're very powerful.

258
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,200
I truly underestimated you.

259
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:43,980
Yan Dan. What you said on the boat just now...

260
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:48,520
I no longer want the answer... to the questions I asked earlier on.

261
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:16,160
Yan Dan, you gave me your blood directly from your heart.

262
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,200
Are you crazy?

263
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,920
Do you know how risky that is?

264
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,040
What else can I do?

265
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,840
Should I watch you die in front of me?

266
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,060
You know you can't promise me anything, so why won't you leave me alone?

267
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,900
Why do you always appear in front of me?

268
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,600
Why do you have only half a heart?

269
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,660
Where is the other half?

270
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,820
This thing followed me from the Heavenly Realm to the Mortal Realm.

271
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,840
Because fate...

272
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,980
is unavoidable.

273
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,700
Advisor Lotus, I made you supper.

274
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,660
Eat it while it's warm.

275
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,920
It's fine, Yu Mo.

276
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,820
I'm very tired from saving Tang Zhou just now.

277
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,140
I want to sleep now.

278
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,580
I saw you when you came out just now.

279
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,780
You were as white as a sheet.

280
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,840
How did you save him?

281
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,080
If you feel unwell, just tell me.

282
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,700
I'll help you.

283
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,980
I'm fine.

284
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,340
I just plucked out several of my petals.

285
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,440
I'll be fine after a nap.

286
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,240
Once Tang Zhou has recovered, I'll boss him around.

287
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,180
He'd better return my spiritual power to me.

288
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:24,220
All right. I'll sleep now. You should get some rest, too.

289
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,380
Ziqi.

290
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:20,020
The gray spots on your face are gone.

291
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,320
It seems like the ghostly energy from Bone Mountain has dissipated.

292
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,960
However, your soul just returned to your body.

293
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,660
It's still unstable. You need several days to recuperate.

294
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,060
Come.

295
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,400
I made this medicinal soup for you.

296
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,700
Xuan Xiang.

297
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:48,840
Do you have the information I asked you to find for me?

298
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:58,440
During the Divine-Devil War, 34 divine clans were wiped out.

299
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,220
The Ming Goose Clan... was one of them.

300
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,200
Were my people buried in the Divine Cemetery Forest?

301
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,600
Did they have an honorable burial?

302
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,100
The Ming Goose Clan was ambushed.

303
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,420
No bodies were found.

304
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,220
I'm sorry.

305
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,360
After I was promoted,

306
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,700
my mentor, Star Deity Ji Du, Huan Qin,

307
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:48,100
gave this purple hairpin to me.

308
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,520
He said this hairpin was unbreakable,

309
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,420
like the trust the Heavenly Realm had in me,

310
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,700
and the sense of duty I had to the Heavenly Realm.

311
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,220
Even though I chose you...

312
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,720
I never betrayed the Divine Clan.

313
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,480
Of course not.

314
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,320
But my mistake helped Elder Shuo Hua.

315
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,240
My selfishness...

316
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,760
started the Divine-Devil War.

317
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,120
Xuan Xiang.

318
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,630
We won't be what we used to be anymore.

319
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,300
Ziqi.

320
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,280
We trumped life and death.

321
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:33,180
Why can't we start over?

322
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,670
No.

323
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:41,330
Life and death... aren't what is between us.

324
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,130
It's the thousands of lives of those deities who died for nothing.

325
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,760
Xuan Xiang.

326
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,470
Please let me go.

327
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,500
Ziqi.

328
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:15,400
If you want to leave, wait till your health has improved.

329
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,920
Okay?

330
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,240
I let go of my memory of him last time.

331
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,480
This time, I can do it, too.

332
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:31,620
I really didn't expect us to meet again.

333
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:34,700
How have you been all these years?

334
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,720
Not bad.

335
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,600
If so, why are you here again, then?

336
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,680
The Night Forgetting River is losing its effectiveness.

337
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,740
I crossed the river to forget my past.

338
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:56,060
Now... it all came back to me.

339
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,760
I've been in the Night Forgetting River for over a million years.

340
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,920
Everyone here is just a passenger to me.

341
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,300
Except for you who have kept me company for 800 years.

342
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:12,500
I have long regarded you as my only friend.

343
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,140
I think...

344
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,720
you should know something.

345

♫ <i> Close your eyes and feel the warmth of your palm </i> ♫

346
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,740
The agarwood incense burner wasn't destroyed.

347
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,020
How come it's in your hand?

348

355
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:51,320
<i>who erased our memory.</i>

356
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:58,140
That day, Emperor Ying Yuan did not destroy this cocoon.

357
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,960
He used a deceptive trick.

358
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,540
Then he came to help you cross the river.

359
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:07,380
During a battle, it fell into the river.

360
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,800
<i>Butterfly of Lucid Dreaming is banned in the Heavenly Realm.</i>

♫ <i>I searched near and far, but I couldn't find your eyes</i> ♫

363
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,640
A Butterfly of Lucid Dreaming.

364
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,530
Didn't they say...

365
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:38,220
one will spawn when you let go of your love?

366
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,520
If I already let go of him...

367
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,820
why does it still hurt this much?

368
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:52,680
All records say the Butterfly of Lucid Dreaming will only break out of its cocoon once it senses true love.

369
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:58,180
That's why it went extinct 10,000 years ago in the Nine Heavens after the Heavenly Rules were enforced.

370
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:05,560
<i>Only when it detects no love and no sentiment...</i>

371
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,760
<i>will it break out of its cocoon.</i>

372
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:13,700
<i>Even if you crush it, it will still be reborn from resentment.</i>

373
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:20,800
<i>Ying Yuan, you have been lying to me.</i>

374
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,500
<i>You are indeed in love with me.</i>

375
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,480
<i>Yet you still chose this world over me.</i>

376
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,900
Okay.

377
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:44,220
I'm living with all my memories, once again.

378
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,220
If you can let go of me...

379
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,660
I can also let go of you.

380
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,280
Even if I can't forget you...

381
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:00,440
I will cast away all my love.

382
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,580
Yan Dan, don't become too heartbroken.

383
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,780
Emperor Ying Yuan wasn't being cruel.

384
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,900
He had no choice.

385
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:29,020
From now on, I won't love him anymore.

386
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,340
I will only live for myself.
