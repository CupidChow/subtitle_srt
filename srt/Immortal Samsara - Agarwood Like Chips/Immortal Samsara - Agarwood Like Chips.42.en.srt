Look, I am fine now.

16
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,040
I'm all right now.

17
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,120
This place is very close to Lingxiao Sect.

18
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,960
You all should go now.

19
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,440
You can drop the act.

20
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,280
You're trying to win her sympathy after saving her.

21
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,280
You know Yan Dan is a loyal person.

22
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,860
She won't leave you behind. Yet you still said that.

23
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,300
Thanks.

24
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,680
Your celestial vest is torn.

25
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,660
And you dared to dissipate your cultivation base.

26
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,800
Your body is not as strong as it used to be.

27
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,600
You'd better conserve the petals.

28
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,280
Yu Mo, you just said my sect wasn't acting righteously.

29
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,820
What do you mean?

30
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,340
Lingxiao Sect kills demons to make pills.

31
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,200
It has been witnessed by demons.

32
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,080
That's impossible.

33
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,540
Although I've used those alchemy reasons to scare demons,

34
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,660
Lingxiao Sect is a reputable and decent sect.

35
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,200
We would never practice such arts.

36
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,520
Even someone you spend a lot of time with has a side that is kept from others.

37
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:06,120
When Cang Hong attacked me, I sensed something weird about his power.

38
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,760
He couldn't have cultivated that through the righteous path.

39
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,940
When I was locked up in the Demon Suppression Hall,

40
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:24,600
I left a petal with Dan Shu. It has Cloud Breaker Spell on it.

41
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,900
We can use this to break the magical array at Demon Suppression Hall's gate.

42
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,860
Dan Shu is still in there.

43
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,000
After a short rest, we shall return to Lingxiao Sect to save him.

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,880
That's what I intend to do.

45
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,540
All right.

46
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,240
I will go with you.

47
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,400
I may no longer be a member of Lingxiao Sect,

48
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,260
but I won't stand by and watch the reputation of the sect be tarnished.

<i>[Demon Suppression Hall]</i>

50
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,140
The magical array to open the gate has changed.

51
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,140
Do you think someone will come to your rescue?

52
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,020
They can't get in.

53
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,980
After that flower demon left, she must be worried about you.

54
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,780
But it's fine.

55
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:28,340
As long as you are dead... all this evidence will be gone.

56
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,040
Demon Suppression Hall's magical array has not been changed in over a decade.
<i>[Demon Suppression Hall]</i>

57
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,020
If it was to prevent you from saving them, changing it or not makes no difference.

58
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,900
The one he is targeting is me.

59
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,420
If Cang Hong had nothing to hide, why would he bother doing all of this?

60
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:53,080
Luckily, you gave Dan Shu a petal. Otherwise, how else would we break this magical array?

61
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,680
You've learned a thing or two from me, the protector of Yelan Mountain.

62
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,740
- Dan Shu.
- Dan Shu!

63
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,140
Let's go.

64
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,700
Dan Shu?

65
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,140
Thank goodness. He just fainted. His demon soul isn't harmed.

66
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,800
Sect Leader, what are you doing?

67
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,540
The traitor has returned.

68
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:14,680
Have you come to your senses and want to return to your sect?

69
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:21,020
Because you brought back two good selections for my alchemy practice, I would consider it.

70
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,220
Killing demons to make pills and devouring demonic essence are evil arts.

71
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:31,020
But it's also the fastest way to achieve immortality, isn't it?

72
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,780
The demons are wreaking havoc in the mortal world.

73
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,860
They deserve to die.

74
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,200
If they can help me grow my power, their death would mean something.

75
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,560
As long as I get a constant supply of demonic essence, over time,

76
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,500
I shall become the first in Lingxiao Sect to ascend to the Heavenly Realm.

77
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,700
So everyone in Lingxiao Sect is merely a tool for you to gather demonic essence.

78
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,640
Aren't you afraid I'll tell everyone what you've been doing?

79
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,780
You are his pupil indeed.

80
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,520
Tang Jiang said that, too.

81
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:15,640
But soon, you'll end up like him and never be able to speak again.

82
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,100
What does that mean?

83
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,620
Did my master find out about your evil deeds?

84
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,960
So you brutally killed him and framed it on the demons, didn't you?

85
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,940
So what if I did?

86
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,870
It happened so fast. He left me with no choice.

87
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,330
I suppose it was a blessing

88
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:41,200
as it allowed me to train you to become my most successful work.

89
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:46,420
The more you hate demons, the more you can do for me.

90
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,480
You've done so much for me all these years.

91
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,760
Tang Jiang was very merciful to demons.

92
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,240
If he could see how ruthless you were to demons all these years,

93
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,940
he would have been awfully disappointed in you.

94
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,140
No.

95
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,580
This can't be true.

96
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,600
It can't be!

97
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,220
Someone like you wants to ascend to the Heavenly Realm?

98
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,740
In your dreams!

99
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,220
The moment you step into the Nine Heavens, you will be sent to the Heavenly Gallows.

100
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,180
Even burning you to ashes is not enough to punish you for what you did.

101
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,980
The strongest rules the three realms.

102
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:36,260
How dare a demon like you pass judgment on the Heavenly Realm.

103
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,080
"The strongest"?

104
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,680
And how much do you know of the Heavenly Realm?

105
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,160
With what you're capable of, you won't have a chance to understand it.

106
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,400
I suppose your confession now isn't because you've grown a conscience, is it?

107
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,960
How clever.

108
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,660
It almost made me want to spare your life.

109
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,120
Oh, no! He was waiting for his body to absorb the demonic power.

110
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:27,760
From the moment you walked in here, it was destined that you won't get out alive.

111
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,700
I didn't expect the power of the pills could be so powerful.

112
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,920
Now you know what bullying demons gets you.

113
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,340
If it weren't for the demons that were still locked up in here, I would have already torn Lingxiao Sect apart.

114
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:16,120
Your current cultivation base is several times stronger than it was during the day.

115
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,400
Even though you have taken the demonic pills, your power shouldn't be this strong.

116
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,980
This power doesn't come entirely from you, does it?

117
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,720
Yan Dan, I will leave Dan Shu with you.

118
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,260
All right.

119
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,200
Over there!

120
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,360
The demons are over there! Get them!

121
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,660
Hurry!

122
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,160
Tang Zhou, how dare you come back after you betrayed your sect!

123
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,660
You... You unlocked the demon-subduing chain.

124
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,100
This is the only way to drain his demonic power.

125
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,060
Sect Leader... Why is Sect Leader emitting so much demonic essence?

126
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,440
He has been using you.

127
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,760
He has been killing demons to make pills and devouring demonic essence.

128
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,580
After we caught him red-handed, he swallowed hundreds of demonic essence.

129
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,860
That's why he's emitting a strong demonic essence.

130
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,520
We had to tie him up with this chain.

131
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,100
Or else, the innocent lives in the nearby hundreds of miles would have been killed.

132
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,740
Tang Zhou. Why did you poison me?

133
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,460
The one who should be seized is Tang Zhou.

134
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,340
He colluded with demons and tried to attack our sect.

135
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,360
He poisoned and framed me after I caught him.

136
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,040
He knows I hate demons the most so he poisoned me with demonic venom to humiliate me.

137
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,720
How vicious!

138
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:52,160
You taught us Demon Suppression Hall... was a place to redeem evil demons.

139
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,700
And that there is nothing wrong with killing demons and making talismans.

140
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,540
Demon Suppression Hall is right over there.

141
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,340
You can go inside and take a look.

142
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:03,260
Look at the injuries suffered by the demons with weak power.

143
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,920
And you will know who's lying!

144
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,060
Stop deceiving them!

145
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:14,640
If I really killed demons to make pills, there must be traces in Demon Suppression Hall.

146
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:19,120
If you don't believe me, go in and check.

147
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,040
Cang Hong, did you think you could destroy all the evidence by blowing up the alchemy furnace?

148
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,680
You had planned it all out, but you forgot one thing.

149
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,800
You used a fire demon to make pills.

150
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,800
Even if there's only a little spark left, it will find its master.

151
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,220
At this point, what else do you have to say?

152
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:19,520
I, Cang Hong, have failed the ancestors of Lingxiao Sect and Tang Jiang.

153
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,820
I got carried away by my obsession.

154
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:28,920
Tang Zhou, for the sake that I raised and mentor you...

155
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,360
please spare my life.

156
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,800
Watch out!

157
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,360
My ten years of hard work are ruined!

158
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,660
Tang Zhou, I am going to kill you!

159
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:30,420
Cang Hong killed so many demons, yet he ended up dying in front of Demon Suppression Hall.

160
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,400
You reap what you sow.

161
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,200
This is karma.

162
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,180
Sect Leader is dead.

163
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,400
The demon-subduing chain is broken.

164
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,700
Lingxiao Sect... is over.

165
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,180
- Tang Zhou!
- Tang Zhou!

166
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,800
If you want to go in and see him, go ahead.

167
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,140
He fought with Cang Hong while he was not fully recovered.

168
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:34,540
These mortals may not be able to wake him up.

169
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,580
Haven't you been counting the wounded demons?

170
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,960
How did it go?

171
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,560
I've sent Dan Shu and the injured demons back to the mountain to rest.

172
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:50,160
Those who did not return... may never be able to come home with us.

173
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,840
Nevertheless, we have avenged them.

174
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,040
This shouldn't happen again.

175
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,760
Now that the head count is complete, we can leave at any time.

176
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:11,500
But... you and I won't feel at ease until we see Tang Zhou is well.

177
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,400
<i>Senior Brother</i>

178
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,120
Thank goodness, Senior Brother. You're finally awake.

179
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,760
How are the others?

180
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,800
Everyone is fine.

181
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,380
Senior Brother...

182
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:49,580
what you said before is true.

183
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:53,980
Cang Hong... has been using all of us.

184
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,800
Brother Tang Zhou, I'm sorry.

185
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,900
We were wrong about you.

186
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,400
Now that the corrupt leader is gone, the future of Lingxiao Sect will depend on you.

187
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,010
- That's right.
- That's right.

188
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:09,080
Cang Hong's evil lies in his selfish interest.

189
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:14,220
Everyone of Lingxiao Sect has made a lot of mistakes because of him.

190
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,220
Now, what we should think about is

191
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,580
how we should live with ourselves in the future.

192
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,100
Yes.

193
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,680
There have been debates among our sect over the past few days.

194
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,460
We don't know if we should continue to kill demons in the future.

195
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,640
We even had to argue for a long time before we finally decided to free

196
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,760
those demons in Demon Suppression Hall.

197
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,240
The fact that you freed those demons

198
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,160
showed that Lingxiao Sect is now different after what has happened.

199
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,540
Not all demons are evil.

200
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:52,380
The harsh rules set by Cang Hong can be abolished after you discuss among yourselves.

201
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,840
As for how to act in the future...

202
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,960
the whole sect should decide together.

203
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:09,980
Qin Qi, you have a kind nature, and you're the social one in the sect.

204
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,660
You will take the lead in all affairs of the sect.

205
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,500
I understand.

206
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:25,400
I'm afraid that the news of Lingxiao Sect being in chaos will get out soon.

207
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,180
Evil demons who want to seek revenge will take advantage of the situation.

208
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:33,400
We must strengthen our patrols these days.

209
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,920
Senior Dao Yuan is highly skilled in spells.

210
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,140
When he has calmed down, you must do what he says.

211
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,720
You have thought of everything, Brother Tang Zhou.

212
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,220
I'll tell Senior Dao Yuan later.

213
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,960
Don't worry.

214
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,920
Lingxiao Sect will get through this.

215
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,480
Why haven't you gone in?

216
00:21:02,225 --> 00:21:04,841
<i>[Yiyun Abode]</i>

217
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,580
Senior, you haven't recovered yet.

218
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,160
Where are you going?

219
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,480
I am no longer a disciple of Lingxiao Sect. I'm leaving, of course.

220
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,200
But Cang Hong is dead.

221
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,340
You are the sole successor.

222
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,920
You gave so many instructions just now.

223
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,060
Aren't you going to get through this with us and revive Lingxiao Sect?

224
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,880
<i>That's right, Senior Brother.</i>

225
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:39,180
I gave those instructions to fulfill my final duty as a former Lingxiao Sect disciple.

226
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:43,540
Now I am no longer the heir of the sect.

227
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,520
I am by myself now.

228
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,360
Take care, everyone.

229
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,600
Brother Tang Zhou. Brother Tang Zhou.

230
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,580
If you leave, Lingxiao sect will fall apart.

231
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:04,000
Senior Brother, you are the only one who can take charge and be the sect leader.

232
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,440
Are you going to leave even though we have pleaded with you to stay?

233
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,440
You should all go back.

234
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,100
When I was on the path of cultivation, everything I did was for the greater good.

235
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:22,160
Now I just want to live for myself.

236
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,380
Lingxiao Sect is like a dream in the past for me.

237
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,280
There's no way for me to return.

238
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,500
<i>[Lingxiao Sect]</i>

239
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,540
Yan Dan?

240
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,460
Tang Zhou isn't Ying Yuan after all.

241
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:50,340
He cares about responsibility as much as Ying Yuan, but he is not bound by it.

242
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,940
You...

243
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,800
What do you think of Ying Yuan?

244
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,140
I suddenly feel a little sorry for him.

245
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,600
Tang Zhou, a mortal, can at least choose to live as he wishes,

246
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,360
but as an emperor, he didn't even have the right to choose.

247
00:23:08,575 --> 00:23:12,760
<i>[Tomb of Late Master, Tang Jiang]</i>

248
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:19,520
I have let you down, Master.

249
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,080
All these years, I was fooled by Cang Hong.

250
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,280
Not only did I not avenge you,

251
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,220
I assisted him.

252
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,240
All those things that I did...

253
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,200
seem ridiculous now.

254
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:44,120
If you saw it in the underworld, you must be very disappointed in me.

255
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,920
Fortunately, justice has been served.

256
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,360
Your death...

257
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,260
has finally been avenged.

258
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,320
This is the jade gourd you gave me...

259
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,740
when I caught my first demon.

260
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,640
I have never forgotten...

261
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:34,260
the skills you taught me.

262
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,720
But now...

263
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:57,100
I'm afraid I can no longer do this.

264
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:05,120
Master... I'm sorry.

265
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,600
I'm sorry, Master.

266
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:50,852
<i>[Tomb of Late Master, Tang Jiang]</i>

267
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,920
Tang Zhou.

268
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,800
I have been through so much lately.

269
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,320
I need some time alone.

270
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,200
Stop following me.

271
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,620
Stop drinking.

272
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,880
What are you still doing here?

273
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:48,120
Didn't you put the Distance-Keeping Lock on me to stop me from getting close to you?

274
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:57,280
If you want to escape or want to vent, Yu Mo and I will stay with you.

275
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,080
But you need to stop drinking.

276
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,200
Your wound is not healed yet.

277
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,660
You don't need to act like this.

278
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,820
We are not the same kind of people after all.

279
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:12,420
Tell me then, what kind of person are you?

280
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,280
Since I was little...

281
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,640
I had been cultivating to catch demons.

282
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,680
And I always thought it was my path.

283
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:27,960
Now it turned out to be a scam.

284
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,660
I always thought...

285
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,260
I was executing justice.

286
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:40,340
I didn't realize I had killed so many innocent demons.

287
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,080
Now that I have lost all my cultivation...

288
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,900
I don't know where my future lies.

289
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,280
I am no longer a demon catcher.

290
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,700
But who is Demon Catcher...

291
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,260
Tang Zhou?

292
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,040
Am I that imaginary deity?

293
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,560
No. I'm not him.

294
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,300
But I'm not me either.

295
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:21,240
Excuse me. Get me another jug of liquor.

296
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,560
You got it.

297
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,220
No need.

298
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,600
Yan Dan, you don't have to feel sorry for me.

299
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,640
You should go.

300
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,000
Stop drinking.

301
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,040
Tang Zhou!

302
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,980
If I didn't do that, he wouldn't stop.

303
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:18,340
He has lost his power and been through a vicious battle.

304
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,560
The traces of the celestial vest in his body have expanded again.

305
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,400
He must find the next divine tool as soon as he can.

306
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,720
If he fails, the celestial vest in his body will burst.

307
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,920
He will die.

308
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:37,200
I think he knows. What Cang Hong did is too big a blow to him.

309
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,060
The priority now is to help him get over this.

310
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,840
Otherwise, he won't continue to look for other divine tools.

311
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:47,660
Yu Mo, if we succeed in convincing him,

312
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:51,660
can we keep searching for the divine tools with him?

313
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,700
Mortal Tang Zhou is our friend.

314
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,760
Of course, I'm willing to help him.

315
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,800
You are here.

316
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,440
The tavern is closed. The suburb is haunted.

317
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,660
The owner got frightened and became ill when he passed by the area.

318
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:56,320
If you still want to drink in the future, why don't we go check it out?

319
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,640
Consider it eliminating the evil for the people.

320
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,680
The owner said you owe him a lot of money for the liquor.

321
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:11,480
You may no longer be a demon catcher, but you can still be a decent human being, right?

322
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,150
<i> Leave me alone!</i>

323
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,130
<i> Please let us go.</i>

324
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,070
<i> Please let us go.</i>

325
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,420
<i> Please let us go.</i>

326
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,960
This place is only ten miles away from Lingxiao Sect.

327
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,880
No demon has ever dared to approach here.

328
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,060
You have a lot of nerve.

329
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,720
Aren't you afraid of being caught?

330
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,460
We didn't dare to come here before, but we heard that Lingxiao Sect is in chaos, so we are free.

331
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,940
You think you can cause rouble because no one is protecting this place?

332
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,960
Do you know you are embarrassing us demons?

333
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,660
We... We were just pulling pranks on the mortals.

334
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,340
We have no intention of hurting them.

335
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:00,160
It's only funny when they find it funny.

336
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,680
You are just scaring them.

337
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,100
Sit properly! Reflect on your actions.

338
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:12,040
Tang Zhou, the fault of Lingxiao Sect is the fault of Cang Hong alone.

339
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:18,320
Over the years, the disciples have been subduing demons and have protected many people.

340
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,260
The demons in the mortal world have different tempers and characters.

341
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:27,720
As the chief of Yelan Mountain, I know how hard it is to discipline them.

342
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:32,020
Besides, eliminating evil demons is a meritorious service for both mortals and demons.

343
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,800
You don't have to blame yourself.

344
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:40,640
You three little rat demons, don't think you can do whatever you want just because you're demons.

345
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,920
Being born into this world, it doesn't matter whether we are mortal or demon,

346
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:49,560
what matters is what kind of person or demon we want to be.

347
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,500
Look at this man next to me.

348
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:56,100
He is no longer a demon catcher, nor does he follow the ways of Lingxiao Sect,

349
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,520
but he is still eliminating evil and doing good, being a good person.

350
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,960
You should learn from him. Do you understand?

351
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,020
<i>Yes.</i>

352
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:10,200
Did the tavern owner... really get frightened and become sick?

353
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:15,040
We paid him to close his business.

354
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,540
But these little boys really did scare people.

355
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,040
Those people did get sick after being frightened by them.

356
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:31,440
Do you think we're helping him by doing this?

357
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,960
I don't know what's on his mind.

358
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,900
I think we should just give him a good beating.

359
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,440
He deserves a beating.

360
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,060
I'd better go check on him.

361
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,760
I will leave these rat demons to you.

362
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,120
Teach them well.

363
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,640
Stay safe.

364
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,560
You'd better reflect on yourselves.

365
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,880
You are hiding here to drink alone.

366
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,820
Are you here to smash my liquor bottles?

367
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,300
You need to have one for me to smash.

368
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:22,780
Enjoying the moon all by yourself, how boring.

369
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,660
I happen to have brought some pastries.

370
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,020
I had wanted to have good food all to myself,

371
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,720
but because you did a good job eliminating demons today,

372
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,540
let's have it together.

373
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:42,140
When I caught you in Lanxi Town, you were posing as a street vendor.

374
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,500
You were selling Snow Jade cakes like this one.

375
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,680
I was hungry, so I had a few pieces.

376
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,420
I still remember its taste.

377
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,780
Don't even bring that up.

378
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,600
It makes me so mad.

379
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,630
When I first met you, you ate so many of my cakes

380
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:01,460
and then you confined me in your jade gourd for a few days.

381
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,680
I almost starved to death.

382
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,900
When I recall that, do you know how much I want to draw a talisman to curse you?

383
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,120
Do you need me to help you with that?

384
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,560
At that time, I thought all demons should be killed.

385
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:20,160
Fortunately, I didn't lock you in Demon Suppression Hall.

386
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,860
From now on...

387
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,420
I should think carefully when I do things.

388
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,000
You just said "from now on"?

389
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,080
Are you feeling better?

390
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,200
I should ask you that.

391
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,320
Are you feeling better?

392
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:44,120
Yan Dan, I already know...

393
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,520
why you distanced yourself from me.

394
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,560
Yu Mo said...

395
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,440
that person hurt you deeply.

396
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,660
On the day of the Lantern Festival...

397
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,060
you smiled with so much joy.

398
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:05,700
So I suppose you feel better now.

399
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:15,880
I thought I'd leave after I made sure you were fine,

400
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:20,280
who knew I'd get you into another mess.

401
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:25,100
On the day of the Lantern Festival, I saw your lantern.

402
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:31,430
When I was poisoned with chill venom, someone put a piece of lava outside Shenxiao Palace.

403
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:33,880
It was you, wasn't it?

404
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,340
Thank you for all that you have done for me.

405
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,820
Yan Dan, you are thanking me all of a sudden.

406
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,380
I'm not used to hearing that.

407
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,880
But I still want to know...

408
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,380
are you feeling better now?

409
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,040
Have some more.

410
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,740
What happened to your hand?

411
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,960
Nothing. I scratched it by accident.

412
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,580
You should have some, too.

413
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,680
This still tastes the same as before.

414
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,740
Yan Dan...

415
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,660
Yan Dan...

416
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,600
Go, Yan Dan!

417
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,760
Yan Dan!

418
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,460
I won't point my sword at you anymore.

419
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,000
I told you I won't point my sword at you anymore.

420
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,720
Yan Dan. Yan Dan...

421
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,620
This explains the scratch.

422
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:23,560
You don't want to hurt me even in your dreams.

423
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,800
<i>Yet I can't requite your feelings for me.</i>

424
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,020
<i>I can only give you a sweet dream you desire.</i>

425
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,440
All our rare ingredients for liquor brewery are here.

426
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,800
Please take your time, Miss.

427
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:51,030
<i>Hundred-Flower Dew is easy to find in the Heavenly Realm, but it's a rarity in the mortal world.</i>

428
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,660
<i>This is the eighth shop.</i>

429
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,780
<i>Don't let me down again.</i>

430
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,280
Boss, is this Hundred-Flower Dew?

431
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,760
Miss, you have a good eye.

432
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:08,200
It's my family's secret recipe which is said to have been handed down from ancient times.

433
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,660
It is the collection of the first dew of hundreds of flowers.

434
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:14,720
But this item costs 150 taels of silver.

435
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,340
I will take it.

436
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,400
After you recovered your memory, you've changed quite a lot.

437
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,740
Maybe you should take over my place as the chief of Yelan Mountain.

438
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,810
Knock it off.

439
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:31,810
Now I just want to protect the ones that I care about. The rest is just vain glory.

440
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:35,080
Then why did you suddenly think of making As You Wish Wine?

441
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,280
Tang Zhou has been having nightmares.

442
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,360
As his friend, I don't want to see him suffer.

443
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,880
So I want to let him try this.

444
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,020
Qin Qi?

445
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,280
Yan Dan?

446
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,200
What are you doing here? Are you here for Tang Zhou?

447
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,040
- I...
- Senior Sister!

448
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,420
Where is the cat demon?

449
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,140
The cat demon is too cunning.

450
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,380
He got away again.

451
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,640
The cat demon has disturbed my family for days.

452
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,680
He has been harassing my daughter.

453
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,900
She has been so scared that she can't eat and sleep.

454
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,760
I thought you could subdue demons.

455
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,000
Turns out the famous Lingxiao Sect

456
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,700
can't even catch a cat demon with so many disciples dispatched.

457
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,340
Your reputation is exaggerated.

458
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,040
Useless!

459
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,760
If you can't catch the demon, I won't pay you anything.

460
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,860
You should stop catching demons.

461
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:41,420
Get a new profession while you still can.

462
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,460
Please stay.

463
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:47,100
Lingxiao Sect is not what you think it is.

464
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,290
Are you from Lingxiao Sect, too?

465
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:51,190
We are not from Lingxiao Sect,

466
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:54,280
but we are very much indebted to the demon catchers of Lingxiao Sect.

467
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,680
My family was once captured by an evil demon.

468
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:02,520
Thanks to the demon catchers of Lingxiao Sect, my family was saved.

469
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,360
I will never forget your great kindness.

470
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,540
That must be the former Lingxiao Sect you're talking about.

471
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:13,180
Now their leader is dead, leaving them leaderless.

472
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,240
When facing a demon, one disciple wanted to do this,

473
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,660
one disciple wanted to do that, another wanted to do something else.

474
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,840
They started fighting among themselves.

475
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,320
The cat demon turned my family upside down.

476
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:26,880
Two groups of demon catchers came and almost tore my house down!

477
