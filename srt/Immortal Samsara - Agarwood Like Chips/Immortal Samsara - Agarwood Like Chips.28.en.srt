<i>[Episode 28]</i>

15
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,600
The poison is receding, but her demonic essence was damaged.

16
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,900
She can't regain her human form for a while.

17
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,500
The array Yan Dan fell into was unearthly.

18
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,080
It wasn't made by a normal human.

19
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,000
From now on, we will go our separate ways.

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,140
I'm taking Yan Dan with me to get treated.

21
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,580
You can't.

22
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,190
Why not?

23
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:13,240
You came here for your mission. It has nothing to do with Yan Dan.

24
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,300
You have no reason to stop me from taking her back.

25
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,880
Yan Dan's assailant probably caused the unusual incidents in the palace.

26
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,460
Many women in the capital city are missing.

27
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,700
Everyone fears for their lives. People aren't leaving their homes.

28
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,340
Perhaps that was when Yan Dan was targeted.

29
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,440
Spare me your theories.

30
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,980
Your duty is to capture demons.

31
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,780
My duty is to keep Yan Dan safe.

32
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,960
As for the assailant's identity, it doesn't really matter to me.

33
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,560
I believe the Yelan Mountain hot spring can help her recover.

34
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,140
<i>I got into this mess because I wanted to stay away from your bickering.</i>

35
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,140
<i>I was transformed to my original form. And now, you're at it again!</i>

36
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,840
<i>Please work together, for once.</i>

37
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,020
<i>Yu Mo, we left the mountain to do a good deed every day.</i>

38
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:10,720
If evil demons are tarnishing our good name, we must stop them.

39
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,940
<i>Show them who's the king of all demons!</i>

40
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,400
<i>Prove yourself to the Lingxiao Sect. Find out who's behind all of this.</i>

41
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,600
Besides, if we get to the bottom of this mystery,

42
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,280
<i>I can use it for my book, "A Mortal World Diary."</i>

43
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,800
Not only will it be entertaining, but it will also serve as advice.

44
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
What about you?

45
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,600
<i>Relax. I know enough about my demonic essence.</i>

46
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,200
<i>I'll be fine.</i>

47
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,540
<i>Besides, I plan to endure mortal trials and write inspiring stories.</i>

48
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,340
Stop hesitating!

49
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:45,440
I believe that, with our combined ingenuity, we can find the culprit.

50
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,240
Then I'll be able to remove this poison.

51
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,180
You're the king of all demons. Surely you're wiser than a lotus demon.

52
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,580
I'm only willing to overlook this for Yan Dan's sake.

53
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,580
I'm going after the evil demon. Don't get in my way.

54
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,260
The evil demon is in the palace. Please help us now!

55
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,400
Jiang Chen!

56
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,780
That's right. I killed those women!

57
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,760
This is all my fault.

58
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,540
Vile demon! How dare you bewitch His Majesty and harm innocent people!

59
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,360
I will cleanse this palace of your evil for the good of the people!

60
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,660
- My beloved consort!
- Your Majesty , stay back!

61
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,180
Her demonic power hasn't been drained. Don't come any closer!

62
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,200
She is full of grudges. She might harm you!

63
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,500
Jiang Chen?

64
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,020
Pei Luo...

65
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:02,460
I... I wish I could turn back time... to the day where we first met.

66
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,100
<i>You are just as frail and delicate as I am.</i>

67
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,580
<i>You, too, are alone in this world.</i>

68
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,000
<i>We have a lot in common.</i>

69
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,140
<i>Would you let me keep you company?</i>

70
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,140
<i>Umbrella for sale. Buy your umbrella here!</i>

71
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,640
<i>Sir, check out these umbrellas.</i>

72
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,160
<i>That's a nice one.</i>

73
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,940
<i>Sir, I'll buy this umbrella.</i>

74
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,840
<i>Is this yours?</i>

75
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,580
<i>Thank you.</i>

76
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,080
Who would have thought...

77
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,480
this is how it all ends?

78
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,400
But I regret nothing.

79
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,800
I'll always remember that umbrella.

80
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,260
But from now on...

81
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,400
no one will be there to hold an umbrella for you in the rain.

82
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,620
Take care of yourself.

83
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,620
Pei Luo.

84
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,400
Could you hold me in your arms one last time?

85
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,440
If I can die in your arms...

86
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,240
I shall have no regrets.

87
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,820
Your Majesty.

88
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,580
Your Majesty gave orders slay this demon. She likely hates you.

89
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,980
Do not fall for her deceptive words!

90
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,400
Jiang Chen.

91
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,640
Our memories will always stay in my heart. I won't forget them.

92
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:57,180
But you committed great sins and left me with no choice.

93
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,400
Please do not resent me for this.

94
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,290
"The sky above and the depths below,"

95
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,810
"the heart lingers as tears run dry,"

96
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:15,800
"this is the end, love of mine."

97
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,720
Your Majesty. Her demon essence was crushed.

98
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,160
She will perish soon.

99
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,540
The aura of resentment is strong and will infect your body.

100
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,820
Please leave the vicinity.

101
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,140
Your Majesty. What he said is right.

102
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,340
We will alleviate her grudge.

103
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,480
Miss Jiang Chen.

104
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,640
Jiang Chen!

105
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,040
Miss Jiang Chen.

106
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,360
You had the Extraordinary Eye. What happened to you?

107
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,060
The flower demon Yu Mo can't seem to forget is actually Jiang Chen.

108
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,900
I’m sorry.

109
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,280
The Extraordinary Eye...

110
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,620
Miss Jiang Chen...

111
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,040
<i>Jiang Chen!</i>

112
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,460
<i>Jiang Chen!</i>

113
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:04,280
We agreed... that when I finished the script...

114
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,780
you'd be the actress in my play.

115
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,440
<i>I've held on to my end of the promise.</i>

116
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,320
I just completed the prologue...

117
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,820
but you broke your promise.

118
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,640
Jiang Chen!

119
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:50,060
<i>Unexpectedly, the frail prince Jiang Chen loved became King of Andu.</i>

120
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,620
<i>The Flower Spirit Clan is always true to their nature.</i>

121
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,580
<i>They would never harm anyone.</i>

122
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,140
I secretly examined her demonic essence.

123
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,340
She didn’t have any demonic power left.

124
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:08,680
It seems that she didn't cause the unusual events in the palace.

125
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,140
<i>In that case, why did those Taoist Masters still act like it was her?</i>

126
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,700
<i>Why work so hard to build a massive demon-trapping array?</i>

127
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:19,740
Evil demons always work in secret so nothing will be traced back to them.

128
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,570
<i>I recognize Jiang Chen's spells. She wasn't the one who hurt me.</i>

129
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,370
<i>Jiang Chen was a close friend.</i>

130
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,680
We must figure out a way to clear her name.

131
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:38,180
Taoist Master Tang, your mission here is to capture evil demons.

132
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:43,060
Jiang Chen is dead. She wasn't your friend.

133
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:47,540
You should get your reward and leave as soon as possible.

134
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,720
Epiphyllum typically blooms for a very short period of time.

135
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,000
But these epiphyllum in the palace are always blooming.

136
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,260
The flowers are catalyzed by demonic spells to ward off evil demons.

137
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:09,360
Therefore, as long as the real culprit is here, I can't leave.

138
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,380
But you are a demon catcher.

139
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,560
Why would you sympathize with a demon?

140
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,220
Some demons are kind.

141
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,680
If Jiang Chen wasn't the culprit, we shouldn't let her die without justice.

142
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,460
<i>You are both very kind. Why must you fight each other?</i>

143
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,380
<i>Yu Mo.</i>

144
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,640
Yu Mo!

145
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,200
<i>That's more like it.</i>

146
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,560
Shake hands and make peace. Solve the case together.

147
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,840
We must prove Jiang Chen's innocence.

148
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,620
I never said I'd let him go.

149
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,520
When the work is done, we'll settle our dispute.

150
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,060
No problem.

151
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,300
You did a great job catching the evil demon.

152
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,000
I hereby reward you with ten thousand taels of gold.

153
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,260
Starting today, a notice will be posted.

154
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,420
The threat was neutralized. The people can now live in peace.

155
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,040
<i>Much thanks, Your Majesty.</i>

156
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,720
Your Majesty.

157
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:47,120
My junior once worked with Consort Jiang Chen in a troupe outside the palace.

158
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,120
She didn't know Consort Jiang Chen was a demon.

159
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,660
But she knew Consort Jiang Chen had a kind heart.

160
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,440
She would never commit such heinous crimes.

161
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,020
I suspect there is more to this case.

162
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,320
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

163
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,360
That is a very bold claim!

164
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,300
Since your junior befriended a demon, are you two—

165
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,980
He is actually my—

166
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,840
Taoist Master Tang. Don't waste your time on them.

167
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:20,380
We are both from the Lingxiao Sect.

168
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,420
I am his senior and he is my junior.

169
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,100
The Lingxiao Sect is a prestigious sect.

170
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,260
Lesser sects such as yours have no right to smear our name.

171
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,480
Watch yourself out here.

172
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,660
You mentioned that your junior knew Jiang Chen.

173
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:42,820
Since you are defending her, I can tell you are an honorable person.

174
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,600
But I've drawn my own conclusion on the matter.

175
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,140
You shouldn't interfere.

176
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,480
Your Majesty,

177
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,740
I overheard the poem Consort Jiang Chen was reciting.

178
00:16:54,740 --> 00:17:00,780
I speculate that her words had a hidden meaning.

179
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:05,100
Perhaps... she left some clues behind in the palace.

180
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:12,600
Of course, only Your Majesty can know for sure.

181
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:32,360
"The sky above and the depths below."

182
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,660
She has descended into the afterlife.

183
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,520
So the sky above...

184
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,620
<i>[Sky]</i>

185
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,840
Your Majesty. Let me give it a try.

186
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,860
<i>[Delight of Flower]</i>

187
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,540
Your Majesty, a special spell was cast on this wooden case.

188
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,540
A normal spell can't open it.

189
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,020
We might need another way to open it.

190
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:38,940
Since you found this case, I believe you can also open it.

191
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,840
This is the last keepsake from my beloved consort.

192
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,120
I'll wait in the back garden, at midnight.

193
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:11,620
<i>He saw right through the hidden meaning of Jiang Chen's poem.</i>

194
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,820
<i>Perhaps the rumors are true.</i>

195
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,780
Yu Mo proposed to Jiang Chen but was rejected.

196
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:21,840
It seems Yu Mo really loves and cares about Jiang Chen.

197
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,260
<i>[Memorial Tablet of Beloved Consort Jiang Chen]</i>

198
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,120
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

199
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,200
My beloved consort is no longer in this world.

200
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,040
I buried some of her clothing here.

201
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,240
I built her a tomb.

202
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,280
She used to love plum wine.

203
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,280
I ordered several jars made just for her.

204
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,960
I'll pay tribute to her tonight.

205
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,660
May she find peace in the afterlife.

206
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:20,220
If Your Majesty loves her so... why did you order her execution?

207
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,180
There were things I couldn't tell anyone.

208
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:35,180
But since you mentioned that your junior knew Jiang Chen, I wanted to have a word with you.

209
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:39,360
Jiang Chen and I loved each other.

210
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,980
She always cared about my well-being.

211
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,340
But I suffered from a strange illness.

212
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:49,560
She developed the plan to sacrifice humans to make the medicine to cure me.

213
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:56,020
Even though she did it for me, she still committed great sins.

214
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,200
She cannot be absolved of her crimes.

215
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,580
The women who lost their lives deserved justice.

216
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,280
Your Majesty's love for her runs deep.

217
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,140
Many innocent women died, but the epiphyllum are still blooming.

218
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:18,720
If we don't purify the palace, it will be haunted by vengeful souls.

219
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,730
Please let us stay for some time so we can drive off the vengeful souls and alleviate their grudges.

220
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,360
I'll leave the task to you.

221
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:33,840
Consort Jiang Chen was a famous actress in Liyuan. She knew alchemy.

222
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,560
Your Majesty suspected nothing.

223
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:41,080
That means Your Majesty knew she was a demon.

224
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,260
Correct.

225
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,160
I knew her true identity.

226
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,440
I was recuperating in the southern capital.

227
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,180
People were coming after my life.

228
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,380
She once showed her true form to save my life.

00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,400
<i>I didn't tell you my true identity in the past.</i>

235
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,000
<i>I lied to you.</i>

236
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
<i>Do you resent me for it?</i>

237
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,200
<i>I am a demon.</i>

238
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,500
<i>Aren't you afraid?</i>

239
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:09,700
<i>Did you know that... in my eyes, you look more like a fairy?</i>

240
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,600
<i>Whatever you are... you saved my life... and kept me company.</i>

241
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,600
I believed her heart was pure and innocent.

242
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,000
It didn't matter whether she was human or a demon.

243
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,900
After I became King of Andu, I made her my consort.

244
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,600
But in the end, her love clouded her judgment.

245
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,700
She committed murders to treat me.

246
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,700
I failed her.

247
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,500
Consort Jiang Chen and I... knew each other.

248
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:47,400
Knowing that she passed away... brings me great grief.

249
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:52,800
Could I use the plum wine you prepared...

250
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,600
to pay tribute to her and pray that she finds peace in the afterlife?

251
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,500
<i>He does have the Extraordinary Eye.</i>

252
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,100
<i>Why does he wear an amulet that wards off demons?</i>

253
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,800
<i>As long as he wears it, I can't retrieve the Extraordinary Eye.</i>

254
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:28,000
I'm glad to have you here... to mourn her passing... with me.

255
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,400
She is in a better place now.

256
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,000
You have my condolences.

257
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:56,200
It wasn't easy to take you away from Tang Zhou.

258
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,000
This is a reunion for both of us.

259
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,400
Would you like some tea?

260
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,400
What's wrong?

261
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,800
You seem lifeless today.

262
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,300
Are you upset? Is something troubling you?

263
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,900
Would you like... to talk about it with me?

264
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,600
Yu Mo! How did you get inside here?

265
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,500
You shouldn't have sneaked out. Now you know how much I care about you.

266
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,000
This is blossom dew. It can nourish your demonic essence.

267
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,400
Drink it up.

268
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,400
I didn't think Jiang Chen's passing would be what reunited us.

269
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,700
Yu Mo, how are you doing?

270
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,900
I found you. I feel great.

271
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,600
<i>Yu Mo gave his most precious Extraordinary Eye to Jiang Chen.</i>

272
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,400
<i>He must really love her.</i>

273
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,400
<i>Now that Jiang Chen is gone, I doubt he would tell anyone his grievance.</i>

274
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,600
<i>I shouldn't bring it up again. It'd only hurt him even more.</i>

275
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,100
Yan Dan?

276
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:30,600
The wood case you found earlier bears the emblem of Flower Spirit Clan's Heart-Twining Vine.

277
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,400
Each vine plant unlocks in a different way.

278
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,700
- You must learn as much as you can to find a way to open it.
- Yes.

279
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,000
One more thing. I know how important the Extraordinary Eye is to you.

280
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,600
Don't worry. I will surely help you find it.

281
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,800
I already know where it is.

282
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,700
It's just that I can't retrieve it for now.

283
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,600
When the time is right, I will get it back.

284
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,000
The Extraordinary Eye can help you regain your human form.

285
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,200
Then, we can go home together.

286
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,300
Where is Yu Mo? Why isn't he here to be your bodyguard?

287
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,800
<i>Mountain Chief just lost his loved one.</i>

288
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,800
<i>He needs some time alone to mourn her passing.</i>

289
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,100
<i>Give him some time.</i>

290
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,800
He liked Jiang Chen?

291
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,200
<i>Yu Mo once gave his most precious belonging to her.</i>

292
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,200
But in the end, Jiang Chen chose someone else.

293
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,400
After all these years, Yu Mo still hasn't forgotten her.

294
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,800
But the day they reunited was the day he lost her for good.

295
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,800
Of course, Yu Mo would be upset.

296
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,800
<i>If he ever rubs you the wrong way, please show some tolerance.</i>

297
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,000
<i>What is this?</i>

298
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,300
This is a cleansing talisman used to purify vengeful souls.

299
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,200
That wicked consort must be powerful.

300
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,000
Not even a Demon Catcher from the Lingxiao Sect can get rid of these flowers.

301
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
- What should we do now?
<i> - What should we do now?</i>

302
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,900
Taoist Master Tang.

303
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,800
May I know when these flowers first appeared?

304
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:52,500
On the fifth of this month, many women in the capital, who were born at midnight, went missing.

305
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,100
It struck fear into everyone.

306
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:58,100
On the tenth, these flowers began to appear outside Consort Jiang Chen's palace.

307
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,000
She must have consumed those women alive.

308
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,800
That's why their souls won't leave.

309
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,900
Were these flowers the first unusual incident?

310
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,200
What about the river of blood and the crows?

311
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,100
After the epiphyllum began to grow, His Majesty summoned the demon catchers the following day.

312
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,200
But Consort Jiang Chen wasn't scared at all.

313
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,100
She even became more aggressive.

314
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,200
A few days later, the city moat suddenly turned blood red.

315
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,400
