<i>[Episode 48]</i>

15
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,379
I'm Zhi Xi, Curator of Magical Pavilion. Greetings, Your Supreme Majesty.

16
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:48,519
I was commanded to go to Yelan Mountain to retrieve the divine tool.

17
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:51,299
Coincidentally, I found Emperor Ying Yuan there.

18
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,800
He was in danger, and it was urgent.

19
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,000
Trying to help His Majesty return to his place delayed my return.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,499
I'm willing to accept any punishment.

21
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:07,400
As you found the divine tool and got His Majesty back, you've done a great job.

22
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,979
Why would I want to punish you?

23
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:18,600
Emperor Ying Yuan told me that Fairy Zhi Xi is smart and brave.

24
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,199
I'll grant the Magical Pavilion a Meritorious Seal.

25
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,979
You'll be granted a thousand years of cultivation base.

26
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:27,439
You’ll be promoted to third-rank official and elevated to deity level.

27
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,139
Thank you for bestowing the rewards upon me.

28
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:32,500
Well, you may get up.

29
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:45,520
Emperor Ying Yuan told me that your sister, Yan Dan, ripped out her heart to rescue him in the Mortal Realm.

30
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,590
Is that true?

31
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,859
Yes, it is.

32
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:54,920
Ying Yuan even said that he's deeply in love with your sister.

33
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,199
Do you know that?

34
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:02,200
<i>Since His Supreme Majesty is asking me this, is he going to punish Yan Dan for seducing His Majesty?</i>

35
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,260
Your Supreme Majesty, His Majesty has returned to his place.

36
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,179
But Yan Dan is a demon now.

37
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:10,800
Both of them are in different worlds. It's hard for them to see each other.

38
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,300
Besides, Yan Dan has already made it clear that she wants nothing more to do with His Majesty.

39
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,400
As they can't develop this relationship, it'll end sooner or later.

40
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,819
It won't affect His Majesty.

41
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:29,119
Then is it possible for your sister to change her mind?

42
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,999
Your Supreme Majesty, you mean...

43
00:03:31,999 --> 00:03:35,019
Your sister ripped out her heart to save Ying Yuan.

44
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:38,860
And Ying Yuan is deeply in love with your sister.

45
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,339
If he's willing to let go of his divine rank and become a mortal,

46
00:03:42,339 --> 00:03:47,819
then he and your sister will become a wonderful couple.

<i>[Magical Pavilion]</i>

48
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,900
Your Majesty.

49
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,039
Is Yan Dan awake?

50
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,419
Yan Dan is not yet awake. But she's fine.

51
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:17,239
Yu Mo is taking care of her delicately. Please be rest assured.

52
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:19,259
I haven't thanked you yet.

53
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:25,300
Yan Dan ended up like this... because of me.

54
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:30,119
I'll be sure to repay you for risking your life to save her.

55
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:35,500
<i>Your Majesty, will you be able to give up your divine rank to be with Yan Dan?</i>

56
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,239
As she's safe now, I should go back and investigate the case.

57
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,559
I hope that you can uncover the truth soon,

58
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:49,500
in order to punish the culprits and restore peace in the Nine Heavens.

59
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,859
Please don't move.

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,800
Zi Yan, why are you crying?

61
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,719
I planted this peach tree.

62
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,079
I watered it every day.

63
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:25,600
I was looking forward to seeing it bloom and bear peaches.

64
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,779
But now, the mountain has collapsed. And the branches are broken.

65
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,500
Zi Yan, I've got an idea.

66
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,500
- Really?
- Yes.

67
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,800
Right now, on the entire mountain, only Miss Yan Dan's room hasn’t been destroyed.

68
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,000
That's because Mountain Chief has used his Power of the Nine Fins to protect sister Yan Dan's room.

69
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,930
In order to make Sister Yan Dan wake up sooner,

70
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,100
Mountain Chief also transfers his spiritual power to her day and night.

71
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,100
This means that the spiritual power is now gathering under the window sill of her room.

72
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,919
It's very favorable for the regrowth of plants.

73
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:00,959
Let's plant it there.

74
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,800
- Sure.
- Let's go.

75
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,700
<i>It's all because of me that Yelan Mountain has become like this.</i>

76
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,200
Your Majesty. The recent letters from the Mortal Realm are all here.

77
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,900
I shall read them myself. You may leave.

78
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,600
Tianxin Temple is remote and extremely cold.

79
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,479
We use the divine tool, Fire Crystal, for heating.

80
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,079
I've also prepared one for you.

81
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,190
You shouldn't show up when I’m in the Heaven Realm due to your identity.

82
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,830
Please be invisible.

83
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,100
Tell me, since you've regained all your memory,

84
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:33,000
why haven't you asked me about your time with Yan Dan in the Mortal Realm?

85
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,660
The moment I regained my memory, I guessed the reason why you hid the truth.

86
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,400
Therefore, why should I ask?

87
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,859
I'm different from the sanctimonious deities in the Heaven Realm.

88
00:07:47,859 --> 00:07:52,199
I'm worried you may follow in the footsteps of my previous owner.

89
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:58,700
However, I can see that the flower demon cares a lot about you indeed.

90
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,700
All right. I approve of your marriage.

91
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,299
If you want to defy the Heavenly Rules, I'll help you.

92
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,320
<i>[Demons are rampaging in Ciyuan Village. Please look into it, Your Supreme Majesty.]</i>

93
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,419
<i>No letters from Fengquan Valley.</i>

94
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,719
<i>They were intercepted indeed.</i>

95
00:08:33,699 --> 00:08:36,019
<i>Fire Crystals are made out of heavenly fire.</i>

96
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:37,880
<i>It's hard and almost unbreakable.</i>

97
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,370
<i>Why is it cracking all of a sudden?</i>

98
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,939
<i>- Fire! Fire!
- This fire is burning too fast.</i>

99
00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:06,319
<i>It's not a normal fire.</i>

100
00:09:06,319 --> 00:09:08,759
<i>Someone is behind this.</i>

101
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,959
Tai You?

102
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:26,500
Your Majesty. I hope you are not hurt.

103
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:31,779
The Heavenly Soldiers on guard reported a fire, so I rushed here immediately.

104
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,200
The fire is burning violently in the south. I'll go provide relief.

105
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,079
Your Majesty. I shall leave this to you.

106
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,119
<i>Tai You's palace is far from here.</i>

107
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:50,979
<i>How could he get here so quickly?</i>

108
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,200
I've scouted around Tianxin Temple.

109
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,200
I didn't find any trace of a suspicious spell.
<i>[Tianxin Temple]</i>

110
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,600
Perhaps the Fire Crystal hasn’t been changed for too long.

111
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,000
There were hidden dangers after years of usage.

112
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,700
<i>The fire spread too quickly.</i>

113
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,200
<i>It wasn't a normal fire.</i>

114
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,400
<i>Someone must have tempered with it.</i>

115
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,600
Fortunately, we were there in time to put out the fire.

116
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,400
The damage to Tianxin Temple isn't so serious.

117
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,800
Only some book collections were damaged.

118
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,400
Thank you for your help, Your Majesty.

119
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,000
You saved me from the dereliction of duty.

120
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,500
Star Deity, you don’t need to thank me.

121
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,300
<i>It's barely seven days, yet his hands have no black spots at all.</i>

122
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,800
I was wondering who that was.

123
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,000
Isn't this the useless Head of Heavenly Soldiers, Star Deity Tai You,

124
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,400
who claimed to have trained soldiers for a hundred years, yet couldn't even stop the fire?

125
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,500
Marshal Huo De, the former Head of Heavenly Soldiers.

126
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,900
You're still as imposing.

127
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,800
Your Majesty, I have to report to His Supreme Majesty.

128
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,600
- I shall take my leave now.
- Just right!

129
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,300
Ask His Supreme Majesty if anything in the Heaven Realm ever caught fire,

130
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,900
or if anything was lost when I was the Head of Heavenly Soldiers!

131
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,600
Marshal Huo De.

132
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:31,800
Was Tai You really that diligent that he trained soldiers for a hundred years without rest?

133
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,200
Tell me about it.

134
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,600
They use the excuse of military training.

135
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,600
And yet he slept on the field day and night.

136
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,300
The unpleasant duties like going to the Mortal Realm were typically given to others.

137
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,800
I thought he trained his soldiers very well.

138
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,400
But it was just a superficial act.

139
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,800
Totally incompetent idiots!

140
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,200
<i>It seems the mysterious person who has been to the Mortal Realm isn't him.</i>

141
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,100
<i>Or perhaps Tai You was just working for someone.</i>

142
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:02,600
<i>This matter is more serious than I thought.</i>

143
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,800
You gave me the book of war back then.

144
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,400
You asked me to take care of this room and save that rascal immortal attendant in return.

145
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,000
But I didn't manage to do so.

146
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,800
I've always been feeling guilty, but I didn't know whom to make it up to.

147
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,800
All I could do was maintain this room.

148
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,100
<i>[The Tale of the Genesis Hero]</i>

149
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,800
All these years, the deities in the Heaven Realm thought you were dead.

150
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:42,100
The villain, Tai You, has tried every way to steal the book of war from me.

151
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,000
He failed to do it.

152
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:52,400
Now that you're back, this book of war can finally be returned to its rightful owner.

153
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,500
Tai You leads the army only with brute force and divine tools to achieve victory.

154
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,400
Since when does he know about troop strategy?

155
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,500
Who knows what he's thinking?

156
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,400
Back then, just a few arrows of the Devils were enough to scare his pants off.

157
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,700
Such a coward can't lead an army!

158
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:21,400
During the Divine-Devil War, His Supreme Majesty once complained to me

159
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,800
that Tai You was unfaithful and self-centered, so he couldn't be entrusted with important duties.

160
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:31,200
But today he took my position.

161
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,100
This is not right.

162
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,500
His Supreme Majesty normally acts as he thinks.

163
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:46,300
If he has made this conclusion, why would he let Tai You serve in the military?

164
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,800
His Supreme Majesty has changed.

165
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,400
The Heaven Realm has changed.

166
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,700
This Heaven Realm is no longer the Nine Heavens I once knew so well.

167
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,300
Everything has changed.

168
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,500
<i>Immortal Lord Bei Ming was killed in the battle.</i>

169
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,000
<i>His Supreme Majesty changed the Heavenly Rules after the war.</i>

170
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
<i>I went to the Mortal Realm to investigate this matter.</i>

171
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
<i>And I was ambushed.</i>

172
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,500
<i>All these incidents are related to the war.</i>

173
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,900
<i>There must be something suspicious about this war.</i>

174
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Marshal Huo De.

175
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,100
Can you tell me what has happened in the Heaven Realm since I went to the Mortal Realm?

176
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,800
<i>Skies-Crossing Spell?</i>

177
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,600
<i>This spell is used for instant teleporting.</i>

178
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,300
<i>Could it be...</i>

179
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,200
Ziqi!

180
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,800
Why did you use Skies-Crossing Spell?

181
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,300
Is it because you still want to leave?

182
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,000
Turns out that's what you think.

183
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,400
Since I've decided to marry you, I won't leave without letting you know.

184
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,600
Unless I'm leaving with you.

185
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,100
This is the birthday present I prepared for Yan Dan.

186
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,700
She likes to travel around.

187
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:18,100
Hence I put the Skies-Crossing Spell on this painting, so she can travel around the Mortal Realm.

188
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,900
But I just recovered and didn't realize that Skies-Crossing Spell requires a lot of vital essences.

189
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,600
I was afraid that you might get worried.

190
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,100
That's why I did it secretly.

191
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm sorry, Ziqi.

192
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I misunderstood you.

193
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,200
But I don't want you to wear yourself out.

194
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,400
Since you want to give her this gift, what about this?

195
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,800
When we're back in the palace, I'll complete this task for you.

196
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,600
Well, thank you.

197
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,300
By the way, Yu Mo wrote us a letter to invite us to Yelan Mountain.
<i>[Yours truly, Liu Weiyang]</i>

198
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:55,500
But since you haven't fully recovered, I replied him that we'll go there when you feel better.

199
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,000
But I can have someone deliver this present first.

200
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,400
Is Yu Mo still suspecting that I'm the one who taught the Puppet Spell to those in the Heaven Realm?

201
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
I believe you're not the one.

202
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:16,200
Even if Yu Mo misunderstands you, when we go to Yelan Mountain in a few days, we'll just explain it to him.

203
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,000
This place is too chilly, you shouldn't stay out for too long.

204
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,800
Let's go back.

205
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,400
Okay.

206
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,300
<i>Ziqi. Please forgive me</i>

207
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,200
<i>We've been separated for a thousand years.</i>

208
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,200
<i>What I'm afraid of most is to lose you again.</i>

209
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,500
When Ying Yuan left, I told him about the letter from Fengquan Valley.

210
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,000
He's the emperor.

211
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,700
Once he starts investigating this, there'll be a result soon.

212
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,700
In the Nine Heavens, there are many capable heavenly physicians.

213
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,800
Zhi Xi's injury will be fine.

214
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,200
They can take care of each other in the Heaven Realm.

215
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,300
You shouldn't worry.

216
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,600
Ying Yuan didn't want to leave.

217
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,100
But there are duties to be done in the Heaven Realm.

218
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,400
He was forced to leave.

219
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:26,400
Now that you've recovered, we should tell him.

220
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,600
I'm sure he must be missing you.

221
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,700
Tang Zhou is dead.

222
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,400
Ying Yuan has nothing to do with me.

223
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,200
We won't see each other anymore.

224
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,600
From now on, I want to start all over again.

225
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,200
I want to be a simple and happy lotus demon in the Mortal Realm.

226
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,400
Slow down.

227
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,600
Slow down. Wait for me.

228
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,000
Don't run.

229
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,200
The demons of Yelan Mountain were divided into clans.

230
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,100
They typically don't interact between clans and didn't teach each other their spells.

231
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,600
What's going on?

232
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,100
That's what you call "A friend in need is a friend indeed".

233
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:27,600
Although the mountain was in trouble, the relationships between clans have become more harmonious.

234
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,900
Years ago, Qiu Xi and I were in a fight by the hot spring.

235
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:38,200
I used the move, Swirl wind remnant cloud, and then the Guardian's Proof.

236
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,700
I defeated him in an instant.

237
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,000
Awesome.

238
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,600
Look. He's bluffing again.

239
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,400
Who dares to throw a stone at me?

240
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,800
Yan Dan.

241
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,400
Do you believe that I'll...

242
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,000
What?

243
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,100
I'll... I'll let you talk about your brave story.

244
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,100
Yan Dan! You're awake.

245
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,800
Do you feel all right?

246
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,700
Thanks to your Mind-Clearing Medicine. I'm much better now.

247
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,800
That's great. I can keep my tortoise shell.

248
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,500
I took out Ground Block forcefully and destroyed your home.

249
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,000
Yet you still care so much about me.

250
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,400
- I'm very...
- Now you're acting like a stranger, Yan Dan.

251
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,000
The most important thing is home.

252
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,700
The most important thing at home is family.

253
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,800
As long as we're safe and can stay together,

254
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,000
even if the sky falls and the Earth cracks, we're not afraid.

255
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,300
That's right, Sister Yan Dan. We're a family.

256
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,800
My father said a real man can survive in any situation.

257
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,200
We can't be too picky.

258
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,600
Living outdoor is good for training spiritual power.

259
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,900
Not to mention it's just a mountain.

260
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:57,000
If you're willing to marry into our Fox Clan, I'll build you ten more mountains.

261
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,400
I made this pendant using my fox hair.

262
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,000
It's a betrothal gift from me.

263
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,500
Really?

264
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:08,100
Xiao Zi Yan. This is truly beautiful.

265
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,700
My betrothal gift!

266
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,100
Zi Yan, be careful.

267
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,100
Keep on bluffing.

268
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,400
- Let's go.
- We'll get going now.

269
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,200
<i>After looking through the training book and night duty record,</i>

270
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,600
<i>that evening, Tai You was not supposed to be on duty near Tianxin Temple.</i>

271
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,200
<i>It wasn't a coincidence.</i>

272
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,300
<i>As Huo De said, Tai You isn't a great army leader.</i>

273
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:51,500
<i>While I was in the Mortal Realm, the crew arrangement in the Heaven Realm was out of order.</i>

274
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,200
<i>How things are judged is also different now.</i>

275
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,400
<i>The Head of the Heavenly Soldiers is crucial to the Heaven Realm.</i>

276
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,900
<i>Why would His Supreme Majesty go back on his words?</i>

277
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,600
<i>It must have been the mysterious person who helped him get to that position.</i>

278
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,500
Your Majesty. The heavenly physicians are here.

279
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,400
Please be frank with me and speak up.

280
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,300
His Supreme Majesty ordered us to check Your Majesty thoroughly.

281
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:48,200
If Your Majesty doesn't feel well, or if there's any existing hidden illness, His Supreme Majesty will fire us.

282
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,600
<i>That's right.</i>

283
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,800
We finally got to meet Your Majesty.

284
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,200
We must appreciate this opportunity and examine your health thoroughly.

285
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,400
My divine spirit is stable, and I'm healthy.

286
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,700
What is there to examine?

287
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,800
Your Majesty, please don't be stubborn.

288
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,600
Your Majesty is depressed with an unstable pulse.

289
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,400
There's too much heat in your heart.

290
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,000
You may leave now.

291
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,800
This illness is in my heart. You can't treat me.

292
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,000
<i>This...</i>

293
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,200
For the sake of the people, please take care of your health.

294
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,600
Please don't avoid treatment.

295
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,100
We're following the will of His Supreme Majesty.

296
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,100
No matter if it’s a physiological illness or injury,

297
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,000
if you don't even let us try, how will Your Majesty know that we can't cure you?

298
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,400
That's right, Your Majesty. Let us give it a try.

299
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,000
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

300
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
<i>With these heavenly physicians around, how can I investigate?</i>

301
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
<i>I need a hiding place that no one knows.</i>

302
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,000
<i>[Pavilion of Books]</i>

303
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,600
<i>Someone is visiting. What bad timing.</i>

304
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,500
<i>I can't tell anyone about Yan Dan.</i>

305
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,600
<i>I'll meet him next time.</i>

306
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,900
Try it out.

307
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,500
The spiritual power of the Lotus has healing capabilities.

308
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,100
Now that your injury is healed, you may rebuild your home at ease.

309
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,400
Thank you, Sister Yan Dan.

310
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,200
Everyone says that your medical skill is good.

311
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,400
I didn't expect it to be so amazing.

312
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,900
Yan Dan.

313
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,700
Aren't we going to pluck sweet peas for dinner tonight? Did you forget?

314
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,200
Let's go.

315
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,700
Yan Dan, are you...

316
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,700
I'm not coming. Go ahead.

317
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:48,500
I'll pluck some flower seeds to regrow the sea of flowers on the east of the mountain, to recreate how it was.

318
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,600
We're leaving, then.

319
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,000
Let's go.

320
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,700
<i>A move difference.</i>

321
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,200
<i>White wins.</i>

322
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,700
<i>I'll stick to my word.</i>

323
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,700
<i>Since I've promised you, I'll let you go back to Xuanxin Cliff.</i>

324
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,400
<i>Back to Xuanxin Cliff?</i>

325
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,400
<i>Didn't you say that you'll do whatever you can?</i>

326
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
<i>I watched the stars with you once.</i>

327
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,800
<i>Now it's your turn to watch the stars with me.</i>

328
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,200
The GO game is over.

329
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,300
The GO players are also gone.

330
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,400
Today, white belongs to white, black belongs to black.

331
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,100
No matter if it's humans or objects,

332
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,800
everything has a place where they belong.

333
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:13,200
<i>Yan Dan, we were separated twice.</i>

334
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,800
<i>The lotuses I planted for you have wilted.</i>

335
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,200
<i>Only a few know about this place.</i>

336
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,000
<i>Who put this here?</i>

337
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,700
<i>Since Your Majesty has found this bottle, that must mean you're back to your position.</i>

338
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,800
<i>Congratulations.</i>

339
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,400
<i>I just saved Your Majesty who was having mortal trials in the Mortal Realm.</i>

340
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,400
<i>I'm recording this moment because I know that when Your Majesty is back in the Heaven Realm,</i>

341
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,100
<i>Your Majesty will definitely ask who entrusted me to protect you.</i>

342
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:21,800
<i>I was once entrusted by a good friend to protect Your Majesty forever.</i>

343
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,800
<i>And I must keep my promise.</i>

344
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,400
<i>Although I don't know when the mortal trials will end,</i>

345
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:32,100
<i>I know Your Majesty will come back to the Land Under the Horizon when you return to the Heaven Realm.</i>

346
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:37,700
<i> That's why I saved the answer in this bottle and left it here.</i>

347
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,800
<i>Once Your Majesty has seen this, the answer will be clear.</i>

348
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:57,400
♫ <i> I followed you across the endless seas reluctant to leave you </i> ♫

353

354
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,200
<i>Anyway, I've already made up my mind.</i>

355
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,100
<i>You should stop persuading me.</i>

356
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:42,600
<i>If you can withstand my willfulness and still treat me as a friend,</i>

Turns out the close friend Lu Ming meant...

361
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,200
has always been you.

<i>Yan Dan.</i>

365
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
<i>I owe you so much.</i>

366
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,700
<i>How can I repay you?</i>

367
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,100
This is the most precious amber lamp.

368
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,000
How could you break it?

369
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,800
- Is this the amber lamp?
- Yes.

370
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,600
What a coincidence.

371
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,400
Don't worry. I'll fix it.

372
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,660
What are you doing here?

373
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,110
Yelan Mountain doesn't welcome you.

374
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:22,739
Zi Yan, don't be reckless.

375
00:29:22,739 --> 00:29:24,379
He saved your sister after all.

376
00:29:24,379 --> 00:29:26,379
He was the one who brought in the bad people.

377
00:29:26,379 --> 00:29:30,219
He destroyed our home and caused Sister Yan Dan's injury.

378
00:29:30,219 --> 00:29:33,139
Mountain Chief and Sister Yan Dan treated you so well.

379
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:35,779
Why did you do that to us?

380
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,359
Your spiritual power has improved.

381
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:48,379
You even learned how to beat others up.

382
00:29:48,379 --> 00:29:53,179
Well, are you planning to fight me someday?

383
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:59,879
Yelan Mountain was in peace all thanks to Ground Block of Emperor Ying Yuan.

384
00:29:59,879 --> 00:30:03,419
Now, he did nothing but retrieve his treasure.

385
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:06,499
We have no right to blame him, right?

386
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,919
Hurry back.

387
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:14,199
This lamp is needed on the performance stage.

388
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:16,059
Let's go, Zi Yan.

389
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:28,319
Why have you, the noble emperor Qingli, come to Yelan Mountain?

390
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,459
Why are you acting distant toward me?

391
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:40,719
Tang Zhou from the past was a friend who shared weal and woe with me.

392
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:44,479
Right now, you're Emperor Ying Yuan.

393
00:30:44,479 --> 00:30:47,759
You and Demon Clan are on different paths.

394
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:51,359
This place has nothing to do with you.

395
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:53,979
Nine Heavens is desolate.

396
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,239
I don't want to stay there.

397
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:02,179
My beautiful memories are all here.

398
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,959
The letter has arrived.

399
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,139
The Heaven Realm knew that Your Majesty was under attack.

400
00:31:08,139 --> 00:31:10,119
They would surely send people to protect you.

401
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:12,939
In what way is it desolate?

402
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:15,319
I didn't find the one who intercepted the letter.

403
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:21,919
When I was investigating secretly in Tianxin Temple, the temple suddenly caught fire.

404
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,899
The letters were burned.

405
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,379
The clue was cut off.

406
00:31:26,379 --> 00:31:33,519
Who would dare to challenge you despite your return to the Heaven Realm?

407
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,939
I had a suspect.

408
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:42,099
But after the verification, I saw no black spots on his hands.

409
00:31:42,099 --> 00:31:44,559
If he isn't the mastermind...

410
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,599
Yu Mo, this matter...

411
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,519
will be more serious than I thought.

412
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,079
There's a conspiracy waiting to be solved in the Heaven Realm.

413
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:58,199
You should deal with that carefully.

414
00:31:58,199 --> 00:32:01,619
Why did you come to Yelan Mountain again?

415
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,599
It's her birthday today.

416
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,819
When we were in the Heaven Realm...

417
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,879
she used to go to great lengths to celebrate my birthday.

418
00:32:16,879 --> 00:32:21,219
Therefore, I should come here to wish her a happy birthday.

Because she protected her master well, she received a promotion.

422

You can rest assured.

423

Thank you for taking care of Zhi Xi.

424

That's what I should do.

We're both well on our own.

if the agarwood wasn't eliminated...

466
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:23,399
Back then, I didn't like the strict rules in Nine Heavens.

467
00:36:23,399 --> 00:36:25,159
I thought it was unreasonable.

468
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,879
But now, I've experienced the Mortal Realm once.

469
00:36:28,879 --> 00:36:34,479
Only then did I realize that some sacrificed themselves for the greater good.

470
00:36:34,479 --> 00:36:36,650
As a result, the Three Realms are protected.
