<i>[Episode 18]</i>

15
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,220
Only what?

16
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,400
Why did he leave without finishing the sentence?

17
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,100
Only...

18
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,220
Only when the Butterfly of Lucid Dreams...

19
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,780
detects that there's no attachment or love remaining...

20
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,120
When the root of love is severed, it breaks its cocoon and becomes a butterfly.

21
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,840
Even if it's crushed to death, it can be reborn, as it carries no emotional resentment.

22
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,680
Night Forgetting River... is full of beings without emotions...

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,100
and those who have given up on love.

24
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:14,840
So it's not strange for the butterfly to appear here.

25
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,320
Back then, in the thatched cottage...

26
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,660
in that butterfly dream, he had no feelings for me.

27
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,240
Turns out that he never loved me, from the very beginning.

28
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,300
Since that's the case...

29
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,680
you should stop dwelling on it.

30
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,580
You'll definitely succeed...

31
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,260
in crossing the river today.

32
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,940
<i>Yan Dan, you kept failing to cross the river.</i>

33
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,980
<i>I can only try to create an opening in the river and send you directly to Mortal Realm.</i>

34
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,040
<i>It's just that you'll retain your memories this way.</i>

35
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,280
<i>So I can't face you in my real form and increase your pain.</i>

36
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:23,980
<i>I only hope this view of the blossoms can become a beautiful memory in the future.</i>

37
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,140
Take care.

38
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,440
Who are you?

39
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,620
River crossers who don't wish to be implicated or die should get lost.

40
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,520
Capture that woman there alive for me.

41
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,320
<i>Underworld King? Why does he want to capture Yan Dan?</i>

42
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,380
You don't know what's good for you.

43
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,340
Kill him!

44
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,140
I've been to Bi City, the northern capital, Mount Yan,

45
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,300
the Wushui region, and Diling Town.

46
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,660
Yan Dan...

47
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,120
it's been almost 900 years now.

48
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,260
I've searched every corner of the mortal world...

49
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,760
and met tens of thousands of people.

50
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,680
But why can I still not find you?

51
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,540
Where on earth are you?

52
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,060
<i>I will not give up.</i>

53
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,280
Ao Xuan?

54
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,080
Yu Mo, we were in the Heavenly Realm together for so long.

55
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,120
Yet I never realized who you were. You hid it very well.

56
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,840
It's too bad that I have your scale.

57
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,030
As long as you cast spells, I can follow your trail of spiritual power and kill you.

58
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,640
Your Dragon Clan gathered such a large army to catch me.

59
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,920
Aren't you afraid that the rest of the Aquatic Clans will find out about my identity?

60
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,960
If I kill you, no one will find out.

61
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,640
Attack!

62
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,060
Trying to escape? It won't be that easy!

63
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,600
Yi Cang, hurry and leave. I'm his target. Go!

64
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,560
Underworld King has been unreasonably ruthless. I want to teach him a lesson.

65
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,920
Don't worry. Nothing will happen to me. Wait here for me.

66
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,540
You're the great Underworld King. Why do you want to capture a river crosser?

67
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,820
Who do you think you are?

68
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,010
How dare you question me like this?

69
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,010
I've been here for more than 800 years.

70
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,880
No one has ever tried to capture me.

71
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,690
This is strange. Someone must be behind this.

72
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,520
You should leave quickly!

73
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,230
As expected, you have an accomplice.

74
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,700
The Sonic Bat belongs to Heavenly Realm.

75
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,820
Who exactly in Heavenly Realm are you colluding with?

76
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:58,830
<i>Underworld King only uses his left hand to attack because he's afraid someone will see the counter effects of the spell in his right hand.</i>

77
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,980
So this is the reason you're after Yan Dan.

78
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:11,880
<i>This body will soon be mine!</i>

79
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,680
Give me the Four-Leaf Lotus now!

80
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,300
If you make another move, you'll succumb to your internal demon.

81
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,660
<i>He's actually Emperor Qingli, Ying Yuan?</i>

82
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,240
Yi Cang, what just happened?

83
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,300
What's going on right now?

84
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,100
I'm fine. Don't worry. Wait for me.

85
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,100
You're the master of Night Forgetting River.

86
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,840
You abuse the power of the dark force to kill living beings.

87
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:19,020
Today, I shall destroy you and punish you for your crime.

88
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,060
The Golden Seal of the Seven Planets?

89
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,780
Your Majesty, I only acted so foolishly because I was tricked.

90
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,640
Your Majesty, please spare me this time.

91
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,760
The Golden Seal of the Seven Planets is a divine tool that belonged to Emperor Wan Yun.

92
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,980
You've never sparred with him before.

93
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,500
Tell me! How did you get these injuries?

94
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:54,440
During the Divine-Devil War, Emperor Wan Yun seriously injured me.

95
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,300
Did Your Majesty not know about this?

96
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,160
<i>Your Majesty, the Devil Clan told us to provide reinforcements here.</i>

97
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,060
<i>But they haven't arrived yet!</i>

98
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,160
<i>Could the battle up ahead be unfavorable to them?</i>

99
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,500
<i>Did they abandoned us and flee?</i>

100
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,500
<i>I always felt Elder Shuo Hua couldn't be trusted when he said we'd reap the benefits.</i>

101
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,830
<i>There's no such thing as a good deal in the world.</i>

102
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:34,580
<i>Maybe they're sending us to die in their stead!</i>

103
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,000
<i>So you're colluding with the Devil Clan in this battle too, Underworld King.</i>

104
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,560
<i>I will report this to Divine Realm and ask His Supreme Majesty to punish you!</i>

105
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,280
<i>Devil King is dead! All of you rebels and traitors should surrender now!</i>

106
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,400
<i>Devil King is dead?</i>

107
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,440
<i>Emperor, please have mercy!</i>

108
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:37,380
<i>I was confused because Devil King bewitched me!</i>

109
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,280
<i>I've always been loyal to the Divine Realm.</i>

110
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,840
<i>I never thought of betraying the Divine Realm for tens of thousands of years.</i>

111
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,280
<i>Please, Your Majesty, spare me!</i>

112
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,120
News of the battle spread all over the Divine Realm.

113
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,300
His Supreme Majesty also made it clear that it was Devil King Xuan Xiang

114
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:06,420
who led the army into the Illusion of Demons, catching the three emperors and Star Deity Ji Du off guard.

115
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:11,360
If the three emperors really had killed the Devil King,

116
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,340
the Devil Realm would have been in chaos without a leader.

117
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,260
Then why would the three emperors have died in battle?

118
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,680
I don't know!

119
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,120
After our defeat, I was imprisoned... imprisoned in the Heavenly Prison by the heavenly soldiers.

120
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,660
After the battle ended,

121
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,380
His Supreme Majesty considered the fact that it was my first offense, and that I didn't cause a huge problem.

122
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:35,220
So he only punished me by draining 10,000 years of my cultivation and exiled me to Night Forgetting River.

123
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:42,420
Since then, I've doubled my annual tribute and have the utmost respect for the Heavenly Realm.

124
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,560
I would never dare to deceive you, Your Majesty!

125
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,200
<i>If what Underworld King said is true, why is it different from what is written in the Heavenly Annals?</i>

126
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,200
<i>Was there something else behind the heavy casualties suffered by the Divine Realm back then?</i>

127
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,200
When I'm done with my business, I will return to question you again.

128
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,980
Yan Dan.

129
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,200
Let go, Yi Cang.

130
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,080
The Underworld King wants to kill me.

131
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,500
If you try to stop him again, your life will be in danger.

132
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:08,060
I can only go to the river to meet my death.

133
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,860
This way, you will be safe.

134
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,880
Yan Dan, don't worry.

135
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,520
I know a way to cross the river...

136
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,920
and send you directly to Mortal Realm.

137
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,980
Don't tell me you're willing to die here...

138
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,480
instead of going to Mortal Realm.

139
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,240
Yes.

140
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,620
Either I forget.. or I die.

141
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:56,220
Otherwise, no matter where I go, it's all like Night Forgetting River.

142
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,380
<i>I really am useless.</i>

143
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,360
<i>All that person took was half of your heart.</i>

144
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,960
<i>Yet you can't forget him even if you turn to ash?</i>

145
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,140
Yan Dan, you won't be able to endure this pain.

146
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,680
I've endured all sorts of pain in this world.

147
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,100
The pain from having my heart gouged out, the punishment of thunder strikes,

148
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,620
having my body ripped apart below the Bridge of Emptiness,

149
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,600
and having my heart burned by the scorching fire in the Underworld Realm...

150
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,110
It can't even compare to the pain of a broken heart.

151
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,480
I must forget him.

152
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,160
I will never turn back.

153
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,060
Yan Dan, do you really want to forget everything?

154
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,760
Yes.

155

I've been heartbroken over him for too long.

156
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,480
This time, I only wish to be free from this torture.

157
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,380
I haven't fulfilled...

158
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,840
the promise I made.

159
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:48,240
This time, the last thing I can do for you...

160
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,000
is to fulfill your wish.

<i>"Water from Night Forgetting River wipes out all feelings and love."</i>

164
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,880
<i>"Anyone who fails to cross the river because of one's obsession..."</i>

165
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,040
<i>"can use this method instead."</i>

166
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,980
<i>"Refine a bone from the Life and Death Arena."</i>

167
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,060
<i>"Collect water from Night Forgetting River."</i>

168
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,440
<i>"Gather ash from the Afterlife Path."</i>

169
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,380
<i>"Refine it into a sleeping pill."</i>

170
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,400
Consecrated Dark Force, I request the Fire of the Flaming Heart to finish this pill.

171
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,650
You're not Underworld King!

172
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,510
Who are you?

173
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,620
I come from the Heavenly Realm.

174
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,020
It's a matter of urgency.

175
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:55,840
So I borrowed Underworld King's identity to request the Fire of the Flaming Heart from the Dark Force.

176
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,340
What will you sacrifice?

177
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,500
Very good.

178
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,080
You're more useful than that useless man.

179
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,700
Those who borrow such fire must undergo a sincerity test.

180
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,280
For what reason do you make this request?

181
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,880
An old friend is trapped in Night Forgetting River.

182
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,520
I want to borrow this power so I'll feel at ease.

183
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,260
Insincere heart.

184
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,740
I have let this person down.

185
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,020
It's hard to repay her kindness.

186
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,320
I only ask for help,

187
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,020
so I'll feel more comforted.

188
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,400
That's not true!

189
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,000
This person...

190
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,640
This person is the one I love.

191
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:12,140
However... we aren't fated to be together, despite our deep affection.

192
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,200
We eventually had to part ways.

193
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,600
I only wish...

194
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,480
for her memories of the past to be erased.

195
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,740
So she can live happily...

196
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,600

197
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,500

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,500
The Soul-Crushing Hook has damaged his dragon core.

303
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,000
He will surely die.

304
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,200
Let me tell you,

305
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,400
if it weren't for my ten thousand-year-old golden armor, we would have died already.

306
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,800
Brother! Hey, Brother!

307
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,200
He's seriously injured.

308
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,400
You saved my life today.

309
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,700
I won't let you die.

310
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,400
<i>[Qianyun Palace]</i>

311
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,200
Is that so?

312
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,200
Royal Father!

313
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,800
Ao Xuan.

314
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:19,000
Zhao Lan? What brings you here?

315
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:25,500
Zhao Lan came with the South Sea Dragon King to discuss the wedding date.

316
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,000
I'll go and entertain your future father-in-law in the inner hall.

317
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,400
You two should have a good talk.

318
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,800
"Wedding date"?

319
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,800
So, you're willing to marry me now?

320
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,800
Where's my thing?

321
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,100
It's been 900 years, and the first time you willingly come to see me is only for that scale?

322
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,500
You said you'd return it to me the day I was willing to marry you.

323
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,600
As a dignified Crown Prince, don't go back on your word.

324
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,000
I threw it away.

325
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,600
What?

326
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,000
When and where did you throw it away?

327
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,300
I don't remember.

328
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,400
I never cared about insignificant objects like that.

329
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:26,100
Ao Xuan, if you go back on your word, consider our wedding canceled!

330
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,400
So you refuse to marry me?

331
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,600
The person in your heart is already dead.

332
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,800
I'll see how long you can hold on for.

333
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,800
<i>My dragon core was damaged,</i>

334
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,000
<i>but I was still able to recover.</i>

335
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,200
<i>What is this place exactly?</i>

336
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,900
You're finally awake!

337
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,800
This hot spring is indeed magical!

338
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,600
It can even save a dying person.

339
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,400
Where am I?

340
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,500
Enough. Stop asking questions.

341
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:04,400
We can't stay here for too long. This is Qiu Xi's private stronghold.

342
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,700
If he finds out we're using it secretly, he'll definitely take revenge.

343
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,400
Since you're already here, why rush to leave?

344
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,700
It's Qiu Xi.

345
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,400
I didn't expect to capture a tortoise.

346
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,000
Do you like my territory that much?

347
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,800
These are the accommodations I prepared for you.

348
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,000
Stinky lizard.

349
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,400
Do you think you can imprison me here?

350
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,700
You're getting ahead of yourself!

351
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,100
<i>- Let me go!
- Move!</i>

352
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:16,300
Your beauty is pointless. You'll still end up as the Mountain Chief's meal.

353
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,000
Move! Move it!

354
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Bai Ling?

355
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,200
- Hurry up! Move it!
- Don't try anything funny.

356
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,200
- Come over here!
- Move!

357
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:28,200
Mountain Chief, we've already caught the demons who escaped yesterday, and the lark who delivered the message.

358
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,000
Stinky lizard.

359
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,000
You're so beautiful.

360
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,800
You would be a nice concubine.

361
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:46,300
Why seek your own death by sending a message and showing this traitor the way?

362
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,400
You massacred hundreds of our avian clans' demons.

363
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,200
I hate you more than you know!

364
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,200
All right.

365
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:57,500
Then I'll fulfill your request and let you reunite with your tribesmen!

366
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,300
Stop!

367
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,000
