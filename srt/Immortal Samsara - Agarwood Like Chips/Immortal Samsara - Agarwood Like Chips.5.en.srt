<i>[Episode 5]</i>

15
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,259
Your Majesty, I was ignorant back then.

16
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:46,900
I didn't know Yan Dan was your immortal attendant.

17
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,360
It's all right.

18
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,739
I didn't expect that, despite her young age, Yan Dan actually wrote a play on the War of Genesis.

19
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,760
The Four Emperors' loyalty and courage were unparalleled.

20
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,650
Everyone in the Heavenly Court should learn from you.

21
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:02,400
I truly admire the effort Your Majesty put into this.

22
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,180
She wrote a play on the War of Genesis?

23
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,020
That's right.

24
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,819
Not only is Fairy Yan Dan beautiful, but she's also very talented.

25
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:13,040
She is a very good writer.

26
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,760
Where can I get the script?

27
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,760
It's been ten thousand years since the War of Genesis.

28
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,860
We can't find any topographic maps or primary sources on the war.

29
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,300
However, it's clearly written here on this topographic map.

30
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,040
Someone even commented here.

31
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,090
"When the Nine Fins Clan is ready for the war, we may narrate the story from another perspective."

32
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:12,300
That's exactly what I want.

33
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,180
Who left this comment?

34
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,310
These are battlefield maps and military strategies from a war that happened 10,000 years ago.

35
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,930
It is a very detailed record.

36
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:27,119
No one knows the war this well unless they participated in the war.

37
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:29,620
Who do you think is trying to help us?

38
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,439
I know who it is.

39
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,840
Who is it?

40
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,480
The Snail Girl.
<i>(T/N: Chinese folktale)</i>

41
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,699
It's true! I saw it in a script. This is a story told by the mortals.

42
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:44,410
It's about a very kind man in the mortal world who lived a very tough life.

43
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:49,379
Therefore, the snail girl came every night to cook for him and help him with his laundry.

44
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,719
What a coincidence! Look at me.

45
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,940
I'm a kind and pitiful immortal attendant too.

46
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,339
All right. I'll believe whatever you say.

47
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:00,540
I'm too smart!

48
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,360
<i>This person clearly knows everything about the Nine Fins Clan's expedition route.</i>

49
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,620
<i>Perhaps he or she knows what actually happened during the genocide too.</i>

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,920
<i>Don't tell anyone about the comments I left.</i>

51
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,860
<i> I don't want any rumors to spread.</i>

52
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:26,100
His Majesty has many official duties to attend to, yet he had time to check Yan Dan's script.

53
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,020
Looks like Yan Dan is someone special to him.

54
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,870
What an extravagant palace.

55
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,790
I think he must be a superior deity.

56
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,960
I don't think you're here so late at night just because you're curious about this place.

57
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,380
What do you want? Let's cut to the chase.

58
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,620
You were so kind to leave comments on the script, yet you don't want me to see your true face.

59
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,760
Are you hiding any secrets?

60
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,159
Come on. All I want to know is your true identity.

61
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,220
An orphan of the Nine Fins?

62
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,460
You can recognize the Power of the Nine Fins?

63
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,439
During the War of Genesis, you were definitely there at the frontline when the Nine Fins Clan was there.

64
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,739
Who exactly are you? Can you tell me how they died?

65
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:10,060
Your guess is as good as mine.

66
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:14,520
During the War of Genesis, I was tasked to guard the Divine Realm.

67
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,920
Unlike the Nine Fins Clan, I was fighting on a different battlefield.

68
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,840
When war was first declared, the Nine Fins Clan was indeed brave.

69
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,460
They defeated their enemy multiple times.

70
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,280
However, the Asura Clan was too strong.

71
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,500
Eventually, all the clans suffered heavy casualties.

72
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,420
There were only limited reinforcements.

73
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:34,400
Perhaps... they already did their best.

74
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,560
I don't believe that.

75
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,160
It doesn't matter whether you believe it or not.

76
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,690
Since you were lucky to have survived the war,

77
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:47,880
you should let go of that memory and cherish your life.

78
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,500
But I...

79
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:13,520
"Emperor Ying Yuan's eyes were fixed on the beach that was filled with ruins and dead bodies."

80
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,040
"He noticed a tortoise was crawling out of a pile of dead bodies."

81
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,420
"Emperor Ying Yuan flashed a faint smile."

82
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:24,290
"He cast a spell and flipped the tortoise over."

83
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,959
Rubbish.

84
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,350
<i> [Flipped it over]</i>

85
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,259
Oh, no! Oh dear! Something bad has happened!

86
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:46,260
Yan Dan, after your ban was lifted, you've become even more unruly.

87
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,250
Did I allow you to enter the room? What are you panicking about?

88
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,800
To be honest, I don't know why I'm panicking either.

89
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,219
The only thing I know is that all the immortal attendants are panicking as if our enemy is here.

90
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:59,839
Lu Jing told me to tell you that Marshal Huo De is here.

91
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,239
Who is he?

92
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,360
Why is Huo De here?

93
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,820
Help me.

94
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,239
Who else? Ying Yuan, you child, show yourself!

95
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:15,559
You promised me yourself.

96
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,159
You said that if I win a duel, you would willingly give up the book on the art of war you wrote.

97
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:23,599
I didn't live up to my usual standards during the previous competition, and you barely won.

98
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,759
Let's fight again today! A real man should always keep his word!

99
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,499
Only cowards hide in their rooms, pretending not to see and hear!

100
00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:34,179
Marshal, you have had ten duels this year.

101
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:37,149
You turn Yanxu Heavenly Palace into ruins every time.

102
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,599
The Divine Realm budget will run out if you have another fight!

103
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,809
Besides, His Majesty has been busy with official duties lately.

104
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:43,719
Stop acting like he's above everyone else!

105
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:49,520
When His Supreme Majesty and I were traveling the world, he didn't even know how to use a sword!

106
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,440
Emperor Ying Yuan! Emperor...

107
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,099
Your Majesty. Wake up, Your Majesty!

108
00:08:59,099 --> 00:09:01,600
Why are you like this?

109
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,039
You stayed up for days and nights just for a few spies.

110
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,240
And now, you keep traveling back and forth

111
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,579
between Deity Intelligence Bureau and the training ground for the military defense issue!

112
00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:12,759
Be gentle!

113
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,740
You're too young to be ill!

114
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:24,499
Because you are ill, all the immortal attendants in the palace are worried sick about you!

115
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,380
Wake up!

116
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,860
Marshal Huo De.

117
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:41,420
Marshal, it's been a long time. You still look as good as always.

118
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:46,220
I'm sorry that I'm ill. I can't greet you myself.

119
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,470
Emperor Ying Yuan has always been a strong and healthy man.

120
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,039
What a coincidence that you fell sick on the day I came to visit!

121
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:55,939
Marshal Huo De, the divine physician said His Majesty has overworked himself and is suffering from Fengxie.
<i>(TN: a pathogenic influence)</i>

122
00:09:55,939 --> 00:10:01,520
If he doesn't rest well, I'm afraid... I'm afraid that it will hurt his primordial spirit.

123
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,699
- How long will it take for him to recover?
- A couple of weeks...

124
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,999
is not enough!

125
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,520
The divine physician said that he is weak and gets tired easily. This will leave a long-term effect on him.

126
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,699
He will need more than a couple of weeks to recover from this.

127
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:18,260
It will take at least a year or so.

128
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:23,419
When did Emperor Ying Yuan get himself a smart and loyal immortal attendant?

129
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:26,260
Not only that, you are really eloquent too.

130
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,100
She is new, so she acts rather heedlessly.

131
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,250
I ask for Marshal's forgiveness on her behalf.

132
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:40,540
Since Your Majesty is ill, we have no choice but to postpone the competition.

133
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,760
Thank you, Marshal.

134
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,160
I will personally visit you after I recover.

135
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,440
The emperor is ill!

136
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,639
Being a senior, how can I leave you to deal with this alone?

137
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:12,930
Since no one in Yanxu Heavenly Palace knows how to take good care of you, I'll stay here and take care of you myself!

138
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,480
Marshal, this is such a trivial matter.

139
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,120
I don't want to trouble you.

140
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,279
You are the most experienced superior deity in the Divine Realm.

141
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,960
I don't dare to bother you.

142
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,319
Your Majesty, there's no need to be shy.

143
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:35,270
In ancient times, loyal servants gouged out their flesh and tasted feces in order to save their masters.

144
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:41,180
Since you are such a loyal immortal attendant, I'm sure you will let me stay and help. Right?

145
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,150
Emperor Ying Yuan is severely ill now. How can he eat all this on his own?

146
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,760
Feed him!

147
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,999
This is a secret recipe of mine.

148
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,319
Although it's bitter, salty, and has a pungent smell, it can cure Fengxie.

149
00:12:44,319 --> 00:12:49,739
It only means that the immortal attendant is not doing a good job if His Majesty is unwilling to drink it.

150
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:52,920
- Attendant!
- We're fine.

151
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,440
Drink it!

152
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,799
An ill person should not consume meat.

153
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:25,439
I think I'll have to do my duty by eating this delicious spiritual drumstick on your behalf!

154
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,220
You should avoid meat.

155
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,399
The immortal attendant lighted the burners herself.

156
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,719
If His Majesty is unwilling to use it, it only means that the immortal attendant is not doing a good job.

157
00:13:57,719 --> 00:13:59,259
Attendant!

158
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:01,480
He will use it! He will!

159
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,540
What a good relationship you share!

160
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,159
An ill person should never catch a cold.

161
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,500
I'll tell Qing Yun to bring ten more braziers here!

162
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,100
Your Majesty, are you doing all right?

163
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,660
What do you think?

164
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,780
Your Majesty. Why don't you just give him your book on the art of war?

165
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:52,159
All this old man wants now is for me to gouge out my flesh to cure you!

166
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,140
Impossible.

167
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,760
I'm hungry.

168
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,980
Sorry.

169
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,460
You are really a loyal servant, and a good actress too!

170
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,039
You didn't take good care of His Majesty, causing him to fall ill. That's the first offense.

171
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:57,539
You spoke rudely to me. That's the second offense.

172
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:03,619
Despite knowing that His Majesty was ill, you secretly fed him greasy food. That's the third offense.

173
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:07,200
By the Heavenly Rules... Your Majesty.

174
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,079
I'm sure you are well-versed with the Heavenly Rules. How should we punish her?

175
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,079
I shall be expelled from Yanxu Heavenly Palace and get sent back to Xuanxin Cliff to be a fish-keeper.

176
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:16,800
A fish-keeper?

177
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,910
If we report this to the Department of Heavenly Law,

178
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:24,139
you will receive at least eighty thunder lashes and get half of your cultivation removed!

179
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:25,739
You're such a heartless old man!

180
00:16:25,739 --> 00:16:29,620
What you just said will cost you an extra twenty lashes!

181
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,880
That's enough!

182
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,450
<i> [Qingli Playbook]</i>

183
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:48,039
I spent a thousand years of hard work writing this book. I'm one chapter away from finishing it.

184
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:52,840
I cherish it a lot. That's why I never wanted to show it to others.

185
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,200
Marshal, we have fought more than a dozen times.

186
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,560
I'm sure you are very curious about the book.

187
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,320
I hope you will appreciate it.

188
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,199
I only want to borrow the book because I acknowledge your work.

189
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,630
Even His Supreme Majesty respects me for being his senior!

190
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,820
You're in no place to tell me to listen to you!

191
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,920
Emperor Ying Yuan, the ruler of the Six Realms, is just another man.

192
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,360
I'm the winner today!

193
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,179
That Marshal Huo De! He's just a stupid rooster to me.

194
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:35,780
Your Majesty, he is not interested in the book of war at all.

195
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:42,000
He did all he could to obtain the book only because he wanted to prove to all deities that he's stronger than you.

196
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,420
He unnecessarily ruined all your effort!

197
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,010
Are you really going to let him go?

198
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:02,650
Other than a martial arts competition, it's against the Heavenly Rules to assault another immortal.

199
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:05,190
Huo De is the most experienced immortal in the Heavenly Court.

200
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,750
Even His Supreme Majesty can't do anything about him.

201
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,060
His Majesty always follows the rules strictly.

202
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,930
I know you're upset, but there's nothing else you can do about it.

203
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,200
Your Majesty.

204
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,740
Where are you going?

205
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,399
It's late at night. Why aren't you at the rehearsal and wandering around here instead?

206
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:40,059
Oh, it's late at night! Where is Your Majesty going?

207
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,880
All right. Let me be the cynical one here.

208
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:52,780
I guess you're going to take revenge on Marshal Huo De at his residence.

209
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,240
You didn't say anything.

210
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,420
I've guessed right.

211
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,399
You seem like a righteous man, but deep down, you're cynical, just like me.

212
00:19:00,399 --> 00:19:02,500
But you're too scared to admit it.

213
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:07,040
It's nice being a righteous man, having a bright future, and a good reputation.

214
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,739
The only downside about being a righteous man is that you have to fake a smile even when you're upset.

215
00:19:10,739 --> 00:19:14,499
On the other hand, being cynical has only one advantage.

216
00:19:14,499 --> 00:19:18,440
You can live happily.

217
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,100
What do you think, Your Majesty?

218
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:27,320
You overestimate your intelligence. Hurry up!

219
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,940
This is so exciting!

220
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,399
Your Majesty, Marshal Huo De has gone to bed.

221
00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:47,719
Then wake him up.

222
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,699
Your Majesty. I don't think we should do that.

223
00:19:50,699 --> 00:19:57,570
Why not? We developed some fresh spiritual drumsticks, hoping to share it with Marshal Huo De.

224
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:04,299
Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Marshal acted on impulse and offended Your Majesty.

225
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:06,700
Please have mercy on him! Don't take it to heart!

226
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,379
<i> He's just as naughty a child!</i>

227
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:13,480
<i> Emperor Ying Yuan! Your Majesty! Emperor Ying Yuan!</i>

228
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,580
<i> Emperor Ying Yuan!</i>

229
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,220
You always want to compete with me, but turn my backyard upside down when you lose a duel.

230
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,480
I know that you're a senior, so I tried to be generous.

231
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,160
But you took advantage of my kindness and started criticizing me.

232
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,460
Yan Dan gave me food, and you wanted to punish her with eighty thunder lashes.

233
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,800
Am I dead to you?

234
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,500
Exactly.

235
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,979
Your Majesty. What was the spell you cast on him?

236
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:55,780
A fasting spell.

237
00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:03,060
From now on, whenever he sees his favorite spiritual drumsticks and Eight Treasure Trotter, he will get nauseous.

238
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:08,280
It's not too bad. Consuming less meat can increase his life expectancy.

239
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,759
I didn't know you're more talented as a villain than as a gentleman!

240
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:18,899
I was already being very merciful for not casting a wine-free spell.

241
00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:20,500
Hurry and find it now.

242
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,180
On it!

243
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,519
<i>Isn't this the GO games Tortoise-Flipping Man solved with me?</i>

244
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:49,199
<i> [GO]</i>

245
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,359
<i>The military strategies in this book of war were actually written with GO games as references.</i>

246
00:21:54,359 --> 00:22:00,200
<i>Wait a minute. If someone ruins this book, all the hardship I went through will go down the drain.</i>

247
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,620
I found it.

248
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,000
Let's go.

249
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,740
Wait a minute!

250
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,940
We'll just borrow the book.

251
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,260
Let's go.

252
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,440
I've spent thousands of years beyond the Six Realms.

253
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,800
This is the only hobby I have.

254
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,720
Why can't I keep it?

255
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,160
I can't guarantee that I will definitely be of help, but I will try my best.

256
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,660
You actually remembered it.

257
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,160
It's my duty as an immortal attendant.

258
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,259
If we ever put this book for sale, you have to share half the profits with me!

259
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,620
That's strange.

260
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:47,800
I memorized all the GO games we have had before.

261
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,100
But this one...

262
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,460
This is the unfinished last chapter.

263
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,359
No matter how hard I try, it always ends in a draw. It's a Quadruple KO<i> (knockout).</i>

264
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:58,420
On the battlefield, we call this a seesaw battle.

265
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,799
I've been to every corner of the Six Realms and visited many GO experts in both the Divine and the Mortal Realms.

266
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,640
But I couldn't find a solution for this.

267
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,820
If you can help me with this, I'll fulfill a wish of yours.

268
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,060
Really?

269
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:13,600
Even if I want to leave Yanxu Heavenly Palace?

270
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,800
As long as it's within my capability, not against the Heavenly Rules, and not hurting anyone else.

271
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,140
However, don't celebrate too soon.

272
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:41,100
It might seem like the white has the upper hand, but if we make a reckless move, we might end up losing sixteen stones.

273
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:46,039
However, if we don't sacrifice it, the black won't be able to attack us.

274
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,719
It's a draw. Again.

275
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,400
Again.

276
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,360
Wait!

277
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,079
By a difference of a stone and a half, the white won.

278
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:34,720
I won!

279
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,740
I will keep my promise.

280
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:45,000
I gave you my word, so I'll allow you to return to Xuanxin Cliff.

281
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,800
Return to Xuanxin Cliff?

282
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,359
Didn't you just say it yourself?

283
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,620
You'll do it as long as it's within your capability.

284
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,040
I thought you were more determined than this.

285
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,600
The emperor's promise is worth a lot.

286
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,420
I'll allow you a few more days to think about it.

287
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,740
I don't have any disciples, but I own a lot of divine tools.

288
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,199
I've made up my mind.

289
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,699
I watched the stars with you the last time, so you will watch the stars with me too!

290
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,920
What a huge Kun!
<i>(T/N: Chinese mythical giant fish that could transform into a giant bird)</i>

291
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,520
We made a deal.

292
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,499
Don't worry. You and I will be the only ones who will know about this.

293
00:26:35,499 --> 00:26:37,440
No one else will find out!

294
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,040
Here too!

295
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,600
The emperor gave you his word, and you could have gotten anything you wanted.

296
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,960
Yet this is what you asked for.

297
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,099
If you practice more diligently, you'll be able to take part in future ascension ceremonies.

298
00:27:18,099 --> 00:27:20,380
Then you won't have to sneak around anymore.

299
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,820
I found the right person to back me up.

300
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,339
I'll also get to enjoy this beautiful scenery.

301
00:27:23,339 --> 00:27:25,899
And all this belongs to me alone. What a deal!

302
00:27:25,899 --> 00:27:27,860
Hold tight, then.

303
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,480
What are you going to do?

304
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,559
Don't act recklessly!

305
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,860
It's not up to you anymore.

306
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,840
You're so mean!

307
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,300
How could you speed up without telling me first?

308
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,940
Your hands.

309
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,160
I'm not trying to hug you!

310
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,880
I've experienced blessings like this hundreds of times.

311
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:06,580
But today is the first time I realized that it's more beautiful than the Milky Way.

312
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,680
A little immortal power can make someone so happy.

313
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,660
Who is that for?

314
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,580
- It's a secret.
- A secret?

315
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,820
He must be a humble immortal attendant who has never had this blessing.

316
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,940
What are you doing?

317
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,160
Give it back!

318
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,600
What are you doing? Give it back to me!

319
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,899
I'm reminding you that, while cultivating, you should never fall in love.

320
00:29:38,899 --> 00:29:40,879
Why do you have such a dirty mind?

321
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,200
This is for Zhi Xi.

322
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,960
Deities are all weird.

323
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,079
The Heavenly Court doesn't allow anyone to fall in love.

324
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,759
What about the immortals who went to the Mortal Realm to experience trials?

325
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,500
I'm sure His Supreme Majesty can't stop them.

326
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,519
When I get to the Mortal Realm in the future...

327
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,740
Falling in love is one of the trials.

328
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:09,720
When one experiences the pain of love, he or she will stop obsessing and live without desire.

329
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,820
The mortals are their only concern.

330
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,820
I advise you not to create trouble for yourself.

331
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,800
Have you ever fallen for anyone before?

332
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,639
Of course not.

333
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,660
Then how did you know that love is painful and not sweet?

334
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:31,919
<i>[Deity Intelligence Bureau]</i>

335
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,799
You trespassed into the Deity Intelligence Bureau late at night.

336
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,220
Who sent you here?

337
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,300
Why are you here?

338
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,180
They committed suicide!

339
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,720
Were they sent by the Devils to invade the palace?

340
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,239
Don't worry. I'll have it all sorted out.

341
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,340
I hope that didn't scare you.

342
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,980
I'm fine.

343
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,220
Your Majesty.

344
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,559
Your Majesty knows how to think ahead.

345
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,959
Two days ago, the devil spies we captured finally switched sides and confessed that

346
00:31:10,959 --> 00:31:12,919
they spread the fake news about the Devil Realm's map.

347
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,259
They faked the defection, but they helped us eliminate our enemies.

348
00:31:15,259 --> 00:31:18,579
We can't read minds. I'm sure they are feeling restless now.

349
00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:24,180
To check all the channels Si Xuan delineated with the Unparalleled Mirror

350
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:29,820
and find the mole that is hiding in the Divine Realm, we need more than a few days.

351
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:35,820
Since they decided to take the initiative, they will definitely eliminate all their enemies once and for all.

352
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,199
How are all the palaces doing?

353
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,559
We followed Your Majesty's orders.

354
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,659
Once the rebels approach the spies in the palaces, we will kill them immediately.

355
00:31:41,659 --> 00:31:43,840
As of now, we see no turmoil in any palaces.

356
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,200
These three men probably came to steal Devil Realm's defense map.

357
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,340
Now that we have captured them, you shall come with me to Yuqing Palace to report this incident.

358
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,000
Yes.

359
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,100
Huan Qin is still patrolling around Devil Realm.

360
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,239
I made up an excuse, saying that I would reward the Devil Realm.

361
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,360
I've summoned Devil King Xuan Xiang to the Divine Realm.

362
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:09,320
Let's find out if he is really loyal to us.

363
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,359
The Devil Realm dispatched 300 rebels to steal the defense map and kill their enemies.

364
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:18,580
We have detained the rebels.

365
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:22,180
The barrier Si Xuan broke with the help of the Unparalleled Mirror has been sealed again.

366
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:29,939
- But...
- But the Heaven-Devil Barrier was formed by the spirit of Primordial Lord Ran Qing.

367
00:32:29,939 --> 00:32:31,780
It has been there for a very long time.

368
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:37,619
The Devil Realm will find a new breach soon, if this is what they intend to do. Am I right?

369
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,620
Yes.

370
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:45,659
It isn't easy to repair the barrier formed by the Primordial Lord.

371
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:51,539
I'm not entirely sure I can do it, even if I exhaust my immortal power and eventually die of fatigue.

372
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:56,380
Let me... think about it again.

373
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:20,920
Before we decide how to deal with the barrier, you should prepare all the divine soldiers for war.

374
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:25,240
Make sure to take all the necessary precautions to stop the Devil Clan invasion.
<i> [Yuqing Palace] </i>

375
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:29,400
Emperor Ying Yuan, the superior deities of the Divine Realm...

376
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,200
Who is that?

377
00:33:33,422 --> 00:33:35,088
Yan Dan.

378
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,960
Yan Dan!

379
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,879
What an ignorant immortal attendant!

380
00:33:42,879 --> 00:33:44,839
How dare you sleep near Yuqing Palace?

381
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,339
His Supreme Majesty is here. Aren't you going to greet him?

382
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:55,759
Your Supreme Majesty. I am an immortal attendant from Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

383
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:57,199
My name is Yan Dan.

384
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,740
"Yan Dan"?

385
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:03,060
Is this the Four-Leaf Lotus you named?

386
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,100
Yes, Your Supreme Majesty.

387
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,620
She is now serving at Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

388
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,360
She helped with the plot to capture the spy from the Devil Clan.

389
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,760
When we captured him, she was there as well.

390
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:21,139
That's why the divine soldiers brought her here to Yuqing Palace, in case Your Supreme Majesty wants to question her.

391
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:24,520
Yan Dan, why are you standing there?

392
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,360
You should go back now.

393
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:30,430
Yes. Yes.

394
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:35,020
I wish Your Supreme Majesty a healthy and long life.

395
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,920
I will take my leave now.

396
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,830
Stop right there.

397
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,730
You made a contribution.

398
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,359
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

399
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,919
I am going to reward you.

400
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:49,500
But... it is past Divine Realm's curfew, right?

401
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,059
Emperor Ying Yuan went to Divine Intelligence Bureau to handle military affairs.

402
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:54,400
What about you?

403
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,279
You're just a lowly immortal attendant.

404
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,820
Why were you at the Deity Intelligence Bureau?

405
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,820
I... I...

406
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:07,100
Emperor Ying Yuan, I remember that you have only a few immortal attendants.

407
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,080
There were only Qing Yun and Lu Jing, right?

408
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,679
You saved her life when she turned into a human.

409
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,999
And now, she is working at Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

410
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,879
What a coincidence!

411
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,900
Why didn't you tell me about something so interesting?

412
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,900
Your Supreme Majesty.

413
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,099
The deployment of immortal attendants is always a trivial matter.

414
00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:30,860
"Immortals must never fall in love."

415
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:35,199
That was the rule set by the Primordial Lord when he passed on.

416
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:41,260
This girl will be challenging the Heavenly Rules if she ever falls for you!

417
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,860
Your Supreme Majesty, please help me.

418
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,920
To protect Emperor Ying Yuan's reputation, please expel me from Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

419
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,560
That will save my life too.

420
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:29,100
I was just a carefree immortal attendant at Xuanxin Cliff.

421
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:33,300
But one day, I ran into Emperor Ying Yuan.

422
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,840
He bullied my divine tortoise.

423
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:41,000
I was upset, so I went forward to reprimand Emperor Ying Yuan.

424
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,180
I told him that he shouldn't bully heavenly beasts.

425
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:48,940
I didn't expect Emperor Ying Yuan, an emperor, to hold grudges against me.

426
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:53,619
He wanted to cover up his crime, so he brought me to Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

427
00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:57,280
He started to take revenge on me.

428
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,700
You should not lie to His Supreme Majesty.

429
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,260
The palace is huge.

430
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:14,920
I take care of the broken bricks and tiles, sweep and mop the palace, cook and do the laundry.

431
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,000
I have to do all these chores on my own.

432
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Although I'm not an experienced immortal, I am really hurt by this, Your Supreme Majesty!

433
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,420
That's enough.

434
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,700
You're really eloquent.

435
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,180
You tell lies as if they are facts.

436
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,720
It was you who damaged my Cosmic Jade Belt.

437
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,999
It has not been fixed yet, and you're trying to leave the palace.

438
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,359
His Supreme Majesty is wise.

439
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,480
Do you think he'll believe your words?

440
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,679
I swear I'm not lying!

441
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,979
Your Supreme Majesty. Please help me!

442
00:37:49,979 --> 00:37:51,900
Your Supreme Majesty!

443
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:56,300
Why were you at the Deity Intelligence Bureau late at night, then?

444
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,559
This is what happened.

445
00:37:57,559 --> 00:37:59,640
I wrote a play recently.

446
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,540
It's called "The Tale of The Genesis Hero".

447
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,920
I wrote it for the Jade Pool Festival.

448
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,999
Unfortunately, I'm always very busy with my work at Yanxu Heavenly Palace during the day.

449
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:12,079
I can only practice it at night in Pixiang Hall.

450
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:16,719
However, it was really dark at night and I lost my way.

451
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,919
Then I ran into Emperor Ying Yuan, who was fighting the rebels.

452
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,919
Although I'm an inexperienced immortal, I'm always ready to give my all to defend the Six Realms!

453
00:38:25,919 --> 00:38:28,300
That's why I summoned my courage and joined the fight!

454
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,239
Is that all?

455
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,260
It's true, Your Supreme Majesty.

456
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:40,359
If Your Supreme Majesty doesn't mind, I can show you the scenes I have completed.

457
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:48,720
"Ten thousand years ago, when the world was first created, the sun and the moon were in chaos,"

458
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,030
- "mortals and demons..."
- That's enough.

459
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,640
You're too young to be this long-winded!

460
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,239
Even I want to punish you, let alone Emperor Ying Yuan.

461
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,500
Yan Dan, the immortal attendant.

462
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,819
You broke the curfew and acted rudely in front of the Supreme Majesty.

463
00:39:05,819 --> 00:39:09,160
You will copy the Heavenly Rules a hundred times, using the Divine Pivot Brush.

464
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,780
Send it to Lingxiao Hall by noon tomorrow.

465
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,560
I will.

466
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,579
I should be punished for my mistakes and rewarded for my merits.

467
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:19,240
I'll make sure to finish copying the Heavenly Rules.

468
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:25,260
However, can I keep the Divine Pivot Brush?

469
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:36,960
Emperor Ying Yuan, don't forget what happened to Si Xuan, and the love abstinence mentioned in the Heavenly Rules.

470
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,300
I had no other choice.

471
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:57,679
This is the only thing we can do to prove that there's nothing going on between us.

472
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,420
The girl His Supreme Majesty mentioned just now, Si Xuan...

473
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,520
Wasn't she the former curator of the Magical Pavilion?

474
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,620
What was your relationship with her?

475
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:11,819
Where is she now? Tell me.

476
00:40:11,819 --> 00:40:15,279
<i>Whether it's worth it or not, Your Majesty shall know in the future.</i>

477
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,100
<i>Love is born from our hearts.</i>

478
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:20,440
<i>Your Majesty, could it be that you're heartless?</i>

479
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,440
Your Majesty.

480
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,720
What's on your mind? Tell me.

481
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,699
- Share it with me!
- Let's go back.

482
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,680
Divine Pivot Brush.

483
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,999
I can tell how powerful this artifact is just by hearing its name.

484
00:40:41,999 --> 00:40:46,559
I didn't expect to receive such a powerful artifact just by copying the Heavenly Rules.

485
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:48,480
It was a good bargain!

486
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,160
What... What's with the brush?

487
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,519
You're done for.

488
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,719
The Divine Pivot Brush weighs 1,000 jin.
<i>(T/N: 1 jin = 500 g)</i>

489
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:14,000
You can't use your immortal power on it, so you have no choice but to do it physically.

490
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,019
You'll lose your arms before you finish copying ten pages.

491
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:22,760
How can the Supreme Head of the Six Realms be this vicious?

492
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,520
Yan Dan.

493
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,740
Never badmouth His Supreme Majesty.

494
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,400
You were unruly in Yuqing Palace.

495
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,579
You should be glad that His Supreme Majesty didn't send you to the Heavenly Gallows.

496
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:38,459
How can you repay kindness with evil? What a heartless man!

497
00:41:38,459 --> 00:41:39,879
Can't you see it?

498
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,399
His Supreme Majesty has found out that there is something going on between us.

499
00:41:43,399 --> 00:41:48,720
If it wasn't for my acting skills, we would have been sent to the Heavenly Gallows, awaiting our punishments!

500
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,659
You have been very secretive since we returned from Yuqing Palace.

501
00:42:02,659 --> 00:42:04,380
Looks like something is bothering you.

502
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,280
Don't tell me His Supreme Majesty got it right.

503
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,480
Did you not stay abstinent?

504
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,320
Are you done yet?

505
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:25,760
So you and Si Xuan...

506
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,980
I killed her.

507
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,860
You...

508
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,560
Why?

509
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,540
She didn't stay abstinent.

510
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,400
I executed her at the Heavenly Gallows.

511
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,750
