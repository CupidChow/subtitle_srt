15
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,349
- Yu Mo!
- Yan Dan! Stay away.

16
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:35,649
It's too dangerous. Don't worry.

17
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:37,610
I'll be fine.

18
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,910
Only a high-level immortal can break this magic spell.

19
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,990
Help get them here!

20
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,710
How can I just abandon you?!

21
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,309
This isn't the time to argue! This sacred tree fears fire.

22
00:01:47,309 --> 00:01:49,930
Only burning mantras can deal with it. Do you know how to cast that spell?

23
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,090
How would I know such a high-level spell?

24
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,290
Yu Mo, do you how to do it?

25
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,530
- How would he know?
- I...

26
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,909
He's from an Aquatic Clan. Besides, he just transformed into a human form.

27
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:58,410
He wouldn't know this type of burning mantra.

28
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,430
Then hurry and get some help. I'll watch over him.

29
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,829
- Hey, wait. Wait for me.
- Hurry! Hurry!

30
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:15,950
Star Deity Ji Du! Help! Star Deity Ji Du! Help!

31
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,750
All right. You are all safe now.

32
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,170
Thank you for lending us a hand, Star Deity Ji Du.

33
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,190
If it weren't for you, my friend would've either died in the hands of the Devils

34
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,869
or died from being absorbed by this sacred tree. Come on.

35
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:39,210
- Thank Star Deity Ji Du.
- She's right.

36
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,210
Thank you, Star Deity Ji Du.

37
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,250
I'm the Curator of the Pavilion of Books, Lu Ming.

38
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,130
These two immortal attendants are my good friends.

39
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,290
They've been writing excerpts of a play about the War of Genesis.

40
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:51,349
So they broke into the forbidden area without observing the Heavenly Rules.

41
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:54,270
I hope you can show them mercy.

42
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,910
If you hadn't come tonight,

43
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,290
we wouldn't have caught the Devil Clan's spies.

44
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,970
I know what to report regarding this.

45
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,290
You three can rest assured.

46
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,330
Yes, yes.

47
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,530
Star Deity Ji Du, you are indeed virtuous.

48
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,110
We can't feel grateful enough.

49
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,809
All right. You should head back to treat your injuries.

50
00:03:11,809 --> 00:03:14,130
You mustn't be so mischievous next time.

51
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,990
- Thank you, Star Deity Ji Du!
- Thank you, Star Deity Ji Du.

52
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,330
I've never met an immortal with such a good temperament before.

53
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,409
Right? I used to think Immortal Lord Bei Ming was the most decent one.

54
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:32,649
I never imagined that I would find out the real demeanor of a superior immortal today.

55
00:03:32,649 --> 00:03:34,050
There's something you don't know.

56
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:38,189
Star Deity Ji Du, Huan Qin, is a superior immortal who has profound immortal powers,

57
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:39,770
only second to the Four Emperors.

58
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,870
He's also peace-loving, charming, and genteel.

59
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,650
He's always polite to low-ranking immortal attendants.

60
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,490
No one has seen him lose his temper before.

61
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,650
We're so lucky.

62
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,250
<i>[Pavilion of Books]</i>

63
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,549
- What's this?
- A seal.

64
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:03,009
- A seal?
- Yes.

65
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,610
It was created from my true form's spiritual power.

66
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,470
As long as I'm alive, this seal will always glow.

67
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,170
So don't worry. From this day forth, you'll be here as long as I'm here.

68
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,550
I'll always watch over you.

69
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,370
There are two factors that worry me most now.

70
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,490
Do you know what they are, Your Majesty?

71
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,970
One, how did the spies infiltrate the Heavenly Court?

72
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,110
That's why I brought you here.

73
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,110
This is where the Devil Clan entered.

74
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,850
The Deity Realm is separated from other realms by a barrier.

75
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,330
The barrier between the Nine Heavens and the Devil Clan

76
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,570
was formed with the Primordial Lord's primordial spirit.

77
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,730
No one could have broken the barrier.

78
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,850
These spies don't have high supernatural powers either.

79
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,690
How did they get in?

80
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,010
Si Xuan was deeply in love.

81
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,490
If she could transport artifacts and pills from the Magical Pavilion to the lower realms,

82
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,890
she could also transport the Devil Clan to the Nine Heavens.

83
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:10,190
Could it be that she stole and used an ancient divine artifact, the Unparalleled Mirror?

84
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,489
It is one of the magical tools missing from the Magical Pavilion.

85
00:05:16,489 --> 00:05:20,070
Marshal Huo De caught Si Xuan

86
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,930
in the most remote Secluded Wilderness of the Devil Realm.

87
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:28,910
I never figured out why she was there.

88
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,130
So that means below the Land Under the Horizon is the way

89
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:38,350
that leads to the Secluded Wilderness of the Devil Realm.

90
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,469
The Land Under the Horizon is a forbidden, uninhabited land.

91
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:45,070
This place would have been her safest bet,

92
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,170
in case the Devil Clan coveted the Unparalleled Mirror.

93
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:51,130
I've requested for instructions from His Supreme Majesty to burn it.

94
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:55,410
So from today onward, no one will be able to open the barrier.

95
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,030
Is this Emperor Zhao Sheng's divine tool, the Truth Duster?

96
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,750
With it, we can dispel all unknown barriers.

97
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,630
So this is where the Devil Clan enters.

98
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,110
We mustn't seal it at the moment, lest we alert the enemy.

99
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,470
You're right.

100
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,410
With such meticulous deployment,

101
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:57,410
the Devil Clan spies can still move freely.

102
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:01,510
It shows that they usually act cautiously.

103
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:07,110
Do you have other ways to find the rest of the Devil Clan spies?

104
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,770
We only need to decipher the way they transmit their messages.

105
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,290
And let them reveal themselves on their own.

106
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,730
We now have a conclusion to the first case.

107
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,890
As for the second case... Why did you stop guessing?

108
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,870
You don't need to ask if you can't keep it to yourself.

109
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,610
You really know me best.

110
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,590
I've already done what you asked and sent someone to investigate it secretly.

111
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:36,030
The spy disguised as an immortal attendant from Miluo Palace was captured.

112
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,250
The attendant didn't interact with anyone when he was on duty.

113
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,810
He also didn't go anywhere suspicious.

114
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,249
We searched through their belongings,

115
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:47,270
but we found no magical tools that could transmit messages.

116
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,730
In order to hide their identities, they're naturally cautious.

117
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,350
They probably transmit their messages at

118
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:55,530
the places they pass by every day.

119
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:59,310
Only then could they avoid arousing suspicion.

120
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,630
A place they always pass by?

121
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,770
Don't tell me it's this heavenly street.

122
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,110
None of the palace lanterns,

123
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,410
tiles, or bricks along this street have been pulled down.

124
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,010
But we still have no clues.

125
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,730
How about we make a bet?

126
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,630
If I find the clues first, you will give me

127
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:22,470
the GO manual you have treasured for many years.

128
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,090
What do you think?

129
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,770
Huan Qin, are the decorations on the palace wall all five-petaled plum blossoms?

130
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,430
Five-petaled plum blossoms?

131
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,190
I think so.

132
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,590
I really never noticed it before.

133
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,910
Do you find something unusual about it?

134
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,010
You haven't answered me.

135
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,010
Are we betting or not?

136
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,410
For your sake, I won't bet.

137
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,870
Why does that plum blossom have six petals?

138
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,890
Superior Deity Tao Ziqi has dealings with the Devil Realm.

139
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,170
So she's familiar with their codes.

140
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,070
We should let her take a look at this.

141
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,490
All right.

142
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,410
Yan Dan, the soup is ready.

143
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,030
Hurry, try it.

144
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:24,950
Yan Dan, why are you reading the GO manual?

145
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,470
This is so frustrating.

146
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,530
It's all that vile Ying Yuan's fault.

147
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,610
He forces me to play GO with him every day.

148
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,250
I've used up almost all my tricks.

149
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,350
If I don't practice, I'm afraid I won't be on equal footing with him anymore.

150
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,950
Yan Dan. If you lose,

151
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,310
it means you no longer have to play anymore, right?

152
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,610
I have my pride too!

153
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,430
I can't let that vile person look down on me.

154
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,030
Yu Mo, that day after you were hurt by the Devil Clan...

155
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,830
I was thinking about it.

156
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,050
In my opinion, we may be immortal attendants,

157
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,830
but we need to have some powers to protect ourselves.

158
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,090
How about this? I can teach you

159
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:05,689
some low-level immortal powers first, just in case.

160
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,710
Yan Dan, I'll pass.

161
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,150
I don't want to trouble you. You don't need to teach me.

162
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:15,150
D-Did you just roll your eyes?

163
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:20,610
That scornful look of yours seems so familiar.

164
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,510
Just like that little black fish at Xuanxin Cliff.

165
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,930
This won't do!

166
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:31,530
Yu Mo, the first lesson I'm going to teach you is

167
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,950
that as deities, we must be modest.

168
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,390
Get up!

169
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,090
Let's practice!

170
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:45,230
Our true forms are animals or plants.

171
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,250
So when we cultivate, we are divided based on the five elements.

172
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,169
I belong to the wood element. You belong to the water element. You understand that, right?

173
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:55,169
Yes. Water nourishes plants. I bring you benefits.

174
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:56,310
Shut up!

175
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,769
You aren't allowed to interrupt when I'm talking.

176
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:00,129
- But you asked me a question.
- Enough!

177
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:03,509
In any case, everything has a spirit.

178
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:07,170
But we must control our inner spirit.

179
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,809
Watch me. Copy what I'm about to do now.

180
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,110
Go with the flow!

181
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:27,530
Just now, I only used a little bit of strength. Incredible, right?

182
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:30,390
Your skills are really amazing!

183
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,050
It's all right.

184
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,209
Don't just stand there. Hurry and try it.

185
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:35,810
Just do what I taught you.

186
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,369
It's not shameful if you can't put out the candles on your first try.

187
00:11:38,369 --> 00:11:39,950
Come on.

188
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,730
Pretty amazing.

189
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,770
That's because you taught me well.

190
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,109
Oh, no. We've been found out!

191
00:12:08,109 --> 00:12:10,829
We're trapped in the barrier now. I'm afraid we can't get out.

192
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:12,809
Even if there's no barrier, there's still only one entrance!

193
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:14,289
We will run into them when we leave. Are you a fool?

194
00:12:14,289 --> 00:12:15,890
Hide!

195
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,150
The soup is still hot.

196
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,629
They must be hiding. Search the place!

197
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:34,130
<i>Yes.</i>

198
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:40,789
I'd like to see who's bold enough to come to my palace every day and steal food.

199
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,350
<i>After I get my hands on him, I'm going to stew him!</i>

200
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,569
We can't just hide here either.

201
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:54,469
How about this? I'll go out and admit my mistake.

202
00:12:54,469 --> 00:12:57,350
After I'm caught, they'll naturally lift the barrier.

203
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,150
You should take the chance to escape then.

204
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:03,369
No, Yan Dan. We promised that we would share the good and bad together.

205
00:13:03,369 --> 00:13:05,969
Enough. I'm from Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

206
00:13:05,969 --> 00:13:07,789
Even if I'm caught, I'll be okay.

207
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,029
But you're different.

208
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,869
You can't reveal your identity.

209
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,590
Especially to Tai You Pavilion's people.

210
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,650
Enough already. Don't worry.

211
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,589
I can take care of myself this time.

212
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:20,150
I know what to do, so don't worry.

213
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,630
Hide yourself.

214
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,090
Are you here for dinner?

215
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,309
What a coincidence.

216
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:43,390
You have the audacity to steal my food.

217
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,869
If I hadn't run into immortal servant Yan Dan making soup in secret,

218
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,610
we would still be clueless.

219
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,970
Your Majesty works day and night for the Six Realms.

220
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,389
Yet you refuse to trouble the Heavenly Kitchen to prepare you a bowl of immortal soup.

221
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:59,810
I'm truly moved, and I feel so guilty.

222
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,450
As the Head of the Heavenly Kitchen,

223
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,229
I failed to notice Your Majesty's needs.

224
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,369
I have neglected my duties. I have truly failed.

225
00:14:07,369 --> 00:14:11,549
Your Majesty. If you need anything in the future, please send someone immediately to make a request.

226
00:14:11,549 --> 00:14:15,029
The hundreds of dishes in the Heavenly Kitchen

227
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:17,190
will surely satisfy you!

228
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,410
Immortal Lord Zi Huai, you have misunderstood the situation here.

229
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:25,470
I never asked Yan Dan to prepare supper in secret.

230
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,989
But... What exactly is going on here?

231
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:39,189
Your Majesty, I had no idea you were such a person!

232
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:43,829
I work hard from dawn to dusk just to cook for you.

233
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:47,890
These hands of mine! I don't know how many times I've scalded them!

234
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:52,630
And now you refuse to admit it because of your dignity!

235
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,290
Really. I put my heart into this,

236
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:00,850
but you take it all for granted!

237
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,949
Immortal Lord Zi Huai, you must speak up for me!

238
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,889
You must show everyone in the Nine Heavens

239
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:13,729
what kind of person His Majesty is!

240
00:15:13,729 --> 00:15:15,489
- All right. Forget it. I'll let this matter go.
- Immortal Lord...

241
00:15:15,489 --> 00:15:16,689
- I never saw anything.
- Immortal Lord!

242
00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:17,709
- I don't know anything at all.
- Immortal Lord!

243
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:18,749
I didn't see anything!

244
00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:20,090
Your Majesty, if you'll excuse me. Excuse me.

245
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,829
- Farewell, I'm taking my leave now!
- Are you leaving, Immortal Lord?

246
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,149
That was self-defense. It was just to protect myself.

247
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:37,370
I know I went a little overboard with the acting.

248
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,590
But I had no choice.

249
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:47,429
Your Majesty, I know you're a generous person.

250
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,290
You won't take this matter to heart.

251
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,010
You'll definitely forgive me, right?

252
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,769
Also, I can assure you that Immortal Lord Zi Huai

253
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:56,250
will never tell anyone about this matter.

254
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,130
So don't worry.

255
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:01,770
A mere immortal attendant who spouts lies

256
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,970
and feels no guilt.

257
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,970
In that case,

258
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:09,989
you'll be in charge of all of Yanxu Heavenly Palace's suppers.

259
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:16,110
From tomorrow onward, you'll write fifteen copies of the GO manual.

260
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,190
You're not allowed to sleep if you don't finish it.

261
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,870
You may leave now.

262
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,650
Yes, Your Majesty.

263
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,130
What a jerk!

264
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,410
It must be hard working at Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

265
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,950
Why don't you go somewhere else?

266
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,190
No.

267
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:03,809
I'll never leave before I expose the true colors of that Tortoise-Flipping Man's perfect immortal image.

268
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,070
Besides, I already have a witness.

269
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,499
As long as we help it turn into an immortal,

270
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,850
not only will no one dare to bully it in the future,

271
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:18,689
but it can also help me testify against the Tortoise-Flipping Man's weird fetishes.

272
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:20,630
What do you have in mind then?

273
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,190
Just wait and see.

274
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,230
Yan Dan!

275
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,049
You've never had any medical training.

276
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:43,689
I'm afraid it's not good for the little tortoise if you insert the needles into it so rashly.

277
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:44,970
How is it not good?

278
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,149
The journey of immortal cultivation has never been easy.

279
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:51,610
Besides, it'll have to thank me if it finally turns into a human form in the future.

280
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,310
Just watch.

281
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,110
You pricked it to death.

282
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,290
No! That can't be!

283
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,870
I followed what was written in the ancient text.

284
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:23,029
- No. I must save it.
- Wait!

285
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:24,770
You really shouldn't do anything anymore.

286
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,010
Instead of saving it, you might get yourself killed.

287
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,949
If both of you die at the same time,

288
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,910
you'll leave me all alone in this room.

289
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,509
Then if the immortals come and investigate me...

290
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,069
Won't that be tragic?

291
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,030
Then what should we do?

292
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,230
How about you let me see it?

293
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:46,130
Your acupuncture hasn't had any effect yet.

294
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:49,950
Perhaps it'll recover if I talk to it.

295
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,430
All right.

296
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,350
Little Tortoise. Little Tortoise.

297
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,149
See how nicely Yan Dan treats you?

298
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,270
You mustn't disappoint her.

299
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,530
Please open your eyes and stretch your legs.

300
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,170
After that, you need to hang in there.

301
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,430
Little Tortoise, get up. Hurry, get up.

302
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,889
Not bad!

303
00:19:18,889 --> 00:19:21,410
As a fellow Aquatic Clan member, your minds really are connected.

304
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,770
You little tortoise!

305
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,890
Why didn't you respond to me when I talked to you just now?

306
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,489
This won't do. I must try again.

307
00:19:27,489 --> 00:19:29,790
Yan Dan! You can't.

308
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,709
This immortal tortoise is too young.

309
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,809
It may not be able to endure being pricked so many times in one night.

310
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:37,029
How about you let it cultivate for another two days?

311
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:40,690
When it has recovered, then you can try again.

312
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,650
That'll do too.

313
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,609
I'll be raising it in my room now anyway.

314
00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:47,090
So I can help it with its cultivation anytime.

315
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,509
But before it transforms into a human,

316
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:54,470
I'll never let that Tortoise-Flipping Man have it easy!

317
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,330
My poor little tortoise!

318
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,670
Why are you upside-down again?

319
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,469
Oh, dear little tortoise.

320
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,409
I thought you could get away from that devil's talons

321
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:35,650
if I took you away from Xuanxin Cliff.

322
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:39,009
I didn't expect that vile Ying Yuan still refuses to let you go.

323
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,720
<i>[Copy 50 times]</i>

324
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,670
Fine.

325
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,530
Real nice.

326
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:03,870
<i>[Tiglium Powder]
(T/N: induces constipation)</i>

327
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,590
This Queshe tea is for Your Majesty.

328
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:28,210
This Liuwu tea is for Star Deity Ji Du.

329
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:31,110
Please enjoy your tea.

330
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,929
We've deciphered their code.

331
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:35,170
They're indeed trying a two-pronged attack.

332
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:38,709
The other group has already swapped the magical tools between palaces

333
00:21:38,709 --> 00:21:43,850
and listed Crape Myrtle Bottle in the burning list of Magical Pavilion.

334
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:47,370
If they fill the sap from the Kunlun Sacred Tree into the Crape Myrtle Bottle,

335
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:50,130
they can refine poison that could scatter and wound souls.

336
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:54,910
If they were to use it in war, the casualties would be immeasurable.

337
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:59,350
That's right. I've followed our plan and asked Tao Ziqi

338
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:02,830
to release the news of having successfully obtained the sacred tree's sap.

339
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:07,109
Seeing how determined they are to possess the item that could refine poison to scatter the soul,

340
00:22:07,109 --> 00:22:11,030
I'm sure they have insiders among those who are in charge

341
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,850
of destroying discarded artifacts in Qianyun Palace.

342
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:19,110
We have laid out the "Crape Myrtle Strategy."

343
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,790
We just need to wait for them to make their move now.

344
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:28,670
Our plan will successfully spoil their plan.

345
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:36,470
Ying Yuan, why did you take advantage of me talking to beat me again?

346
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,449
Star Deity Ji Du, you have been talking all day.

347
00:22:44,449 --> 00:22:47,729
Your throat must be parched. Have some tea to soothe it.

348
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:53,489
Your Majesty, you should drink some tea to soothe your throat too.

349
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:04,170
Huan Qin, I want to try your tea today.

350
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,970
Why don't we switch?

351
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,070
Sure.

352
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,990
Wait!

353
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:18,129
Star Deity Ji Du, I know you love Liuwu tea.

354
00:23:18,129 --> 00:23:21,550
I can just get you another cup.

355
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,830
Where are you taking my clothes?

356
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:31,029
Don't you always complain about how bad I am at mending your Cosmic Jade Belt?

357
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:35,010
So I'm taking your clothes back for more practice.

358
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:37,989
Just in case you return the belt for the tenth time.

359
00:24:37,989 --> 00:24:39,650
Stop playing tricks.

360
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,410
If you put your mind on cultivation,

361
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:43,550
the belt would've been mended a long time ago.

362
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,929
That's because you played a trick on me first.

363
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:48,809
I'm just protecting myself.

364
00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:52,769
Besides, I'm only a low-ranking immortal attendant.

365
00:24:52,769 --> 00:24:55,689
I naturally don't have any decent magical spells that I can use.

366
00:24:55,689 --> 00:24:59,510
Unlike you, the almighty Emperor.

367
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:02,169
Don't you know? Since ancient times, the rule is that

368
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:05,190
a gentleman should tolerate a lady.

369
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:13,970
When did I say I was a gentleman?

370
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:25,009
Vile person! My sister embroidered that for me! Give it back!

371
00:25:25,009 --> 00:25:28,950
You can ask me for it after you've learned how to behave.

372
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:33,069
I won't give your clothes back to you then. Horrible jerk!

373
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,730
Your Majesty.

374
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,729
- So you've learned your lesson.
- Of course, I did.

375
00:26:09,729 --> 00:26:12,490
As the saying goes, "Conflicts won't end if we leave no room for compromise."

376
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:14,250
There's always someone better and stronger.

377
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:17,970
So I hope you don't stoop to the level of a lowly immortal like me. Am I right?

378
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:20,130
You're learning.

379
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,510
Come here.

380
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,750
What can I do to help you?

381
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,270
Put out your hand.

382
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,710
What kind of divine tool is this?

383
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:43,409
I can't accept rewards without doing anything.

384
00:26:43,409 --> 00:26:46,910
You're making me feel a little embarrassed.

385
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:49,830
Fifteen.

386
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,030
What are you doing?!

387
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:56,629
It's called a Distance-Keeping Bracelet. I added Distance-Keeping Lock to it.

388
00:26:56,629 --> 00:26:58,289
As long as you're within fifteen steps from me,

389
00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:01,130
you'll fly off just like what happened now.

390
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,270
I won't let you get away with this!

391
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:19,649
You vile person. You're such a vile person!

392
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:51,369
Who are you? Why did you barge into our Devil Realm?

393
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:56,550
Lowly soldiers like you are not qualified to talk to me.

394
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:00,870
Divine Official! Divine Official, please show mercy!

395
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,869
You ignorant fools!

396
00:28:05,869 --> 00:28:07,349
How dare you offend the Elder's important guest?

397
00:28:07,349 --> 00:28:09,530
Get back to your positions now!

398
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,010
All the elders have been gathering soldiers.

399
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,690
The big day is coming soon.

400
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:18,670
Elder Shuo Hua has been waiting anxiously for you to arrive.

401
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:22,450
<i>Your Highness, Si Xuan indeed stole the Unparalleled Mirror</i>

402
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,210
<i>under my orders.</i>

403
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:28,850
<i>The barrier Ran Qing set up has become a problem for the Devil Realm.</i>

404
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:32,390
Our clan has to seek self-preservation.

405
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:35,209
Soul Devouring Valley is now in the Devil's territory.

406
00:28:35,209 --> 00:28:37,569
He can station troops at the Deity and Divine realms.

407
00:28:37,569 --> 00:28:41,670
Why must the Devil Realm huddle up like cowards?!

408
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,830
You recruited a hundred thousand soldiers

409
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,910
and stationed five hundred thousand soldiers.

410
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:49,690
Are you protecting yourself or raising a rebellion?

411
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:52,410
Rebelling is a way of protecting ourselves.

412
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:55,630
Xuan Xiang, you're the ruler of the Devil Realm.

413
00:28:55,630 --> 00:29:00,250
Your skills are comparable to that of Emperor Ying Yuan.

414
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:04,790
How can such an almighty person have such low ambition?

415
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:07,550
Your Highness, Ran Qing is gone.

416
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:10,649
If you follow the example of Xuan Ye of the Asura Clan...

417
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:12,870
So this is what you were up to.

418
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:15,810
It looks like you've been plotting against me from the very beginning.

419
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:19,470
Your Highness, Si Xuan is dead.

420
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:22,530
The Devil soldiers have been mobilized. His Supreme Majesty will hold us accountable.

421
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:25,490
Instead of making amends and enduring humiliation,

422
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:29,570
why not go all out and fight for your own world?

423
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:10,730
Xuan Xiang, His Supreme Majesty has a message.

424
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:42,270
Emperor Ying Yuan has started a thorough investigation.

425
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:46,330
I'm afraid we can't save

426
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:48,990
the Devil spies in the Divine realm.

427
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:58,690
If that person is willing to lend a hand...

428
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:04,050
Elder Shuo Hua, do you want to take

429
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:07,070
the risk of being annihilated because of those few soldiers?

430
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:14,250
The Supreme Majesty is muddle-headed, and the gods and immortals are overbearing.

431
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,050
It has led to oppression of the Six Realms.

432
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:19,910
If we want to treat this disease, we must prescribe a potent medicine.

433
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:22,150
The warriors who died tragically can trigger

434
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:26,410
the blood and anger in the hearts of the Devil Clan, who have been subjugated for many years.

435
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:29,630
I won't let their sacrifice go in vain.

436
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:33,090
But... without the Unparalleled Mirror,

437
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:37,150
how can we attack the Southern Heavenly Gate?

438
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,909
Even if Ran Qing's extraordinary power is the best in the world,

439
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:42,430
tens of thousands of years have already passed.

440
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,610
The barrier has already weakened.

441
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:47,050
When the time comes, we'll coordinate with the spies

442
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:49,790
and find a way to break the barrier.

443
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,949
It's just that when we're facing a critical time,

444
00:31:51,949 --> 00:31:56,330
Devil King Xuan Xiang is still indecisive.

445
00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:00,909
Elder Shuo Hua, you need to make a decision for the Devil Clan.

446
00:32:00,909 --> 00:32:04,250
If the sacrifices of these devil warriors

447
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:07,770
couldn't move the Devil King's heart...

448
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:10,810
I think, in the Six Realms,

449
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:14,290
only the death of that immortal envoy, Tao Ziqi,

450
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:18,230
will make him change his mind.

451
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,670
This is a good plan.

452
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:26,750
We'll discuss this again after I report on this matter.

453
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,369
The day of the big plan must not change.

454
00:32:29,369 --> 00:32:31,330
It cannot be too early or too late.

455
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,890
You need to be patient for several more days, Elder.

456
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:37,649
Continue gathering and training the soldiers. Provoke the Devil King.

457
00:32:37,649 --> 00:32:41,310
We'll also deploy our men from the Divine and Deity realms

458
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:44,770
and assemble on the battlefield.

459
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:48,630
The years of the Devil Clan being disgraced will be washed away with blood.

460
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,570
Fifteen.

461
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:23,170
You vile person!

462
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,630
I must study.

463
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,510
I want revenge!

464
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,070
Speak properly!

465
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:37,430
Is there any kind of divine art that allows one to win in one move, without getting close to the target?

466
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:39,190
Give it to me.

467
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,629
Is this your first day knowing me?

468
00:33:40,629 --> 00:33:43,110
I'm not interested in immortal cultivation.

469
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:47,090
What if I told you that my target for revenge is Ying Yuan?

470
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,870
Would you be interested then?

471
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,570
You've finally come around.

472
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,410
I've been waiting for this day for a long time.

473
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:58,750
<i>[Law of Enchantment]</i>

474
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:02,370
What's wrong with you?

475
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:04,730
"Law of Enchantment"?

476
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:09,969
I'm talking about winning in one move using force... not beauty!

477
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:13,969
Seducing the Emperor is a grave crime. Do you want us to die?!

478
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,810
But isn't it your dream to be a follower?

479
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:20,049
Why are you giving up on a great ally like Ying Yuan by insisting on fighting him?

480
00:34:20,049 --> 00:34:23,110
Then... you should just go to the Heavenly Gallows and enjoy a quick punishment.

481
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:26,510
I-I'll go and look. I'll look for it.

482
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,950
I found it.

483
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:36,350
Let me see.

484
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:39,680
Which chapter?

485
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,440
All of them.

486
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,329
If you want to learn divine arts, it's useless if you don't cultivate your inner power.

487
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:46,140
You need to study the Yin and Yang, the five elements, and divination techniques too.

488
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,410
If you learn all these, and if nothing goes wrong,

489
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:50,410
Emperor Ying Yuan might still beat you in one move.

490
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:53,970
Why don't you consider my "Law of Enchantment" again?

491
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:56,850
No way. I'm going to borrow all of these.

492
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:59,010
Give them to me.

493
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,370
What a coincidence.

494
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:01,710
These are all directories.
<i>[The Directories]</i>

495
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:04,890
The books are at Yanxu Heavenly Palace. You can only borrow them from Emperor Ying Yuan.

496
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:08,330
But... don't you have a single one here?

497
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,450
After all, these are all middle and high-level divine arts.

498
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:12,530
Maybe Emperor Ying Yuan already predicted

499
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,870
that there would be a trial involving a beauty like you.

500
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:18,770
Oh, it's fate. Fate!

501
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:22,050
If there really is such a fate,

502
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:26,700
then, I, Yan Dan will be that vile Ying Yuan's natural enemy!

503
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:35,169
The Devil King may have submitted a statement making it clear that he doesn't intend to rebel.

504
00:35:35,169 --> 00:35:37,489
But according to the investigation of the immortal envoy, Tao Ziqi,

505
00:35:37,489 --> 00:35:40,370
the elders of the Devil Clan are wantonly recruiting soldiers.

506
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:44,049
They've stationed a hundred thousand soldiers at Soul Devouring Valley.

507
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:48,750
There are many war advocates among the devil elders.

508
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:53,830
If they use Si Xuan's death as an excuse to recruit soldiers

509
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:57,910
and force the Devil King to fight, then it'll be troublesome.

510
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:04,729
The Devil King has always been eccentric and lives in seclusion.

511
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:07,910
He doesn't interact with the deities or immortals.

512
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:10,330
I fear it'll be hard to predict his moves.

513
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:15,230
Why don't I go down to find out the truth?

514
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:26,529
That's a lot of text. It'll take half a month to copy everything, won't it?

515
00:36:26,529 --> 00:36:29,330
What did she do wrong?

516
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:33,629
Yan Dan, can you lend the "Cold Dawn Scriptures" to me after you finish copying it?

517
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,830
Sure.

518
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:40,729
I've always wanted to read "Six Principles of Overflowing Collection." Can you lend it to me?

519
00:36:40,729 --> 00:36:42,570
Me too! Me too!

520
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:46,610
Thank you.

521
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,090
"Curl the upper body."

522
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,950
"Circulate the energy within the organs."

523
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,190
"Concentrate in the wrists."

524
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:06,410
What a smart girl.

525
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:09,510
"Cold Dawn Scriptures" can make immortal power pure.

526
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:12,630
It's also the key to mastering the Truth Duster.

527
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:16,549
For a mere immortal attendant to be able to actually read such text...

528
00:37:16,549 --> 00:37:19,610
I don't think it's a punishment, but a reward.

529
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,290
Of course, it's a punishment.

530
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:22,750
She's very noisy.

531
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:26,770
Having her copy the texts... will give me some peace.

532
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:30,370
You prefer tranquility, while I like things to be lively.

533
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:34,950
How about... you send her to my palace?

534
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,330
No.

535
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:39,770
Since I took her in, it's only natural for me to be the one

536
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:42,190
to correct her clamorous behavior.

537

You're a fast learner.

543
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:09,409
It's unfortunate that your wrists and foundation are weak.

544
00:39:09,409 --> 00:39:12,849
You're mocking me! You vile person!

545
00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:14,710
Am I?

546
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,230
Don't come near me.

547
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:21,769
If you're so talented, I dare you get rid of this lousy bracelet!

548
00:39:21,769 --> 00:39:23,870
I want to challenge you one-on-one!

549
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:25,649
If you're able to, take it off yourself.

550
00:39:25,649 --> 00:39:28,690
I will wait for that day to come.
