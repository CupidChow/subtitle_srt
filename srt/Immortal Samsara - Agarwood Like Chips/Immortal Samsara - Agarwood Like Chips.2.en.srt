15
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,280
What's wrong?

16
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,160
His Majesty adores this Cosmic Jade Belt.

17
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,420
What should we do?

18
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,300
Fairies.

19
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,860
This belt has kept His Majesty company for twenty centuries.

20
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,270
How could you two be so careless?

21
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,100
Who damaged it?

22
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,020
- Senior Immortal Attendant.
- Senior Immortal Attendant.

23
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,219
I am Yan Dan of Xuanxin Cliff. I was the one who broke it.

24
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:05,880
It has nothing to do with Zhi Xi.

25
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,139
How dare a lowly immortal attendant like you trespass on our sacred area and damaged His Majesty's favorite item?

26
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,999
Follow me to Yanxu Heavenly Palace to receive your punishment.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,619
Although Deputy Curator didn't damage it, it was caused by her negligence.

28
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:19,699
I cannot hide this from His Majesty and the Curator of Magical Pavilion.

29
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:22,680
I shall bear the blame myself. Please do not blame Sister Zhi Xi.

30
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,990
It all depends on His Majesty's will.

31
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,630
Let's go.

32
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,920
Yan Dan.

33
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,759
Don't worry, Sister. I'll be fine.

34
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,890
I'll come back and retrieve "The Divine Scripture Collection" tonight.

35
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,510
Wait for me.

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,580
Marshal!

37
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,599
The divine tools that were stolen by Si Xuan, former Curator of Magical Pavilion, have been stolen by the Devils!

38
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,239
Find Emperor Ying Yuan immediately and tell him to intercept them, no matter the cost.

39
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,319
If not, this war will never end!

40
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,940
Yes, Marshal!

41
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,260
Elder Zhan Yi, you started an internal conflict among the Devils.

42
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:07,920
If you hand over the divine tools now, I will leave your corpse intact.

43
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,420
If not, I have no choice but to conform to destiny and rid the world of your clan.

44
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,100
I'm in possession of the most powerful divine tools within the Nine Heavens.

45
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,610
I won't surrender to you.

46
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,060
Get in formation. Slay the Emperor!

47
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,710
The Asura Totem?

48
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,600
Is the Emperor of the Divine Realm actually a descendant of the Asura Clan?

49
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,980
<i> I guess it's time to tell you about the secret of your birth.</i>

50
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,859
<i> You're the child of the leader of the Asura Clan and a fairy of the Divine Realm.</i>

51
00:05:20,859 --> 00:05:26,220
<i> The black mark on your forehead is the Asura Clan's Totem.</i>

52
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,465
<i> If that's true, where is my mother?</i>

53
00:05:29,465 --> 00:05:33,980
<i> Back then, your mother was bewitched by your father.</i>

54
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,280
<i> She realized that she was manipulated only after she gave birth to you.</i>

55
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,999
<i> That's why she chose to practice martyrdom and perish together with your father.</i>

56
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:45,200
<i> With her last breath,</i>

57
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,720
<i> she entrusted you to me.</i>

58
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,360
<i> Ying Yuan, you weren't supposed to exist.</i>

59
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,560
<i> However, you were very young back then. I couldn't bear to take your life.</i>

60
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:03,319
<i> Thus, I removed the black mark on your forehead, raised you, and enlightened you.</i>

61
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,160
<i> However, Ying Yuan, you must remember this.</i>

62
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,559
<i> No one must find out that you're a descendant of the Asura Clan.</i>

63
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:16,370
<i> If anyone in the Divine Realm finds out that you're a descendant of the Asura Clan,</i>

64
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,510
<i> they will definitely hunt you down.</i>

65
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:21,360
<i> So... you're a descendant of an ancient bloodline of deities.</i>

66
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,959
<i> You have no parents. Do you understand?</i>

67
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,620
Your Supreme Majesty.

68
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,230
Now that the internal conflict between the Devils is over,

69
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,440
all the stolen divine tools have been retrieved too.

70
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,280
They are currently stored in the Magical Pavilion.

71
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:04,130
A thousand heavenly soldiers and two heavenly generals were sacrificed in this war.

72
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,870
Marshal Huo De is visiting the injured in the Heavenly Infirmary.

73
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,889
Internal conflicts broke out one after another within the Devil Realm.

74
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,249
The Divine Realm had to intervene every time to stop the chaos.

75
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:19,249
This time, countless elixirs were sent to the Devil Realm

76
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:24,569
due to Si Xuan's collusion with the Devils' elder. The war has been in a stalemate for months.

77
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:29,810
Did you notice any suspicious behavior from Devil Realm's Xuan Xiang when you descended into their realm?

78
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:35,990
Your Supreme Majesty, Xuan Xiang supported my every move.

79
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,849
He has stated many times that he leads a carefree life, and that he's not ambitious.

80
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:42,989
After I met him, I realized that he wasn't lying.

81
00:07:42,989 --> 00:07:47,049
He has the ability to stick to his purpose. He's not a hypocrite.

82
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:52,349
If Devil King Xuan Xiang truly isn't ambitious, it will be fortunate for the Six Realms.

83
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:58,630
Judging from his personality, I'm afraid it's both good and bad for the Divine Realm.

84
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,750
What do you mean?

85
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:06,150
Xuan Xiang is not suitable to rule over the Devils.

86
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:11,470
He doesn't like power. He left the elders alone even when they were trying to fight for the throne.

87
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:14,709
It may seem like the Devils are done for now. However, they will recover soon.

88
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:20,330
If one of them gradually gets stronger, we cannot say for sure that the Devil King will remain the same.

89
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:23,130
By then, war will be unavoidable.

90
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:26,710
Your Supreme Majesty, please take the necessary precautions.

91
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:30,510
From tomorrow onward, the Deity Intelligence Bureau and Deity Soldier Division will be on standby.

92
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,300
You will command them.

93
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,740
We mustn't let Devil Realm take advantage of any opportunity.

94
00:08:34,749 --> 00:08:36,200
Yes.

95
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,010
Your Supreme Majesty, everything is ready.

96
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,070
Execute the punishment.

97
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:17,510
Did you see that? She was a curator with a bright future ahead of her.

98
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:21,010
Even Huan Qin requested for her hand in marriage.

99
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:27,429
However, for the sake of love, she colluded with the evil Devils and went against the heavenly law.

100
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:35,190
Those who were punished because of love shall only rest after death if they do not admit their mistakes.

101
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,510
Your Supreme Majesty,

102
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,330
Si Xuan had been faithful to her duty for several millennia.

103
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,330
She was just temporarily bewitched.

104
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:50,450
Your Supreme Majesty, could you please spare her this time?

105
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:59,990
All right. If she's willing to admit her mistake, I will let her retain her primordial spirit after death.

106
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:04,969
I will allow her to cleanse herself of her past in the Forgetting Night River and be reincarnated as a human.

107
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:22,790
Si Xuan, Elder Zhan Yi is already dead.

108
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,940
You still have a chance to repent.

109
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,930
My lover is already dead.

110
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,950
How could I live a cowardly life without him?

111
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:32,390
Moreover, the heavenly law is clearly unfair.

112
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:35,290
I have no regrets, and I have done nothing wrong!

113
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,970
Si Xuan, you discarded your virtues and rationality because of love.

114
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:56,409
How dare you make such irresponsible remarks, saying that the heavenly law is unfair?

115
00:10:56,409 --> 00:11:01,789
Do you know why the first rule of the heavenly law was to abstain from falling in love?

116
00:11:01,789 --> 00:11:06,569
Because the Six Realms can only be at peace when the immortals have no feelings.

117
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,210
Emperor Ying Yuan, did you see that?

118
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:18,489
Once you plunge into the world of love, you're beyond redemption.

119
00:11:18,489 --> 00:11:21,110
Tens of thousands of people died because of one curator's love.

120
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,860
What do you think will happen if a divine emperor falls in love?

121
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,630
Calamity will descend upon the Six Realms.

122
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,060
No one can escape from it.

123
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:38,990
Do you know why the Six Realms are at peace now?

124
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:43,150
It's merely because the Demon, Devil, and Underworld Realms are biding their time.

125
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:46,489
All of those traitorous beings are just waiting for an opportunity to strike.

126
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:50,870
They're waiting for you to expose your weaknesses.

127
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:54,970
What's wrong? Do you feel compassion for her?

128
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:00,090
Your compassion today will give birth to cowardice later.

129
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:03,050
What if the Six Realms have to face an unprecedented crisis?

130
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,770
What will you do then?

131
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,810
Emperor, please end my life!

132
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:16,609
I no longer want to stay in the Nine Heavens!

133
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:21,329
You've sacrificed everything for Zhan Yi to bring suffering to the Six Realms.

134
00:12:21,329 --> 00:12:25,389
However, he didn't even inquire about your well-being right before his death.

135
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:27,210
Do you think it's worth it?

136
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,470
Whether it's worth it or not,

137
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,110
Your Majesty shall know in the future.

138
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:36,130
That day will never come.

139
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,370
Love is born from our hearts.

140
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:42,930
Your Majesty, could it be that you're heartless?

141
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,849
I beg you! Please kill me!

142
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:53,890
I would rather perish with love

143
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:57,470
than live together with heartless beings like you all!

144
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:03,070
I've had enough of this unfair treatment! I beg you!

145
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,230
Please end my life!

146
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:35,290
<i>The punishment for love cannot be violated.</i>

147
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,850
<i>The only thing I can do for you is to retain a sliver of your primordial spirit.</i>

148
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:44,629
<i>I hope you can cross the Night Forgetting River and start anew.</i>

149
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:47,530
<i>I hope you can live an ordinary life as a mortal.</i>

150
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:52,530
<i>I hope you can love and live for yourself.</i>

151
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:02,140
<i>[Yanxu Heavenly Palace]</i>

152
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,610
Your—

153
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,670
Tortoise-Flipping Man? It's you?

154
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,870
Yan Dan, mind your manners!

155
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:51,510
I am Emperor Qingli, Ying Yuan.
<i>(TN: "Qingli" is his royal title)</i>

156
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:54,510
<i>The Tortoise-Flipping Man is actually the Emperor?</i>

157
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,989
Please pardon me for my carelessness. Your Majesty, I damaged your belt by accident.

158
00:14:59,989 --> 00:15:01,750
Please punish me.

159
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,590
How could an immortal attendant of Xuanxin Cliff come into contact with my belt?

160
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,910
I remember now.

161
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:13,270
Your elder sister, Zhi Xi, has a position in Magical Pavilion.

162
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:17,129
Your Majesty, I-I damaged your jade belt by accident when I was visiting my sister.

163
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:19,989
It has nothing to do with Zhi Xi. It is all my fault.

164
00:15:19,989 --> 00:15:21,790
Your Majesty, please judge wisely.

165
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:26,290
The belt isn't that big of a deal. Get up.

166
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,510
Thank you, Your Majesty.

167
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,409
Your Majesty is magnanimous indeed.

168
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,709
- In the future, I will surely...
- Although I said it wasn't a big deal,

169
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:40,210
I didn't say I wouldn't punish you.

170
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,089
Qing Yun.

171
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,410
Yes, Your Majesty.

172
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,570
Don't we need someone to clean up the side hall?

173
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,390
Yes, Your Majesty.

174
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,469
Yan Dan has damaged an important item due to her unruly nature.

175
00:15:51,469 --> 00:15:54,270
She must serve me in Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

176
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:59,230
She has to repair the Cosmic Jade Belt until I'm satisfied with the result.

177
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:12,470
Immortal Lord, you can stop here.

178
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:16,029
I'm leaving today. Please take good care of yourself.

179
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:19,370
I will visit you often in the future.

180
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:26,710
I didn't expect you to make such a sudden departure.

181
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,410
Don't be sad.

182
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:36,610
Who will solve my GO riddles for me in the future?

183
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,550
Please stop crying, Immortal Lord.

184
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:44,610
Immortal Lord, I have served you for over two hundred years.

185
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:49,129
Are you only sad about the fact that I can no longer solve your GO riddles for you?

186
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:52,329
If that's true, I'll be very disappointed!

187
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,870
That's not what I meant.

188
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:06,850
This sack of divine tools will be my parting gift to you.

189
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:11,349
However, you need to remember this. You must visit me often in the future.

190
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:17,110
Don't worry! Immortal Lord, this sack is quite heavy.

191
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:21,500
I can finally feel your unwillingness to part with me.

192
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,449
How about this? Why don't I solve one more GO riddle for you before my departure?

193
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:27,599
Sure! Come.

194
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,290
I remember something. I found the culprit who flipped the tortoise.

195
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,010
Who was it?

196
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:14,830
The wrongdoer emperor has finally exhausted all of his schemes.

197
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,800
This riddle is actually easier than the last one!

198
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:21,829
That move was excellent. You followed through with your strategy.

199
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:26,609
Look. You've rendered his GO pieces here useless.

200
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:29,070
How did you come up with that move?

201
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:32,670
When it comes to GO, it's either about exposing the opponent's weakness

202
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,850
and taking advantage of his mistakes...

203
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:39,580
or robbing the opponent of his game of Go pieces.

204
00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:42,030
If I can't rob them, I'll swallow them all.

205
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,569
The latter is usually harder to execute.

206
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:48,710
However, with determination, you can overcome anything!

207
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,170
Excellent!

208
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:54,210
I was planning to play a game of GO with Immortal Lord Bei Ming.

209
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:58,449
I didn't expect to witness a scene of a loyal attendant unwilling to part with her master.

210
00:18:58,449 --> 00:19:01,490
I'm too embarrassed to request her to serve me now.

211
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:11,430
Emperor Ying Yuan, when did you arrive?

212
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:14,190
I was here in time to hear something about a wrongdoer emperor.

213
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:18,170
You two were quite absorbed in the game, so I didn't interrupt you.

214
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,770
You... You're a Greater God!

215
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:23,320
How could you eavesdrop on our conversation?

216
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,670
Don't you think that's inappropriate?

217
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,769
I'm ashamed. I set a bad example.

218
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:33,069
That's why Immortal Lord Bei Ming cheated in his game. I'm truly ashamed.

219
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:38,869
Emperor Ying Yuan, you must be joking. I'm sure you felt sorry for me when I racked my brain to solve these games.

220
00:19:38,869 --> 00:19:44,449
That's why you lowered the difficulty again and again. You went easy on me, right?

221
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,809
We were just joking.

222
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:52,129
Once Yan Dan heads to Yanxu Heavenly Palace, I'm sure her GO skills and divine arts

223
00:19:52,129 --> 00:19:57,710
will reach a new height under your guidance.

224
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:12,890
Since you're full of energy, it would be a waste to assign you to clean the side hall.

225
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:18,089
In the future, you'll be in charge of copying the divine arts manual and solving GO riddles.

226
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,100
Your Majesty, you're a game of GO expert.

227
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,520
I'm sure many immortals challenge you to a game of GO matches.

228
00:20:22,529 --> 00:20:26,209
- If that's the case, do I...
- An able man is always busy.

229
00:20:26,209 --> 00:20:32,230
In the future, you shall deal with all of the GO riddles.

230
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:37,290
<i>You're just angry that I solved your GO riddles on Immortal Lord Bei Ming's behalf.</i>

231
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,540
<i>You're abusing your power!</i>

232
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,070
Yes, Your Majesty.

233
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,569
Also, repair the Cosmic Jade Belt as soon as possible.

234
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:57,410
Don't waste the other attendants' time by waiting for them to remind you.

235
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,730
Yes, Your Majesty.

236
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,409
Ying Yuan is such a vile person.

237
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:13,190
He may look gentle and polite, but in reality, he's just scum!

238
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,850
He assigned so many chores to me.

239
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:18,140
He's doing it on purpose. What a vile person!

240
00:21:18,149 --> 00:21:23,830
I never expected the perfect emperor to have such an interesting side.

241
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:27,750
I think my admiration for him has increased.

242
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,950
Whose side are you on?

243
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,200
Yan Dan, that's enough.

244
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,600
His Majesty flipped the tortoise only on a whim.

245
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,000
It isn't that big of a deal.

246
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,400
Moreover, he was playing GO with Immortal Lord Bei Ming.

247
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,600
An outsider like you shouldn't have interfered.

248
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,800
Although you said he was a vile emperor to his face,

249
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,400
he still laughed it off.

250
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,000
We can see that he's magnanimous.

251
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,900
He's a gentleman.

252
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,800
Zhi Xi, can you please sober up?

253
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,000
Y-You're just charmed by his looks!

254
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,400
Do you know how big Yanxu Heavenly Palace is?

255
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,000
I have to do all kinds of chores.

256
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,200
My whole body is sore.

257
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,000
He even instructed me to repeatedly copy that stupid manual!

258
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,100
My brain is hurting from all those words!

259
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,200
Do you know how many people wish to join Yanxu Heavenly Palace?

260
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,200
You should cherish your good fortune.

261
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,800
Zhi Xi.

262
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,400
Curator.

263
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,800
You played a petty trick so that your sister could take the blame.

264
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,600
You do love your sister dearly.

265
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,300
It's a pity that His Majesty is a magnanimous person.

266
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,800
Yan Dan's misfortune was a blessing in disguise.

267
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:54,200
I wonder if you're jealous of your younger sister?

268
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,000
Do you regret it?

269
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,400
If it weren't for that one wrong thought,

270
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,000
you would be the one receiving His Majesty's grace now.

271
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,200
It's not easy to be an attendant at Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

272
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,400
Yan Dan suffers every day.

273
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,200
Do you actually believe her petty complaints?

274
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,800
She was just showing off.

275
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,100
Yan Dan isn't that kind of person.

276
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,500
What kind of person is she then?

277
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,500
Is she a useless younger sister who doesn't strive to improve?

278
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,800
Twins are always born with differences.

279
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,400
Everyone says that you're the dominant twin.

280
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I beg to differ.

281
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:40,200
If that was true, His Majesty wouldn't take a liking to that useless Yan Dan.

282
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,600
Think about it yourself.

283
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,200
Yan Dan, you've been acting mysterious lately.

284
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,800
You didn't even tell me what you wrote.

285
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,700
You can tell me now, right?

286
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,200
I wrote this play because I was inspired

287
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,600
by "The War of Genesis", the book you recommended to me.

288
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,300
During the dawn of civilization,

289
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,200
using the divine tool, Unparalleled Mirror, the Asura Clan

290
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,000
broke the barrier between the Heaven and Devil Realms, causing a full-scale war.

291
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
His Supreme Majesty and the Four Emperors saved the living beings,

292
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,800
split the Four Seas and formed the Six Realms.

293
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,000
That's how peace was introduced to the world.

294
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,400
It sounds like a boot-licking play to me.
<i>(TN: seeking favor by fawning, servile behavior)</i>

295
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,500
You're so sleazy.

296
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,449
If I only wrote about the great war,

297
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:46,089
I'm sure all the immortals would say that I was making up nonsense.

298
00:24:46,089 --> 00:24:47,700
I'm not that dumb.

299
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,800
Besides, it's boring if I only write about the war.

300
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,000
It's not interesting at all.

301
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
What exactly did you write then?

302
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Using the war as my setting,

303
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I wrote from the perspective of a being

304
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,200
whose ancient clan was annihilated.

305
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,900
We can imagine the powerful from the insignificant and see the strong through the weak.

306
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,900
Which ancient clan did you choose?

307
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,600
In order to assist the Four Emperors,

308
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,400
their clan was wiped out during the War of Genesis.

309
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,300
It was the Nine Fins Clan.

310
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,000
<i> [Wenshui Pavilion]</i>

311
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,800
Did you find out about the Nine Fins Clan?

312
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,000
Exactly.

313
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,800
They were once known as the strongest Aquatic Clan among the Six Realms.

314
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,400
Dragons in the sky, mermen in the sea,

315
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,600
immune to all poison, and unaffected by the elements.

316
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,200
They were terrifying.

317
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,900
However, they were gradually forgotten

318
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,600
by people in the era of peace.

319
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:47,000
Now, who else can remember the Nine Fins Clan besides us?

320
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,600
Do they remind you of yourself?

321
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,800
Is that why you sympathize with them?

322
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,500
At least, the Four-Leaf Lotus still has my sister and me around.

323
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,400
However, the Nine Fins Clan weren't able to keep their bloodline intact.

324
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,600
It's such a pity.

325
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,200
Legend has it that although the Nine Fins Clan were excellent warriors,

326
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,000
they were born with no desires.

327
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,400
Before they acquire their human forms,

328
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,800
they will go through a life-or-death situation.

329
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,300
If they fail the test,

330
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,800
their power will dissipate and they will die.

331
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,000
If they pass the test, they will be reborn.

332
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
<i>[Xuanxin Cliff]</i>

333
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,000
<i>[Pixiang Hall]</i>

334
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,000
A'Chen, the battlefield you're heading to

335
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,800
is located between the Divine and Underworld Realms.

336
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,200
I'm afraid you will face a two-pronged attack.

337
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,500
You must be careful.

338
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,800
I will.

339
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,400
<i>Beings of the Demon and Underworld Realms are easy to deal with.</i>

340
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,900
But you, Feng Yi, you must come and find me

341
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,600
once you're done with your duties.

342
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,200
Naturally.

343
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,500
Why don't we make a bet?

344
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,900
The one who ends their war earlier can name our child. What do you think?

345
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,400
All right.

346
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,300
I hope we can reunite before the birth of our child.

347
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,600
<i>It's been ages since then.</i>

348
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,200
<i>I never expected anyone to remember the Nine Fins Clan.</i>

349
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,400
Stop!

350
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,900
That's wrong. It's all wrong!

351
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,600
You're a renowned female general of the Nine Fins Clan.

352
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,600
- Even if you're facing separation,
- <i>Is it her?</i>

353
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,000
your eyes need to look determined.

354
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,300
You have to suppress the longing in your heart. Do you understand?

355
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:13,000
And you, you have no idea that this is your last encounter with her.

356
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,600
That's why you shouldn't show too much grief.

357
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,600
You must believe

358
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,600
that your spouse will return victoriously.

359
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,800
How about this? Let's give it another go.

360
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,200
Yan Dan.

361
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,800
It's getting late.

362
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,000
I think we should stop now.

363
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,400
Don't forget that they have to do their duties early in the morning tomorrow.

364
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,000
Then... I think that's all for today.

365
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,600
You can study your roles once you get back.

366
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,000
Meeting dismissed.

367
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,700
Let's go.

368
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,600
The Curator here took the divine we gave her, right? Did she say anything?

369
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,700
No. His Supreme Majesty favors warfare over literature.

370
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,600
This stage was abandoned long ago.

371
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,200
The Curator was happy that we could find a use for it.

372
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,000
I'm glad to hear that.

373
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,500
The first chapter is about the separation of the two generals of the Nine Fins Clan.

374
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,200
The last chapter is about their separation after death.

375
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,200
I don't know how I should proceed with the chapter about the Four Emperors.

376
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,000
<i>Lu Ming, you're something else.</i>

377
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,200
<i>How dare you try to scare me?</i>

378
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,200
My script!

379
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,500
My script!

380
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,000
Buddy, who are you?

381
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Why did you enter my room in the middle of the night?

382
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,600
You can actually wield divine water arts?

383
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,200
Tell me! What are you up to?

384
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,200
You won't tell me?

385
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,800
Fine. If you're going to keep quiet,

386
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,200
I'll shout for the heavenly soldiers!

387
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,000
Heavenly...

388
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,200
I am just a...

389
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,200
a black fish who has just acquired my human form.

390
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,000
I accidently wandered into Pixiang Hall

391
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,800
and saw the rehearsal you all were doing.

392
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,000
I thought it was very interesting.

393
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I wanted to know more about the plot development.

394
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,800
That's why I sneaked in here.

395
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,500
I just wanted to see

396
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,900
how the plot develops after this.

397
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,600
Did you become a grown man right after you acquired your human form?

398
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,000
So you're from the Aquatic Clan.

399
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,400
No wonder you can put out fires.

400
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:45,000
So are those the reasons you saved my script for me?

401
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,600
Seems like you do have a conscience.

402
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,000
The black fish I knew wasn't as kind as you.

403
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,300
Judging from your outfit,

404
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,800
you don't look like a star deity or immortal attendant.

405
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,000
So... did you really sneak in here

406
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,200
because you thought my play was great?

407
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,400
Yes.

408
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,800
I wish to know about the story of the former Dragon Emperor and his Empress.

409
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,000
I also wish to know how the plot will develop.

410
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,800
By the way,

411
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,400
the Nine Fins Clan was originally the ruler of the Four Seas.

412
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,700
I wish to know what happened to them.

413
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,800
You actually know about the Nine Fins Clan?

414
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,800
I thought I was the only person

415
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,600
who knew about the Nine Fins Clan!

416
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,300
Buddy, you have great taste!

417
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,600
What's your name?

418
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,000
I... I don't have a name yet.

419
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,689
<i>He doesn't even have a name?</i>

420
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,800
<i>Looks like he is from a lowly rank.</i>

421
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,600
<i>It must have been tough for him.</i>

422
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,400
It's like this.

423
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,600
You're lucky that you encountered me today.

424
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:49,800
You can be my follower. I promise you a happy and enjoyable life as long as I'm around.

425
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,500
What do you think?

426
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:57,309
<i>I'm sure I could never have acquired my human form so smoothly if she hadn't rescued me </i>

427
00:31:57,309 --> 00:32:00,330
<i>when I was facing the test.</i>

428
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:03,969
<i>If that's the case, I guess being her follower is no big deal to me.</i>

429
00:32:03,969 --> 00:32:06,589
What do you think? Have you made up your mind?

430
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:09,129
Are you sure about that?

431
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,409
Yes!

432
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:11,929
You don't have a name yet, right?

433
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,249
Let me give you a name.

434
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,810
Give me a moment.

435
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:24,310
Are you sure?

436
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,369
<i>[Yu Hei Tu]</i>

437
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,750
Done!

438
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:39,190
This name is actually pretty good.

439
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,970
I think so too.

440
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:43,550
"Yu Mo?"
<i>(TN: The character for "Mo" looks like the characters for "Hei Tu" put one on top of the other - 墨)</i>

441
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:49,870
I clearly wrote "Yu Hei Tu."

442
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:53,990
Didn't you say so yourself? You're a black fish that has just acquired human form.

443
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:56,670
That's why I think the name "Hei Tu" fits you well.
<i> (TN: "Hei Tu" literally translates to "black soil")</i>

444
00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:00,110
No. That sounds so lame.

445
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,050
I think "Yu Mo" sounds better.
<i>(TN: "Mo" literally translates to "ink")</i>

446
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,690
You see...

447
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:07,230
Fate led us to encounter each other.

448
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:11,190
Fate also led me to read the words wrongly.

449
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,849
So I think I'll call myself "Yu Mo."

450
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:17,209
Although you do have a point, I still think Hei Tu sounds cuter.

451
00:33:17,209 --> 00:33:19,569
Wait. I think we shouldn't go against fate.

452
00:33:19,569 --> 00:33:23,930
From now on, you should call me "Yu Mo," okay?

453
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:28,189
All right then. I'll call you "Yu Mo."

454
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:46,349
Your Majesty, Yan Dan seeks an audience.

455
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,449
For what purpose?

456
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:49,969
She said she finished repairing the Cosmic Jade Belt.

457
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:52,450
Your Majesty, are you willing to grant her an audience?

458
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:55,109
- Call her in.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

459
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:59,170
Your needlework has improved.

460
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:02,450
However, I don't like the color of the thread.

461
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,650
Do it again.

462
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:10,450
Your Majesty, what color would you like then?

463
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,070
It depends.

464
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:14,239
Your Majesty, I thought you were in a hurry to use it.

465
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,409
I just hope you can make your requests more specific.

466
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:19,609
That way, I won't need to disturb you every day.

467
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:21,609
Although I'm in a hurry, I'm not desperate.

468
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,609
You have to come here every day anyway.

469
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,570
Every day?

470
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:27,929
Come here. Solve this GO riddle for me.

471
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:47,789
This GO riddle is much more complex than the one you designed for Immortal Lord Bei Ming.

472
00:34:47,789 --> 00:34:50,410
Which immortal designed this riddle?

473
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:53,690
I did.

474
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:56,730
See if you can solve it.

475
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,130
I'll give it a try.

476
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,570
<i>[Heavenly Kitchen]</i>

477
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:50,709
The food we have in the Nine Heavens can replenish your spiritual power.

478
00:35:50,709 --> 00:35:52,250
Eat up.

479
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,989
I already told you this when I came in.

480
00:35:54,989 --> 00:35:57,529
I will never act like a thief.

481
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,490
Even so, you insisted on asking me to be here.

482
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,730
What a hypocrite.

483
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:05,369
The eggs here were laid by divine chickens.

484
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:07,449
It can boost your immortality.

485
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:09,330
Are you sure you don't want it?

486
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,089
No.

487
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:13,030
I said I wouldn't eat—

488
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,370
You asked for it.

489
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,510
I said...

490
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:26,769
This is so delicious!

491
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:27,929
Right?

492
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:32,569
I told you already. My cooking skills are not inferior to my playwriting skills.

493
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,450
If so, what was the name of the play you all rehearsed before this?

494
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:40,530
"The Tale of The Genesis Hero."

495
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:44,670
I thought the main leads were from the Nine Fins Clan.

496
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,550
Do you think they're heroes?

497
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,809
Of course, they're heroes.

498
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:54,650
In the War of Genesis, His Supreme Majesty and the Four Emperors are known as heroes.

499
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,549
The Nine Fins Clan are heroes too.

500
00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:00,070
To me, even insignificant deities and pawns

501
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:06,230
are heroes, as long as they fought hard in the war.

502
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:09,350
That's why I wrote this play in the first place.

503
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:55,629
Well, this is a surprise indeed.

504
00:37:55,630 --> 00:38:01,529
So the Kunlun Sacred Tree that grew in the Land Under the Horizon was actually shifted here after the War of Genesis.

505
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,949
The Deity Clan and Devil Clan are right next to each other.

506
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:06,730
And this tree has immense spiritual power.

507
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:10,449
I'm sure the Four Emperors thought it wasn't appropriate to plant the tree in the Devil Realm.

508
00:38:10,449 --> 00:38:13,010
They didn't want to lose control of it.

509
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:16,709
Anyway, I won't be able to experience how it felt to be involved in such a war.

510
00:38:16,709 --> 00:38:19,910
However, we can check out the sacred tree.

511
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:21,770
That's what I intend to do.

512
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,990
You mustn't!

513
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:26,629
The Kunlun Sacred Tree thrives on spiritual power.

514
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:29,969
Your centuries' worth of cultivation will go down the drain if you get entangled by accident.

515
00:38:29,969 --> 00:38:32,629
Moreover, the Land Under the Horizon is a forbidden land of the Nine Heavens.

516
00:38:32,629 --> 00:38:36,190
You will be punished if someone finds out.

517
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,830
Hurry!

518
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,349
Help! Save me!

519
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:44,350
Friends, please save me!

520
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,909
Which palace did you come from?

521
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,829
Why were you caught by the sacred tree's vines?

522
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:51,869
I... I-I was too playful for my own good, and I trespassed onto the forbidden ground.

523
00:38:51,869 --> 00:38:55,330
I didn't expect to get entangled!

524
00:38:55,330 --> 00:39:00,529
However, according to ancient records, the tree will only attack you if you cast a spell on it.

525
00:39:00,529 --> 00:39:03,410
Why did you cast a spell on the tree?

526
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,589
I... How should I know?

527
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:07,549
I just liked how the leaves looked.

528
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:10,850
I wanted to acquire it and use it as a bookmark.

529
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:15,589
Be careful. He's lying to us.

530
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:18,509
You may be able to trick others, but I won't fall for it.

531
00:39:18,509 --> 00:39:19,669
You were lying just now.

532
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:22,669
There's a slash mark on the tree. Did you do that?

533
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,770
The sap of the Kunlun Sacred Tree can be used to create poison.

534
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:28,610
It can be used to create elixirs too.

535
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:30,430
I'm sure you sneaked in here.

536
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:32,749
Tell us. Which palace did you come from?

537
00:39:32,749 --> 00:39:34,170
Tell us!

538
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,430
Don't use any magic spells!

539
00:39:51,246 --> 00:39:52,846
Watch out!

540
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:03,190
Yu Mo!

541
