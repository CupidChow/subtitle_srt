00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,000
<i>What's your name?</i>

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,260
<i>Why are you here alone?</i>

17
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,500
<i>Cover the hot furnace when it's cold at dusk.</i>

<i>Shape the eyebrows on a warm spring day.</i>

19
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,440
<i>My name is Mu Han.</i>

20
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,660
<i>Don't you remember me?</i>

21
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,560
<i>Ran Qing.</i>

22
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,860
<i>It turns out Mu Han and Xuan Ye are the same person.</i>

23
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:33,080
<i>You approached me just to steal Seven Star Deity Jade.</i>

24
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,120
<i>Why?</i>

25
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,320
<i>Ran Qing!</i>

26
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:52,500
<i>All immortals and gods have been wiped out, and the Six Realms are under my reign now.</i>

27
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,960
<i>Love and the world... I want them both.</i>

28
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,950
<i>Ran Qing. You can't kill me.</i>

29
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:28,000
<i>Quit being stubborn and be my queen.</i>

30
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,140
<i>When I hold your hand, I realize that I wish to be with you forever.</i>

31
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,860
<i>I won't make any mistakes again.</i>

32
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,980
<i>Let's indulge ourselves in the galaxy of stars,</i>

33
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:31,620
<i>and in the wheel of time, in days and nights for eternity.</i>

34
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,880
<i>Even though I've turned back the time over and over again,</i>

35
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,860
<i>I still couldn't be with you without destroying the world.</i>

36
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:42,160
<i>This time... I'll definitely live my life to the fullest with you.</i>

37
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,400
<i>The cloud is beautiful.</i>

38
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:03,440
<i>Xuan Ye said that I'm always busy, and I've missed the beautiful scenery.</i>

39
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,360
<i>I'll scoop this piece of cloud and take it back to admire it with him.</i>

40
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,360
<i>Your Majesty, we've received the report of victory from the southern battlefield.</i>

41
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,380
<i>Keep the army on their toes and go after the enemy troops.</i>

42
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:55,700
<i>We must conquer the Six Realms before Primordial Lord exits from the Unparalleled Mirror!</i>

43
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:03,380
<i>Conquer the Six Realms!</i>

44
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,980
<i>I made a great mistake by believing Xuan Ye would keep his word to go into seclusion with me.</i>

45
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,620
<i>I was trapped in the illusion of the Unparalleled Mirror for months.</i>

46
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,360
<i>The war is in full swing now.</i>

47
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,360
<i>I will leave this baby to you.</i>

48
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,800
<i>Evil grows from affection.</i>

49
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,860
<i>I was supposed to repay it with my life.</i>

50
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,040
<i>However, I was pregnant.</i>

51
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,480
<i>The baby is innocent.</i>

52
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:06,080
<i>Please grant him a new identity and never let others know who his parents are.</i>

53
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
<i>I cast a spell on him.</i>

54
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,240
<i>As long as the Asura's mark doesn't show,</i>

55
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,440
<i>the Asura Clan won't discover his existence nor will they see his true countenance.</i>

56
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,680
<i>He's fully mastered both Universe Enchantment and Eternal Darkness.</i>

57
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,600
<i>Besides, with the Seven Star Deity Jade and Unparalleled Mirror, Xuan Ye's divine power is unrivaled.</i>

58
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,540
<i>Can you handle this alone?</i>

59
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,160
<i>No worries. I'm not who I used to be.</i>

60
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:52,380
<i>If I die, I'm counting on you to look after both Deity Clan and Divine Clan.</i>

61
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:57,820
<i>Remember. From today onwards, the prime abstinence of the Heavenly Rules is to be</i>

62
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,640
<i>the love abstinence of all gods and deities in Nine Heavens.</i>

63
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,120
<i>Whoever violates it will be sentenced to the punishment of love till they admit their fault.</i>

64
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,800
<i>Don't worry.</i>

65
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:13,780
<i>As for this baby and the Heavenly Rules, I'll protect and implement them for your sake.</i>

66
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,120
<i>I just created the Ranyue Move recently.</i>

67
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,580
<i>How are you able to resolve every move I launched?</i>

68
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,280
<i>It's like you've seen them before.</i>

69
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,240
<i>Xuan Ye, did you use Moment-Turning Gear on me?</i>

70
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:00,340
<i>Since you've guessed it right, I'm not going to conceal anymore.</i>

71
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,220
<i>Ran Qing.</i>

72
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:18,690
<i>If only one of us survives, the ending will always be the same.</i>

73
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,320
<i>Stop being stubborn.</i>

74
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,260
<i>Give in to me.</i>

75
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,560
<i>Come here.</i>

76
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:35,790
<i>You're even willing to turn back the time at the cost of your life in order to kill me every time.</i>

77
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,780
<i>I was trying to save you every time.</i>

78
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:44,040
<i>However, you always choose to sacrifice yourself for the world.</i>

79
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:51,220
<i>This time, I'll trap you in the Unparalleled Mirror and never let you die in front of me.</i>

80
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,360
<i>I'm Primordial Lord.</i>

81
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,020
<i>My mission is to protect all beings in the world.</i>

82
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:01,440
<i>No matter how hard you try to halt me, you can't change the ending.</i>

83
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,100
<i>Xuan Ye. You said you love me.</i>

84
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,220
<i>But why can't you give up on your ambition?</i>

85
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,360
<i>Quit saying all this!</i>

86
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:18,800
<i>Every time I turned back the time, I was forced to admit to my karma.</i>

87
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,360
<i>You refuse to let go of your mission, and I won't let go of my ambition.</i>

88
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,720
<i>Ran Qing. As long as you say yes...</i>

89
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,200
<i>we can share the world together.</i>

90
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,420
<i>If you give in to me just once, the ending can be rewritten.</i>

91
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,120
<i>Everything in the world can indeed be changed, but not the will of someone.</i>

92
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,900
<i>Both of us value the world more than our affection.</i>

93
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,260
<i>Admit it, Xuan Ye.</i>

94
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,360
<i>We're born to be enemies, and we never compromise till we die!</i>

95
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,040
<i>Ran Qing.</i>

96
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,700
<i>Again, I lost.</i>

97
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,380
<i>However, it's fine.</i>

98
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,680
<i>I can take you back to the beginning even at the cost of my life.</i>

99
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,940
<i>There will be one chance to trick you,</i>

100
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,420
<i>then I can spend my whole life with you, and we'll rule the world together.</i>

101
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,180
<i>You've become stronger.</i>

102
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,720
<i>How come you can resist Eternal Darkness?</i>

103
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,400
<i>Because...</i>

104
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,420
<i>I carried the lineage of the Asura Clan.</i>

105
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,220
<i>Ying Yuan.</i>

106
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,720
<i>Remember this name.</i>

107
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,540
<i>This is the name of your son.</i>

108
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:51,880
<i>Ran Qing, why are you still so stubborn?</i>

109
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:38,180
After your mother died,

110
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:43,460
I cast a spell on Soul Ripping Sword to prevent him from revealing your parents' identity.

111
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,560
Then I sealed it in the Land Under the Horizon.

112
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,220
Let bygones be bygones. Don't dwell on the past.

113
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:55,640
Unexpectedly, those words have come true and became their karma in the end.

114
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,820
It's the karma for Xuan Ye only.

115
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:03,480
He's the only one who refused to admit his mistakes.

116
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:08,700
I didn't expect the heavenly rule forbidding deities from falling in love was actually set by my mother.

117
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,140
Your Supreme Majesty has been guiding me...

118
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,940
to abide by this rule strictly.

119
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,900
Thank you for telling me how I was born.

120
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,300
I will protect the Three Realms...

121
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,520
that my mother once protected.

122
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,060
I'll bring you back to life and debunk the conspiracy of Huan Qin.

123
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,080
No, you can't.

124
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:35,440
Huan Qin couldn't destroy my body because I've left a wisp of my primordial spirit inside you.

125
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,040
Therefore, Huan Qin can't really take away my life.

126
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,880
And he could only pretend to be me by using Puppet Spell.

127
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,780
Ying Yuan.

128
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:46,960
You inherited the Asura's blood from Xuan Ye.

129
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,580
If you fail to control yourself, the consequence will be devastating.

130
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,100
Only my primordial spirit can oppress it.

131
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,900
What Huan Qin has achieved today does not depend on him alone.

132
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,820
Don't ignore the power behind him.

133
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:06,580
The one who can restore peace to the Three Realms is none other than you.

134
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,106
Ying Yuan. I'm not afraid of death.

135
00:16:10,106 --> 00:16:14,440
However, the War of Genesis was like hell on the world, which can never occur again.

136
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,080
How could I place my life above yours, Your Supreme Majesty?

137
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,260
As long as Emperor Ying Yuan is alive, the Three Realms won't collapse.

138
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:27,120
Ying Yuan, don't forget your mother's last will.

139
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:33,560
For the sake of me and your mother, protect everyone in the Three Realms.

140
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,820
I will remember this.

141
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,180
To Ying Yuan, His Supreme Majesty is like his father.

142
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:10,660
Now, he has learned that his dearest kin was murdered by his long-time friend.

143
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,020
He must be heartbroken.

144
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:20,120
Even the Greater God or Emperor... cannot escape from the caprice of fate.

145
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,770
Who are you?

146
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,700
I'm Ling Jiang, the Senior Priest of the Asura Clan.

147
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,720
Greetings, Young Lord.

148
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,640
Please pardon my late arrival.

149
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,160
I was deceived by Huan Qin for years about your true identity, Young Lord.

150
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,160
That hateful Huan Qin is a member of the Asura Clan.

151
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,620
Yet he plotted to frame the son of His Majesty.

152
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,960
What?

153
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,600
Huan Qin belongs to the Asura Clan?

154
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,260
However, I read that those of Asura Clan only have a spiritual pill but no divine root.

155
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,340
How did Huan Qin manage to obtain divine power and ascend to divinity?

156
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,420
Before the War of Genesis, we had known each other for hundreds of years.

157
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,400
I'd never found anything suspicious about him.

158
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,500
To His Majesty, Huan Qin was his most successful and...

159
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,900
most secretive pawn.

160
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,060
<i>Greetings, Your Majesty.</i>

161
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:41,480
<i>In order to plant the divine root in you, your spiritual pill must be crushed</i>

162
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:47,060
<i>and your blood drained off to be replaced with the blood of the God Clan.</i>

163
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:53,040
<i>You'll die if the process fails.</i>

164
00:18:53,040 --> 00:19:00,080
<i>Even if you manage to cultivate your divine spirit, you'll still be useless.</i>

165
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,700
<i>I request to go to Nine Heavens because I'm ready to risk my life at any time.</i>

166
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,520
<i>For the plan of our clan, I'm willing to sacrifice my life.</i>

167
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,340
<i>Very good.</i>

168
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,220
I didn't expect Huan Qin to have such strong forbearance.

169
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,540
No wonder he could lie low in the Heavenly Realms for ten thousand years.

170
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:05,380
We've worked together side by side for years, and he never betrayed me.

171
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:12,140
I can't believe he was able to deceive all of us.

172
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:23,540
So after the Asura King perished, you've been governing the Asura Clan?

173
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,000
Yes.

174
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,580
Back then, our clan was defeated. But I was reluctant to accept the failure.

175
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:35,180
After calming all the members of the clan down, I went to see Huan Qin, hoping to restore our clan.

176
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:38,420
At that time, Huan Qin hadn't been promoted to Star Deity.

177
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,420
He kept rejecting my offer, claiming that he wasn't competent enough.

178
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:46,920
He then imprisoned me at a place and said he needs some time to consider my offer.

179
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,540
After a few days, he returned with the Refined Steel.

180
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,380
He said this object had helped him make up his mind.

181
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,600
"Refined Steel"?

182
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,500
It turns out he was brooding over that.

183
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,780
<i>The swamp of Luye penetrates your armor and devours your bone.</i>

184
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:22,920
<i>Huan Qin, regardless of your regal aura, we, the Asura Clan are still the winner.</i>

185
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,480
<i>I'll bring you back.</i>

186
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:45,060
<i>After you fainted, Ying Yuan risked himself and went to the Blood Hole Altar</i>

187
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:48,660
<i>of the Asura Clan to retrieve their treasure, Bone-Growth Stone.</i>

188
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:52,400
<i>This Bone-Growth Stone uses massive cultivation to heal one's body and limbs.</i>

189
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,620
<i>What a shame.</i>

190
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:57,000
<i>Due to my incompetency, I can't be of help.</i>

191
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,260
<i>It was Ying Yuan who used almost half of his cultivation base to mend your hand.</i>

192
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,460
<i>Ying Yuan. Thank you.</i>

193
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,460
<i>I thought I would be disabled for the rest of my life.</i>

194
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,700
<i>We've been fighting alongside each other for years, and you're my only friend.</i>

195
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,560
<i>Apart from that, you broke your hand while fighting the enemy.</i>

196
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,940
<i>Even if weren't friends, I'd still help you.</i>

197
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,720
<i>Anyhow, your broken limb may gain you some merits.</i>

198
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:27,280
<i>So far in our war with the Asura Clan, you're the first one to slay the elder of the Asura Clan.</i>

199
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,500
<i>It's said that His Supreme Majesty is going to grant the title of the fourth emperor.</i>

200
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,920
<i>And he'll take the four emperors to bring down the capital of Asura for the final battle.</i>

201
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,091
<i>I bet you'll be given this title.</i>

202
00:22:37,091 --> 00:22:39,700
<i>Your name will go down in history.</i>

203
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,380
<i>Huan Qin, please accept the edict.</i>

204
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,220
<i>By the mandate of heaven, this decree is announced to the masses that Huan Qin, the immortal lord</i>

205
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,420
<i>who has led the heavenly army for thousands of years and possesses invincible courage,</i>

206
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,300
<i>has made a significant achievement in the war.</i>

207
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,060
<i>I'm beaming hearing this news, and so do the Six Realms.</i>

208
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:07,800
<i>From today onwards, you'll ascend as Star Deity Ji Du</i>

209
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,340
<i>and govern Star Setter Pavilion and all cosmic stars.</i>

210
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,580
<i>Thank you, Your Supreme Majesty.</i>

211
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:31,400
<i>I'll devote myself to my duty and never fail your expectation.</i>

212
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,720
<i>His Supreme Majesty is concerned about you and specially granted you a treasure.</i>

213
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,640
<i>Refined Steel. It can change from being very hard to very soft.</i>

214
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,120
<i>It can be smelted into divine tools that can change form.</i>

215
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,520
<i>His Supreme Majesty offered it to you because he cherishes you so much.</i>

216
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:03,240
<i>I'm delighted to be favored by His Supreme Majesty.</i>

217
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,100
<i>Why are you drinking alone?</i>

218
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,740
<i>You've wasted your divine power to fix my hand.</i>

219
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:32,680
<i>I reckon His Supreme Majesty won't assign me to lead the army in the future.</i>

220
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,720
<i>I heard that you were crowned as Emperor. Congratulations.</i>

221
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:46,220
<i>Your Majesty, may I have the pleasure to drink with you?</i>

222
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,460
<i>How come your body possesses the aura of the Asura?</i>

223
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:03,200
<i>Were you bitten by Asura Ghost-Faced Spider while in Blood Hole Altar?</i>

224
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,380
<i>It's impossible.</i>

225
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,680
<i>It's impossible.</i>

226
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,020
<i>If it were ordinary people, they would've died.</i>

227
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:21,020
<i>How come your blood can suppress the poison?</i>

228
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,300
<i>Are you a descendant of the Asura Clan?</i>

229
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,900
<i>Huan Qin.</i>

230
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,260
<i>Honestly, my mother...</i>

231
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,460
<i>was an innocent fairy who was bewitched by the Asura Clan.</i>

232
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:46,460
<i>You exposed your identity in order to save my life.</i>

233
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,700
<i>No worries. I won't tell anybody else about this.</i>

234
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,960
<i>However, during your inauguration ceremony,</i>

235
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,440
<i>you'll have to take an oath in front of everybody's eyes,</i>

236
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,700
<i>and your bloodline will be exposed then.</i>

237
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,900
<i>His Supreme Majesty is stern, so he'll definitely kill you.</i>

238
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,500
<i>Ying Yuan. You better leave now.</i>

239
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,980
<i>I'll escort you to leave the Heavenly Realm.</i>

240
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,500
<i>Huan Qin.</i>

241
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,500
<i>His Supreme Majesty is aware of my identity.</i>

242
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,780
<i>He already knows you belong to the Asura Clan?</i>

243
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:30,620
<i>But how could he tolerate your existence and crown you as Emperor?</i>

244
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,100
<i>His Supreme Majesty said...</i>

245
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,140
<i>since I possess this blood lineage,</i>

246
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,400
<i>I should devote myself...</i>

247
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,440
<i>to the Heaven Realm.</i>

248
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,900
After Xuan Ye died, he cut off connection with the Asura Clan.

249
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,300
Huan Qin had lost his master, and he became a useless pawn.

250
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:09,260
Perhaps he had thought about turning into a deity, and went on war expeditions for the Heaven Realm.

251
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,840
However, he was not His Supreme Majesty's favorite.

252
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,740
He had the ambition to be Emperor.

253
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,940
How could he endure the trivial duty of governing the stars?

254
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:21,000
Back then, he still treated me kindly even though he learned about my background.

255
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,780
I was indebted to him and regarded him as my confidant.

256
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:28,740
Looking back, he was born into the Asura Clan as well.

257
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,520
Perhaps he had complex feelings by then.

258
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,340
And all the feelings...

259
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,400
turned into hatred.

260
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,840
Young Lord. Huan Qin is nothing to be afraid of.

261
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,600
Since I've found you, it means

262
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:47,300
the Asura Clan that has been sleeping for ten thousand years will awake anytime now.

263
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,120
What's your plan?

264
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,340
As long as you neutralize Heavenly Emperor's primordial spirit that has been suppressing your blood

265
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,560
and release the Asura divine power inside you,

266
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:59,980
those who died in the War of Genesis will be resurrected.

267
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,220
You know of everything?

268
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:08,240
Yes. In the Divine-Devil War, Huan Qin crushed the divine power of the Heavenly Emperor,

269
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,000
but he still failed to kill him.

270
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,900
When I learned that you're the son of His Majesty,

271
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:18,040
I finally realized that you've done nothing all these years

272
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,220
because you were suppressed by the Heavenly Emperor.

273
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,520
I've been waiting for this moment for a long time.

274
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,140
Unexpectedly, His Majesty has left his lineage in this world.

275
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,700
Everything is destined.

276
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,720
Young Lord. Don't worry.

277
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,280
The entire Asura Clan will offer ourselves to you like we offered ourselves to His Majesty.

278
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:43,420
Very soon, your cultivation will improve by leaps and bounds, and you can restore honor to the Asura Clan.

279
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:49,260
Young Lord. What are you doing?

280
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:54,220
Listen up. I'll never be your Young Lord.

281
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:57,300
I'm Emperor Qingli, Ying Yuan.

282
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,360
The Puppet Spell is the secret skill of Devil Clan.

283
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,760
And it's rarely known to outsiders.

284
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:33,800
If we're going to uncover the fake Heavenly Emperor, we must find Liu Weiyang first.

285
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:38,100
Tao Ziqi said they were incarcerated in different places.

286
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,760
However, we have no clues at all.

287
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,500
She's willing to give up on her deity status to be with the Devil King.

288
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:51,140
However, she cherishes Purple Anser Hairpin given by the Heavenly Court, and she gazes at it every day.

289
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,920
You can see the obsession in her eyes.

290
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:57,260
However, I find something weird about her.

291
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:01,453
It's time to reveal her true identity.

292
00:30:01,453 --> 00:30:03,400
I have an idea.

293
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,660
Your Majesty.

294
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,040
What has happened? I heard that Brother Yu Mo and the rest are back.

295
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,480
Did something happen to them?

296
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,380
Your Majesty, you can't simply protect Yu Mo and neglect your people in South Sea.

297
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:26,340
You've used the barrier to shut all the passages, and we can't communicate with the outside world.

298
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,280
However, the kins of the Aquatic Clan are serving at the Heavenly Court.

299
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,140
If they don't receive letters from their family,

300
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,240
the Heavenly Court will discover that something has happened to the South Sea.

301
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,520
You're right.

302
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,520
But Yu Mo has no way out now.

303
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,800
I can't send them away.

304
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,780
How about this? Discreetly inform the Aquatic Clan who have kin

305
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:55,580
in the Heavenly Court to put their family letters on the Heavenly River at seven in the morning every day.

306
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,580
By then, I'll open up the barrier at the Heavenly River

307
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:02,200
and have the letters drift towards the Heavenly Court.

308
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,020
It'll cease the suspicion from the Heavenly Court.

309
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,540
Remember. You must do it in secret.

310
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,580
Find someone you really trust.

311
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,600
Understood.

312
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,060
Off you go.

313
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,400
Brother Yu Mo asked me to test you.

314
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,100
I didn't expect you to be this impatient.

315
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,280
You're indeed colluding with the Heavenly Emperor.

316
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,440
What are you up to?

317
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:57,020
Your letter can never arrive.

318
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,420
I'm anxious because I want to save Xuan Xiang.

319
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,580
So I sent a message to my sisters in the Heavenly Court asking for help.

320
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,960
Do you think we'll believe your words?

321
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,920
I don't care if you have excuses or reasons, or if you remain silent due to someone's threat.

322
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,880
If you really love Liu Weiyang and are worried about whether he's alive or dead,

323
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:19,020
why do you push us to the corner when we're the only ones who can rescue him?

324
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,920
I didn't mean to harm you.

325
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,080
Ever since we entered the South Sea, you've been casting me out in every discussion.

326
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,680
I understand, and I'm in no position to make requests.

327
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,440
However, my worries about Xuan Xiang are no less than yours.

328
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,340
No matter how you try to explain yourself, I won't believe you again.

329
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,880
I'm sorry, Sister Tao.

330
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,560
Now, we must lock you up.

331
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,300
Dragon Queen Zhao Lan.

332
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,600
We, the heavenly army, have surrounded the entire South Sea.

333
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:00,080
To avoid all Aquatic Clan in Four Seas being killed, surrender the traitors of the Heavenly Court!

334
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,320
Your Majesty. The heavenly army is here.

335
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,280
They sieged the entire Dragon Palace claiming to search for the traitors of the Heavenly Court.

336
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:16,040
How impressive. How did you manage this even though the letter was destroyed?

337
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,340
It wasn't me.

338
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,820
Stop pretending.

339
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:22,700
That letter isn't how you communicate with the outside world, right?

340
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,380
Our negligence gave you the opportunity to act.

341
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,680
It's not because we're deceived by your perfect disguise.

342
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:31,760
It's because you're not afraid of us suspecting you. You know we'll never harm you since we were once friends.

343
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,940
She won't admit her act easily.

344
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,960
We must leave here immediately.

345
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,840
I guess the heavenly army suddenly surrounded this place because they received news of our whereabouts.

346
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,440
They won't give up until they find us.

347
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,820
We must not drag the South Sea into trouble.

348
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,580
Zhao Lan. You're the Dragon Queen.

349
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,160
If they found us here, the Four Seas must be your priority of concern.

350
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,820
Got it?

351
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,300
Yes.

352
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:59,040
Brother Yu Mo. In the South Sea, there's a secret passage that connects to the outside world.

353
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,920
However...

354
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,880
Take her along.

355
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:09,400
Whether she works for the fake Heavenly Emperor or not, we'll lose our only clue if we leave her here.

356
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,660
You leave first!

357
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,730
Let's go.

358
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,340
Hold on.

359
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,400
What's wrong?

360
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,580
This path twists and turns.

361
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:06,600
Tao Ziqi. Tell me why the army can trace us.

362
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,340
If it weren't for Zhao Lan, who told us the right path, we'd be lost.

363
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,040
This doesn't make any sense.

364
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,180
Sister Tao. Why did you take the arrow for me?

365
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,920
My instinctive response.

366
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,580
Thank you.

367
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,160
But there is something suspicious about your injury.

368
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:51,760
I see. The arrow contains Tracking Incense that exposes our location.

369
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,320
Tao Ziqi. You've been in the Divine-Devil War.

370
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,640
You should know this, right?

371
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:06,520
Are you suspecting that I brought the army here?

372
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:11,900
If Yan Dan was shot with the arrow, she would be infected by the poison instead.

373
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,280
Why did I have to save her?

374
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,960
If you don't trust me, you can surrender me to the heavenly army.

375
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,500
I'd rather prove my innocence with my death.

376
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,420
You wish!

377
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:29,540
We won't grant your wish by letting you go.

378
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,580
You're the thread manipulated by the heavenly army.

379
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:36,840
Only if we kill you and cut the thread can we leave this place.

380
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,240
Stop.

381
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,220
She's the thread that connects to Liu Weiyang as well.

382
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,960
If we kill her, we can't explain to Liu Weiyang.

383
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,620
Besides, there are many mysteries left in the Divine-Devil War which need to be investigated.

384
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:50,200
She has experienced the war. She can't die.

385
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,460
As for now, we must find our way out as soon as possible.

386
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,740
It's Qingyi Cauldron!

387
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:52,000
It has been refining pills for ten thousand years, and it's immune to fire and water

388
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,460
and defends attacks from the deities.

389
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,060
It's not easy to deal with!

390
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,440
This fake Heavenly Emperor thinks highly of us.

391
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,160
He even created a divine tool to deal with us.

392
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:14,260
<i>If this continues, the boat will be damaged and torn to pieces.</i>

393
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,400
<i>Yan Dan!</i>

394
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:25,360
It's my turn to protect you this time. Go!

395
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,780
Come back! Yan Dan!

396
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,860
We must go back!

397
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,160
We have no time now.

398
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,160
After capturing Yan Dan, they'll report it right away.

399
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,080
I knew something was wrong with you.

400
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,720
I should've killed you.

401
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:00,780
If it weren't for you attracting the army, Yan Dan wouldn't have been captured.

402
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,780
If I could replace her with my life,

403
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,200
I'd jump off the boat without hesitation.

404
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:21,500
Yu Mo! It's useless even if you kill her.

405
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,640
You must calm down at this critical moment.

406
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,680
If you act rashly...

407
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,940
Yan Dan's safety will be compromised.

408
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,820
You're awake.

409
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:52,520
I hear that you outsmart the Three Realms with your GO skill, Miss Yan Dan.

410
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,280
Finally, I have a chance to compete with you today.

411
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,380
This is the last game in Ying Yuan's book of war.

412
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:08,420
You're using me as a pawn to break this game against Ying Yuan's strategy, right?

413
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:13,980
Judging by that tone, it seems you've taken me as your enemy.

414
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,220
People with different political dispositions become enemies.

415
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,800
You betrayed your master for your interest twice.

416
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,220
Plus, you slaughtered innocent beings.

417
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:28,000
You're the traitor to the Three Realms, Huan Qin of the Asura Clan.

418
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,720
True.

419
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,760
I, Huan Qin, am the traitor to the Three Realms.

420
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,600
What about Ying Yuan?

421
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,180
He's the hero of the Three Realms.

422
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,560
However, he turned his back on you twice.

423
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,400
He abandoned you when you were at the brink of death.

424
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,100
Who's better amongst us, the traitor or the hero?

425
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,120
I'm clear about what has happened between us.

426
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,020
He has never abandoned me.

427
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:58,940
I came here today by my own choice.

428
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,960
But look at you.

429
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,100
Who else did you benefit from besides yourself?

430
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,880
What methods did you use to threaten Tao Ziqiinto

431
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,460
into sacrificing her life to help you?

432
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,720
I've never threatened Tao Ziqi.

433
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,920
Enough.

434
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,560
Quit arguing.

435
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,780
Take a guess.

436
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:29,740
Who's the winner in this game?

437
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,360
How about this?

438
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,580
I'll have the Three Realms as the GO board, and your life as the pawn.

439
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:39,820
Ying Yuan will probably admit defeat willingly this time.

440
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,640
Interesting.

441
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,760
You want me to help you...

442
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,240
In your dreams!

443
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,500
How dare you frail lotus demon try to kill me?

444
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,400
You're asking for your death.

445
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,720
Although I'm an insignificant lotus demon, I still look down on you!

446
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,820
You killed my kin.

447
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,340
I'll never let you off the hook easily!

448
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:04,180
Were your kin killed by me?

449
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:08,520
The elimination of the Nine Fins Clan was conducted under the edict of the Heavenly Emperor.

450
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:12,980
Immortal Lord Bei Ming was sent to the battlefield by him as well.

451
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:18,860
As for Zhi Xi, if she hadn't helped Ying Yuan, why would I kill her?

452
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,660
You're just quibbling for your own benefit.

453
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:25,740
My benefit is to create well-being for the Three Realms.

454
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,580
See, you've admitted it.

455
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:44,620
Everything you did isn't for the sake of the Asura Clan nor the benevolence to the world.

456
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:48,080
Instead, it's merely for your ambition and status.

457
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,820
How about the benevolence Ying Yuan used to mention?

458
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:53,380
Isn't it also for his benefit?

459
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:56,320
True. I'm from the Asura Clan.

460
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:01,620
But don't forget that Ying Yuan is the Young Lord of the Asura Clan.

461
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,780
He's not like you!

462
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:08,200
Although he possesses the blood of Xuan Ye, he has never done anything evil.

463
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,000
How naïve of you.

464
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,300
Yan Dan. You're merely a lotus demon.

465
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,540
Why are you concerned about the well-being of the world?

466
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:20,760
Now, I determine how the world should run.

467
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:25,520
The benevolence of the world you said is merely nonsense.

468
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,880
Come on.

469
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,160
If you refuse to play or you deliberately play it wrongly, the thunder will strike you.

470
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,860
With three consecutive wrong moves, the GO board will be reset.

471
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:47,020
If the game remains unresolved, the thunder strikes won't stop.

472
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:51,840
Considering your cultivation, you can't take many strikes.

473
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,760
Listen, Huan Qin.

474
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:59,950
Every evil you've done so far will repay you handsomely sooner or later.

475
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,200
I'm afraid I'll let you down.

476
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,580
Now, I've prepared some tea in my palace,

477
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:13,500
waiting for Ying Yuan to watch how his lover is being tortured.

478
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:18,160
Back then, because of Ran Qing, his father caused the entire Asura Clan to perish.

479
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,560
Today, I'll use your life to end his future.

480
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,940
How satisfying.

481
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,940
How satisfying!

482
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:14,650
