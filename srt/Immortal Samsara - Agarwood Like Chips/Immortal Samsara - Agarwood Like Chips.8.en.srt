What are you doing?

16
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,399
- This is...
- The Heavenly Infirmary denied us a visit.

17
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,170
The immortal attendants of the palace are worried.

18
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,039
All we can do is hang the immortal bell as a blessing.

19
00:01:55,039 --> 00:02:00,139
If His Majesty hears the bell ringing from Yanxu Heavenly Palace, he'll know we sent him regard.

20
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:02,940
Yan Dan, why don't you hang one too?

21
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,219
What kind of injury does His Majesty sustain? When will he be back?

22
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:09,199
The heavenly physician said His Majesty's injury is related to the peace of the Three Realms.

23
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,939
- Except for His Supreme Majesty, no one has the right to know.
- But we're not outsiders.

24
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:17,100
We're under his care and share his joy and sorrow every day.

25
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:22,650
Now that His Majesty is at the Heavenly Infirmary, don't we have the right to dress his wound and serve him some tea?

I'll throw tiles with you.

You promised me you would come back and watch it.

I'm Yan Dan, an immortal attendant of Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

60
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,819
I know His Supreme Majesty has ordered the heavenly physician not to say a word of Emperor Ying Yuan's injury.

61
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:10,179
But I'm willing to stay in the Heavenly Infirmary and serve by His Majesty's side.

62
00:06:10,179 --> 00:06:13,759
Can you relay my message? His Majesty will surely agree if he knows about it.

63
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,299
Attending to the wounded is the responsibility of the Heavenly Infirmary.

64
00:06:17,299 --> 00:06:20,319
We don't need your help. Just leave.

65
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,799
If there's any update, His Supreme Majesty will send someone to inform you.

66
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:28,839
After His Majesty returned to the Heavenly Realm, we have yet to see him and we don't know how injured he is.

67
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:31,599
All the immortal attendants of Yanxu Heavenly Palace are worried.

68
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,560
Even if I have to disobey the order today, I must see him.

69
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,866
You came at the wrong time.

70
00:06:36,867 --> 00:06:40,747
Emperor Ying Yuan has just bid His Supreme Majesty farewell and descended to the Mortal Realm to recuperate.

71
00:06:40,747 --> 00:06:43,451
Now, the various deities are returning to their palaces.

72
00:06:43,452 --> 00:06:44,736
No one has the time for you.

73
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:48,479
What do you mean? Please make yourself clear.

74
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,400
<i>The deities? Immortal Lord Bei Ming has returned too?</i>

75
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,119
<i>He was also on the battlefield. He must know about Emperor Ying Yuan's injury.</i>

76
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,260
Yan Dan, what are you doing there?

77
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,500
Get the heavenly physician now.

78
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,119
Okay.

79
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,340
There's no need.

80
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,160
The heavenly physician with the military has concluded

81
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:33,860
that prescribing medicines will only prolong his pain.

82
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:40,640
Didn't Immortal Lord ride the immortal beast and command from the rear?

83
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,580
How did he... How did he sustain such a serious injury?

84
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,239
They were ambushed by the Devil Army.

85
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,400
When I reached there, he had already lost his immortality.

86
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,570
He was stabbed by the Devils' Soul Dissipating Sword.

87
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:58,900
It penetrated his bone, causing him to lose his soul.

88
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:04,019
The pain is akin to having countless poisonous insects moving throughout his body.

89
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,140
He will not survive.

90
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,960
Immortal Lord, do you have any final wishes?

91
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,499
Do tell us.

92
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:19,500
Put me...

93
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,540
Put me out of my misery.

94
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,100
Please kill me!

95
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,200
There must be a way.

96
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,999
You won't die just like this.

97
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,469
Yes. You won't die like this.

98
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:45,749
There must be a way. There must be a way.

99
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,340
The soul-returning pill.

100
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,339
The soul-returning pill! The soul-returning pill!

101
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,600
Master.

102
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,039
Immortal Lord! You will be okay after eating this.

103
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,140
Come on.

104
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,600
Kill me!

105
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,320
Kill me now!

106
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,640

109
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,019

110
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:19,800
- Kill me now!
- Master!

111
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,840
Master!

112
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,199
Kill me!

113
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,159
Kill me!

114
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:30,019
<i>Within my lifetime, I'd like to see Little Black Fish transform into human form and call me "master".</i>

115
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:34,999
<i>It's not worth the wish. Obviously, it can be realized anytime.</i>

116
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,299
Have you gone mad, Yu Mo? What are you doing?

117
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:53,000
Yan Dan, since there is no other way to change the result, I can't bear to let Master suffer such misery!

118
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,939
But if Immortal Lord Bei Ming dies with regret, you'll be in pain your whole life!

119
00:09:56,939 --> 00:09:59,640
I've cultivated into human form not long ago.

120
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,540
Given my spiritual power, I can't save him.

121
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:08,740
I have an idea. Even if it's only for a moment, I can make you two see each other!

122
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,380
Yan Dan.

123
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,799
Yes, it's me. I'm Yan Dan, Immortal Lord.

124
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,610
It's me.

125
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:50,320
Yu Mo, hurry up! Hurry up!

126
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,460
You are...

127
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,540
Master.

128
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,940
Master, I've cultivated into a human form.

129
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:11,820
But I'm still late. I have a name now.

130

My name is Yu Mo.

131

00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,620
You are...

133
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,060
from the Nine Fins Clan.

134
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,580
You're not late.

135
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,900
You're not late at all.

136
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,300
I can now die

137
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:54,960
without regret.

138
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,740
Immortal Lord!

Master.

140
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,480

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,940

I'll do as you wish and live well.

146

Let my dragon scale stay with you forever.

Immortal Lord Bei Ming.

148

Immortal Lord!

149
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:54,660
They succeeded the throne in ancient times.

150

I am very heartbroken. I can't stop shedding tears.

156
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:20,219
After being bestowed as Star Deity Ji Du and Immortal Lord Bei Ming, they will enjoy the glory of the Greater Gods.

157
00:14:20,219 --> 00:14:23,819
They will be buried in the Divine Cemetery Forest, living with the holy spirits of the martyrs.

158
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:26,559
Their loyalties will be passed down eternally.

159
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,980
And we will not forget that they are heroic spirits and will receive respect from every realm.

160
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,820
I came to the Divine Realm in my childhood.

161
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:56,720
Due to the distress in adapting to an environment that was a world apart from my homeland,

162
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,240
I suffered from many strange illnesses.

163
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,400
The dragon scales all over my body fell off.

164
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:08,080
When my life was hanging by a thread, it was Master who smashed his divine tool, Jade Bone Pestle,

165
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:16,080
into pieces to restore my dragon scales and preserve my true form.

166
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:24,560
After losing his divine tool, some Greater Gods continuously mocked him secretly.

167
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,360
They laughed at his incompetence.

168
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,280
Now I know what happened.

169
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,220
He hoped that I could live well.

170
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,860
I once read the script of a play from the Mortal Realm.

171
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:45,100
If a good man dies unjustly,

172
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:50,980
heavy rain will hit the Mortal Realm to wash away the grievances of the world.

173
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:57,580
The bereaved will gain some relief from the pain.

174
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:04,060
But in the Heavenly Realm,

175
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:09,520
there are heavenly palaces, divine tools, elixirs, and thousands of beautiful sceneries.

176
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,620
Yet, it has never rained once.

177
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,740
In the Heavenly Realm, there is no rain, snow, or thunder.

178
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,290
Neither do joy nor sorrow exist here.

179
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,720
This place may look holy and solemn.

180
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,000
In truth, it is very dull and indifferent.

181
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:37,900
My master was only bestowed with a false title "Greater God" and a coffin.

182
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:48,580
In the days to come, Xuanxin Cliff will surely change hands.

183
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:53,600
And the world will forget about him, just as they did to the Nine Fins Clan.

184
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,100
They'll forget about my master.

185
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:02,840
He made all these sacrifices, but to no avail.

186
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,800
It won't be.

187
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,100
As long as we're alive, we won't forget him.

188
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,800
The west wind blows softly. The sound of music stopped.

189
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,906
The flowing clouds don't know the weariness of the setting sun.

190
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,610
The tall buildings don't know the worries of the running water.

191
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:35,339
Birth and death. Good times have gone. When can one rest?

192
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:42,040
The setting sun illuminates the world only because the world is his beloved.

193
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,820
Even if no one understands him, he has no regrets.

194
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,940
Yu Mo,

195
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:56,660
today, let Xuanxin Cliff rain for Immortal Lord.

196
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,000
<i>[Wenshui Pavilion]</i>

197
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:19,220
Immortal Lord! Don't worry! I'll take good care of Yu Mo for you!

198
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,340
Master!

199
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,300
I know you can hear me!

200
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:36,140
<i>Master, I've grown up. I'll make myself stronger.</i>

201
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,920
<i>I'll never let my loved ones leave me again.</i>

202
00:18:42,314 --> 00:18:46,554
Come on. I'll lend you my shoulder.

203
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:15,320
<i>When I was born, I heard that the Four-Leaf Lotus brings auspiciousness.</i>

204
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,960
<i>But I lived a simple life.</i>

205
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,199
<i>I was often ridiculed. I've been an embarrassment to the Four-Leaf Lotus Clan.</i>

206
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,840
<i>Only after I met you,</i>
<i>[The Tale of The Genesis Hero]</i>

207
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,520
<i>I realized everything could be so different.</i>

208
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,840
<i>If what was said about auspiciousness is true,</i>

209
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,560
<i>I'm willing to give all my auspiciousness to you,</i>

210
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,200
<i>as long as you can return safely.</i>

211
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,720
<i>Please don't end up like Immortal Lord Bei Ming.</i>

212
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,279
This is my title token.

213
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,579
All right. This is mine.

214
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,579
What are you doing? Immortal Lord Bei Ming has just been buried.

215
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,659
And Emperor Ying Yuan is still missing. I have many things to attend to.

216
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:10,540
Why did you bring me here?

217
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:15,059
You look dispirited these few days. If you don't take a stroll, you'll turn mad soon.

218
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:20,520
I did this for your sake. It's better to step out and watch the fun than to stay in your room.

219
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:22,420
So many have come.

220
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,390
Yes. It hasn't been so lively for a long time.

221
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:30,639
So many immortals and fairies have dressed up. Is there a grand occasion today?

222
00:20:30,639 --> 00:20:35,599
To celebrate the war victory, His Supreme Majesty holds a grand Jade Pool Festivity.

223
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:37,450
He invited the immortals from the Three Realms

224
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:40,290
and many of the immortal clans that cultivate in the Mortal Realm to attend the festivity.

225
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:43,119
Didn't you always feel it's boring in the Heavenly Realm?

226
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,279
Maybe you'll catch love at first sight and forget your sorrow.

227
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:49,750
With my law of enchantment and your little pretty face, you can easily...

228
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,299
Can easily cost me my life.

229
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:55,540
The first abstinence in the Heavenly Rules is love abstinence.

230
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,310
Those who are forbidden to fall in love and get married

231
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,199
are the Heavenly Immortals and the Greater Gods in the Nine Heavens.

232
00:21:00,199 --> 00:21:03,459
These immortal clans are Earthly Immortals. They don't need to abide by the Heavenly Rules.

233
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:06,159
What do you think these immortals and fairies dressed up for?

234
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,270
All of them want to regain their freedom.

235
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:12,060
It's so lively today.

236
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,800
It'd be great if Emperor Ying Yuan were here too.

237
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,070
He promised he would watch my performance.

238
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,800
I wonder if he would show up on that day.

239
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,759
The Jade Pool Festivity is a heavenly occasion. Emperor Ying Yuan has never been absent.

240
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:28,339
By then, he'll definitely end his wandering and return to the Heavenly Realm.

241
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:32,920
Since His Majesty will be there to review it, you should pull yourself together and practice well.

242
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,260
Dragon King of the East Sea is here!

243
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,580
Your Majesty, you came from afar bearing exquisite gifts.

244
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,239
It shows that the Dragon Clan is prosperous and strong.

245
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,910
His Supreme Majesty has prepared a warm palace for you to rest.

246
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,690
Please follow me.

247
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,360
He brought so many exquisite gifts.

248
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,879
This kind of gift exchange is nothing.

249
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,559
I heard that all the guests of the festivity have brought along exquisite gifts for His Supreme Majesty.

250
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,839
The Treasure Pavilion must be full of treasures then.

251
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,519
After the festivity is over, the treasures will be transported down through the Heavenly River

252
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:13,760
to the mansions of the various Earthly Immortals.

253
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,880
The Treasure Pavilion?

254
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,820
It's a deserted place with slack security.

255
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,220
What are you planning to do?

256
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,899
You mean when His Supreme Majesty is bestowing the gifts after the festivity,

257
00:22:31,899 --> 00:22:35,260
we'll take the opportunity to sneak into the Treasure Pavilion,

258
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:40,439
hide the little divine tortoise in the East Sea Dragon King's gifts, and take it to the Mortal Realm?

259
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:44,860
That's right. Heaven is helping me.

260
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,360
I almost forgot.

261
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,459
This is your invitation letter. Remember to come and watch our performance.

262
00:22:52,459 --> 00:22:53,999
I've saved a good seat for you.

263
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,119
Before the show begins, you must come backstage to cheer us on.

264
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:59,899
Don't worry, Yan Dan. I'll definitely be there.

265
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,440
It's going to start at noon?

266
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,500
Yes. All festivities in the Heavenly Realm start at noon and end at sunset.

267
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,020
What's the matter? Don't tell me that you can't make it.

268
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,620
Well, actually...

269
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:17,819
To obtain this invitation letter, I've spent a lot of gold to create a fake identity, Black Fish Spirit, for you.

270
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:22,119
Don't worry. By then, it'll be a mess. No one will suspect your identity.

271
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:24,279
- Yes. Actually, I...
- What is it?

272
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:28,359
You're not from the Bat Clan. You're afraid of the light?

273
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,760
Anyway, if you don't show up, we won't perform.

274
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,380
I'll definitely be there.

275
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,820
There will be a surprise.

276
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,740
Are you saying the Snail Girl will be there too?

277
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:49,200
It would be great if he showed up.

278
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,600
But he has given me many inspirations.

279
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,200
I've made some changes to the ending.

280
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,200
Yan Dan, are we going to rehearse or not?

281
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,500
The show is in three days.

282
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,200
You're so talkative. Just save it for your thank you speech.

283
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm coming!

284
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,500
Remember, okay?

285
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,000
<i>My immortal power is unstable.</i>

286
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,400
<i>I lost substantial power when saving Yan Dan.</i>

287
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,800
<i>If I step up in my practice day and night, </i>

288
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,300
<i>I wonder if I could transform into the human form during the day for the festivity.</i>

289
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,400
<i>All I can do is give it a try.</i>

290
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,200
We've been practicing for three nights.

291
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,000
The show will begin in eight hours.

292
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,700
You'll only finish lighting the lanterns at dawn if you do it one by one.

293
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,200
What else can I do? If I don't start lighting them now, I won't be able to make it.

294
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,800
Yan Dan, you've learned many magical spells.

295
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,700
Can't you just light them up all in one go?

296
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,900
I'm not Emperor Ying Yuan.

297
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,600
I'm not that capable.

298
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,900
Besides, I'm a lotus. Water is my strength.

299
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,200
I don't know any fire spells.

300
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,000
Yan Dan, your cultivation base has improved substantially. Just give it a try.

301
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,300
All right then. I'll give it a try then.

302
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,400
Calm down.

303
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,600
I... I'll try again.

304
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,000
What's going on?

305
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
Impressive!

306
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,000
I lighted them up! Am I awesome?

307
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,600
You're awesome.

308
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,400
That was so close.

309
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,400
Thank you.

310
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,800
I saw everything.

311
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,800
You have amazing immortal power.

312
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,600
It's all right.

313
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,400
Let's carry on.

314
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,900
Yes.

315
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,100
The Asura Clan uses human bones as firewood and consumes immortals as food.

316
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,800
They slaughtered everything.

317
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:48,000
If we can only gain light and victory by letting the Asura Clan trample on our dignity and lives,

318
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,300
I'd rather extinguish it personally and fight to the end in this darkness.

319
00:27:55,300 --> 00:28:01,500
In the ancient year 1358, the world's remaining five Greater Gods and Star Deity Huan Qin

320
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,600
shot out the Myriad-Bone Light that symbolized the rule of the Asura Clan.

321
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,700
And the War of Genesis began.

322
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,400
The Dragon Clan, the Nine Fins Clan, the Blood Eagle Clan,

323
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:19,100
the Four-Leaf Lotus Clan, and hundreds of immortal clans responded to the call and joined the battle.

324
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:28,400
They sustained a long battle, endless sacrifices, and prolonged darkness

325
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:33,100
just to prove that dignity was more important than life.

326
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,200
Emperor Ying Yuan is still not back.

327
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,300
I guess he has forgotten about my performance.

328
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,500
Why isn't Yu Mo here either?

329
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,600
Why are you so late?

330
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,100
- Zhi Xia.
- Emperor Ying Yuan must be still recuperating in the Mortal Realm.

331
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,600
Yu Mo must have been caught up with something.

332
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,200
Don't worry so much.

333
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,600
We're into the second act now.

334
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,200
It's almost my turn to go on stage.

335
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,000
Get yourself ready.

336
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,500
All right.

337
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,670
<i>[The Tale of The Genesis Hero]</i>

338
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,700
Immortal Lord Bei Ming. Star Deity Ji Du.

339
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,700
The war is over.

340
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,500
How come I can't feel the joy that arises from the end of a battle?

341
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:51,300
134 immortal clans have been wiped out due to the war.

342
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,900
This is the 135th clan.

343
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,400
I can't believe that there is a survivor.

344
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,600
This is the Four-Leaf Lotus.

345
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,800
When the flowers bloom, auspiciousness emerges.

346
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,400
It's suitable to be grown in the Jade Pool.

347
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,500
Your sister is really something else.

348
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,600
I, Yan Dan, an immortal attendant, presented "The Tale of The Genesis Hero"

349
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,000
to thank all deities and immortals for your efforts in the War of Genesis.

350
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,300
I hope for peace in the Three Realms and we shall never forget the martyrs.

351
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,200
Joy is like training, and sorrow is like a halberd.

352
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,400
The sophisticated and the weak will fall.

353
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:08,000
Looks like the name Emperor Ying Yuan has given you suits you well.

354
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,600
Four-Leaf Lotus has a girl like you.

355
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,600
Looks like you can make your clan proud again.

356
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,800
I am a foolish girl.

357
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,900
I'm fortunate to receive help from Emperor Ying Yuan to make this play possible.

358
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,800
Hopefully, I lived up to Emperor Ying Yuan's painstaking effort.

359
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,000
May wars cease forever in the Three Realms.

360
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,600
May all heroes be remembered eternally.

361
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:31,500
Look, the immortals feel joyful because of your play.

362
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,800
It's all because of your ingenuity.

363
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,400
Looks like...

364
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,100
Joyful?

365
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:48,100
It seems that Your Supreme Majesty has failed to understand the play.

366
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,600
The War of Genesis was a tough battle.

367
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,200
This play may seem to be filled with hope.

368
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,800
But in truth, it's a lamentation and a show of sympathy towards the lives we lost during the war.

369
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:12,400
The recently deceased Immortal Lord Bei Ming's appearance at the end of the play

370
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:17,400
was intended to provoke a sense of mourning in everyone here.

371
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:23,600
I can't believe that everyone only showed laughter, but no tears.

372
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,200
More than a hundred ancient immortal clans were wiped out just like that.

373
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:33,700
How could you all feel joyful?

374
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,000
Huo De, you're drunk.

375
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,600
Today is the Jade Pool Festivity.

376
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,200
Please get back to your immortal mansion.

377
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,000
Why lose your temper and spoil the joy?

378
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,400
We suffered as many casualties and injuries in the Battle of Devils as in the War of Genesis.

379
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,000
Three out of the Four Emperors have perished.

380
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,400
Star Deity Ji Du and Immortal Lord Bei Ming had lost their lives during the war.

381
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,900
This isn't the sorrow of one palace!

382
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:03,400
It's the funeral of the Three Realms!

383
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,600
Marshal Huo De, you're drunk.

384
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,500
Stop talking.

385
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,439
You, as the ruler of the Three Realms,

386
00:35:11,439 --> 00:35:14,999
instead of presiding over the funeral and guarding the coffins in person

387
00:35:14,999 --> 00:35:21,219
in the Divine Cemetery Forest, you're acting proudly and celebrating the victory here.

388
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,599
How could the heavenly army not feel bitterly disappointed?

389
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,779
How can this action convince the public?

390
00:35:25,779 --> 00:35:28,850
Marshal, who is the one acting proudly here?

391
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:31,900
Is it you or me?

392
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:39,959
Marshal Huo De, His Supreme Majesty always respects you because you're the oldest immortal in the Three Realms.

393
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:42,739
Yet, His Supreme Majesty's tolerance has made you even more arrogant.

394
00:35:42,739 --> 00:35:44,199
This is a crime of disrespect.

395
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:46,979
Come on. I've broken the Heavenly Rules.

396
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:51,320
Are you going to punish me immediately at the Heavenly Gallows?

397
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,470
Come on!

398
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,700
<i> Your Supreme Majesty, please calm down!</i>

399
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:10,539
As the reinforcements, Marshal Huo De must have put in a lot of effort in fighting the Devils.

400
00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:15,860
Even so, you didn't have to force yourself to come here.

401
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,539
What Dragon King said is right.

402
00:36:20,539 --> 00:36:24,299
The Heavenly Realm is not without places for recuperation.

403
00:36:24,299 --> 00:36:28,679
Xuanxin Cliff, the former residence of Immortal Lord Bei Ming, is a scenic spot.

404
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:36,359
From now on, you will be relieved of command in the military and recuperate at Xuanxin Cliff.

405
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:40,640
You may grieve and resent there.

406
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:03,479
For a ruler like you, why should I continue to train and lead your army?

407
00:37:03,479 --> 00:37:07,139
Instead of being buried with disappointment in the Divine Cemetery Forest alone one day,

408
00:37:07,139 --> 00:37:13,559
I'd rather spend my time at Xuanxin Cliff to raise fish and water the flowers earlier.

409
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:15,980
Insolence!

410
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,750
<i> Your Supreme Majesty!</i>

411
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,939
Your Supreme Majesty, please calm down!

412
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:25,160
I have something to say that may calm your anger.

413
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,840
Speak.

414
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,740
Previously, Emperor Ying Yuan had watched this play once.

415
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:37,680
He said that everything he did wasn't to gain merit and fame.

416
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,779
He only hoped those who had not been affected by the war would enjoy eternal happiness.

417
00:37:41,779 --> 00:37:48,359
I think that both Your Supreme Majesty and Marshal Huo De are right.

418
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:52,440
To cherish prosperity is to commemorate the heroes.

419
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,590
Rise and speak.

420
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:02,079
Your Supreme Majesty, you and Emperor Ying Yuan have known each other for tens of thousands of years.

421
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,119
Your Supreme Majesty must understand Emperor Ying Yuan the best.

422
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:08,510
I believe Your Supreme Majesty will not hold Marshal Huo De accountable, right?

423
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,380
Definitely.

424
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:16,419
Yan Dan, the immortal attendant, has a pure heart and spirit and unique artistic talent.

425
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,179
This play deserves to be the winner.

426
00:38:19,179 --> 00:38:25,719
I once said that the winner of the performances at the Jade Pool Festivity will be bestowed with one wish.

427
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:30,480
Yan Dan, speak your wish.

428
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,140
Thank you, Your Supreme Majesty.

429
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:39,790
My elder sister Zhi Xi and I are the only survivors of the Four-Leaf Lotus Clan.

430
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:48,719
As the Vice Curator of Magical Pavilion, she has passed the ascension examination.

431
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:52,199
After experiencing the hardship in the Mortal Realm, she'll be ascended in her divinity.

432
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:54,579
I hope I can take my sister's place to experience the hardship.

433
00:38:54,579 --> 00:38:59,000
I'd like to wander and experience the Mortal Realm so that I could write better plays.

434
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:05,559
Is your sister the girl who was harmed by the Devils 500 years ago?

435
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:08,420
There's a saying that one may find a strong and a weak in twin lotus.

436
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,159
She's very smart.

437
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:14,919
Firstly, she was brought back by Emperor Ying Yuan to help subdue the traitor.

438
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:17,679
Now, she received praise from His Supreme Majesty.

439
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:21,080
Isn't it apparent who is strong and who is weak?

440
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:28,160
Congratulations, your ascension is just around the corner.

441
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:34,860
It's just that in the future, whenever you show up in the Nine Heavens,

442
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:42,340
your divine headpiece will remind the immortals of how Yan Dan makes herself stand out today.

443
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,139
I approved.

444
00:39:45,139 --> 00:39:49,679
Discuss among yourselves the auspicious date and report to the Department of Heavenly Law

445
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,620
to descend to the Mortal Realm and experience hardship in her place.

446
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,560
Thank you, Your Supreme Majesty.

447
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,600
Your Supreme Majesty, Yan Dan has another request.

448
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,100
Proceed.

449
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,400
I'm Emperor Ying Yuan's servant.

450
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:14,279
When the Devils attacked the Heavenly Court, it was thanks to Emperor Ying Yuan for saving me that I'm alive today.

451
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:23,280
Emperor Ying Yuan left behind this item back then.

452
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,859
I have yet to return it to him.

453
00:40:24,859 --> 00:40:28,730
Since he's not back yet, I can't bear to leave now.

454
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:36,059
May Your Supreme Majesty allow me to repay my master for his kindness before I descend to the Mortal Realm?

455
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,260
You're a loyal servant.

456
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:49,960
The three Emperors, including his best friend Star Deity Ji Du, have just passed away.

457
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:55,579
Emperor Ying Yuan was devastated and descended to the Mortal Realm to recuperate.

458
00:40:55,579 --> 00:41:01,180
I don't know when he'll let go of his guilt and return to the Heavenly Court.

459
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:06,359
Well... Does Your Supreme Majesty know how Emperor Ying Yuan's injury is?

460
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:09,259
His injury is fine. What about this?

461
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:16,699
When Emperor Ying Yuan returns to the Heavenly Realm, I'll inform you and allow you two to bid farewell to each other.

462
00:41:16,699 --> 00:41:19,300
You'll descend to the Mortal Realm after that.

463
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,630
Thank you, Your Supreme Majesty, for your kindness.

464
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,160
Sister!

465
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,359
Did I do very well just now? Did you hear it?

466
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:34,999
His Supreme Majesty said you don't have to descend to the Mortal Realm.

467
00:41:34,999 --> 00:41:36,559
I can do it for you.

468
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:40,499
For this play, I've been practicing for days without taking a rest.

469
00:41:40,499 --> 00:41:42,670
Aren't you going to compliment me?

470
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:49,580
If you want to stand out, you don't have to use me as your reason.

471
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,980
What's wrong with you?

472
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:56,159
Didn't you say that you don't want to suffer in the Mortal Realm?

473
00:41:56,159 --> 00:42:01,259
I said it was because I don't wish to, not because I can't do it.

474
00:42:01,259 --> 00:42:05,200
Wasn't your action today telling the Heavenly Realm that I'm incapable?

475
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:10,300
Or do you think that I'm destined to be the weak one of the lotus twins?

476
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:14,599
Then, why don't you just compete against me in front of the immortals?

477
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,479
She has once broken through my immortal power.

478
00:42:20,479 --> 00:42:23,239
She could subdue Qianyun Palace's curator with a few moves.

479
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:26,940
It's too easy for her to beat you.

480
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:34,260
Zhi Xi, given your immortal power, Yan Dan may find it unworthy to fight against you.

481
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,720
Stop your nonsense!

482
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,180
Sister, have I done anything wrong?

483
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,439
Or did I say anything that hurt you?

484
00:42:44,439 --> 00:42:48,499
Tell me, please. Or just hit me.

485
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:51,560
Everything I did was to make you happy.

486
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,680
You're not me.

487
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,380
How can you understand my worries?

488
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:59,260
Do you think this will make me happy?

489
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:03,490
Do you think I'll win you with pride if you don't fight back?

490
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:09,510
Your actions only embarrass me more.

491
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:18,500
Sister, didn't you say that we should protect each other?

492
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,639
I don't know what I've done wrong.

493
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,800
Did I do something wrong?

494
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,540
Please tell me what I did wrong.

495
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,959
Yan Dan, in the past, you relied on Emperor Ying Yuan's generosity and acted willfully and were deluded.

496
00:43:34,959 --> 00:43:40,239
Now, you used what Emperor Ying Yuan had said and acted slyly at the festivity.

497
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:43,600
You're really adept at flattering.

498
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,879
But you must never forget your identity.

499
00:43:45,879 --> 00:43:52,610
Making a racket at the festivity is a crime of disrespect.

500
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,580
I'm going to take a stroll by the lotus pond.

501
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:06,259
Are you going to stay to pester your sister and make yourself a joke?

502
00:44:06,259 --> 00:44:09,270
Or are you going to go for a clear break?

503
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:11,420
Please make your decision.

504
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,860
Sister, don't go with her.

505
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:12,470
