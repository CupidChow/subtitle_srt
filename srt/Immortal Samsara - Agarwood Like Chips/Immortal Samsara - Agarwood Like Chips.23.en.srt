00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,060
Why don't you soak in the hot spring before you go cook?

16
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,840
I'm not hungry yet anyway.

17
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh right, remember to apply medicine to your injured ankle.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,660
I already gave it to Bai Ling.

19
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,300
Yu Mo.

20
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,920
Have we met before?

21
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,580
Wouldn't you know if we met before?

22
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,400
I don't even know where I came from, or if I have parents or relatives.

23
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,340
In a daze, I came to the Mortal Realm and to Liyuan.

24
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,730
Then I went to Forest of Hidden Flower Mountain and came here by accident.

25
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,420
I often feel like my brain is fogged.

26
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:27,160
I always feel like we've known each other for a long time.

27
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,160
Maybe... we knew each other before.

28
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,760
Maybe I lived and faced death in a spectacular way for you.

29
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,840
But, in the end... we didn't have a happy ending.

30
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,520
So you became my concubine in this life.

31
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,260
You're at my beck and call, and be be bullied.

32
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:59,140
Maybe... you are here to pay your karmic debt.

33
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,160
I vow to follow you till I die, repay you with my loyalty, and sacrifice myself.

34
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,800
Master, please believe in my loyalty towards you.

35
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,880
The Flower Spirit Clan is taking refuge on Yelan Mountain.

36
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,960
The whole mountain is full of demons. I wonder if we can—

37
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,210
I know you want to go down the mountain. We'll leave tomorrow.

38
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,710
I am the King of All Demons.

39
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:36,700
With this journey, I want to check on the demons in the Mortal Realm.

40
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:42,320
I'll see if any evil demons are tarnishing the clan's reputation and punish them.

41
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,940
A chaotic place generates the Five Sufferings and Six Delusions.

42
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,460
I've already done my homework. I'll get everything ready for our first stop.

43
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,660
I hope this trip will be fruitful, helping me

44
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,160
collect thousands of stories.

45
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,160
When the journey is over, I will write a good play!

46
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,360
I really am envious of those fisherwomen.

47
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,880
They can bully the fish, while I serve that picky fish.

48
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,320
Making me collect flower dew so early in the morning to make tea.

49
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,700
Do not move!

50
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,500
Stay still!

51
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,100
Behave!

52
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,820
Do not move!

53
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,540
Each one is prettier than the other. Why are you here fishing?

54
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,060
Come and enjoy life with me!

55
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,150
- Come on.
- Stop!

56
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,980
What do you think of me?

57
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,880
I also want to enjoy life with you.

58
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,060
Do you think I'll do?

59
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,860
You'll do! You'll do!

60
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,660
Please keep your distance.

61
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,280
Thank you.

62
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,810
What a foul demonic aura.

63
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,480
It must be a tormentor.

64
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,860
Very nice.

65
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,420
How old are you?

66
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,520
What is your name?

67
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,020
I am Bai Piaoliang.

68
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,600
I just turned sixteen last month.

69
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,920
Sixteen is a good age.

70
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,980
You're my idea type!

71
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:58,340
<i>Your ugly, lustful look is the manifestation of the false view element in the Six Delusions</i>

72
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,220
<i>I did the right thing coming here.</i>

73
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,720
Do you know who I am?

74
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:09,020
Of course! You are the famous Charitable Zhou from Lanxi Town.

75
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,820
I heard that you often help children from poor families.

76
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,340
You forcibly take their daughters as concubines.

77
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,900
You imprison them here to enjoy great wealth and status.

78
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,620
I don't think you're a bully at all.

79
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,620
Rather, you look like a really nice man!

80
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,560
Good! Well said!

81
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,620
You are a very interesting girl.

82
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,960
The way you said that.... makes my entire body, oh my....

83
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,240
feels so good!

84
00:06:38,186 --> 00:06:42,546
Since you know who I am, you know what I'll probably do to you.

85
00:06:42,546 --> 00:06:45,180
Serve me well and obey me.

86
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,520
If you're disobedient,

87
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:54,740
I have many ways to make you suffer and wish you were dead.

88
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,420
Am I right?

89
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,860
Mr. Charitable.

90
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,800
I saw a cavity on your molar when you laughed just now!

91
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,350
Sisters, run! The master is sick!

92
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,160
Let me cure him.

93
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,670
Your demonic aura was so intense.

94
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,580
I thought you were a powerful demon.

95
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,560
Turns out you're just a toad!

96
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,450
With your looks, you should have stayed in the water.

97
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,520
You just had to come out and harm beautiful women.

98
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,100
How shameful!

99
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,640
Are you a demon catcher?

100
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,780
What did you give me?

101
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,230
You're the demon catcher!

102
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,160
You and your family members!

103
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,940
I'm your great aunt!
<i>(T/N: Implying he needs to show her more respect)</i>

104
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,480
What I gave you was a special revealing pill from the Fox Clan.

105
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,660
You don't even know about this? Do you have any common knowledge of being a demon?

106
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,020
How dare you fool me!

107
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,000
You shall die!

108
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,060
Such a powerful demon! So you're an old toad!

109
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,480
You're also a demon. Why don't you have a demonic aura?

110
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,580
Because I'm awesome!

111
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,460
You are quite awesome too.

112
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,760
Run. Why did you stop running?

113
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,240
I'm tired of eating mortals.

114
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,820
I'll have some demonic essence, for a change.

115
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,873
You came here of your own accord.

116
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,320
Brother Toad, I have eyes but failed to see.

117
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,820
Your superior cultivation base surprised me!

118
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,100
You really are a powerful demon!

119
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,320
I was just confused and offended you.

120
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,120
How about this? I'll offer my demonic essence to you willingly.

121
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:09,860
Then... Then prove it with your actions.

122
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,360
Brother, no need to be so polite.

123
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,480
All right. Let's high-five over that, then. It's a deal!

124
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,980
Brother Toad, this is really inappropriate!

125
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,460
So inappropriate!

126
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,300
Yu Mo! I knew you would come to my rescue!

127
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,400
You wrote to say that you were going to do a good deed every day.

128
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,580
Is this a good deed?

129
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,100
What are you? You ruined my great plan!

130
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,680
What are you? How dare you talk to the Mountain Chief like this?

131
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,580
Believe it or not, he can turn you into a roasted toad!

132
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,820
How did you know I would roast him?

133
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:57,220
I've known you for so long. I can tell what you're thinking by looking at your hair.

134
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:03,060
Yu Mo, this toad did all kinds of evil and is extremely obscene. Hurry and destroy him!

135
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,560
Are you done yet?

136
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,280
I would like to see what you two are capable of.

137
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,820
You stinky, darned toad!

138
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,160
You want to take advantage of me? Please!

139
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,530
Congratulations Mountain Chief, you rid the Mortal Realm of an evil demon.

140
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:31,460
You rescued damsels near and far from untold misery.

141
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,280
What's wrong with you? Ever since we got back, you've looked unhappy.

142
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,940
You already have a long face to begin with.

143
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,460
Your long-faced expression makes it look even longer.

144
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:05,100
Didn't you say that you know what I want to say just by looking at my hair?

145
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,560
Are you still upset about the fact that I went to the toad's lair alone?

146
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,720
Tell me. Why can't you even suppress a toad spirit?

147
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,380
- Then... Were you trying to run away?
- No.

148
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,960
- Is it because you do not want to serve me?
- That's not it.

149
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,520
I understand. You think you've lived too long already.

150
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,740
I... I was in a hurry.

151
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,480
Plus, I knew you were nearby.

152
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,500
You can beat any evil demon with a few punches and kicks.

153
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,420
I'm like a dog who uses my master's power.

154
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,920
That's not right. I was a fox masquerading as a tiger.

155
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:43,340
What if I didn't show up? You would have become his concubine.

156
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,440
Impossible!

157
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,800
I've never seen you use such a charming trick on me.

158
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:54,000
Heaven knows that I'm yours in life and death.

159
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,400
How could I fancy that ugly thing?

160
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,080
Moreover, I knew you would come and save me.

161
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,460
I was just thinking of a way to buy myself some time.

162
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,220
There are many ways to do one thing.

163
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,420
You didn't have to do that.

164
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,860
I naturally did whatever came to my mind.

165
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,440
Although seducing someone is a little old-fashioned, it suits me.

166
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,940
Plus, it works every time.

167
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,240
Don't mention seduction to me again.

168
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,900
<i>Why is he still angry?</i>

169
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,160
<i>What's wrong with him today?</i>

170
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,080
Yu Mo gives me food and clothing.

171
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,960
If he is angry, I will suffer too.

172
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,500
Hopefully, this snow jade cake will cheer him up.

173
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,280
- Give it to me.
- This money is for buying rice for my grandson.

174
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,240
Please, I beg you, have a heart!

175
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,860
Go away!

176
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,760
Let go!

177
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,660
An able-bodied man bullying an elderly person.

178
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,300
Didn't your parents teach you well?

179
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:57,860
All right. Let me teach you a lesson today!

180
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:10,020
"Honor the elderly in other families as you honor your own."

181
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,020
"Care for others' children as you care for yours."

182
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,420
Our elderly...

183
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,060
Our children...

184
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,980
The demonic aura is gone.

185
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,400
Did someone capture it?

186
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,840
<i>"Do good, no matter how petty the deed."</i>

187
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,300
<i>"Don't do evil, no matter how trivial it is."</i>

188
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,980
<i>- “Men on earth..."
- "Good at birth.”</i>

189
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,120
<i>- "The same nature..."
- "Varies in nurture."</i>

190
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,140
Bai Piaoliang.

191
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,180
<i>- "If a child is uneducated..."
- "It is the father's fault."</i>

192
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,980
Thousand-Miles Demon-Subduing Formation.

193
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,620
Sirs, I just found this silver.

194
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,440
Did you two lose it?

195
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,980
- Yes.
- Yes. It's ours.

196
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,500
Throw it here.

197
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,180
I sprained my ankle. I really can't get over there.

198
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:19,140
Why don't you come here and get it?

199
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,420
<i>The formation is dangerous, but it closes when it encounters mortals.</i>

200
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,100
<i>Which deity was that? He used such a cruel formation on me!</i>

201
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,520
She still likes to act smart.

202
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,780
Madam, excuse me.

203
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,600
Did you see a young woman run past here?

204
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,060
<i>What do you mean, "Madam"?</i>

205
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,300
<i>But his voice sounds familiar...</i>

206
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,360
No. No. No. I did not.

207
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,500
Excuse me. How much is this cake?

208
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,480
Five wen a pack.
<i>(T/N: ancient copper currency)</i>

209
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,260
Five wen.

210
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:43,560
Young Man, I take money, not gourds.

211
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:47,000
I will capture you, Bai Piaoliang.

212
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,880
So it is you!

213
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,900
How despicable!

214
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,140
You humiliate me with a paralyzing talisman.

215
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,860
This cake tastes pretty good.

216
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,920
But... I really am hungry.

217
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,600
I want to play with you for a while longer, but I don't have the time.

218
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,400
I disguised myself.

219
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,680
How did you recognize me?

220
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,800
In my trade, we see the world using our eyes.

221
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,800
We are very shrewd.

222
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,160
But you? You don't even dare to lift your head.

223
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,060
How could you fool me?

224
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,710
You're pretending to be a middle-aged lady.

225
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,780
But your hair is dark and glossy.

226
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:34,660
Your hands... don't look like they've done any work. It's too fake.

227
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,260
It's a curse to be born beautiful.

228
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,820
I'll take that as a compliment.

229
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:44,680
The most important thing was that you once tricked me in the Forest Hidden Flower Mountain.

230
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,140
There's no chance of it happening again.

231
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,180
Taoist Master Tang, look.

232
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,080
You are prejudiced against me.

233
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,680
Just now. I was clearly helping the weak get justice.

234
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,180
It's true!

235
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:01,360
I saved an old lady from those hooligans.

236
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,940
Why would you capture me for doing a good deed?

237
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,980
What's more, in the Three Realms and the Four Seas,

238
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:11,400
we were able to meet twice. We must be linked by a special fate.

239
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,030
- Don't you think so?
- Absolutely.

240
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:17,800
That's right, but it's the fate of the cat catching the mouse.

241
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,800
You darned demon catcher!

242
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:40,340
With your low-level skills, you should just preserve your energy.

243
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,620
Right. I'm not capable enough.

244
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,580
You could've beaten me up or killed me.

245
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,940
<i>But you trapped me in here. What kind of hero are you?</i>

246
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,780
Is this the only skill you demon catchers have? Can't you be reasonable?

247
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,080
"Reasonable"?

248
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,160
- I reason with people.
- Hey!

249
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,700
Don't. Don't! Don't trap me in here!

250
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,400
You really are something!

251
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,880
<i>I was wrong, all right?</i>

252
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,220
<i>I was wrong!</i>

253
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,400
<i>Taoist Master Tang!</i>

254
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:10,680
I am just a cute, innocent, and harmless little lotus.

255
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,040
You used this divine tool against me. What a waste!

256
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,200
I still take up space.

257
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,080
What if you encounter an evil demon in the future, and you can't trap it?

258
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,140
No problem. No problem at all.

259
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:24,340
After I turn you into an elixir, other demons can easily live in there.

260
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,780
<i>Don't worry. I am very experienced.</i>

261
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,220
I'll let you die peacefully.

262
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,340
<i>It wouldn't matter if it was anyone else.</i>

263
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,980
<i>But he's had a feud with me. He wouldn't really kill me, would he?</i>

264
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,860
<i>I only focused on escaping and left no markers.</i>

265
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:46,580
<i>I can't count on Yu Mo. I'm on my own.</i>

266
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:55,390
Now I finally know how it feels when kind people get bullied, and when a mouse encounters a cat.

267
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,160
This kind of imprisonment... without being able to rely on anyone...

268
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,140
I finally know how to write about it.

269
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,620
I just don't know if I'll get a chance to write it.

270
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,280
Yan Dan.

271
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,300
Yan Dan!

272
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,720
Yan Dan.

273
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,260
<i>I'll be back soon. Master, please wait for your supper.</i>

274
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,560
At least you have a conscience.

275
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,200
In your heart, you still remember your master.

276
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,280
Come again. See you soon.

277
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,480
Greetings, guests. You have arrived.
<i>[Zuixiang Inn]</i>

278
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,620
Please come in. Please come in.

279
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:04,340
Sir, come in, please. What would you like to order?

280
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,380
In Lanxi Town, the best desserts are in our back kitchen.

281
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,300
The best desserts?

282
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,280
I'm not here to eat.

283
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,720
I would like to ask you something.

284
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,900
Sir, you may not know that our storyteller here

285
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,220
is the most famous snoop, in a 100 li radius.
<i> (T/N: 100 li is about 31 miles/50 kilometers) </i>

286
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,960
However, we have a rule here.

287
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,820
If you want to ask questions, you must buy a plate of desserts and write it on a slip of paper.

288
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,740
I'll pass the slip to him.

289
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,540
Is this enough?

290
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,060
Yes, yes. Sir, please come in.

291
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:36,960
Young Master Yu's second sister harshly scolded Li Jianxian.

292
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,540
"You knew that place attracts fierce ghosts."

293
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:44,040
"Those who go there never come back!"

294
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:48,920
"Why did you trick my brother into treasure-hunting there?"

295
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,360
May I know where the place you are talking about is?

296
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,720
Wait. Wait.

297
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,300
This guest also has a question.

298
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,580
This is the last dish of desserts left today.

299
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,460
Who will ask, between the two of you?

300
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,080
Sir, my wife and I got separated.

301
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,500
I need some clues.

302
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,620
May I have the desserts?

303
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,860
Yu Mo!

304
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,440
Yu Mo, is that you?

305
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,660
Is there anyone there?

306
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:35,960
The Taoist Master has imprisoned a beautiful girl!

307
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,260
Sir, please go ahead.

308
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,080
It wasn't important. I was just asking for fun.

309
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,820
Thank you.

310
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,680
<i>Yu Mo!</i>

311
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,660
<i>You fool! Can't you hear me?</i>

312
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,500
Stop yelling. Only I can hear you.

313
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,480
If you make more noise, I will concoct an elixir out of you tonight.

314
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,980
<i>Yan Dan really did come here to buy desserts last night.</i>

315
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,060
<i>She must have encountered something on her way back.</i>

316
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,500
The storyteller said that the question is not worth the silver.

317
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,240
It's all right. This clue is worth more than that.

318
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,420
Sir, please enjoy the desserts.

319
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,180
Bai Ling was the one who asked me out.

320
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,380
Why are you here instead?

321
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,420
Didn't she say I invited you?

322
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,260
This Bai Ling!

323
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:00,720
I think her heart has disappeared with Yu Mo.

324
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,640
Fine. Mountain Chief Zi Lin.

325
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,040
Why are you trying to please me for no reason?

326
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:16,320
Yelan Mountain and the Three-tailed Snow Foxes have already made a covenant for a century of reconciliation.

327
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,980
You are a princess and a guest here.

328
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,320
I am also the Mountain Chief.

329
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,060
You are an honorable guest.

330
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:27,460
Naturally, I should show our utmost hospitality.

331
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,580
Close your eyes.

332
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,380
I have a surprise for you.

333
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,100
Don't bother.

334
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,800
This is called "beggar's chicken."

335
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,580
This is a delicacy in the Mortal Realm.

336
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,240
I heard that you foxes all love to eat chicken.

337
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,800
Right?

338
00:24:55,420 --> 00:25:00,090
I learned this dish from Yan Dan's scripts...

339
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,600
I cooked this myself.

340
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,440
Do you want to try some?

341
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,600
Wait a moment.

342
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,060
Here. Try it.

343
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,920
Here.

344
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,140
How is it?

345
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,980
It's all right.

346
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,180
The Three-tailed Snow Foxes never owe a favor.

347
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,740
To thank you for the chicken,

348
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,780
I'll buy you anything you like tomorrow.

349
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,160
You don't have to do that.

350
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,900
Oh, right.

351
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,260
I prepared another surprise for you.

352
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,780
You must close your eyes this time.

353
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,260
All right.

354
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,940
What is this?

355
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,500
A tribute from the Aquatic Clan.

356
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,160
This treasure is thousand-year-old silt from the deep sea.

357
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,440
It has beautifying effects, for women.

358
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,500
I don't want any silt! I don't need it!

359
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,620
We agreed on a century of reconciliation.

360
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,740
Turns out the princess is the first to breach the covenant.

361
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,820
I am me. The Fox Clan is the Fox Clan.

362
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,980
Mountain Chief Yu Mo and my father signed the covenant. What does it have to do with me?

363
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:54,180
If you and I become enemies, then of course revenge will be had.

364
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:58,580
Without my permission... You can't apply any silt to my face!

365
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,800
That's for women!

366
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,420
Why are you running?

367
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,920
That's for women. I shouldn't spoil it.

368
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,820
Stop!

369
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,860
Are you all right?

370
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,980
Watch out!

371
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,720
- Let me help you up.
- Thank you.

372
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,540
Who hides fish in a tree?

373
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,000
This... is my private stash.

374
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,840
A private stash?

375
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,060
I remember!

376
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,480
Yan Dan told me that Mountain Chief Yu Mo's real form is a fish.

377
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,040
So he doesn't allow those around him to eat fish or shrimp.

378
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,660
Mountain Chief Zi Lin, how could you eat it in secret?

379
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,960
You nearly hurt me!

380
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:13,200
Nobody knows about this, except for Heaven, Earth, you, and me.

381
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,520
You must never tell anyone about this, especially Bai Ling.

382
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,480
She's a tattletale.

383
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,680
She'll instantly go and tell Yu Mo.

384
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,580
Okay, then. I'll keep it a secret.

385
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:28,180
But what will I get out of it?

386
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,340
"Good"?

387
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,380
How about this?

388
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,980
I give you half of my private stash.

389
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,500
Snow foxes don't eat fish and shrimp.

390
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:47,020
Then I'll make you beggar's chicken every day, for the rest of my life.

391
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,760
In your dreams! Who wants to be with you forever?

392
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,920
Tell me, then. What do you want?

393
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,360
I'll do as you say.

394
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,260
<i>Mountain Chief Zi Lin! Mountain Chief Zi Lin!</i>

395
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,500
Mountain Chief Yu Mo sent a letter asking us to go and help him.

396
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,240
Yan Dan is missing!

397
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,860
What?

398
00:29:07,366 --> 00:29:09,350
<i>[The Consort's Tomb in Qingshi Town]</i>

399
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,900
<i>Is my next stop Qingshi Town?</i>

400
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:18,040
<i>"Anomalies will occur wherever there is a divine tool."</i>

401
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,560
<i>Over this piece of advice, I've been to so many places.</i>

402
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,620
<i>I've returned empty-handed multiple times.</i>

403
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:26,840
<i>I came down the mountain to travel the world and practice spells.</i>

404
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,260
<i>My pursuit might not bear fruit.</i>

405
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,880
<i>Instead, I banished demons and devils.</i>

406
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,160
<i>It still isn't a waste of time.</i>

407
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,500
<i>Yu Mo is looking for me, so I might still be rescued.</i>

408
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,680
<i>I must not give up.</i>

409
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,300
<i>I must survive under Tang Zhou's oppressive power.</i>

410
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:53,340
<i>I must write a good script about my survival in the mortal world.</i>

411
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,800
Bai Piaoliang.

412
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,440
Taoist Master Tang! Do you want something?

413
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,720
Nothing much.

414
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,260
I just wanted to make sure you're still alive.

415
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,860
As long as you're okay, that's good.

416
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,640
It is my blessing to have your concern.

417
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,560
You're so well-behaved.

418
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,700
Are you hiding the words you want to scold me with in your heart?

419
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,240
<i>You are very self-aware.</i>

420
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,060
<i>If I didn't have to flatter you, who would pay you any attention?</i>

421
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,960
Taoist Master Tang, you see...

422
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,280
<i>You're traveling the world alone.</i>

423
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,360
<i>There's no one to chat with you either. Aren't you bored?</i>

424
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,960
Why?

425
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:42,820
Are you trying to flatter me... and persuade me to let you out to keep me company?

426
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,060
Do you dislike us demons that much?

427
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,300
I don't dislike you.

428
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,620
It is a deep hatred.

429
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,360
But not all demons are evil!

430
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,040
Maybe, but I haven't met one like that yet.

431
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,640
Me! Me! You've met me twice.

432
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,200
Have you seen me doing a single bad thing?

433
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,500
You used eloquent words to deceive me.

434
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,500
Is that not evil?

435
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,640
That doesn't count!

436
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,780
I did it to save the Flower Spirit Clan.

437
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:16,580
<i>Generations of our clan lived lonely lives in the Forest of Hidden Flower Mountain.</i>

438
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,380
<i>We're not much different from mortals.</i>

439
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:24,120
<i>If you hadn't broken in, I would've never see any mortals in my life, much less harm them.</i>

440
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:29,060
Even if they haven't done evil, it doesn't mean they wouldn't, in the future.

441
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:32,360
<i>My clan taught me that demons are inherently evil and won't change.</i>

442
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,780
Once upon a time,

443
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:38,840
I pitied a poor white snake demon and let her out of a demon-trapping bottle.

444
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:43,680
In the end, she came out and bit me immediately.

445
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,220
<i>That is wrong reasoning.</i>

446
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,860
<i>You can't dismiss all other demons because of one evil one.</i>

447
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:52,680
Although I haven't seen many mortals, I've read a lot of history books.

448
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,620
There was continuous fighting and wickedness everywhere.

449
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,960
<i>Many mortals die at the hands of their own kind.</i>

450
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,460
<i>Using your logic, humanity is even more terrible.</i>

451
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,960
Why don't you catch humans instead of demons?

452
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,580
You're such a chatterbox.

453
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,860
How noisy!

454
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:10,120
You asked so many questions and kept talking to try and convince me otherwise, right?

455
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,720
Listen. You better give up on this.

456
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,160
<i>From today onwards, you may ask only three questions per day.</i>

457
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,580
Whether or not I answer will depend on my mood.

458
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,580
If you ask more than that...

459
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,360
I'll immediately concoct an elixir out of you.

460
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,640
No. No. No.

461
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,500
<i>That isn't how you reason.</i>

462
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,220
It is pitch black in here.

463
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,640
I can't tell when it is day and when it is night.

464
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,280
How do I know if the day is over?

465
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,380
That is your problem.

466
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,400
I don't care.

467
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,520
How despicable!

468
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,660
All right. You've reached your quota for today.

469
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,840
<i>Residual supernatural power.</i>

470
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,420
<i>Someone used the Demon-Subduing Formation.</i>

471
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:07,700
<i>Yan Dan, I'm sorry.</i>

472
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,680
<i>I failed to protect you.</i>

473
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,820
<i>I lost you again.</i>

474
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,700
<i>Where are on earth are you?</i>

475
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,120
Last night, I searched the city.

476
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:30,120
I found three activated demon-catching formations, but not the demon catcher.

477
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,580
I'm afraid Yan Dan is no longer in Lanxi Town.

478
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:39,200
As soon as we got the message, we notified everyone on the mountain.

479
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,200
The Fox Clan, Avian Clan, and Wolf Clan are the most powerful.

480
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,660
Don't worry. We'll definitely find Yan Dan.

481
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,840
But she doesn't have a demonic aura.

482
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,000
Ordinary tracking spells will not work on her.

483
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,100
To find her, we must find the demon catcher.

484
00:33:55,100 --> 00:34:01,960
Zi Lin and I will lead the Aquatic Clan and Fox Clan to check all demon catchers around Lanxi Town.

485
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:07,800
All sects in the Mortal Realm regard the Lingxiao Sect as their leader.

486
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,300
This clan is located far away,

487
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,000
but don't let go of any clues.

488
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,060
I'll ask the Avian Clans to ask around.

489
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,600
You should send the Wolf Clan instead.

490
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,600
The Lingxiao Sect is extremely powerful.

491
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:24,900
The Avian Clan can check the small sects so that we can receive news as soon as possible.

492
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,640
Everyone, act quickly.

493
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,900
Yan Dan is smart, but she doesn't have much power.

494
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:33,500
One day's delay might endanger her more.

495
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,460
- Yes.
- Yes.

496
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,500
Taoist Master Tang. Taoist Master Tang.

497
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,400
<i>Are you tired after a long journey?</i>

498
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,500
<i>Why don't you let me out to massage your legs and shoulders?</i>

499
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,100
No need. It's better if you just sit in there quietly.

500
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,700
<i>I know. I know. You think I nag a lot.</i>

501
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,600
<i>I've already tried my best to keep quiet for a whole day.</i>

502
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,200
But being a chatterbox isn't a bad thing.

503
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:09,700
I heard that you're going to look for the Consort's Tomb in Qingshi Town.

504
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,900
I can help you there!

505
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,400
You know that I enjoy talking.

506
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,600
Let me out!

507
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,300
I'll be at your beck and call. I'll snoop around for you.

508
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,800
<i>You wouldn't have to worry at all. What do you think?</i>

509
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,000
Are you that eager to come out?

510
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,900
<i>I know. You want to go to the Consort's Tomb to get rid of demons and devils.</i>

511
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,400
To save people, right?

512
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:34,500
Even though I'm a demon, I admire your chivalrous heart.

513
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,000
If you let me out,

514
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,800
it would be my honor to share your burden.

515
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,200
It doesn't matter if you disagree.

516
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:46,400
<i>But can you let me out to breathe first?</i>

517
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,900
Are you sure about that?

518
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,600
Yes!

519
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,300
All right.

520
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,200
You... You... You...

521
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,300
I... I... I... What about me?

522
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,900
You're a hooligan! A despicable Taoist Master!

523
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,600
Didn't you say you wanted to come out to breathe?

524
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,400
I'm a woman! You shouldn't let me watch you take a bath!

525
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,400
How shameless.

526
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,400
I agreed to let you out to breathe.

527
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,000
Are you in a hurry to go back inside?

528
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,200
No, no, no. Don't get angry, please.

529
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,600
It's my fault, all right?

530
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,400
I lied to you in the Forest of Hidden Flower Mountain.

531
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,800
I deserve all this.

532
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:49,000
If I were you, I would keep my mouth shut. That way, I could live a few more days.

533
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,600
Noisy.

534
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,800
<i>You vile person!</i>

535
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,600
<i>[Jingshui Inn]</i>

536
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,700
Tang Zhou. You really are a vile person.

537
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,800
Despicable.

538
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,800
Tang Zhou, you despicable person! Can't you let me sleep?!

539
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,600
<i>Is this made of gold? It must be worth a lot!</i>

540
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,300
I know, right?

541
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,100
This thing is studded with glittering jewels.

542
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:38,100
<i>Maybe there's something precious in it.</i>

543
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:41,000
<i>Exactly. Open it and take a look.</i>

544
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,800
I must have done a lot of good deeds. Even Heaven can't bear to see me suffer.

545
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,600
It has sent someone to help me!

546
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,000
Open it. Open it. Open it!

547
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,400
Hurry up. What if that man wakes up?

548
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,100
What's the rush? We'll kill him before we leave anyway.

549
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,200
We can kill him if he wakes up.

550
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,000
That's right.

551
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,000
I'm finally out!

552
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,600
- This...
- This...

553
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,600
Am I that scary?

554
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,800
Wasn't my roaring cute, not frightening?

555
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,000
They ran away so fast.

556
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,400
It was knockout drops.

557
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,800
This vile person has such superb magical spells,

558
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,000
but he doesn't know the ways of the world.

559
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:52,100
You tortured me for so long. But me? I accidentally saved your life.

560
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,600
This is a big misunderstanding.

561
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,900
How can I repay evil with good?

562
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,600
It would be more pleasing to the eye

563
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,000
if I were to leave my fingerprints on this clean, white face.

564
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,800
Bai Piaoliang. What are you doing?

565
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,100
You're awake?

566
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:18,600
I... I saw a mosquito on your face. I wanted to swat it.

567
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,900
You raised your hand so high. I thought you were going to slap me.

568
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:27,700
Seriously? No way. Why would I do such a thing?

569
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,600
Move your butt.

570
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:38,200
Did you really think some knockout drops would work on me?

571
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,900
Then... Looks like you were conscious the whole time.

572
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,000
Why didn't you get up if you were awake?

573
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,100
Were you going to let them steal your things?

574
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,200
At first, I wanted to get up.

575
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:56,100
But on second thought, it was better to watch you face a "big misunderstanding" and "retaliate with virtue."

576
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:02,800
You don't know, these two thieves murdered others for money in the inn.

577
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,100
Looking back, it was so dangerous.

578
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,300
I didn't know I would accidentally save your life.

579
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,000
It's an honor. An honor.

580
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,700
But they can't hurt me.

581
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,200
Don't say that.

582
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:18,400
Criminals have a lot of ways to hide.

583
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,700
If I didn't scare them just now,

584
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:25,800
you really would've been in danger. But you don't have to repay me for saving your life.

585
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,200
I have only one request.

586
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,200
I don't want to go back into that gourd again!

587
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,200
It's dark and stuffy inside.

588
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,800
If you send me back in, I would rather kill myself.

589
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,000
Fine then.

590
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,100
You didn't sit by and watch them hurt me.

591
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,000
There's a possibility you can still be changed.

592
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,500
Well, I can let you out... but you have to be by my side every day.

593
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,800
I want to try that...

594
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,000
Try what?

595
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,800
Nothing much.

596
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,200
You're good at snooping around, aren't you?

597
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,600
Yes, yes!

598
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,800
Show me your skills, then.

599
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:05,400
I'll readily die serving Taoist Master Tang!

600
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,600
Very good.

601
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,400
<i>[Jingshui Inn]</i>

602
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,700
Here you go. Enjoy your food. Enjoy!

603
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,600
Can you imagine that?

604
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,400
At that table, the three are tall, short, fat, and thin.

605
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,500
They are actually biological brothers.

606
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,400
Get to the point. What did you find out?

607
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,500
I really did find out something.

608
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:33,400
In the forest near Qingshi Town, there's a tomb called "Consort's Tomb."

609
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:38,700
Rumor has it that when the former dynasty fell, the ruler and his beloved noble consort fled.

610
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:43,400
With warriors escorting them, they escaped with all their gold and silver.

611
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,800
When they reached Qingshi Town, they were cornered.

612
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:52,400
The warriors could only protect the people and not the treasures.

613
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:58,000
So the ruler thought of a heartless plan.

614
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Did he kill his noble consort?

615
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,000
Not only that.

616
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,500
After he built the tomb, in order to turn her into a fierce ghost to protect his treasures,

617
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,800
he used an extremely cruel method to kill his consort.

618
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,000
Then, over the years, greedy people have tried many ways to steal the treasures.

619
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,800
But those who go in never come back.

620
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,600
Ghosts don't exist. Most of them are demons.

621
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,000
They make trouble masquerading as fierce ghosts.

622
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:35,900
Then, from what I heard, that demon is extremely powerful.

623
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,800
<i>He seems to have made up his mind to go into the tomb.</i>

624
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,600
<i>I was going to slip away in the name of snooping around,</i>

625
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,600
<i>but the story of the tomb is way too exciting.</i>

626
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:52,400
<i>If I can gain knowledge, I might as well risk my life to accompany this vile person.</i>

627
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,800
<i>Miss, try this.</i>

628
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,200
<i>Come on.</i>

629
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,900
I'll leave it here, all right?

630
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,500
Bai Piaoliang, what brings you here?

631
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,600
I heard you talking about the Consort's Tomb.

632
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,000
I wanted to join in on the fun.

633
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,500
Moreover, the more people, the better the odds!

634
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,000
Come on! Let me introduce him to you.

635
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,900
This is my friend, Tang Zhou.

636
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,700
This is Brother Qi Hu, Brother Qi Niu, and Brother Qi Bao.

637
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,500
This... This is?

638
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,200
Let me introduce these two to you.

639
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,500
They're famous in Jianghu, Qin Mingyang and Jin Hongmian.

640
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,200
The Consort's tomb is full of danger.

641
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,400
Those who enter together should stay together, whatever their relationship.

642
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,600
We also just met.

643
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:50,300
We were discussing watching each other's back when we enter. Then you came.

644
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,400
Let's go together.

645
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,300
Agreed, agreed.

646
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,600
There's a lot of evil energy here.

647
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,100
We should definitely help each other.

648
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,000
That's right.

649
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,500
There's not even a word inscribed on this tombstone.

650
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:45,100
