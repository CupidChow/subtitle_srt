15
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,760
- Father!
- Father! Don't stop me!

16
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,460
I can't keep Zi Lin's secret anymore, Clan Leader!

17
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,120
What secret?

18
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,200
Since things have come to this point, I'll just tell you about it.

19
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,540
Zi Lin, you're not an ordinary tortoise.

20
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,740
Zi Lin is an immortal tortoise from heaven.

21
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,720
The deceased Immortal Lord Bei Ming was his master.

22
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,880
He absorbed the essence of the sun and the moon.

23
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,160
So he's an divine tortoise.

24
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,900
I thought I was just an ordinary tortoise from a divine lake.

25
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,900
It turns out that my master was Immortal Lord Bei Ming?

26
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,260
- Really?
- Talk less.

27
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,440
This is Zi Lin's immortal form.

28
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,720
I thought my primordial pill just looked unique.

29
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,780
Turns out it was really precious.

30
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,240
Father-in-law, if you're willing to let Lin Lang marry me,

31
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,500
I'll gift her the immortal spirit for her to kick around like a ball if she wanted.

32
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,940
- Father.
- Even if you were an immortal cultivating in the heavenly realm,

33
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,420
you're still just a demon in the mortal world right now.

34
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,660
Our Fox Clan never has set up an alliance with the Tortoise Clan.

35
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,340
- If this goes public, how will I...
- Father! Father!

36
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,760
I don't care if he's a deity!

37
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,920
All I care about is if he loves me wholeheartedly.

38
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,800
Father, I beg you.

39
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,320
Promise me, okay?

40
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,500
Just fulfill our wishes, please?

41
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,640
- Father!
- I beg you.

42
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,120
- Please let us get married.
- I beg you too.

43
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,780
I don't want to leave the mountain.

44
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,700
And I can't bear to leave the Mountain Chief and Sister Yan Dan.

45
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,380
Father...

46
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,080
Listen to me. The marriage must be held in the Mountain Chief Hall.

47
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,900
It must be filled with 88 tables. The food and drinks will constantly flow to show dignity.

48
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,940
- Father.
- Eighty-eight tables?

49
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,080
We don't have that much money on the mountain.

50
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,400
Do it. Even if I lose everything, I'll still have to do it.

51
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,740
What's more, you have to ask a respected deity to be the witness.

52
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,360
- Well...
- Father!

53
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,860
Didn't you cultivate in the Heavenly Realm before?

54
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,360
Don't tell me you don't know any superior deities.

55
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,120
Clan Leader, if I may be so bold to ask, must it be a superior deity?

56
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,680
Yu Mo is the king of all demons.

57
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,580
- It'll be an honor to have him as their witness, right?
<i>- Right!</i>

58
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,240
Or will an Earthly Deity do?

59
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,580
There's a Soil Guardian I know. He's really kind.

60
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,500
- Can you...
- No.

61
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,840
We're leaving!

62
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,360
- Find a superior deity.
- Father!

63
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,500
Only then can you come to the Fox Clan to propose!

64
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,760
- Father! Father.
- Clan Leader.

65
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,460
- Let's go.
- Father, calm down.

66
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,820
- Father.
- Clan Leader, please stop for a moment.

67
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,380
Mountain Chief Yu Mo. Please forgive me for being noisy and rude.

68
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,820
But Lin Lang is my most beloved daughter.

69
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,620
You treasure your daughter, I can understand that.

70
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,740
How hard could it be to find a superior deity as the witness?

71
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,820
An emperor who has descended to the Mortal Realm, would that satisfy you?

72
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,540
An emperor?

73
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,100
Lin Lang and Zi Lin got into trouble because of me.

74
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,060
I'll be the witness to their marriage, to bring them good luck.

75
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,780
Greetings, Your Majesty.

76
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,380
- I'm sorry for being rude.
- Father. What are you doing? Get up.

77
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,580
- He's our savior. He's Taoist Master Tang.
- Kneel down.

78
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,140
- All of you, kneel down.
- He captures demons.

79
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,500
The Emperor is the savior of the Fox Clan.

80
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,580
During the War of Genesis, thanks to the Emperor's help,

81
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,100
the Fox Clan managed to avoid the genocidal acts of the Asura Clan.

82
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,300
Back then, the Fox Clan avoided the war to survive.

83
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:16,400
After that, the Heavenly Court was going to denounce us and kicked the Fox Clan out of the Immortal Clan.

84
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,960
Our clan was bullied.

85
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,580
Because of your kindness, you saved the territories of the Fox Clan.

86
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,700
Which is how our clan was able to survive up to now.

87
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,260
Your portrait was kept in the ancestral temple of the Fox Clan this entire time.

88
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:34,920
Every clan leader is grateful for your kindness and we worship you.

89
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,620
I descended to the Mortal Realm to experience hardships.

90
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,860
I can't remember the past.

91
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,640
If the kindness I did back then can bring a good outcome today, that is be a good thing.

92
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,520
As long as Lin Lang and Zi Lin love each other,

93
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:57,240
Yan Dan and I are willing to be witnesses to their marriage.

94
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,420
Father. I, Zi Lin, am more than willing.

95
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,300
If I can marry Lin Lang, I'll be sure to treasure her.

96
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,500
I'll love what she likes and hate what she hates.

97
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:21,340
Even if the world is torn apart and water flows backward, I'll never change my mind.

98
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:26,820
If I go back on my words, may I die a horrible death and never be able to reincarnate.

99
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,800
You're indeed a man.

100
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,320
I'll allow you two to get married.

101
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,100
Since Young Master Tang has such a noble status and he and the Fox Clan have such fate with each other,

102
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,760
then can these 88 tables of banqueting be...

103
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:56,480
Your Majesty. No. If Young Master Tang graces us with his presence as a witness to my daughter's marriage,

104
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,220
that would be a great honor for the Fox Clan.

105
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,540
How could I dare ask for anything more?

106
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,080
I'm willing to spare all the efforts of the Fox Clan,

107
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,980
and I'll offer the divine scriptures which have been passed down for tens of thousands of years to return the favor.

108
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:15,940
It's justified for Lin Lang to do anything for Yelan Mountain as a token of appreciation.

109
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,060
This is a predestined marriage.

110
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,240
A divine scripture that is tens of thousands of years old?

111
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,380
Let's do it! We have to hold this marriage now!

112
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,000
Can you take care of those split souls of yours?

113
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,440
They're wandering around all over.

114
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,640
If they were to come out at night, it would scare those timid demons.

115
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,640
I didn't see you when I woke up.

116
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,880
So I asked them to look for you.

117
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,200
And I happened to do this good deed.

118
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,980
How are you going to thank me?

119
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,140
I think the pleasant surprise is this box of divine scriptures.

120
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,140
I didn't expect the Leader of the Fox Clan to keep his promise.

121
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:03,160
He asked someone to bring this box of divine scriptures over so quickly.

122
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:09,900
I think that one of these books contains a spell to break that mysterious man's magic.

123
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,320
I think this Lotus Sutra is quite nice.

124
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:22,820
"It's suitable for those who suffer from internal deficiencies and a leaking of yang <i>(male)</i> force.."

125
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,980
This isn't suitable for you.

126
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,180
Why isn't it suitable for me? Let me see it.

127
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,280
I said it's not suitable, so it isn't.

128
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,000
Give... give it back to me!

129
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:44,340
"To cultivate this, the cultivator has to take off their clothing,"

130
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,280
"pick a person to inject the power into Dark Ice,"

131
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,740
"and wipe the whole body with Dark Ice."

132
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,240
I think it's quite suitable.

133
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,500
You vile man.

134
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,880
It's suitable for you, but not for me!

135
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,300
What are you doing?

136
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,940
You said that you wanted to save me.

137
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,920
How do you know it's not suitable without trying it?

138
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,400
I don't want to.

139
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,240
Isn't it written clearly in the book?

140
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,320
You're only going to wipe that one place?

141
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,900
Stop being too demanding, okay?

142
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,240
What about the neck?

143
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,780
It hurts.

144
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,580
- What's wrong? Are you shy?
- I'm not shy. I'm daring enough.

145
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,800
If so, why did you stop? Keep going.

146
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,220
My immortal spirit is hurting again.

147
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,820
Since it hurts so much, why don't I help you with it.

148
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,760
Hei Tu, perfect timing.

149
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,420
- Hurry. Wipe it for him.
- Damn it.

150
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,100
Enough, you're severely injured, you should take care of yourself.

151
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,000
Besides, pretending to be sick to seek attention are all tricks I've used before.

152
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,300
It doesn't work at all.

153
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,700
It'll do as long as it works.

154
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,000
Since I'm dying, the most important thing is to be happy.

155
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,300
Yan Dan, Zhao Lan's reply... I've put the letter in the Pavilion of Books.

156
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,300
Go read it if you have the time.

157
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,600
This palm is incurable, right?

158
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,300
How could it be?

159
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,400
There must be a way to cure it.

160
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,100
Didn't you hear Yu Mo just now?

161
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,900
Zhao Lan already wrote back to us. She must've figured it out.

162
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,800
You wait here. We'll come to you after discussing it.

163
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,000
You stay here in the water.

164
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,000
Yan Dan,

165
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,200
I've been in the mortal world for twenty years already.

166
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,000
Seems like I won't have a chance of getting married.

167
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,900
So, at Lin Lang and Zi Lin's wedding tomorrow, let's all be happy, okay?

168
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,300
What are you talking about? We're all happy.

169
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm really happy too.

170
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,900
Besides, believe me. You won't die.

171
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,600
<i>Withered Stone Palm, as its name suggests, causes a stone-like occlusion in the person's meridian.</i>

172
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,800
<i>Medicine or magic aren't able to be injected into the body.</i>

173
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,600
<i>No matter how powerful the rescuer is, the power will still be thrown back by the body.</i>

174
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,400
<i>If the person who was hit has symptoms of pulse collision,</i>

175
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,800
<i>he'll die in ten days due to the inability of regulating the basis.</i>

176
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
<i>There's no cure for this palm.</i>

177
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,300
<i>I suggest you not to cast a spell recklessly.</i>

178
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,600
<i>Or it'll cause danger to yourself, causing you both to die.</i>

179
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,700
Yan Dan, eat something.

180
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,100
<i>[Blood is the spirit, sudden force is used to lead, draw invisible magic, then rebuild the body.]</i>

181
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,200
I found it.

182
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
Yu Mo, Yu Mo. I found it.

183
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,400
Look. In this Great Silk Scripture, there are 81 stances.

184
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,600
Every move and every stance is able to heal and prolong life.

185
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,300
We can save Tang Zhou now. I can save his life!

186
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,600
Yan Dan.

187
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,400
Zhao Lan already said it... this palm is incurable.

188
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,800
If you insist on using power to save him, the power will be thrown back into your body. It's useless.

189
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,400
What do we do then? I'm asking you what I should do now.

190
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,900
Should I just sit by and watch him die without doing anything?

191
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,900
I'm sorry.

192
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,300
I...

193
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,900
I didn't mean to lose my temper with you.

194
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,000
- I'm just...
- It's all right.

195
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,400
Yan Dan.

196
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,100
Tang Zhou is my blood-sworn brother.

197
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,400
I certainly want him to be alive and well.

198
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,700
I know. If Tang Zhou dies, you'll be heartbroken.

199
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,400
I've never expected you to give up on him.

200
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,400
I've already sent all the demon soldiers down the mountain to find the clues about the Ground Block.

201
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:42,100
Perhaps if they find it, then his power will be stabilized.

202
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,000
This is what Yelan Mountain owes Tang Zhou.

203
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,400
We'll naturally try our best to repay him.

204
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,100
For the time being,

205
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,200
he'll only be happy if you are.

206
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,400
Isn't that right?

207
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,000
Yu Mo, thank you.

208
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,400
Thanks.

209
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,400
You're running out of breath.

210
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,900
Yet, you still want to be a wedding officiant.

211
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,300
After the wedding ends, I can die without regrets.

212
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,500
After I die, you should go find a new master.

213
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:52,400
<i>If you die, there's no other master I can serve in this world.</i>

214
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,400
I have a qi-gathering method that might be worth trying.

215
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,600
It's useless.

216
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,100
Yan Dan and Yu Mo have gone through all the scriptures of the Divine Realm.

217
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,200
It's unsolvable.

218
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,000
Using qi-gathering methods is time-consuming.

219
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,100
Stop fussing around.

220
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,600
This method of mine is definitely different.

221
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,200
If you learn it, perhaps you can make it to tomorrow's wedding.

222
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,900
How about it? Do you want to learn it?

223
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,500
I won't learn demonic spells.

224
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,000
You're my sword master, how could I possibly harm you?

225
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,200
Come on, try it.

226
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,700
Forget all five senses.

227
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,800
Empty the six perceptions.

228
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,400
Reverse the mysteries.

229
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,800
<i>I'm cursed and I can't reveal your origin.</i>

230
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,500
<i>But I still made you learn your father's unique skill, Eternal Darkness.</i>

231
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,200
<i>As long as you can survive this, you'll achieve the same goal sooner or later.</i>

232
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,900
<i>We, the Asura Clan, can finally fulfill our wish as well.</i>

233
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,600
<i>All of you, kneel down.</i>

234
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,100
<i>Your Majesty, this is the last batch of slaves from the Quick Cypress Clan.</i>

235
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,500
<i>Congratulations, Your Majesty.</i>

236
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:07,100
<i>With the help of their spiritual power, it'll bring your Eternal Darkness to perfection.</i>

237
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,300
<i>Ingesting the slaves can strengthen the cultivation base.</i>

238
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,200
<i>It can make our soldiers invincible.</i>

239
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,400
<i>But our clan is destined to have a short lifespan.</i>

240
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,600
<i>If this disadvantage isn't removed, it'll be hard for us to achieve greatness.</i>

241
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:28,300
<i>If... we have the Primordial Lord,</i>

242
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:34,400
<i>Ran Qing's Seven Luminaries Jade, we'll be able to engulf the lives of others.</i>

243
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,600
<i>A life for a thousand years.</i>

244
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,800
<i>Then, we could be invincible.</i>

245
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:47,000
<i>We've sent people to the Heavenly Realm to steal the jade many times.</i>

246
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,800
<i>But all of them are no match for Ran Qing.</i>

247
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,000
<i>That's because she hasn't met me.</i>

248
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,300
<i>Xuan Ye, you killed my whole clan and tried to absorb my spiritual power.</i>

249
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,800
<i>I'd rather kill myself than let you have your way!</i>

250
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:40,800
<i>Live or die, it's up to me.</i>

251
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,000
<i>Your Majesty, Ran Qing is here.</i>

252
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,500
<i>Perfect timing.</i>

253
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:26,000
<i>Once you learn Eternal Darkness today, it'll be deeply embedded in your body. And it'll automatically run in it.</i>

254
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,700
<i>When you reach a profound level of this cultivation over time,</i>

255
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,600
<i>there's no one in the world that can handle your Asura divine power.</i>

256
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:38,600
<i>Wait until the Asura Clan rules the Three Realms, your late father will be pleased with that.</i>

257
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,900
- I don't want to go.
- Come on.

258
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,200
Come on. Listen to me.

259
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,500
Let's go.

260
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,800
How about this? Here. You take this.

261
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,900
You go.

262
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,500
No.

263
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,300
Thanks to Tang Zhou. Or else Father wouldn't agree to our marriage.

264
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:08,800
No matter what, we have to send the wedding cake to him in person as a token of appreciation. Let's go.

265
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,200
Forget about it.

266
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,200
Tortoise.

267
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,400
Be honest with me.

268
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,000
Do you have a history with him?

269
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Or else why would you say it makes you feel sick when you see him?

270
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,800
I don't.

271
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:27,200
I don't know why I'll feel sick when I see him.

272
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,200
Speaking of which, we, divine tortoises, don't have a natural enemy.

273
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,200
Right?

274
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,400
Then, let's go.

275
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,000
No.

276
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,400
Be nice to him.

277
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,500
Tang Zhou.

278
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,500
It's him.

279
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,700
- It was actually him.
- Who?

280
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,800
Again?

281
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,400
Tortoise!

282
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,800
Tortoise! Tortoise!

283
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,100
I found you.

284
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,600
Come on out.

285
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,800
What's the matter?

286
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,800
Is it because you don't want to marry me anymore?

287
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,300
No. It's because...

288
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,400
It's because...

289
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:08,800
"Kill all those in the world who flip tortoises."

290
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,200
What does it mean?

291
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,400
Fine. I'll tell you.

292
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:24,400
Actually... before I managed to turn into human form, I was just an ordinary little tortoise.

293
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,200
But when I was in heaven, there was a deity who would always come and flip me over.

294
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,400
I was flipped over every which way.

295
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,600
Again and again.

296
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,500
He flipped me over every single day.

297
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,800
In heaven, there was never a day where I wasn't dizzy or felt like throwing up.

298
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:44,200
The person who flipped me... is Tang Zhou!

299
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,000
No wonder. Every time I see him I feel like throwing up.

300
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,100
Why are you laughing so merrily?

301
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,500
Do you think it's embarrassing?

302
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,500
Don't want to marry me anymore?

303
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,600
It's all the more reason for me to marry you.

304
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,200
So then I can protect you in the future.

305
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,600
No one will dare flip you over again.

306
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,900
Only I can flip you over.

307
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,500
Why do you have a needle and thread that mortals use?

308
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,000
You're not trying to learn from the hedgehogs are you?

309
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And stick needles in your tortoiseshell so that way no one will dare flip you over again?

310
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,000
This... is a wedding gift I prepared for you.

311
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,000
How about this? Close your eyes.

312
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,400
What is it?

313
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,800
Why are you being secretive?

314
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,400
Open your eyes.

315
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,000
That day, when we were trapped in the cave,

316
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:26,100
I watched them cut off your tail, but I couldn't do anything about it.

317
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,800
Now, I've made one for you.

318
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,400
At least... it makes up for it a tiny, little bit.

319
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,000
Where... did you find this?

320
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,700
Stop asking so many questions.

321
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,700
Just tell me if you like it or not.

322
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,800
The bones inside this fox tail...

323
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,200
Where is your tail?

324
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,700
Where is your tail? Where did it go?

325
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,800
Are you a fool?

326
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,200
Where did it go? I don't want you to do this for me!

327
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,400
Where is your tail?

328
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:39,200
Either way, I won't reveal my true form in front of mortals.

329
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,000
With or without a tail, it makes no difference.

330
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,900
It's just a few vertebrae. It's okay.

331
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,400
I still have my shell.

332
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,100
I'll be fine even if there are a few bones missing.

333
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,200
Look at this.

334
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,400
I know that you like pretty things.

335
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,000
The bones don't look good in its original form.

336
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,800
So I learned the way the mortals do it.

337
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,800
I knitted each piece onto it.

338
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,600
Don't worry.

339
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,800
After we get married, I'll practice diligently.

340
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:17,000
I promise... no one can bully you again in the future.

341
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,200
I believe you.

342
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,300
But... isn't our wedding tomorrow?

343
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,700
I became your bride a long time ago.

344
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,600
I can't wait until tomorrow.

345
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,400
Just leave the wedding planning to me.

346
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,800
With your condition, instead of soaking in the hot spring you had to insist on coming here.

347
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,200
Are you worried?

348
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,200
My body is just fine.

349
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,000
And I'm not worried.

350
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I just wanted to come here with you

351
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,200
to see what a wedding looks like and understand what the process is.

352
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,800
The process is complicated.

353
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,700
To get the bride out of the sedan chair, the groom has to shoot arrows. Then, cross the saddle.

354
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,200
They have to get married and swear an oath.

355
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,600
They also have to propose a toast.

356
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,500
In the end, they have to tie their discarded hair together and thank the matchmaker.

357
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,000
That complicated?

358
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,600
What if something goes wrong?

359
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,200
This is a good question.

360
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,400
If I make a mistake, my guess is the Leader of the Fox Clan will beat me to death in public.

361
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,300
How about this then?

362
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,200
Let's have a rehearsal.

363
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,600
After we're familiar with the process, we can still save the situation even if something goes wrong.

364
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,400
Yan Dan. This is the only time I've ever acted as an officiant.

365
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,400
I hope that nothing will go wrong.

366
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,000
But the procedures are really complicated and long.

367
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I worry that if you're away from the hot springs for too long your body won't be able to handle it.

368
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,600
Isn't it nice that it'll take a long time?

369
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,100
What?

370
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,300
Nothing.

371
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,900
I'll manage. Don't worry.

372
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,800
Yan Dan, don't you like acting?

373
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,200
You claim yourself to be the top actress in Yelan Mountain.

374
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,100
What now? Are you afraid of embarrassing yourself now?

375
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,900
The groom shoots three arrows to remove all the bad luck!

376
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,100
Be careful. Don't hit me!

377
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,900
Play your role. Focus.

Groom, please lift up the bride's veil!

Next is all your part.

410
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,940
My part?

411
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,920
According to rites, the groom and the bride have to thank the matchmaker.

412
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,200
But they don't have one, so they can only thank you.

413
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,320
Moreover, you've got to give them a gift in return.

414
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,740
Have you thought about what gift to give yet?

415
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,900
Lin Lang likes things that are flashy.

416
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,720
Zi Lin likes things that are fun.

417
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,540
I've already thought of it.

418
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:13,540
It turns out that being with someone you like is such a happy thing.

419
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,300
Bride and Groom, please thank the matchmaker.

420
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,880
There you go again. Don't move, don't move.

421
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,780
What's wrong with Zi Lin?

422
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,820
He always feels nauseous and wants to throw up. He'll feel better after covering up his head.

423
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,460
Yes, yes. That's right.

424
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,300
Why do you keep hiccupping non-stop?

425
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,340
Young Master Tang, thank you for making this happen.

426
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,000
<i>Bow to him.</i>

427
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:59,600
May you always be of one heart and never doubt your love.

428
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,220
Young Master Tang, please give them your gift in return.

429
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,300
As for my gift, it can't fit in the Mountain Chief's Hall.

430
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,780
Please, everyone, follow me outside of the hall.

431
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,020
What is Mountain Chief going to give them?

432
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,660
A kun?

433
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,440
Why would you...

434
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,240
I've been dreaming of this mythological beast all the time lately.

435

It later became a painful memory.

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,940
<i>He's using a lot of divine power, he's trying to blow himself up.</i>

461
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,900
Tang Zhou, don't be a fool!

462
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,660
Hurry, get down here!

463
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,080
It's such a lovely night.

464
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,920
It's a good view to enjoy at night.

465
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:39,120
Mountain Chief, don't be so petty.

466
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,560
Tang Zhou, Yu Mo is right.

467
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,260
Your celestial vest is damaged to begin with.

468
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,780
Doing this will consume more of your divine power.

469
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:50,000
Hurry, let's go back down.

470
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,460
Just let me be stubborn this one time.

471
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,540
Yan Dan...

472
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,120
have you ever had feelings for me?

473
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:10,420
♫ <i> I followed you across the endless seas reluctant to leave you </i> ♫

474
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,080
I can't.

475
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,760
Very well.

476
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:20,120
That way, if I die, you won't feel that sad.

477
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,260
I won't let you die.

478
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:31,180
Yan Dan, if I survive through the seven days and that mysterious man breaks the Shared-Fate Spell

479
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:35,040
and comes after me again, how am I going to protect you?

480
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,060
I'm not afraid of dying.

481
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:42,320
I just... can't accept the worst-case scenario.

482
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,200
He'll hurt you in front of me.

485

Yan Dan, I wish so much that you could've meet me first

486
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,260
and have fallen in love with me first.

487
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,380
It'd be nice if there was an afterlife.

488
