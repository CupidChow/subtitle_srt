How could you do all these foolish things without letting us know?

17
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,600
You ripped out your heart and then got struck by thunder.

18
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,300

<i>In the end, you still did such a foolish thing.</i>

Where is Yan Dan?

23
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,800
Yan Dan's location remains unknown at the moment.

24
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,600
Your Majesty, Fairy Zhi Xi from the Magical Pavilion used half of her Lotus Heart to cure your fire poison.

25
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Fairy Zhi Xi stole the Fuxuan Cauldron in order to save you.

26
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,400
She's being punished at the Heavenly Gallows right now.

27
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,500
Your Majesty, do you want to go and have a look?

28
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,000
Your Majesty.

29
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,600
You have finally recovered.

30
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,500
<i>If I had put more effort into my cultivation, I'd have been able to shape-shift in the day earlier.</i>

31
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,400
<i>You wouldn't have had to rip out your heart alone.</i>

32
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,700
<i>I wouldn't have let the heavenly soldiers take you to the Heavenly Gallows either.</i>

33
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,900
<i>If anything happens to you, I will never be able to forgive myself.</i>

34
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,200
- Yan Dan.
- Are you awake?

35
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,700
Yan Dan!

36
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,000
Little Black Fish.

37
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,900
It's my first time seeing you during the day.

38
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,600
Do you know that you almost died at the Heavenly Gallows with only half of your heart?

39
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,500
We're friends! How could you rip out your heart without telling me first?

40
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,000
Who are we to you?

41
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,900
You found out about everything already?

42
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,600
Don't worry.

43
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,400
As offspring of the ancient bloodline, we don't die so easily.

44
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,000
We're quite incredible.

45
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Look.

46
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I only have half of my heart left,

47
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,700
yet I can still lie here and enjoy your attentive care.

48
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,000
What's there to be proud of?!

49
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,200
When Yu Mo brought you back earlier,

50
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,300
do you know how horrendous you looked?

51
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,000
Don't do such a dangerous thing again!

52
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,400
All right, Mother. You're nagging just like one.

53
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
I'll go make you some soup.

54
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,800
All right. All right.

55
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,800
From now on, I'll bring you along wherever I go.

56
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,600
How about that?

57
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,200
You Little Black Fish.

58
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,400
I fed you for more than a century and raised you myself.

59
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,100
How could I die before I exploit you and make you look after me for the rest of my life?

60
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,900
For the sake of me, your "nagging mother", stop being angry. Okay?

61
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,700
What do you mean, "Mother"?

62
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,400
Then tell me. Why did you take the blame for Zhi Xi?

63
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,700
My sister let me use the divine without permission for my sake.

64
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,000
I couldn't let her take the punishment for me.

65
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,199
What about Emperor Ying Yuan? Is he all right?

66
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,800
Where is he?

67
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
He has returned to Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

68
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,200
That's great.

69
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,800
I want to go see him.

70
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,100
<i>Her immortal spirit is impaired, and her pulse is abnormal.</i>

71
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,400
<i>It seems like you've ripped out your heart and got struck by thunder as punishment.</i>

72
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,900
<i>But even if all evidence points to you, my heart tells me that it wasn't you.</i>

73
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,900
Zhi Xi, are you the one who saved me?

74
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,500
It was me.

75
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,500
For Your Majesty's sake, I am willing to do anything.

76
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,600
Why does your voice sound different then?

77
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,200
When we first met in the Land Under the Horizon,

78
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:27,700
I knew that Your Majesty didn't want anyone to witness your embarrassing condition.

79
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,800
I was afraid that my voice would expose me.

80
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,100
So I cast a spell to change it.

81
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,700
Your Majesty.

82
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,000
Are you upset because I purposely hid my identity

83
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,800
and ripped out my heart to save you without your permission?

84
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:54,400
I just can't bear... I can't bear to see Your Majesty's spirit disappear.

85
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,800
Although this Distance-Keeping Bracelet was broken,

86
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,800
it was a gift from you.

87
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,900
So I fixed it...

88
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,100
and wear it all the time.

89
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,700
<i>She has the Distance-Keeping Bracelet and knows about the things between Yan Dan and me.</i>

90
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,400
<i>Is this Yan Dan's wish? Did they do this on purpose?</i>

91
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,000
<i>Or is Zhi Xi trying to steal Yan Dan's identity?</i>

92
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,820
<i>[Xuanxin Cliff]</i>

93
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,800
Did you say your name was Yu Mo?

94
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,200
Yes.

95
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Are you the black fish that Immortal Lord Bei Ming kept in the lotus pond?

96
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,700
That's right.

97
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,800
Ao Xuan told me that you hit him for no reason.

98
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,500
Do you admit to it?

99
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,200
Yes, I hit him. I'm willing to take responsibility for my actions.

100
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:32,500
Since you're willing to take responsibility, take three slaps from me and ground yourself to reflect on your mistakes!

101
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,200
- Go ahead.
- Marshal, there's something wrong with him!

102
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,800
How can you let him go just like that?

103
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,900
Ao Xuan!

104
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,500
When I fought him, I realized that he has tremendous spiritual power. He's no ordinary man.

105
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,000
Moreover, he can shape-shift.

106
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,100
If he can shape-shift, why hasn't anyone seen him at Xuanxin Cliff before?

107
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,600
I suspect that he's a spy from the Devil Clan. He's hiding his identity!

108
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,300
Ao Xuan!

109
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,400
Why didn't you inform me about your ability to shape-shift?

110
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,900
Since you asked, I'll be honest with you.

111
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:09,700
Immortal Attendant Yan Dan of Xuanxin Cliff accidentally threw Ao Xuan into the pond and hit me.

112
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,500
That hit was serious.

113
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,600
I couldn't shape-shift back into human form because of that.

114
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
You also know

115
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,900
that was the most critical period for me to shape-shift.

116
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:24,200
So... I couldn't shape-shift and felt ashamed.

117
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,300
So I didn't report it to you. I was wrong here.

118
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,900
However, if you don't believe me, you can ask Immortal Attendant Shi Yun.

119
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:36,600
If you still don't believe me, he looked after Ao Xuan with Immortal Attendant Yan Dan previously.

120
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,020
Ao Xuan, did you hit him before?

121
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,020
I think that might have happened...

122
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,439
- But I—
- Oh, I see. I know Yan Dan.

123
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:54,939
- Forget about hitting you. She even dares to hit the Dragon King!
- Yes, that's right.

124
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:59,280
If that's true, you almost ruined his cultivation,

125
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,679
because of that, he hit you. That's reasonable!

126
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:04,800
He's making excuses!

127
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,759
I'm the Dragon Prince of the East Sea. I hold the divine power of the Dragon Clan.

128
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:15,079
If he's just a normal black fish, how could he shape-shift before I did?

129
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:19,059
Aside from our Aquatic Clan, there are other spiritual beasts at Xuanxin Cliff.

130
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:21,859
According to your logic, everybody is a spy from the Devil Clan!

131
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,379
Why are you also taking his side?

132
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,660
Because you were in the wrong first!

133
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,159
Even though he isn't a Devil Clan spy, there's something fishy about his identity!

134
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,580
You...

135
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,759
Just wait. One day, I'll surely expose your true colors!

136
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,720
That's enough! This is Xuanxin Cliff!

137
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,080
You shouldn't quarrel here.

138
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,160
The two of you fought, but

139
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,139
you aren't repenting and disturbed my sleep!

140
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:57,439
All of you shall take three strikes from me and then go back to reflect on yourselves!

141
00:12:57,439 --> 00:12:59,320
I accept the punishment.

142
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,300
Yes.

143
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,660
Will I also...

144
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,459
What's wrong? Do you want to take a strike too?

145
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,799
- Yes.
- Get lost!

146
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,179
Zhi Xi and His Majesty look so good sitting together!

147
00:13:47,179 --> 00:13:49,979
- They look like a couple from a painting.
- That's right.

148
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:53,070
To save His Majesty, not only did she rip out half of her heart,

149
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,120
but she also withstood nine strikes of thunder. It's just so touching.

150
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,830
She'll certainly stay at Yanxu Heavenly Palace, won't she?

151
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:06,230
Although Zhi Xi is sincere toward His Majesty, the Heavenly Palace forbids romantic relationships.

152
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,640
What a shame.

153
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,739
Excuse me, Fairy. I have a question.

154
00:14:14,739 --> 00:14:22,500
Did you just say that Zhi Xi ripped out half of her heart for His Majesty?

155
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,360
<i>That's right.</i>

156
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,610
Yan Dan, your sister is really too kind.

157
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:30,350
The whole palace is grateful for her deeds.

158
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,720
It's a shame that I'm not good at using immortal power.

159
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:27,800
I couldn't repair all the cracks.

160
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:34,640
Do you have any methods to restore the Distance-Keeping Bracelet back to its original state, Your Majesty?

161
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:52,040
Back in the hut, you wouldn't address me as "Your Majesty".

162
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,260
Back then, Your Majesty was unaware of my identity.

163
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,300
There was no one around either.

164
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,840
So I didn't think much about our titles.

165
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,320
Now that Your Majesty has returned to your position,

166
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,040
I dare not cross the line.

167
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,560
Your Majesty.

168
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,010
Immortal Attendant Qing Yun is keeping an eye on us outside.

169
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:26,540
Do you really want me to address you as a villain?

170
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,040
Oh right...

171
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:40,320
Curator Ying Deng is very upset about the theft of the Fuxuan Cauldron.

172
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,680
Can you take me in for some time?

173
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,020
After I recover from my injuries, I will return and take the punishment.

174
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,780
His Supreme Majesty was informed of Your Majesty's recovery and return.

175
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:01,639
He sent someone to gift this Snow Lingzhi to Your Majesty, to aid your recovery.
<i>(T/N "lingzhi" - divine mushroom)</i>

176
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:05,700
His Supreme Majesty is currently busy, so he will visit Your Majesty later.

177
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,059
<i>[Registration Book]</i>

178
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,320
This immortal herb is said to be a tribute from the Dragon Clan.

179
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,539
It works wonders for nourishing one's immortal spirit.

180
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:15,720
Fairy Zhi Xi... ripped out her heart and got struck by thunder too.

181
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,050
Do you want to gift this to Fairy Zhi Xi?

182
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,859
Many Divine Officials were injured in the Divine-Devil War.

183
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:33,630
His Supreme Majesty organized an extra ascension examination.

184
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,059
This is the registration book for Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

185
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:41,179
I've selected a few potential immortal attendants with strong immortal power to take part in the exam.

186
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:45,050
Yan Dan is Fairy Zhi Xi's sister. I've registered her name as well.

187
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,070
Please have a look, Your Majesty.

188
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,840
Your Majesty.

189
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,660
What has Yan Dan been doing recently?

190
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,580
It's actually a little strange. I haven't see her recently.

191
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,960
She must have neglected her job and snuck out to play.

192
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,680
Are you...

193
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,040
back from traveling?

194
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:13,240
Qing Yun told me... that you haven't been in the palace recently.

195
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,800
Where have you been?

196
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,220
I'm just a low-level immortal attendant.

197
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:26,460
How could I bother Your Majesty with my whereabouts?

198
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,460
How did you get hurt?

199
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:47,740
Did you do something foolish to help someone else and hurt yourself again?

200
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,559
Immortal Lord Bei Ming was badly injured when he returned from the war.

201
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:00,059
His immortal spirit was dissipating. He wasn't in his right mind.

202
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:06,640
I channeled my Power of the Lotus into his meridians to reduce his pain.

203
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,200
I helped him regain consciousness temporarily when he was dying, that's all.

204
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:20,060
Immortal Lord Bei Ming devoted his whole life to the Heavenly Court.

205
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,440
His merits are immeasurable.

206
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,800
All beings of the Heavenly Realm will forever remember his sacrifice.

207
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,800
You keep your old master in your heart.

208
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,840
All this while...

209
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:48,740
When I disappeared for several months, did you look for me?

210
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:56,980
Now that I have returned, are you happy?

211
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,639
They all said that you were traveling. Why would I look for you?

212
00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:05,170
Besides, your absence is a good thing for me.

213
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,490
No one tortures me anymore.

214
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:12,439
I hoped you'd never return, so I'd get to enjoy my freedom more.

215
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,260
Is that true?

216
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:22,660
Look at yourself in the mirror. See what you look like right now.

217
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,560
Do you look happy and untroubled?

218
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,200
I'm not blind.

219
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,680
I can see that you're different now.

220
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,920
Where has that carefree...

221
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,480
and daring Yan Dan gone?

222
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,360
That's right.

223
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:50,860
After the Divine-Devil War, the Heavenly Realm suffered great losses.

224
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,000
Immortal Lord Bei Ming died right in front of my eyes.

225
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,560
How could I still be the same as before?

226
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:05,360
Yan Dan, the war is over now.

227
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,340
The Three Realms are at peace.

228
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:11,219
We should carry their hopes onward and live good lives.

229
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:16,080
That way... We can live up to those who sacrificed themselves.

230
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:21,900
When I named you, I said this.

231
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,630
"Happiness and sadness are cultivations in life."

232
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:29,020
"Life and death, sorrow and pain."

233
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:32,680
"It's all part of cultivation."

234
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,980
I understand.

235
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:42,600
As immortals, starting at birth, we have to cultivate.

236
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,120
No matter how difficult it is, we must endure it.

237
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,420
I could return safely...

238
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,070
because someone ripped out her heart to save me.

239
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:07,300
Zhi Xi tells you everything. Did she tell you about this?

240
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,140
No.

241
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,360
Sister... Sister has always admired you.

242
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,919
When she knew that you were injured for the sake of the Three Realms,

243
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,400
she saved you without telling any of us about it.

244
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,600
I only found out about it today.

245
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,700
Zhi Xi must be badly injured right now.

246
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,500
You should hurry back and look after her.

247
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,600
I won't see you out.

248
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,200
Please leave.

249
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:46,500
<i>Seeing your reaction, I'm afraid Zhi Xi really took your place and didn't tell you about it.</i>

250
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,400
<i>You're kind and innocent,</i>

251
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,000
<i>and you care about the bond between sisters.</i>

252
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,800
<i>You can't bear to expose her lies and ruin her cultivation.</i>

253
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,300
<i>In that case, I shall make her confess her deeds and give you justice.
[Daxuandan Scriptures]</i>

254
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,000
The ascension examination will take place soon.

255
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,100
Your name is on the list.

256
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:17,300
Now that I'm back, I shall monitor your cultivation strictly.

257
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,700
I hope...

258
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,800
you won't bring shame to Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

259
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,200
I'm just a useless fairy.

260
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,200
I don't care about divinity or divine arts.

261
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,200
I don't want any of that.

262
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,000
Tell me this, then.

263
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,600
What do you want?

264
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,400
Yan Dan.

265
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,600
Your Majesty.

266
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,100
Aren't you injured? You should be resting.

267
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,200
Before, I always worked at the Magical Pavilion.

268
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,200
I seldom got to see my sister.

269
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,800
Since I'm in Yanxu Heavenly Palace now, I'd like to spend more time with Yan Dan.

270
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,300
I have something to discuss with her. Please leave first.

271
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,700
There's no need, Your Majesty.

272
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,500
I told you already. I won't attend the ascension examination.

273
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,800
If Your Majesty has no other business, please leave.

274
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,200
Why?

275
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,500
Why did you do that to me?

276
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,100
Yan Dan.

277
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,400
I'm sorry.

278
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:08,200
Actually, you're not the only one who was hanging on by a thread today.

279
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,200
I was too.

280
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:16,800
Ying Deng found out long ago that we had stolen the Fuxuan Cauldron.

281
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,300
She wanted to report it to His Supreme Majesty.

282
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:24,200
No matter how I begged her, it was useless.

283
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:29,300
I tried to stop her but was hurt by the Heart-Piercing Drum.

284
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,400
I struggled to escape.

285
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,300
I could only ask for help at Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

286
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,700
But who knew?

287
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:44,700
When I was unconscious, His Majesty mistook me for you.

288
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,600
When I regained consciousness, I wanted to explain at once.

289
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:53,000
But I was suddenly... suddenly afraid.

290
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:01,500
As long as I'm in Magical Pavilion, Ying Deng will think of ways to torture and harm me.

291
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,600
Would I be lucky enough to escape the next time?

292
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:11,200
I got the chance to transfer from Magical Pavilion only as His Majesty's savior.

293
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,400
I'm only doing this to survive.

294
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,500
Yan Dan, I really am sorry.

295
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,900
Please don't blame me.

296
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,800
Turns out that he got the wrong person.

297
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,900
Sister, don't be a fool.

298
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:44,500
If someone were to find out about your feelings, you'll have to go through a love trial.

299
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:49,000
Don't you know how Fairy Si Xuan died?

300
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,300
I don't want to watch you die for this.

301
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:59,600
<i>One day, if I fall in love with someone, but I don't hurt anyone and do nothing wrong...</i>

302
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,200
<i>would you kill me?</i>

303
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,300
<i>I would kill you.</i>

304
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,600
I hold no personal feelings toward His Majesty.

305
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,700
But you're different.

306
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,200
I can't watch you walk towards your doom.

307
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,400
I hope that you can let go of this obsession that you aren't supposed to have.

308
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,800
You must remember.

309
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,800
Immortals can't fall in love with each other.

310
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,800
You mustn't disobey the Heavenly Rules.

311
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,200
I know.

312
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,200
He's the Emperor.

313
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:40,600
He takes the Heavenly Rules of the Nine Heavens the most seriously.

314
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:46,100
He said it before too. "Immortals must never fall in love."

315
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,900
Since he got the wrong person...

316
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,200
just let it be.

317
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,300
I'll treat it as a dream, that's all.

318
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,500
If you can think like that... then I don't have to worry.

319
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:15,000
Yan Dan, we're connected by blood.

320
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,400
In this vast Heavenly Court, we can only rely on each other.

321
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,000
At the Jade Pool Festival, I was wrong.

322
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,400
I know that you did it for my own good.

323
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,000
Today, I'm also doing this for your own good.

324
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,900
I hope we can still be the same as before. Okay?

325
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,000
<i>[Yanxu Heavenly Palace]</i>

326
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,300
Curator Ying Deng.

327
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:01,800
What brings you to the Yanxu Heavenly Palace at this hour?

328
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,600
I heard that Fairy Zhi Xi was badly injured while saving His Majesty.

329
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:11,000
Since she's the Deputy Curator of Magical Pavilion, I'm here to visit her.

330
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,300
Fairy Zhi Xi's room is over there.

331
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,500
I have other matters to attend to. I cannot escort you there.

332
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,000
Hold on.

333
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,400
This liuli box looks delicate and translucent.
<i>(T/N: "liuli" - ancient Chinese name for colored glass)</i>

334
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,600
May I know what's inside?

335
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,700
His Majesty knew that Fairy Yan Dan was injured.

336
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,800
So he sent me to give her this Snow Lingzhi from His Supreme Majesty.

337
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,600
This is Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

338
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,800
There are soldiers everywhere.

339
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,900
If you attack me here, they won't let you go.

340
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
You and I have no grievances with each other.

341
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,500
Why would I attack you?

342
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,000
Then why are you here?

343
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I'm here to visit you, my Deputy Curator of the Magical Pavilion.

344
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,900
What's inappropriate about that?

345
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:39,100
You really have made yourself into Emperor Ying Yuan's savior.

346
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:44,000
If His Majesty finds out you're pretending to be someone else,

347
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,400
I wonder what the punishment would be.

348
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,800
The Heavenly Rules state that immortals mustn't fall in love.

349
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,800
It is impossible for His Majesty to fall in love with anyone.

350
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,300
Why do you constantly have to target me?

351
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,200
I won't tell His Majesty about this.

352
00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:01,800
I'm just here to remind you that I'm not the only one who's aware of the truth.

353
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,400
The person you should be wary of and fear most

354
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,600
is your biological sister, Yan Dan.

355
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,900
Back then, the heavenly soldiers arrested her in the Land Under the Horizon using your name.

356
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:24,700
She cares for you. So she admitted her guilt on the spot.

357
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:29,600
While you're here, taking her place.

358
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,400
Tell me.

359
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,800
Will she really not hate you because of this?

360
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,200
As long as Yan Dan is in Yanxu Heavenly Palace...

361
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,000
You will always live in fear.

362
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,900
She spends a lot of time with His Majesty.

363
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:58,600
One day, if His Majesty finds out about the truth...

364
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,500
Not only will you endure thunder strikes, but your reputation will be ruined.

365
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:11,000
You'll have no place to stand in the Nine Heavens.

366
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,200
When that time comes, no one will be able to save you.

367
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:21,500
You're only telling me this because you're worried that His Majesty will fall in love with Yan Dan.

368
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:26,800
As a divine spirit, you'd need a long time to cultivate your immortal spirit.

369
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,300
So you attempted to seduce His Majesty...

370
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:33,700
because he is the only being in the Heavenly Realm who can transform you into an immortal spirit.

371
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,600
Nonsense!

372
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,200
His Majesty is just and upright.

373
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,500
Even if it's the most important person to him, he won't make any exceptions.

374
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,800
You served in Yanxu Heavenly Palace for a century,

375
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,000
yet you still got kicked out in the end.

376
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
That means your evil scheme didn't work.

377
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,800
So you're jealous of Yan Dan.

378
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:58,000
You want to eradicate all obstacles that would hinder your immortal cultivation.

379
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,200
What about you, then?

380
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,400
You took such great pains to approach His Majesty.

381
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,100
Is it really just out of admiration?

382
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:17,600
Did you know that His Majesty already knows that Yan Dan was injured?

383
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,400
He gave her the Snow Lingzhi from His Supreme Majesty.

384
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:26,600
I wonder what explanation your sister gave for her injury...

385
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:35,799
Oh, I also heard that she's on the list for the ascension examination.

386
00:34:35,799 --> 00:34:41,780
In no time, everyone will only know Yan Dan

387
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,200
and forget about Zhi Xi.

388
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:52,120
There's no turning back once the arrow's been released.

389
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,940
Your only choice is to kill Yan Dan...

390
00:34:55,540 --> 00:35:00,040
to avoid potential problems forever.

391
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:25,560
Your Majesty, His Supreme Majesty is here to visit you. He is waiting in your study.

392
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:53,240
No. I must stop thinking about him.

393
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:06,020
<i>To save me, Yu Mo used up a lot of immortal power.</i>

394
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,750
<i>The Snow Lingzhi is so precious. </i>

395
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:11,530
<i>If it can nourish his immortal spirit, it'll serve its purpose.</i>

396
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:24,520
Ying Yuan, you were able to come back and recover so well.

397
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,950
looks like I worried unnecessarily.

398
00:36:27,959 --> 00:36:29,560
Your Supreme Majesty.

399
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:33,120
Before, I felt so guilty. I just left.

400
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,620
I was disloyal and ungrateful.

401
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,880
I apologize for making you worry, Your Supreme Majesty.

402
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:42,620
You were badly injured and were staying in the Land Under the Horizon.

403
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,700
I didn't send anyone to look for you.

404
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,670
You don't hate me for that, do you?

405
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,920
I dare not.

406
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,680
The Divine-Devil War...

407
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,160
was tragic.

408
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:10,800
I'm the one who failed to fulfill my responsibilities.

409
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,300
I feel so ashamed.

410
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:19,460
I only wanted to be somewhere quiet to reflect and meditate.

411
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:24,799
The war was tragic. The other Emperors perished.

412
00:37:24,799 --> 00:37:30,299
Now you're the only Emperor left in the Nine Heavens.

413
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:35,839
No one can predict whether the Devil Clan will strike again in the future.

414
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:42,480
Ying Yuan, I hope you can understand your responsibility.

415
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,480
Please don't leave recklessly again.

416
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,940
I understand.

417
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:02,000
I will not disappoint you, Your Supreme Majesty.

418
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,400
I will always stand and fight

419
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,180
with all beings of the Heavenly Court.

420
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,700
Little Black Fish.

421
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,799
Yan Dan! Why are you here?

422
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,880
I know you used up a lot of your spiritual power for me.

423
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,060
I brought you a supper that will nourish your immortal spirit.

424
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,690
Eat up.

425
00:38:55,580 --> 00:39:01,060
Yan Dan. You're badly injured, yet you still made me supper.

426
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,879
Are you doing okay? How's your injury? Does it still hurt?

427
00:39:03,879 --> 00:39:07,050
I'm okay. Look. I'm doing just fine.

428
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,820
Don't worry.

429
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,180
I ran into Shi Yun at the entrance just now.

430
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,040
He said that the Marshal punished you.

431
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,950
What happened?

432
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:20,440
When I was rushing to the Heavenly Gallows,

433
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,360
I accidentally bumped into two members from the Dragon Clan who had just shape-shifted.

434
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,980
One of them, Ao Xuan, was upset that I shape-shifted before he did.

435
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,100
So we got into a fight.

436
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:33,220
They even told Marshal Huo De about it.

437
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,500
They didn't find out about your identity, did they?

438
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,559
Don't worry. I'm smart enough!

439
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:42,339
I pretended to be a little black fish and used your identity to deceive them.

440
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:44,280
They won't find out.

441
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,740
All right, then.

442
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:51,059
If anything were to happen to you, I'd feel guilty, as your friend.

443
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:54,699
What are you saying? This has nothing to do with you.

444
00:39:54,699 --> 00:39:58,000
If you say such things again, I'll really be upset.

445
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,080
It's delicious.

446
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,739
Look what's under it.

447
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,519
- Is there more?
- Open it.

448
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:15,539
This is Snow Lingzhi. You can use it to help replenish your body.

449
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:19,620
Back then, we needed to steal our supper.

450
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:25,339
Now you're so generous, giving me such a precious immortal herb.

451
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,560
You saved Emperor Ying Yuan.

452
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:32,340
He must be very moved and treating you well. Right?

453
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,980
He doesn't know that I'm the one who saved him.

454
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,040
He thought it was Zhi Xi who saved him.

455
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,660
Didn't you explain it to him?

456
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:48,960
To help me, Zhi Xi stole a divine tool. It's a serious offense.

457
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,290
Ying Deng will stop making her life difficult only if she poses as Emperor Ying Yuan's savior.

458
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:57,080
This was Zhi Xi's idea, wasn't it?

459
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,220
No.

460
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:02,700
That's impossible. Stop covering up for her.

461
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,100
Zhi Xi has always wanted to ascend.

462
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:10,530
Now she claims she's the one who saved Emperor Ying Yuan. It's the perfect chance.

463
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,339
She's doing this on purpose. She's lying.

464
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:16,280
It's not like that.

465
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:19,200
She did this for my sake.

466
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,910
She's doing all this because she's afraid I might...

467
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:30,319
Anyway, we grew up together. She's always taken care of me.

468
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,220
I owe her too much.

469
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:36,310
Even if your assumptions are all true, I'll consider it as me repaying her.

470
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:38,180
You only remember how well she treated you.

471
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,960
But does she think about when you've treated her well?

472
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,540
Yan Dan. We've only just met.

473
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:48,999
Yet, you treat me so sincerely.

474
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:57,060
While Zhi Xi is the most important person in your life, she's also the one who hurt you the most.

475
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,860
Yan Dan, she doesn't deserve your kindness.

476
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,940
Stop talking.

477
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,299
There's another reason why I didn't explain this to Emperor Ying Yuan.

478
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,900
What reason?

479
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,460
He broke his promise.

480
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,800
He didn't recognize me.

481
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,000
- This—
<i>- Brother Yu Mo!</i>

482
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,180
Brother Yu Mo!

483
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,400
Why are you here?

484
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,780
Brother Yu Mo, you have a guest?

485
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,340
Who is this cutie pie?

486
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:36,019
Why haven't I seen her at Xuanxin Cliff before?

487
00:42:36,019 --> 00:42:37,699
Where did you come from little fairy?

488
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,979
I'm the Princess of the South Sea Dragon Clan. My name is Zhao Lan.

489
00:42:40,979 --> 00:42:44,139
No wonder! You have two cute little horns!

490
00:42:44,139 --> 00:42:46,620
So you were that little azure dragon.

491
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,819
Do we know each other?

492
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:52,880
Of course, I know you! My name is Yan Dan. I'm an immortal attendant in Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

493
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,670
I'm also Yu Mo's friend.

494
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:58,750
When I was at Xuanxin Cliff, I even fed you. Don't you remember?

495
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,830
It's you!

496
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:05,560
Since you're Brother Yu Mo's friend, you're my friend too, from now on.

497
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,459
How can you make friends so easily?

498
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:12,099
Well, I don't mind having a sister-in-law.

499
00:43:12,099 --> 00:43:15,050
You can't simply take her as your sister-in-law!

500
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,400
It's not what you think it is.

501
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,100
<i>[Wenshui Pavilion]</i>

502
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:21,470
I've been looking for you everywhere. And here you are, with this suspicious guy.

503
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:25,699
Here comes another one. Xuanxin Cliff is really lively today.

504
00:43:25,699 --> 00:43:26,819
And who are you?

505
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,560
Me? I—

506
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,579
She's my friend. It's none of your business.

507
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,679
Judging from her outfit, she's just an immortal attendant.

508
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:40,479
Zhao Lan, our Dragon Clan rules the Four Seas.

509
00:43:40,479 --> 00:43:43,819
Making friends with such lowly immortal attendants depreciates our status.

510
00:43:43,819 --> 00:43:48,550
What are you saying? We're all immortal beings. There is no distinction between high or low statuses.

511
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:52,130
If you have no other business, just leave. Don't disturb our conversation.

512
00:43:52,139 --> 00:43:54,260
Who said I didn't have any business?

513
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:57,439
That day, you attacked me with Zhao Lan's Heartseeker Bell. It was an unfair match.

514
00:43:57,439 --> 00:44:00,120
- Do you dare battle against me again, fair and square?
- Ao Xuan!

515
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,779
My best friend is here to visit me. It's not a good time to have a battle.

516
00:44:03,779 --> 00:44:05,880
Are you afraid?

517
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:10,619
Are you afraid that you can't defeat me? Or are you afraid that I might expose your identity?

518
