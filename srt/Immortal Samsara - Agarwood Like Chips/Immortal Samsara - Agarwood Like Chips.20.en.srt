The best so far from Lovely Theatre Troupe, I dare say.

Greetings, Curator of Magical Pavilion.

I'm here to see her off.

00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,940
Can you give us some privacy?

41
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:03,620
You planned everything for this day, so you could rise in the ranks.

42
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:09,320
How cunning of you.

43
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,420
The truth regarding the collusion of the heavenly registry official with other parties,

44
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,500
as well as his forgery of Night Forgetting River's registry, which has been made public.

45
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,300
He will receive forty-nine thunder strikes.

46
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,480
Before his title was revoked,

47
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:27,300
the last amendment he made to the heavenly record concerns your future.

48
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,340
The Pool of Eight Hardships.

49
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:37,340
If the water is clear, it means you can exercise your meditation mind as punishment.

50
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:42,740
If the water is murky, your immortal body will be destroyed, and you will be demoted to a mortal.

51
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:49,320
His Supreme Majesty decided that your divine status will be revoked, and your memory erased.

52
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,380
You will be demoted to Mortal Realm. You will never be a deity again.

53
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,020
His Majesty is just down there to go through the mortal trials. He will return one day.

54
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,500
But you?

55
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,080
You can never come back.

56
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,580
You'll go through the pain of being a mortal in Mortal Realm.

57
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,280
I accept my defeat.

58
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,040
Just do whatever you want.

59
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,160
I regret nothing.

60
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,880
However much I punish you now,

61
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,760
Yan Dan...

62
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,600
will never come back.

63
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,080
What did you make me swallow?

64
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,980
Memory-Retaining Pill.

65
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:00,220
I want you to remember you were once a fairy, so that you'll live with shame in the Mortal Realm.

66
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:09,260
I'm sure, for the pretentious Fairy Ying Deng, this is a fate worse than death.

67
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,900
You...

68
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:17,820
For the pain you inflicted on Yan Dan, I will make you pay a hundred or thousand times over!

69
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,520
Come out now.

70
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,500
Yan Dan.

71
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,780
I have done it.

72
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,520
I have avenged you.

73
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:48,010
So this is why you asked me to say that when Ying Deng submitted the divine tools.

74
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:56,180
Yan Dan... is actually alive.

75
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,600
I didn't tell you because I was angry with you.

76
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,280
His Majesty saved her and sent her to the Mortal Realm.

77
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,080
Yan Dan...

78
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,840
became a mortal?

79
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,120
His Majesty forcefully took Yan Dan out of Night Forgetting River.

80
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,420
Although her immortal spirit was gone, she could turn into a demon.

81
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:29,100
She must be living as a free flower demon now.

82
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:38,330
Yan Dan once told me she could never forgive you because you were the closest person to her.

83
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:41,520
However, she still hoped you could overcome your inner demon.

84
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,430
In her eyes, you have always been the stronger one.

85
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,810
Zhi Xi... live well.

86
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:59,650
Yan Dan never stopped hoping that one day, you could live for yourself.

87
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,420
All right?

88
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,960
Why are you frowning?

89
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,160
"Rendezvous by Pear Garden" has been played ten times consecutively. We've had a full house every time.

90
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,460
Troupe Leader asked me to stay here to compose the next play.

91
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:58,080
I might have no idea where I come from, but I know what I want.

92
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,620
I really love writing plays.

93
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:05,600
My goal is to rise to fame, as the best scriptwriter in the world.

94
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:13,060
While my ambition is bold, my inspiration cannot keep up.

95
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,840
I cannot think of or write anything.

96
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,700
You're a talented writer, but your characters' emotions are very rigid.

97
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,420
"Rendezvous by Pear Garden" moved the people because it's inspired by the author's own experience.

98
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,720
You're still young and inexperienced, so you don't how complicated humans can be.

99
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,560
Without having enough experience, naturally, you can't produce a good story.

100
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,760
Jiang Chen, can you tell me what should I do?

101
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,000
The nuanced feelings everyone has here cannot be put into words.

102
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,220
You have to experience it yourself. No one can describe it to you.

103
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,340
You have to travel a lot and endure many things.

104
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:06,460
Only by tasting the sweet and sour, the joy and sorrow, can you view life as it is, and find yourself in it.

105
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,980
You'll find out what it truly means to love and let go.

106
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:14,000
And then, you'll write a gut-wrenching, tear-jerking story.

107
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,860
"The sweet and sour,"

108
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,500
"the joy and sorrow."

109
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,120
Let's go!

110
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:51,400
As per your request, Mountain Chief, we have recalled all tribes that were exiled and bullied by Prison Lizard.

111
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,380
We have also allotted the food quota and living quarters based on each tribe's population.

112
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:59,380
Most tribes were happy to oblige, except for the Tiger Clan, which has always prided itself as the head of all demons.

113
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,980
They want more territory.

114
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,400
In your opinion...

115
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,740
In my opinion, sure.

116
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:20,460
In my opinion, now that Yelan Mountain has new leaders, the rules here have changed.

117
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:27,920
We steer away from distributing resources based on tribal strength, so weaker tribes will not feel sidelined.

118
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:33,180
Tell the Tiger Clan that if they have any issues, they may ask for a duel.

119
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:38,670
If they can win against Zi Lin or me, I'll entertain their request.

120
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,800
I agree with Yu Mo.

121
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,420
When we were trying to kill Prison Lizard, they were nowhere to be seen.

122
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,000
And now they demand more territory.

123
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,540
Yes.

124
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,660
Any news?

125
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:59,420
Whether it's us, the Avian Clan, or the Aquatic Clan members you sent out... we've got nothing so far.

126
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,600
I know you're looking everywhere for her. Can we have more information?

127
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:08,400
For example, her appearance, her special traits, or her age.

128
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,960
She likes to eat. She can finish a chicken in one sitting.

129
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,120
She cares for her friends.

130
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,120
When her friends are in trouble, no matter what,

131
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,320
she'd be there immediately, even though her spiritual power is weak.

132
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,980
She's self-centered.

133
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:27,240
But that was her previous self.

134
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,280
<i>The mark she gave me still lights up. She must have escaped Night Forgetting River alive.</i>

135
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:43,540
<i>But whether she's a mortal, demon, or deity remains unknown.</i>

136
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:49,880
<i>Has her appearance changed? Or did she turn into another creature?</i>

137
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,580
Zi Lin, I'll leave this mountain for a while.

138
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,960
What? Yu Mo.

139
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,380
We need a leader to re-establish order here in the mountain.

140
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,760
If you leave, what should I do?

141
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,280
A hundred avian demons can search through all lands in a few days.

142
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,500
The Aquatic Clan has routes to all places. They can go through all water bodies in a few days.

143
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,480
They are far more efficient than you when it comes to looking for her.

144
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,420
But it's been a while, and I still haven't received news about her.

145
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:19,930
In this world, only I can recognize her, no matter what form or what appearance she takes.

146
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,040
"The floating clouds don't know the weariness of the setting sun."

147
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,080
"My father doesn't understand the sorrow of Dan Shu."

148
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,860
That's not what was written in the play.

149
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,420
I was training and watching plays in Mortal Realm.

150
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:35,260
I was enjoying myself, but you had to drag me into this forest!

151
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,780
You...

152
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,370
Greetings, Mountain Chief.

153
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,720
I'm Yuan Dan, the leader of the Wolf Clan.

No need.

Can you recite those lines again?

Mountain Chief, the play is called "Rendezvous by Pear Garden".

179
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,160
It's a new critically-acclaimed play in Mortal Realm.

180
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,780
Many other troupes have performed it too.

181

She once said she wanted to become the best scriptwriter in the Six Realms.

182

That hasn't changed at all.

183

If she's waiting for me... then I will search all the performing troupes in this world.

His cough relapsed today, and he's been vomiting blood.

He's too ill to come.

- Let me see him!
- No need. All the physicians have checked him.

They said, no matter what they do, or whatever rare herbs they give him, he will not be able to live for more than two weeks.

His Highness told me to pass this message to you: "Destiny cannot be defied."

Monster!

208
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,960
You call me a monster?

You're a pervert!

That's all it takes? So weak!

211
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,080
Don't you know you're a demon?

212
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,280
How can you use your power in front of a mortal?

213
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,720
What if he summons a Demon Catcher here?

214
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,540
Jiang Chen, don't listen to him. I'm not a monster.

I gave him a light tap and he passed out like that.

216
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,380
I didn't even use any force.

217
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,580
I...

218
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,900
What was that?

219
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,560
I'm a demon too. I'm an Epiphyllum Demon.

220
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,040
To conceal my identity, I don't use my powers.

221
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,260
If we weren't in the same clan, why would I save you?

222
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,580
I... I'm a demon?

223
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,260
You're also a demon?

224
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:54,940
No wonder you made up nonsense when Troupe Leader inquired about your origin.

225
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:59,440
I thought you had another reason. So you truly know nothing about yourself?

226
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,440
Your body has too much frigid energy. That's why you have those gray marks.

227
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,260
Your spiritual power is weak. I can't sense your demonic essence.

228
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,500
It is odd, to say the least.

229
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,500
This is too much for me. Let me digest it.

230
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,680
But when I was still a human, these gray marks were always there.

231
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,360
Now that I'm a demon, it's still there!

232
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,920
So being a demon did nothing? I'm still ugly.

233
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,740
Ugly, but heroic.

234
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,620
You injured Young Master Wang with your powers.

235
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,560
He'll be no different from a eunuch now.

236
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:39,440
You just freed all women of the Southern Capital from the terror of this pervert.

237
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,040
I'm quite powerful then.

238
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:48,400
He'll make a scene when he wakes up. You should leave.

239
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,300
Take this. Travel westward after you exit the city.

240
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,920
Look for Flower Clan's leader in the Hidden Flower Mountain forest.

241
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,960
When he sees this, he'll take you in, as a favor to me.

242
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,320
What about you? Come with me.

243
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,340
Or else, what will you do after he wakes up?

244
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,420
Wherever Pei Luo is, I'll be there.

245
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,340
He's very ill. He won't live for long.

246
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm too weak to save him.

247
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,340
If he passes away...

248
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,640
I will reunite with him eventually in the afterlife.

249
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,520
Humans are complicated, especially when in love.

250
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,560
You're still young, you won't understand now. But one day, you will.

251
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,540
Just go.

252
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,840
Jiang Chen, you're my first good friend in the Mortal Realm.

253
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,340
I will miss you.

254
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,920
After we part ways today, I will travel around.

255
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:47,360
I hope I can experience "the sweet and sour, the joy and sorrow," as you said.

256
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,060
I hope I can understand what true feelings are.

257
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,000
If one day, I can write a tear-jerking play...

258
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,630
"If"? I know you will.

259
00:21:56,630 --> 00:22:03,810
And then, whenever it is or wherever you are, I will be there to perform it with you.

00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,000
Stop sulking already.

263
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,600
Though we still haven't found her after visiting more than ten theatre troupes,

264
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:35,600
they said "Rendezvous by Pear Garden" came from Lovely Theatre Troupe in the Southern Capital.

265
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,600
Once we're in the Southern Capital, we'll find something.

266
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,400
Let me check whether this inn forgot to feed the horses.

267
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,900
Stop eating.

Don't worry. I'm not here to kidnap you.

An ugly one at that. How dare you steal my horse!

275
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,900
You're ugly. Your entire family is ugly!

You...

277
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,500
Humans and demons are different.

278
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,200
We're here to find someone. Don't cause trouble.

279
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,700
Let's go back. We can just buy another horse.

280
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,700
She cast a spell just now. She wields supernatural power!

281
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,600
But I still feel nervous. What should I do?

282
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,000
Don't worry. You can do this.

283
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,200
Just do what you normally do.

284

289
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,600
Excuse me, is the leader of Flower Spirit Clan in there?

290
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,800
My friend told me to come here.

291
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,200
Many flower demons are waiting here.

292
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,600
We're all here due to our connections.

293
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,900
Judging from your looks, you won't be chosen.

294
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,900
Does your appearance decide if you can be a demon now?

295
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,400
Stop!

296
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,400
I'm trying to present a beauty to Mountain Chief, not a pest remover!

Your talent is useless!

298
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,100
Don't worry, Tribe Chief.

299
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:40,900
Though she isn't very beautiful, we still have our treasure, the Yanbi Pill.

300
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,600
It is made from one hundred flowers.

301
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,400
Not only can it cleanse the yin in one's body, but it can also enhance one's beauty.
<i>(T/N: "yin" - dark energy)</i>

302
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:55,900
If we present both this beauty and this pill, the new mountain chiefs will definitely acknowledge our sincerity.

303
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,400
<i>"Cleanse the yin in one's body"?</i>

304
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,900
<i>"Enhance one's beauty"?</i>

305
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,800
<i>This was tailor-made for me!</i>

307
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,700
Me!

308
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,600
Tribe Chief! Pick me!

309
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,000
Tribe Chief. I'm Bai Piaoliang, a lotus demon.

310

Jiang Chen recommended me here.

311
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,600
You...

312
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,000
My dear heaven, are you going to eliminate our Flower Spirit Clan?

313
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,900
That's enough. The beauty pageant stops here!

314
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,100
Tribe Chief, you can't judge a book by its cover.

315
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,400
You...

316
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,600
I want to present a beautiful concubine to Mountain Chief.

317
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,700
If I don't judge by appearance, what criteria should I use?

318
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,800
I have other talents.

319
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,500
Talents?

320
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,100
Hear me out.

321
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,200
Hear me, hear me, hear me out.

322
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,400
My wise chief.

323
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:56,200
I was living at the border of the Southern Capital, leading an anonymous life in a theatre troupe.

324
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,200
In order to make a living, I wrote and performed my plays.

325
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,500
But a Demon Catcher came after me!

326
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,000
He hit me on my face and marred my beauty.

327
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I shall avenge myself!

328
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
I heard Mountain Chief's power knows no bound.

329
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,800
He's strong enough to protect his home.

330
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,600
So I traveled far and wide to seek refuge.

331
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,600
I pray that you will take pity on me!

332
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,500
I will repay your kindness with my loyalty!

333
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,800
My loyalty!

334
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,800
Wonderful!

335
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,200
Your story has moved me to tears.

336
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,300
Now that's an interesting talent!

337
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,000
I see you wish to obtain Mountain Chief's protection.

338
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,300
I can do you this favor.

339
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:48,300
However, you will not be presented as a potential concubine.

340
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,000
Are you okay with that?

341
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,800
I will go through all hardships just to serve Mountain Chief!

342
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,800
The Flower Spirit Clan has two treasures.

343
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,600
The first one is Yanbi Pill.

344
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,800
And the second one is Zi Teng.

345
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,800
You will be Zi Teng's dowry maid.
<i>(T/N: maid who accompanies a noble lady to her new husband's house)</i>

346
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:19,200
Once Zi Teng marries Mountain Chief, you will write some plays

347
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,400
and sing songs to entertain them.

348
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,300
Don't worry. With me by your side, whenever I have a meal, you can have the leftovers!

349
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:37,000
Miss Zi Teng, you sure have quite the appetite.

350
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,400
Grandpa.

351
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,100
<i>Even the leftovers will stuff me to death.</i>

352
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,200
What's so special about Miss Zi Teng?

353
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,700
She is the only granddaughter of our tribe chief.

354
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:55,800
We heard that the new Mountain Chief loves girls who eat a lot.

355
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,400
What unique taste.

356
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,800
Miss Zi Teng, you will definitely steal his heart!

357
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,400
Zi Teng.

358
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:11,400
None of the candidates today is as beautiful as you.

359
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,000
Zi Teng.

360
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
The future of our clan falls on your shoulders now.

361
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,600
Don't worry, Grandpa.

362
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,000
God has gifted me with unparalleled beauty.

363
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,800
This is my responsibility!

364
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,200
Grandpa.

365
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,400
<i>I hope Mountain Chief will fall in love with her straight away</i>,

366
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,000
<i>and they will become inseparable, so I can get my hands on the Yanbi Pill successfully.</i>

367
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,100
<i>[Lovely Theatre Troupe]</i>

368
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:56,500
I can't believe the Flower Spirit Clan are good at singing and dancing.

369
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,300
I'm surprised.

370
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,400
Why don't you head back to Yelan Mountain with me?

371
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,800
You'll sing, and I'll listen.

372
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,000
Zi Lin, don't be rude.

373
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,100
Greetings, Mountain Chiefs.

374
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:14,700
I know I have violated the rules of Yelan Mountain, but I have my own reasons to perform with this theatre troupe.

375
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,600
I have not harmed any mortals.

376
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,100
May I know why you came here?

377
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,000
No need to be afraid, Miss.

378
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,200
I'm on a personal quest.

379
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,000
Zi Lin, please give us a moment.

380
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,200
I need to talk to her.

381
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,400
So she's the person?

382
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,000
So much for being your good friend.

383
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,200
Fine! I'll keep watch by the door.

384
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,500
Where is the author of this play?
<i>[Rendezvous by Pear Garden]</i>

385
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,000
You are too late, Mountain Chief.

386
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,100
She attacked the nobleman, Young Master Wang, last night.

387
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:04,000
She used her demonic power, and is on the run now.

388
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,400
I questioned the troupe leader.

389
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,200
But he stuttered and refused to give me a clear answer.

390
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,200
I can guess what might have happened.

391
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,600
I have known this lady for a long time.

392
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,200
I know her mannerisms and behavior very well.

393
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,500
Young Master Wang must have forced himself on you.

394
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,400
And then, she intervened.

395
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,200
It went downhill from there.

396
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,300
I'm sure you directed her to a safe place.

397
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:35,400
Otherwise, the troupe wouldn't have waited till today to report the case to the local authorities.

398
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,800
What is your relationship with her?

399
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,800
She's the most important person in my life.

400
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,000
I have been looking for her.

401
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:56,000
Since you hold her so dear if I can help you locate her, how will you repay me?

402
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,200
I'm willing to give you everything I have.

403
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,200
But if I find out you lied to me...

404
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:10,200
She's a lotus demon with no memory. She isn't aware that she's a demon.

405
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,400
She has no background and no one to fall back on.

406
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,600
Her body is overflowing with cold energy, and her body is covered in gray spots.

407
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:21,100
Her demonic power is weak, and she doesn't know how to become stronger with healing spells.

408
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:26,200
Without anyone looking after her, she will run into danger sooner or later.

409
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:36,000
I considered her as a good friend and took care of her.

410
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,800
I want you to repay my kindness, not for any materialistic gain,

411
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:46,100
but because nothing in this world hurts as much as being unable to be with your beloved.

412
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:52,200
I will help you find your lover, but in exchange,

413
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,800
I hope you can save my beloved.

414
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,600
What happened to you?

415
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,400
It's like your power was damaged. You're weak.

416
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,100
It's okay.

417
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,200
I have to go to the Forest of Hidden Flower Mountain.

418
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,600
You don't have follow me.

419
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,800
I'll be back soon.

420
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,600
Why the hurry?

421
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,400
Is it a marriage proposal?

422
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,700
I hope so.

423
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,100
- Are you truly okay?
- Yes.

424

<i>The Extraordinary Eye contains potent spiritual power.</i>

<i>It can save those who are about to die.</i>

426
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,200
<i>However, it doesn't belong to this realm.</i>

427
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,800
<i>Do not let Pei Luo's greed grow unchecked because of it.</i>

<i>After twenty years, when his life is about to end,</i>

431
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,300
<i>I will retrieve it.</i>

432
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,800
<i>You're like me, Mountain Chief.</i>

433
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:45,100
<i>When we love someone, we will make sure that he or she is forever safe, no matter the cost or consequence.</i>

434
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:50,200
<i>If he lives to see another happy day, so will I.</i>

435
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,700
<i>Even though I'll lose him one day, I'll regret nothing.</i>

436
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:01,700
<i>If I can find her in this life, I'll show her all the joy there is in this world.</i>

437
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,600
<i>I won't let go of her.</i>

438
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,600
For half of my life, I've battled with my illness.

439
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,400
Looks like the battle will end today.

440
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,400
<i>Though I am weak, I still can't escape from the fratricidal strife.</i>

Jiang Chen.

443
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,100
Pei Luo.

444
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,400
You killed them.

445
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,400
But it won't change anything.

446
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,600
I won't live for long.

447
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Why did you come here?

448
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
You're just going to feel worse.

449
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,800
I already said we should stop seeing each other.

450
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:58,600
I also said I wouldn't let you die.

451
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,800
I managed to refine this pill myself.

452
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,600
Just one pill is enough to cure all diseases.

453
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,200
Then, you can do whatever you want.

454

<i>One day in Flower Realm is several years in Mortal Realm.</i>

<i>After the reorganization of the Three Realms, mortals and demons coexisted within the same realm.</i>

<i>Tales of demons disturbing the mortals' peace come one after another.</i>

457

<i>Thus, the mortals turned to the Taoists, who kill nefarious demons and restore order.</i>

<i>They learn Taoist spells in their school, and exercise heroism with their swords.</i>

<i>Among all Taoist sects, the northern Lingxiao Sect is considered as the best.</i>

<i>However, the Lingxiao Sect prefers to hide in tall mountains and sharp cliffs.</i>

<i>They focus on training and rarely meddle in mortal affairs.</i>

<i>Being elusive is their nature.</i>

Tribe Chief! Miss Zi Teng has an upset stomach.

467
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,200
She cannot travel at the moment.

468
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,900
If this continues, we'll miss the auspicious hour!

469
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,200
I won't be able to answer to the Mountain Chiefs!

470
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,800
Indeed.

471
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,700
Leader, you see,

472
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,300
there are many elixirs in the horse carriage loaded with tributes.

473
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,400
Maybe I can find something to treat Miss Zi Teng.

474
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,000
Sure. Go now!

475
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,200
Yanbi Pill.

476
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,800
Move aside! I'm in a hurry!

477
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,100
My tributes!

478
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,800
Watch where you're going!

479
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,600
How can you not apologize after you crash into others?

480
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,200
I slipped.

481
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,600
- I slipped.
- You slipped?

482
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,400
Get Zi Teng some medicine now!

483
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,400
Tell her we'll be leaving in an hour.

484
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,800
- Right.
- Go now.

485
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,600
Oh, my tributes!

486
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,800
Mountain Chief.

487
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:25,800
After the change of Yelan Mountain's ownership, many flower demons went to the Hidden Flower Mountain forest to seek refuge.

488
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,400
All the lotus demons are here.

489
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,700
However, I can't find the one with gray spots that you want.

490
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,600
Do you fancy any other flower demons?

491
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,400
Like... this Rafflesia?

492
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,400
<i>So Yan Dan didn't turn to the Flower Spirit Clan?</i>

493
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,200
<i>Or was Jiang Chen lying?</i>

494
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:51,700
<i>If she isn't here, where can I find her, in this vast world?</i>

495
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:33,540
<i>''Agarwood'' - Zhang Jie | Jane Zhang</i>
