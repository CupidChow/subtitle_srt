Eldest Senior Brother.

16
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,700
Eldest Senior Brother, what brings you here?

17
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,300
Qin Qi and the others are preparing for Sect Leader's birthday celebration.

18
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,500
The class this afternoon is canceled. I'm here to inform you.

19
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,000
Miss Yan Dan, do you not like fish?

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,800
I saw you enjoyed eating crabs yesterday.

21
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,200
Why don't we go catch some at the stream in the rear mountain this afternoon?

22
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,600
The Lingxiao Sect leads a frugal lifestyle.

23
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,200
But the scenery around the mountain is great.

24
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,700
- We can have a great time there.
- Sure!

25
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,100
No. Yan Dan is too restless.

26
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,900
I've arranged assignments for her this afternoon to tone down her temper.

27
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,400
Brother, you are restricting my personal freedom.

28
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,600
Well, I have some free time.

29
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,700
- We could finish the assignment this afternoon together.
- Great!

30
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,000
Eldest Senior Brother, she needs tranquility and self-restraint.

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The presence of others will affect her training. Am I right?

32
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh, no! The books are outside!

33
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,400
This is bad.

34
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,800
Don't get too reckless.

35
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
You shouldn't risk yourself for books.

36
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,400
Thank you for catching me.

37
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,800
I could have been in trouble again.

38
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,000
Eldest Senior Brother.

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,500
Brother’s books are drenched by the rain.

40
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,000
They must have been damaged.

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,400
I must repair those books for him.

42
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,600
I can't go with you on a trip to the mountain.

43
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,800
Yan Dan is right.

44
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,200
You would make such an effort to save Tang Zhou's books.

45
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,600
You are very honorable.

46
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,300
There is always another day. The rain will stop eventually.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,100
As your senior, I must warn you.

48
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,200
You are our future leader.

49
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,600
Do not ruin your future because of your personal attachments.

50
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,000
Don't worry, Eldest Senior Brother.

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yan Dan is my sworn sister.

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,800
Educating her is my duty.

53
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,100
In that case, I should leave you to it.

54
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,800
Why do you have my hairpin?

55
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,000
Did you steal it?

56
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,600
I didn't steal anything.

57
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,600
This is a keepsake my master left me.

58
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,400
Your master?

59
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,500
So the demon my master failed to capture was actually you.

60
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,800
Even after all this time, you're still so cunning.

61
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,600
Old habits die hard.

62
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:32,640
<i>This demon isn't very strong, but she is witty.</i>

63
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,440
So the old fossil who let me die in the water was your master.

64
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,000
You really follow your master's example!

65
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,500
You are both just as obnoxious and blind to the truth.

66
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,200
You're done for! Done for, I tell you!

67
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,200

Are you going to reveal everything about Lingxiao Sect?

71
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,800
Are you going to disrespect your teacher again?

72
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,300
Do you want me to undo the silencing spell?

73
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,600
Dream on.

74
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,200
This is your punishment for slandering and disrespecting me.

75

Come here.

76
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,500
Bring your head forward.

77
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,000
I have no use for the hairpin anyway.

78
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,600
You can wear it.

79
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,500
Put this over there.

80
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,800

Senior, what's wrong with Yan Dan?

88
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,000
She must be exhausted from grinding ink sticks.

89
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,900
By the way, what brings you here?

90
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,000
Today is Ghost Festival.

91
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,800
According to our traditions, we must go to the mountain and subdue demons.

92
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,900
I've prepared snacks and supper for us.

93
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,800
I'm inviting you to come with me.

94
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,600
Yan Dan, don't be scared.

95
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,200
We're keeping watch in name only.

96
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,200
It's actually our sect's annual tea party.

97
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,000
Everyone looks forward to this day.

98
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,100
We get to eat, drink, and talk about anything together.

99
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,200
It will be a lot of fun!

100
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,500
I couldn't hold it anymore. I can finally speak!

101
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,700
Was that necessary?

102
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,000
I'll go with you!

103
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,800
Why are you laughing?

104
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,400
What's wrong?

105
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,200
Tang Zhou!

106
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,900
I'm going to kill you!

107
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,400
Here.

108
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,900
Yan Dan, how can you keep on eating?

109
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,000
You said this was a tea party. Can't I eat here?

110
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's not that.

111
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,900
After all the ghost stories, aren't you scared at all?

112
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,700
Honestly, the ghost stories you told

113
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:57,000
are barely half as scary as the ones in novels.

114
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
If you're so amazing, tell us a ghost story.

115
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,800
I'd like to know what it's like to be afraid.

116
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,900
All right.

117
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:15,200
Since you asked so nicely, I'll do you a favor and tell you a ghost story.

118
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,000
But only on one condition.

119
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,700
When I tell you the ghost story, you must all keep your eyes closed.

120
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,600
Whoever opens his or her eyes will lose.

121
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,600
If you lose, you must run ten laps around this bonfire clockwise.

122
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,700
Then another ten laps, going anticlockwise.

123
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,200
And lastly, go back to your seat.

124
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,100
Is that clear?

125
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,500
All right! Close your eyes, everyone.

126
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,300
Close your eyes!

127
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,200
Here it goes.

128
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:56,900
A long time ago, there was a snake demon that had trained for over 1,000 years.

129
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,000
She fell in love with a Taoist priest.

130
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,600
The Taoist priest appeared to have feelings for the snake demon,

131
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,000
but his true motive was to extract her demonic essence for medicine.

132
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,400
And in the end, the snake demon was blinded by love and was unaware of his plan.

133
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,800
When they were about to get married, the Taoist priest seized the opportunity to steal her demonic essence

134
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,200
and pushed her off the cliff.

135
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,700
You're stealing my lines!

136
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,400
I had heard this story a long time ago.

137
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,200
Therefore, your plan failed.

138
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,400
Not bad.

139
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:48,400
Since you know so many stories, you should tell me one.

140
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,000
I'd like to know what it's like to be afraid.

141
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,800
Sure.

142
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,600
<i>[Demon Suppression Hall]</i>

143
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,800
What are you doing?

144
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,000
Yan Dan, don't be scared.

145
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,300
It's the sound from Demon Suppression Hall.

146
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:11,100
When our seniors return from their journeys, they banish the lesser demons they capture into Demon Suppression Hall.

147
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,600
That building is full of traps.

148
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,400
There is also a demon-binding trap outside.

149
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,200
That's why it rings from time to time.

150
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,000
- What? Are you scared?
- No, I'm not!

151
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,600
Close your eyes, then.

152
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,100
Fine!

153
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,000
Listen closely.

154
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,600
Once, there was a married couple.

155
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,000
The husband and a woodcutter went to the mountain to gather firewood.

156
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
They were gone for too long.

157
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,700
So the wife rushed to the mountain to look for her husband.

158
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:51,000
After a long search, she found only the blood-stained axe the woodcutter used.

159
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,600
The wife thought her husband was dead.

160
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,200
So she went home in tears.

161
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:02,400
Ten days later, the husband came home.

162
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,000
The wife was overjoyed.

163
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,700
She asked, "My love, where have you been all this time?"

164
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,300
He said, "I lost my way in the mountain."

165
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,400
"It took me a long time to find my way home."

166
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,800
The wife went to the marketplace the next day.

167
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,700
She met the woodcutter who went to the forest with her husband.

168
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,300
She asked him about the incident.

169
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,600
The woodcutter was shocked.

170
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,600
"But your husband died ten days ago."

171
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,300
So the wife went home puzzled.

172
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,800
She saw her husband stooping, looking for something.

173
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,500
Suddenly, she was grabbed by two arms.

174
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,800
That's all?

175
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,000
Taoist Master Tang, there is no chance you can actually scare me.

176
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,800
There's more.

177
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,800
"My love."

178
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,600
"My head is missing."

179
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,700
"Could you find it for me?"

180
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,600
<i>What was that?</i>

181
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,500
Miss Yan Dan, what's the matter?

182
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,500
What's wrong with you?

183
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,500
Didn't you say there would be no chance I could scare you?

184
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,200
You're holding my liquor.

185
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,300
You opened your eyes. Start running.

186
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,400
You jerk!

187
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,800
You found three demon-catching arrays.

188
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,000
And you've visited two demon catchers in person.

189
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,400
There is only one place left.

190
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,300
Lingxiao Sect.

191
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,600
Yan Dan must be there.

192
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,400
- Mountain Chiefs!
- Mountain Chiefs!

193
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,800
Mountain Chiefs!

194
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,000
<i>Mountain Chiefs!</i>

195
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,200
Where is Dan Shu?

196
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,000
Why isn't he with you?

197
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Dan Shu and I split up the other day.

198
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,200
But he never showed up.

199
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,200
We went to the last place he was.

200
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,600
There were traces of a demon-catching array.

201
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,100
I'm afraid the demon catcher got him.

202
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,900
Mountain Chief, you must save him!

203
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,400
As long as you're alive, the Dragon Clan will keep hunting you down.

204
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,900
They're acting undercover, while you're in the open.

205
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,700
It's too risky to go alone.

206
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,400
So... I should go with you.

207
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,400
Lingxiao Sect is not an average sect.

208
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,000
I can handle them by myself.

209
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Take everyone home.

210
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,800
You are needed at Yelan Mountain.

211
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,200
It's my fault that Yan Dan went missing.

212
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,300
Whatever it takes, I'll bring her home unharmed.

The dragon core is not inside you.

00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm blessed by the heavens.

216
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
If you want to live, get out of my way!

217
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,200
I told you before, as long as I have your scale,

218
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,700
whenever you cast a spell, I can trace your spiritual power and find you.

219
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,200
Then I'll eliminate you.

220
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,000
I underestimated you last time.

221
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Today, I want to see you dead.

<i>[Demon Suppression Hall]</i>

223
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,000
He was wounded by the Soul-crushing Hook.

224
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,200
He lost a great deal of spiritual power. He couldn't have run far.

225
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,000
Search this place!

226

<i>Yes.</i>

228
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,500
Let's go. We'll search over there.

229
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,900
Yes.

230
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,100
Brother Yu Mo!

231
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,000
Zhao Lan?

232
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,400
You let that Nine Fin man escape time and time again.

233
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,400
And now you started a fight in the biggest demon catcher sect, Lingxiao Sect.

234
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,100
You were lucky to have left no traces.

235
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,200
If the mortals found out, things could get out of hand.

236
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,700
Remember this.

237
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:35,000
If you want to become the ruler of the Four Seas, you need more than just courage.

238
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,700
You also need strategy.

239
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,900
I have failed my mission. I apologize.

240
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,800
However, even though I failed to slay Yu Mo, I noticed that he had lost his dragon core.

241
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,000
He is severely wounded and without his dragon core to protect him.

242
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,400
I promise that I will take his life within the next two weeks.

243
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,200
Very well. Dispatch more soldiers.

244
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,000
Keep searching for the Nine Fins Clan.

245
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,200
The arranged marriage with the South Sea will happen soon.

246
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,900
It will decide your future.

247
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,400
The fate of the Dragon Clan of the East Sea depends on it.

248
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,200
Therefore, you must tie up all loose ends, as soon as possible.

249
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,500
But remember, no one must find out.

250
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,500
Yes, Royal Father.

Crack open the walnuts before I come home tonight.

Sure.

258

Do not play your tricks.

259
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,400
There's a magical barrier at the entrance.

260
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,500
You can't escape.

261
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,900
Wait. What have I ever done to you?

262
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,600
Why must you torture me?

My sworn brother, who lives a decent life, is always picking on me.

He locked me inside this house and ordered me to crack walnuts for him.

Not too shabby, Eldest Senior Brother. Impressive!

275
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:53,820
If he is mistreating you, why do you still follow his orders?

276
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,520
He saved my life, after all.

277

I can't be ungrateful even if he mistreats me.

278

I'll be honest with you.

00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:03,420
Actually, I was forced to do his chores.

280
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:19,080
Yan Dan. Actually, I had fallen for you since the first day we met.

281
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,280
After spending some time with you, I'm even more certain of my feelings for you.

282
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,160
You have no family or friends in this world.

283
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,440
If you marry me, I'll take great care of you.

284
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,440
I won't let you get mistreated.

285
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,420
This came out of nowhere.

286
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,940
You're joking, right?

287
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,160
Indeed. I am well aware of my own charm and beauty.

288
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,420
But I'm afraid my sworn brother wouldn't consent to this.

289
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:50,040
It doesn't matter what Tang Zhou thinks. I only need your consent.

290
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,000
I find your words very touching.

291
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,460
But marriage is not child's play.

292
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,800
I must consult him.

293
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:03,400
I lost my parents when I was little, but my mother did give me a piece of advice.

294
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,300
"Before a woman gets married, the woman's birth horoscope must match the man's."

295
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,020
"They must be meant for each other."

296
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:13,000
If you can wait, could I give you my answer in a few days?

297
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,680
It's a serious matter. We do need to take it seriously.

298
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,280
I'll have my birth horoscope written down.

299
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:24,040
Eldest Senior Brother, I spent the whole night at the mountain last night.

300
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:30,170
This morning, every time there was a breeze, the bell at the demon-binding trap rang.

301
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,900
It's giving me a headache.

302
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,840
I can't even get some proper sleep.

303
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,260
If it's possible, could you please remove the trap for me?

304
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,540
So I can take a nap.

305
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,460
But...

306
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,900
It's all right. I won't put you on the spot. Forget about it!

307
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,940
That's easy. Please get some sleep.

308
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,040
Thank you so much!

309
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,100
And you want to marry me?

310
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,900
You wouldn't even crack the nuts for me.

311
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,780
You're not the one for me!

312
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,980
Sister Yan Dan?

313
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,540
Dan Shu? What are you doing here?

314
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,920
Who hurt you?

315
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,400
After you went missing, Mountain Chief was worried sick. It's driving him insane!

316
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,320
We were sent out to look for you.

317
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,400
But I was too weak to fight and got captured.

318
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,360
They locked me up inside this dark house.

319
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,880
This is outrageous!

320
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,240
You've never hurt anyone. How could they torture you like this?

321
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,620
I might be a tiger demon, but I've done nothing evil.

322
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:53,213
They broke my fangs and locked me up just because I'm a tiger demon!

323
00:26:53,213 --> 00:26:57,260
Sister Yan Dan, it's not safe here. You should run while you can.

324
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:00,360
Go to Mountain Chief. He will be glad to see that you're safe.

325
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,940
He will come to our rescue.

326
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,220
Dan Shu, stay calm. I'll get you out.

327
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:46,800
If I hadn't come back in time after sensing the trap had been broken, you would've been pierced to death by those arrows!

328
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:52,440
I used to think that getting captured by you was my greatest misfortune.

329
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:59,600
But after seeing what's inside the Demon Suppression Hall, I think you're a living saint, compared to the others here.

330
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,540
It's our duty to capture demons.

331
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,180
Those demons got what they deserve.

332
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:07,660
My friend, Dan Shu, is the wolf demon that was locked up.

333
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,760
He was captured because he was looking for me.

334
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,620
What had he done wrong?

335
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:16,400
We may be demons, but we are living beings too.

336
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,460
We feel pain just as you do!

337
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,980
Demons are just the same as humans.

338
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,240
You were overcome with grief when you lost your master.

339
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,560
Do you think we don't feel the same when we lose our friends and family?

340
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,780
The demon that killed your master and his family deserves punishment.

341
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:35,140
But you can't blame every demon for that tragedy.

342
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,520
Tang Zhou. Answer me.

343
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,640
Why do you catch demons?

344
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,760
Is it for the sake of justice, or your own personal vendetta?

345
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,340
Miss Yan Dan, are you inside the room?

346
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,660
Junior Brother, you’re back.

347
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,760
Eldest Senior Brother.

348
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:07,740
Did Yan Dan tell you I proposed to her?

349
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,360
She did.

350
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,640
However, I can't let you marry her.

351
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,220
Why is that?

352
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,720
It's not your decision to make. I need to hear from her.

353
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,280
Yan Dan, I have my birth horoscope ready.

354
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,980
Did you write yours down?

355
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,660
You...

356
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,240
Tang Zhou, Yan Dan is not your biological sister.

357
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,580
So why are you stopping me?

358
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,300
Tang Zhou, you will become the chief someday.

359
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:54,040
Even if you've fallen for her, you two are not meant to be.

360
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:00,960
The demon-binding trap at Demon Suppression Hall was removed.

361
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,320
An accident almost took place.

362
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,040
Do you know who is responsible for it?

363
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,800
This concerns the safety of our sect.

364
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:14,740
I hope you get to the bottom of it.

365
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:20,020
If the chief finds out, both of us will be held responsible.

366
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,860
Eldest Senior Brother, don't let her charm cloud your judgment.

367
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,240
You...

368
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,900
I am still your Eldest Senior Brother.

369
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,080
How dare you speak to me that way!

370
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,420
He is here for me. You have no right to keep me here.

371
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,540
Should I allow you to keep lying to him?

372
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,240
You spoke about right and wrong.

373
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,940
But you tricked him into removing the trap outside Demon Suppression Hall for you.

374
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,220
Are you not using him?

375
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:52,880
You knew you couldn't be with him, but you didn't reject him.

376
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,040
How is this not deception?

377
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,640
First of all, you chose to bring me, a demon, back.

378
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,040
Secondly, I never bewitched anyone.

379
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,920
You mortals do everything willingly, but you blame every mistake on demons.

380
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:11,220
Since you're so unreasonable, we really are not meant to be. I was wrong about you.

381
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,800
Spare me your fancy speech.

382
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,260
From now on, you must stay within my sight, not ten steps away.

383
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,660
You are not allowed to go anywhere.

384
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:33,775
<i>[Yiyun Abode]</i>

385
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,720
<i>A demon was caught here.</i>

386
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:59,080
<i>Why didn't he hand the divine tool to Sect Leader?</i>

387
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:06,980
<i>May Sect Leader share the everlasting shine of the sun and the moon.
[Lingxiao Sect]</i>

388
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:13,680
<i>May Sect Leader be blessed with longevity, live long and prosper.</i>

389
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,980
Today, the disciples are gathered here for this celebration.

390
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,380
I'm glad to see all of you.

391
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:35,780
As I'm getting older, someone else must lead the Lingxiao Sect.

392
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:41,020
Tang Zhou, the beloved student of my senior, Tang Jiang.

393
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,500
You have a strong will and possess great knowledge.

394
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,713
You are outstanding and a role model for everyone.

395
00:32:47,713 --> 00:32:52,060
You are the perfect candidate to be the next leader of the Lingxiao Sect.

396
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,420
When I pass away, Lingxiao Sect will be left in your care.

397
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,760
I'll be relieved to put you in charge.

398
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:06,200
Senior Tang's caliber is above all of us.

399
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,160
He has been treating everyone with care.

400
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,320
He is worthy of the title.

401
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:16,880
Three days from now, we will hold the appointment ceremony here.

402
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,620
Is there any objection?

403
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:25,970
As a demon catcher, his duty is to follow through with his mission

404
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:29,240
and cleanse this world of all demons and devils.

405
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,480
But it seems Tang Zhou takes pity on demons.

406
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,000
That is against our sect rules!

407
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,720
Ever since I became a demon catcher, I have never failed in my duties.

408
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,940
May I know why you would make such a claim?

409
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:52,380
Tang Zhou always carries out his duties without showing favoritism.

410
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,100
Can you prove your claim?

411
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,420
I came across Tang Zhou's jade calabash, which had been recently used.

412
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,260
But he never reported it.

413
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,440
This is deception to our sect.

414
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,420
He disregards our rules.

415
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,260
Tang Zhou. Why didn't you report it?

416
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,580
Sect Leader, I believe Senior Tang Zhou has his reasons.

417
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,160
This is a misunderstanding.

418
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,880
<i>And I just quarreled with him.</i>

419
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,160
<i>Now that he's in trouble, he's going to expose me!</i>

420
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,000
Tang Zhou.

421
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
No one in Lingxiao Sect is allowed to release any demons and disregard justice.

422
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,920
I am so disappointed in you.

423
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,080
You've caught countless demons. Why did you let that one go?

424
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,720
That particular demon must mean a lot to you.

425
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:13,080
Have you made an unscrupulous deal with the demons?

426
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:23,690
Tang Zhou. Tell us where the released demon is, or you'll face severe punishment.

427
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,160
Sect Leader.

428
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:40,260
During my journey, I realized that not all humans were kind, and not all demons were evil.

429
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,100
Nothing is absolute.

430
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:45,220
With kindness and guidance, they can change.

431
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,700
We shouldn't kill all of them.

432
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,780
How dare you defend them!

433
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,460
Tang Zhou has betrayed the sect. He is disloyal and a traitor.

434
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:00,200
He is not worthy of being the next sect leader.

435
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,420
Please reconsider, Sect Leader.

436
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:13,880
Tang Zhou. I'll give you another chance.

437
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,460
Tell us where the demon is.

438
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:20,820
Sect Leader. That demon was kind.

439
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,100
She once saved me.

440
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,040
I spent time enlightening her.

441
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:30,220
I swear on my life that the demon will not harm anyone.

442
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:33,460
<i>He is defending me even though I'm a demon.</i>

443
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,440
"The demon will not harm anyone"?

444
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,380
Do you not remember how your master was murdered?

445
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:47,140
Mercy for the demons comes at the price of innocent lives!

446
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:51,640
His soul will not rest in peace knowing what you've done!

447
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,160
I broke the rules.

448
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,820
I will accept my punishment.

449
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,800
I have no complaints.

450
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:13,260
I had high hopes for you, but you have disappointed me!

451
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,160
Are you forfeiting your title as the next Sect Leader?

452
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,880
I have decided to dedicate my life to serving the Lingxiao Sect.

453
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,080
Whether I am the leader or not makes no difference to me.

454
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:32,220
As per the rules, you will be punished with ten lashes and banished to the Reflection Room to reflect and repent.

455
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,710
If you insist that you're right, showing no remorse,

456
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:41,700
not only will you not become the next leader, but you will be banished from the Lingxiao Sect!

457
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,380
Sect Leader, have mercy!

458
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,280
Sect Leader, have mercy on him.

459
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,200
He suffered severe injuries during his mission.

460
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,400
You will kill him if you don't stop.

461
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,140
He made a silly mistake. He will not repeat it.

462
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,580
He won't be so reckless again.

463
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:29,080
This is the sect's decision. Stay out of this.

464
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,440
Stop kneeling here.

465
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,960
Leave.

466
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,160
Leave!

467
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,160
Go!

468
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,620
Go!

469
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,140
That shop was nice.

470
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,820
Yes, we should go there again.

471
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,880
Yes. Sure.

472
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,420
We should buy more.

473
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,040
Miss Yan Dan.

474
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,800
Miss Yan Dan, where were you yesterday?

475
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,400
Senior Tang looked everywhere for you when he couldn't find you.

476
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,020
I went to the mountain for a walk.

477
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,020
Did you try the almond cookies? Do you like them?

478
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,400
What almond cookies?

479
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,340
Senior Tang and I went down the mountain and found a shop with great almond cookies.

480
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:36,780
He said you'd love them, so he bought you some.

481
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,260
Today is Sect Leader's birthday.

482
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:41,440
We bought more for everyone to try.

483
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,480
That's good.

484
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,460
Is he still at the birthday celebration?

485
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,040
Why are you out here by yourself?

486
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:52,340
I... I came out for some fresh air. It's too stuffy up there. Go on without me.

487
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,200
- Sure.
- Let's go.

488
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:04,340
<i>I'm free to leave, but I'm risking my life, going back to that prison.</i>

489
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:07,360
<i>I'm an honorable demon indeed.</i>

490
00:40:13,951 --> 00:40:17,987
<i>[Memorial Tablet of the Founder, Fu Qingyang]</i>

491
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,820
What monster are you?

492
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:36,360
Why are you hiding in my sword?

493
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,980
People were after your life that day.

494
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:45,980
I was the one who saved you from that magical array, so you could be rescued by that deity.

495
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:50,420
You didn't thank me, and now you're calling me a demon object?

496
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:55,000
If you are being honest, why didn't you reveal yourself sooner?

497
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,540
The mighty Emperor was being punished by a mere mortal.

498
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,640
I couldn't watch it anymore.

499
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,160
Otherwise, why would I visit you?

500
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:09,820
Whether I was a deity or not, I am a member of the Lingxiao Sect.

501
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:12,820
I joined the sect, and I must follow the rules.

502
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:16,400
I made a mistake. I deserve to be punished.

503
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,120
Don't be so pedantic.

504
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,980
How could you accept this?

505
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:24,100
You've stooped so low, to live among peasants.

506
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,960
A demon doesn't understand loyalty.

507
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,140
I am a sword wraith. I'm not a demonic object.

508
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,480
In the Heavenly Realm, you bound me to this sword.

509
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,380
I followed you to the Mortal Realm. Then your master found me.

510
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,720
That was how I became your sword.

511
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:54,640
Since we already knew each other in heaven...

512
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:01,840
Do you know if I had ever had any ties with a woman?

513
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,360
For many years...

514
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,180
I keep seeing her in my dream.

515
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:16,020
However, I could never see her face.

516
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,000
She said I owed her my heart.

517
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,920
Stop! Enough.

518
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,680
I'm not interested in your love stories.

519
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:31,010
Many who possessed heavenly might and grand ambitions had their lives ruined because of love.

520
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:33,320
You're no fun. See you around.

521
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:37,660
You are the wraith of my sword. You're not human.

522
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:40,020
Do not come out unless it's necessary.

523
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:43,280
Your presence might surprise the others.

524
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,760
As if I care about your mortal coils.

525
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,380
I'm not interested at all.

526
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,780
Listen. Take care of your celestial vest.

527
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:55,320
I don't want another new master.

528
