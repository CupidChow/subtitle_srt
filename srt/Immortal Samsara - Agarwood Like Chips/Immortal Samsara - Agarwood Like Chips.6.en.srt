♫ <i> I made countless attempts to create my own fate </i> ♫

<i>[Episode 6]</i>

15
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:43,000
The Ice Spears drills into one's bones repeatedly and endlessly.

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,100
It's bone-chilling.

17
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,400
It's as painful as death by a thousand cuts.

18
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,600
It won't stop until one is dead.

19
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,500
Si Xuan has been working in the Magical Pavilion for thousands of years.

20
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,800
And she's made divine tools for many superior immortals.

21
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,570
When it came to humble immortal attendants, she was always soft spoken and she very caring.

22
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,300
All this torture she's being subjected to... its' just because she fell in love with someone?

23
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,700
The Heavenly Rules... are the foundation of becoming an immortal.

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,800
No exceptions are allowed.

25
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,700
They cannot be broken either.

26
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,600
Be it human or immortal, they all have feelings and emotions.

27
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,500
Yet the Heavenly Court doesn't allow immortals to fall in love. It goes against nature.

28
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,800
Let me ask you something.

29
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,800
If one day... I fall in love,

30
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,600
but I'm not hurting anyone, nor done anything wrong...

31
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,800
would you kill me?

32
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,500
<i>Ying Yuan, from now on, you must draw lessons from what happened to your mother.</i>

33
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,800
<i>Whoever breaks the rules, you have to personally get rid of it.</i>

34
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,500
<i>It is your responsibility as well as your sin.</i>

35
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,000
I would kill you.

36
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,100
Your Majesty, all the generals from the Divine Solider Division have arrived.

37
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,400
They are waiting for you in the courtyard.

38
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,300
One hundred times. Not one word less.

39
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,700
Two competent platoons from each army are to work in alternating shifts.

40
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,200
They will guard and patrol every key place within the Divine Realm strictly and resolutely.

41
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,200
Anyone entering and leaving Deity Intelligence Bureau or the Deity Soldier Division,

42
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,700
except for His Supreme Majesty and the Four Emperors, are to be rigorously interrogated and checked.

43
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,800
Considering the puzzling situation we are in, I cannot help but ask this ominous question.

44
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,800
If the Devils were to join forces and attack us from the Four Heavenly Gates

45
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:03,800
while our platoons are changing shifts, would that throw our army into confusion?

46
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,600
It won't be a problem.

47
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,099
My book of war talks most about multiple battlefields and back and forth battles.

48
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:14,400
It happens to solve this concern.

49
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,300
A Quadruple Cycle Attack?

50
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,500
This composition is also known as the Eternal Attack.

51
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,500
I heard that, for almost a thousand years, Your Majesty had been searching for help to solve it, but to no avail.

52
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,000
I wonder which superior immortal has solved it.

53
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,099
Someday, if she ever becomes a superior immortal, then the Divine Realm will be thrown into chaos.

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,700
As suggested by this composition, troops guarding and patrolling our realm appear to be nothing but disposable.

55
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,700
But they are actually the key to either success or failure.

56
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,400
In your opinion, who is the one who solved the composition?

57
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,300
To come up with such a brilliant strategy.

58
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,700
Indeed.

59
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,600
<i>[Yanxu Heavenly Palace]</i>

60
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,900
Yan Dan, are you done copying it?

61
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:27,300
If you ask for my help, for the sake of your loyalty, I can help you with ten copies of the Heavenly Rules.

62
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,100
I didn't mean what I said just now,

63
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:41,500
I just want you to abide by the Heavenly Rules and stay away from wrongdoings.

64
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,200
Well, it really was my wishful thinking.

65
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,600
Considering how lazy you are,

66
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,200
even if I gave you tens of thousands of years, you'll never cultivate into a superior immortal.

67
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,700
And how dare you bite the Divine Pivot Brush too?

68
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,100
You aren't even afraid of breaking your teeth.

69
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,200
Doesn't follow etiquette or rules.

70
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,600
Not even when you sleep.

One hundred written copies of the Heavenly Rules!

108
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,700
Was I muddle-headed yesterday?

109
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,200
And finished copying them in that state?

110
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,700
Or did that righteous Snail Girl help me again?

111
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,200
Ying Yuan, that despicable person.

112
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,000
He admitted that he's awful. Yet he still does such silly stuff.

113
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,700
How dull.

00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,919
Yan Dan is no longer what she used to be.

Day by day, she's becoming more amazing.

I'm so happy for her.

117
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:44,140
Well, before she got into the Yanxu Heavenly Palace, someone said she only relies on others.

118
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,420
Who would have thought that Yan Dan would get ahead of us all?

119
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,300
I'm afraid Zhi Xi will have to depend on Yan Dan in the future.

120
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,599
Zhi Xi is nothing more than a pretty face.

Yan Dan is really the strongest one among the twins.

It turns out that the entire Heavenly Palace... has already found out about my incompetence.

You are a dignified Deputy Curator.

Yet you needed to rely on an immortal attendant to save your skin.

Your little sister gains favor with His Supreme Majesty.

136
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,839
And she made up tales of your ineptitude with her follower.

137
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,820
You really have indeed lived up to my expectations.

138
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:01,400

I know you resent her.

140

But this humiliating notice was written by His Supreme Majesty himself.

141
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:16,399
You took it down on a whim.

142
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,080
Do you still follow the Heavenly Rules?

143
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,679
I admit my mistake.

144
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,440
Admit your mistake?

145
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,359
Well then, hold it and kneel for six hours.

146
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,359
Let those immortal attendants who pass by take a good look at you.

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,800
Witness how well your little sister treats you.

148
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,739
Divine Official Zhi Xi, the nonsense things we just said was just a joke.

149
00:14:03,739 --> 00:14:06,040
Please don't take it to heart.

150
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:13,780
Yan Dan would normally tell you that I'm a weakling and good-for-nothing.

151
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:18,600
- That's all a joke, is it?
- No, that's not it.

152
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,159
We don't know. We didn't say anything.

153
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,400
Let's go. Let's go...

154
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,599
Yan Dan usually cares about her sister the most.

155
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,980
If she found out that we ran our mouths and caused a problem here, we wouldn't be able to carry on with the play.

156
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,039
The Jade Pool Festival is in a few days.

157
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,459
If everything goes as planned, Zhi Xi will naturally forget about it.

158
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:37,379
- So you should just stop talking.
- All right.

159
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,460
<i>[Notice]</i>

160
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,060
Turns out everything I've ever done for you,

161
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,400
in your eyes,

162
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,240
was all a joke.

163
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,679
I say, you little tortoise,

164
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,919
it took me a lot of effort to get you out of the misery.

165
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,000
That has to account for something, right?

166
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,419
Now that you're a big tortoise, can you please be a bit more considerate of your benefactor?

167
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:27,800
Stay put, okay?

168
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,340
What are you doing?

169
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,600
What's wrong?

170
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,319
Is your body too hot?

171
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,820
Should I do some acupuncture on you?

172
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,079
What are you saying?

173
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,860
I'm a lotus, I don't understand your tortoise talk.

174
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,780
Forget about it.

175
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,380
I'll have Hei Tu treat you.

176
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,420
You Aquatic Clan fellows are all the same.

177
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,520
You're the ones who are supposed to make me happy.

178
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,640
Yet I'm the one coaxing you.

179
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,140
Forget it.

180
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,640
The more capable I am, the more responsibilities I have.

181
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,120
Yu Mo? Yu Mo?

182
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,639
You really are here.

183
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,380
You promised to have supper with me.

184
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,680
W-What are you drinking?

185
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,720
You're drinking liquor?

186
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,959
How old are you?

187
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,159
You're so young and already learning the bad things, like drinking!

188
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,020
Although this stuff doesn't taste good,

189
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,780
but drinking a lot of it

190
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,800
makes one happy.

191
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,219
What happiness are you talking about? Stop drinking.

192
00:16:46,219 --> 00:16:47,759
Open your eyes and take a look.

193
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,020
Who am I?

194
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:58,360
Did you know? I don't want the Divine Realm to remember them.

195
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,280
But at the same time, I want them to remember them.

196
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:11,160
For the sake of the Divine Realm as well as the covenant, they sacrificed everything including their lives.

197
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,620
Yet, what did they get in return?

198
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,210
I never even got to meet my father.

199
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:26,670
And... I will never see him again.

200
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,439
<i>Your Majesty, according to the promise made before the war,</i>

201
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:49,979
<i>reinforcements from both the Deity Realm and the Divine Realm should have been here with food and supplies three days ago.</i>

202
00:17:49,979 --> 00:17:52,820
<i>- Yet up to now...
- Though my immortal power</i>

203
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,779
<i>is no match for that of Ran Qing, the Primordial Lord who had sacrificed herself,</i>

204
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,020
<i>but I am not a coward.</i>

205
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,779
<i>I exchanged letters with Feng Yi.</i>

206
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,040
<i>We are not afraid to fight to the death.</i>

207
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:11,700
<i>My child will know that his parents gave him a happy and peaceful world.</i>

208
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,799
<i>But what I'm worried about is that there are those in the alliance who would try to consume the Nine Fins Clan's strength.</i>

209
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,779
<i>Without the Nine Fins Clan, that's one less clan competing with them for merits.</i>

210
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:22,260
<i>This is a fierce and dangerous battle.</i>

211
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,740
<i>we must stay focused.</i>

212
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,899
<i>I have no time to consider these cunning and selfish people's thoughts.</i>

213
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:35,479
<i>In case anything happens to me, I've dispatched a messenger to Immortal Lord Bei Ming.</i>

214
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:39,340
<i>I asked him to take my child away from the battlefield.</i>

215
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,900
<i>Kill!</i>

216
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,339
<i>Your Majesty, you're severely injured.</i>

217
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,320
<i>It's not the time for you to fight right now.</i>

218
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,560
<i>I'm fine.</i>

219
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,620
<i>Immortal Lord, the battle is critical here.</i>

220
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,360
<i>I beg you to take good care of my child.</i>

221
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:19,020
<i>I will always remember your kindness. Forever.</i>

222
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,980
<i>What?! The whole clan was annihilated?</i>

223
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,559
<i>Did you manage to save the Dragon King and Dragon Queen of the Nine Fins Clan?</i>

224
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:29,200
<i>The Asura Clan was tough.</i>

225
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,740
<i>Our reinforcements were late.</i>

226
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:36,020
<i>When they arrived there, all that was left were their bodies.</i>

227
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,799
<i>The Nine Fins Clan has always been valiant and good at fighting.</i>

228
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,540
<i>How could they have all been destroyed?</i>

229
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,820
<i>I know you've always been close with the Nine Fins Clan.</i>

230
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,140
<i>My condolences.</i>

231
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,560
Immortal Lord Bei Ming always told me,

232
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,740
only by forgetting the past can I go on living.

233
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,630
But he never told me

234
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,040
how to forget it.

235
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,140
You are...

236
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,600
You belong to the Nine Fins Clan.

237
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:47,120
You are... the little black fish I fed for 800 years.

238
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,880
Yu Mo, don't worry.

239
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:03,860
Since I managed to raise you, I will do my very best to take responsibility for you.

240
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:11,419
Although the Divine Realm is boring, not to mention strict, there is still a lot of warmth and happiness.

241
00:21:11,419 --> 00:21:16,699
From now on, not only do you have Immortal Lord Bei Ming, but you also have me to keep you company.

242
00:21:16,699 --> 00:21:19,300
You're no longer alone.

243
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,419
Ying Yuan, stop this at once.

244
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,799
If you keep this up, you will run out of your immortal power. It will cost your life.

245
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,960
Your Supreme Majesty, I am full of sins.

246
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,020
And I owe you for having nurtured and raised me.

247
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,600
I am willing to repay your kindness with my life.

248
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,040
Please grant my wish, Your Supreme Majesty.

249
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,820
Qi scatters all over one's body with the chest as the center.

250
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:14,020
With a worry-free mind comes a divine spirit.

251
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,500
It is to restore the heavenly peace and reshape Kunlun!

252
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,760
Ying Yuan. Quickly, calm your mind and restrain yourself!

253
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,020
Ying Yuan!

254
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,620
Ying Yuan.

255
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,920
He was almost possessed by evil spirits.

256
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,100
If that happened, it would be disastrous for both heaven and earth.

257
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:15,840
Ying Yuan, is your lineage a blessing, or a misfortune to the Six Realms?

258
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,600
<i>[Yanxu Heavenly Palace]</i>

259
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,080
You're awake.

260
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,120
The barrier...

261
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,599
The hate you're holding onto almost got you possessed by evil spirits.

262
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:07,419
Once your immortal power is depleted, you won't be able to suppress the devil nature.

263
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:10,920
Your Supreme Majesty. I would like to give it another try.

264
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:18,239
If I ever run out of immortal power and end up becoming a devil, please grant me death.

265
00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:20,200
You need not go soft on me.

266
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,620
Ying Yuan, you don't get it.

267
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,479
Once you've become a devil, it is no less a catastrophe for the Six Realms

268
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:33,600
than getting attacked by the entire Devil Realm.

269
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,320
Why so?

270
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,560
Your Supreme Majesty.

271
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,320
I don't know why.

272
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,140
Whenever I'm about to become a devil,

273
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,800
there are always random dreams that never stop.

274
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:53,160
I see in those dreams things I have never experienced.

275
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,820
As if they are from the past.

276
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,390
Silence!

277
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:04,680
If there comes a day when the Six Realms are free of hidden dangers

278
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:09,880
and you have eradicated the evil in your nature, I will tell you the answer.

279
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:16,480
Ying Yuan, I have put the primordial spirit into your immortal spirit.

280
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,959
You have to get rid of all the distracting thoughts and act selflessly.

281
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:23,400
Otherwise, you will be made the ultimate sinner.

282
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,760
Yes, Your Supreme Majesty.

283
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:38,020
<i>Ran Qing, now that you're gone, watching this world.</i>

284
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,780
<i>Rest assured.</i>

285
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:45,100
<i>The calamity that happened in the past, I will never let it repeat itself.</i>

286
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,760
It's time.

287
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,780
It's time to make our move!

288
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:40,620
Yan Dan, I'm sorry for what happened last night.

289
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,640
I never meant to hide it from you.

290
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,060
- It's just that it made me...
- If you're feeling apologetic, you shouldn't have drunk so much.

291
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,459
The Divine Realm is strictly guarded right now.

292
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:55,059
If you ended up doing drunk stuff and were taken as a devil,

293
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:58,760
you would be sent up to the Heavenly Gallows and whipped who knows how many times.

294
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,780
Forget it.

295
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,740
I also had too much to drink yesterday.

296
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,720
I don't remember what you told me anymore.

297
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,040
Really?

298
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,840
But there's one thing you can't go back on!

299
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,440
What is it?

300
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,819
No matter what you've been through or what you'll go through in the future,

301
00:27:19,819 --> 00:27:23,259
since you see me as your friend, you have to keep your word.

302
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,420
From now on, you can't ever be mad at me

303
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,020
and can't just suddenly disappear.

304
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,780
I can say mean things, but you cannot take them to heart.

305
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,740
Whenever you encounter difficulty, I have to be the first to know.

306
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:36,179
Be good and accept the fate of being taken care of. Got it?

307
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,000
Aren't these the conditions of a domineering overlord?

308
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,139
- Not happy with it?
- No, I am.

309
00:27:44,139 --> 00:27:45,880
I agree with all your conditions.

310
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,599
Yan Dan, I'm really have to thank you.

311
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,600
Before I met you,

312
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,140
my entire life was all darkness.

313
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:07,100
Ever since I met you, there's now light in my life.

314
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,220
And it is the only light.

315
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,440
It gives the darkness meaning,

316
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,280
and gives light meaning too.

317
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,860
Fine. Fine. Okay. Okay.

318
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,899
Well, let's add one more condition.

319
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,260
Unless I voluntarily open my arms to you,

320
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:30,700
- you aren't to take advantage of me like this again.
- Take advantage of you?

321
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:37,099
- Don't you know? You'll end up on the Heavenly Gallows if you hug people like that.
- Really?

322
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:39,320
Bear it in mind. Don't do that again.

323
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,020
I'm a proud intellectual.

324
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,379
Regardless of what opinions you hold, I won't change it again.

325
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,979
"In the fire, all that remains are the shouts and battle cries of the Nine Fins Clan."

326
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:12,760
Is this considered the Nine Fins Clan's fight to the death?

327
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,459
I didn't say that.

328
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,760
That's your own understanding of it.

329
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,599
Next, I should tell the story from a different perspective.

330
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:26,859
I'll start with that of Star Deity Ji Du, Huan Qin, who went on the expedition with the Four Emperors.

331
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,020
Oh right!

332
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,320
I almost forgot the most important thing.

333
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,700
Why did you bring it along?

334
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,459
It's at a rebellious age.

335
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:42,899
Whenever I come home, I see it trying frantically to crawl out the window.

336
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:44,400
I have no idea what is the matter with it.

337
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,260
It won't eat and won't receive acupuncture.

338
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:50,199
Both of you belong to the Aquatic Clan and you're close to one another.

339
00:29:50,199 --> 00:29:52,540
Quick, listen, what is it trying to say?

340
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,400
Let me hear it out.

341
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,440
It says Ying Yuan goes into your room to flip it all the time.

342
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,819
It can't stand staying in the Divine Realm any longer.

343
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,739
It wants freedom or rather starve itself to death.

344
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:12,459
Well, releasing an immortal beast into the mortal world is against the Heavenly Rules.

345
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,560
- What do we do then?
- Break the Heavenly Rules then.

346
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,379
I can't just let it die from a hunger strike in my room, right?

347
00:30:18,379 --> 00:30:21,360
But, you just mentioned that the realm is strictly guarded.

348
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:27,159
Even so, who would dare stop me as long as I have the token of the Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

349
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,260
The ground has been swept clean,

350
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,300
but look, the flowers and plants are all dusty.

351
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,260
Hurry and clean them up.

352
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,500
His Majesty likes things to be clean the most.

353
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,660
You mustn't take it lightly.

354
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,600
Stop right there.

355
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,759
I've never had any problems retrieving stuff from the mortal world.

356
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:23,179
- Why are you stopping me?
- Emperor Qingli has issued a strict decree.

357
00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:26,020
Those evildoers from the Devil Realm have repeatedly disrupted the peace within the Divine Realm.

358
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:29,799
To prevent troublemakers from sneaking into the Divine Realm, we have locked the Southern Heavenly Gate.

359
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:31,620
Without the token of either His Supreme Majesty or His Majesty,

360
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,280
none of the immortals are allowed to leave or enter the realm.

361
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,060
Take a good look at this.

362
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,220
I am Star Deity Tai You.

363
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,080
Do I look like some thief from the Devil Realm to you?!

364
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,420
It's nothing but a trivial matter.

365
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:44,219
- Yet you want me to ask the Emperor Ying Yuan to come here?
- Yes.

366
00:31:44,219 --> 00:31:45,880
How presumptuous!

367
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,540
You would treat me so disrespectfully?

368
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,560
Aren't you afraid of the thunder whip on the Heavenly Gallows?!

369
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,660
I am just doing my job.

370
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,559
Your Majesty, there is a letter on the arrow.

371
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,600
How audacious these scheming devils are!

372
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,259
They have no respect for the firm rules of the Divine Realm!

373
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,759
Aren't they afraid of His Supreme Majesty's wrath of thunder?!

374
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:34,120
Of course, not.

375
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,120
The Devil King, Xuan Xiang, has started his open rebellion.

376
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,439
Your Majesty, the vanguard has been divided into two groups.

377
00:32:40,439 --> 00:32:42,180
It is known that one of them has barged into our realm.

378
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:45,939
Judging from their direction, they are on their way to Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

379
00:32:45,939 --> 00:32:47,820
Send this letter to His Supreme Majesty at once.

380
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,579
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Hurry up.

381
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,700
Look at you, I thought about helping you become an immortal.
<i>[Pavilion of Stars]</i>

382
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:05,230
Yet having taken another look at you, such a tiny body and brainless.

383
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:12,000
If you go the mortal world like this and end up in a market, it's more complicated than being flipped over.

384
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,360
Besides, we don't have any tokens to mark our relationship.

385
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,600
When I'm in the mortal world, how do I recognize you?

386
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,380
<i>[Yanxu]</i>

387
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,299
She works in Ying Yuan's palace. We will take her as a hostage.

388
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:31,120
- Get her!
<i>- Yes!</i>

389
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,640
Hold on!

390
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,620
Little Devil Brother, is there some kind of misunderstanding?

391
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,820
I don't know Emperor Ying Yuan at all.

392
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,700
There's no use taking me as a hostage.

393
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:58,719
Also, I heard that Emperor Ying Yuan has reconfigured the Divine Realm's defense.

394
00:33:58,719 --> 00:34:02,639
If you insist on attacking it now, I'm afraid you will fall into his trap.

395
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:06,540
Are there any traps to the north of the Divine Realm?

396
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,819
Of course, there are.

397
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:12,399
From here to north of the Divine Realm, there are countless heavenly generals and soldiers lying in ambush.

398
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,980
Little Devil Brother, where are you heading to?

399
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,899
Is it Hanyue Palace or Biluo Hall?

400
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,060
Why don't I take you there?

401
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
Deity Destruction Sword?

402
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,200
Your Majesty?

403
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,000
How are you? Are you all right?

404
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,500
I'm fine.

405
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,000
The Deity Destruction Sword is Elder Shuo Hua's magical weapon.

406
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,800
It is the toughest thing from the Devil Realm.

407
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,800
It can split mountains and seas.

408
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,400
Never thought this thing... would be unable to hurt you.

409
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,000
You are Shuo Hua's favorite general, Tuo Feng.

410
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,700
You must have come entrusted with some critical tasks.

411
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,400
Tell me,

412
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,000
I won't kill defeated generals.

413
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,500
The grand plan of Devil Realm will be revealed on the day you perish.

414
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:39,400
They put themselves under the death curse and were willing to sacrifice their own lives.

415
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,800
What exactly were they planning to do with the Deity Destruction Sword?

416
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,200
Forget about Deity Destruction whatever, they've already been defeated.

417
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,400
This wound of yours...

418
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,200
It's alright.

419
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,800
How are you doing?

420
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,600
I'm fine.

421
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,600
You could have stopped him with your immortal power.

422
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,100
Why did you save me?

423
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,700
The Deity Destruction Sword has a very strong demonic power.

424
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,600
It can break any divine arts.

425
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:10,000
I just didn't want to see you getting cut in half.

426
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,800
That said, you do have some semblance of a conscience.

427
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,499
Do you want to visit the Heavenly Infirmary?

428
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,600
What if that sword was covered with poison?

429
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,300
So noisy.

430
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,200
You head back to the Yanxu Heavenly Palace first.

431
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,800
The Devil Realm has openly declared war on the Divine Realm.

432
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,300
A great battle is coming at any moment,

433
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,800
every minute and second count.

434
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,600
I am going to the hall and to receive orders.

435
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,680
<i>[Yan Dan's script - Before the war...]</i>

436
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,960
<i>[Emperor Ying Yuan smiled and flipped the tortoise over]</i>

437
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,500
You thought to bring medication for my wound?

438
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,800
You do have some semblance of a conscience.

439
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,800
So, you're the Snail Girl?

440
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,600
The War of Genesis is the root of the formation of the Six Realms.

441
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,300
It is a serious matter.

442
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:28,600
I was just afraid you'd simply make up stories and affect the Yanxu Heavenly Palace's reputation.

443
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,200
That's why I included a comment or two in it.

444
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,600
You must come to the performance during the Jade Pool Festival!

445
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,600
I've even signed your name.

446
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,400
Though it's signed as "The Snail Girl".

447
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,000
Don't forget!

448
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,400
Sorry, sorry. I'll help you put on the bandage.

449
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,700
- I can manage it myself.
- It's all right. Let me do it.

450
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,900
I said I could manage on my own.

451
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,800
I'm happy to help.

452
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,600
It must be really painful, right?

453
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,600
I read your manuscript.

454
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,000
It's quite interesting.

455
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,600
If you can adapt it into a stage play,

456
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,500
it'll definitely be deeply moving.

457
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:50,100
But, what a shame. I might not be able to see it.

458
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:57,100
What I was worried about the most... has happened.

459
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:05,900
Just now at the Southern Heavenly Gate, those men you encountered were the vanguard of Devil Realm.

460
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,200
The Devil King has already openly declared war on us.

461
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,000
Together with the Demon Realm, they are attempting to overthrow the Nine Heavens.

462
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,300
The Divine Realm's envoy, Tao Ziqi, was killed by them and made into a sacrificial offering to the battle flag.

463
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,000
A letter from Huan Qin came just now, reminding His Supreme Majesty,

464
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
that the Demon, Devil, and Underworld Realms have prepared millions of soldiers.

465
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,800
Ready to attack at any time.

466
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,500
He's lying low within the Devil Realm and ready to provide reinforcement.

467
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:36,000
In four hours' time I will lead our troops on an expedition.

468
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,400
You're the number one god of war within the Six Realms.

469
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,200
I'm sure you won't have any problems.

470
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:48,500
You managed to subdue those devil generals and soldiers in one sweep.

471
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:53,000
If wasn't for you having to protect this little immortal attendant, who could have hurt you?

472
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,400
I hope so.

473
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:06,000
If I manage to return safely, I'll surely watch and enjoy your "The Tale of The Genesis Hero".

474
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,400
But you need to bear this in mind.

475
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,600
When I'm gone, you can't slack off.

476
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,500
After I'm back, I'm going to check on your cultivation carefully.

477
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,200
Got it?

478
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,800
Don't you love freedom?

479
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,800
When I'm off to the mortal world, no one is going to keep an eye on you.

480
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,600
By then, you can have an easy time of it and be a little bit lazy.

481
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,400
Live more at ease, right?

482
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:41,100
Then have you found out the reason why those devil soldiers came up here with Elder Shuo Hua's magic weapon?

483
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:48,700
When they were holding you hostage, did they mention their motive for coming here?

484
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:53,400
I only remember they said they were heading to the north of the Divine Realm.

485
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,500
But I didn't manage to elicit the exact location from them.

486
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,800
North of the Divine Realm?

487
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,800
It has neither artifacts nor divine elixirs.

488
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,200
And it's not where the hidden military deployments are.

489
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,800
It's also without immortal beasts or divine scriptures.

490
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,900
Why would they go there?

491
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:17,500
Besides, the Deity Destruction Sword can't break the barrier.

492
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,000
Let's stop here.

493
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,600
- If you...
- No ifs.

494
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,600
You're so amazing.

495
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,500
I'm sure everything will be fine.

496
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,700
Of course, I will be back.

497
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:41,600
The "if" I'm talking about is that you have to remember,

498
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:47,800
if you ever encounter such danger again, don't put your life at risk.

499
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,600
The Deity Destruction Sword is extremely violent.

500
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,400
One stroke from it and all your immortality will be gone.

501
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,000
Got it?

502
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:02,800
It has always been my responsibility to guard the Six Realms.

503
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,400
All you need to do is to protect yourself.

504
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,200
You sound rather confident.

505
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:55,700
