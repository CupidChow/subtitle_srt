<i>Yan Dan, I know it was you...</i>

00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,660
<i>who kept me company in the Land Under the Horizon.</i>

<i>But I can't watch you die from the punishment of love.</i>

<i>Yan Dan...</i>

23
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,400
<i>Forgive me.</i>

24
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,300
Who's there?

25
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,480
Yu Mo!

26
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,020
Yan Dan.

27
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,679
Why are you here? Weren't you grounded?

28
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:28,760
Yan Dan. How did you get this badly hurt?

29
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,140
It was Zhao Lan.

30
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,760
It was Zhao Lan who helped me dismantle the barrier set up by Marshal Huo De.

31
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,539
No one's here right now. Let's hurry and get out of here.

32
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:42,560
Are you crazy?

33
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,799
You would dare break me out of the Heavenly Prison? Do you want to die?

34
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,039
I remember you told me that I should serve you until you are old.

35
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:55,439
Now that you're in distress and badly injured, I can't just sit by and do nothing.

36
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,720
Yan Dan. You were seriously injured before.

37
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,719
You should know how much the sight of it pained me.

38
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:07,079
So, even if it's just a minute possibility, I will still take it so that no harm will ever come to you again.

39
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,780
I can't run away.

40
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,240
If I flee now, I'll be seen as guilty.

41
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,900
It would be like admitting I really did poison her.

42
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,499
Only by staying here can I prove my innocence. That's why I can't leave.

43
00:05:19,499 --> 00:05:22,119
- But...
- No more buts.

44
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,480
Don't worry.

45
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:35,600
Emperor Ying Yuan has already promised that he'll send me to Mortal Realm and protect my life.

46
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,980
I can safely leave the Heavenly Court.

47
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,379
Did he really promise you that?

48
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,630
Of course!

49
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:46,420
Didn't His Supreme Majesty also give me his word that I could go through the Mortal Realm hardships on behalf of my sister?

50
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,672
Yu Mo, I've never been to Mortal Realm.

51
00:05:50,672 --> 00:05:52,819
How about this? Why don't you go to Mortal Realm first for me?

52
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,700
Find me a beautiful place with green mountains and blue water.

53
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,919
Once I'm in Mortal Realm, I'll meet up with you. Okay?

54
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,739
No.

55
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,559
After three days, wait for me at the Heavenly Gallows.

56
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:08,779
No matter what, I won't let them hurt you again.

57
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:13,339
Once you've fully recovered, let's visit Mortal Realm together.

58
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:20,200
Just like you wrote in your scripts, we'll be two traveling heroes who bring peace to all beings.

59
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,830
What do you think?

60
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,860
Sure.

61
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,440
Oh, right.

62
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,880
Yan Dan.

63
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,400
Egg fried rice?

64
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,440
We ate this when we first met.

65
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,940
I see you've learned how to make it.

66
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,140
Doesn't matter if it was the first time, or the ones after that, even the 100th one...

67
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:51,740
I won't forget any of the midnight suppers we've had together.

68
00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:00,840
Yu Mo. I'm really happy to have fed a loyal black fish like you.

69
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,260
I'm also really happy to have become your friend.

70
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,860
Me too.

71
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,440
Hurry. Try it.

72
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,299
What do you think? Is it delicious?

73
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,580
<i>Yu Mo, I'm sorry.</i>

74
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,460
Your Majesty. Even though Yan Dan is a lowly immortal attendant, she has committed a serious crime.

75
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,200
We should keep a close watch on her.

76
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,430
If there are any mishaps...

77
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,059
I will escort her there myself. There will be no mishaps.

78
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,600
The time has arrived.

79
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,140
Bring Yan Dan to the Heavenly Gallows.

80
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,540
Anyone else not needed will be dismissed.

81
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,760
I really didn't poison her.

82
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,000
I don't care if others believe me or not.

83
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,120
But can you believe me?

84
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,299
<i>Yan Dan might still survive the punishment of fire.</i>

85
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,439
<i>It's better than serving the fatal punishment that is the punishment of love.</i>

86
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,080
Since things have come to this, knowing how strict the Heavenly Rules are,

87
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,240
you are to serve your punishment.

88
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,260
So you threw all my belongings out of Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

89
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:38,920
And today, you'll personally watch me serve my sentence.

90
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,340
Not only do you not believe me,

91
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,840
but do you really hate me this much?

92
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,460
Only law prevails in my heart.

93
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,820
There is no fondness or contempt.

94
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,860
I am merely enforcing the rules today.

95
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,840
You will understand once you step onto the Heavenly Gallows.

96
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,520
Do not resist anymore.

97
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,660
<i>It seems...</i>

98
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,959
<i>what I did in the cottage and in the Heavenly Palace was all for nothing.</i>

99
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:20,640
<i>Not only did you fail to recognize me, but I also failed to discern your true character.</i>

100
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:34,080
<i>[Bridge of Emptiness]</i>

101
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:46,340
<i>If you regain your sight one day,</i>

102
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,680
<i>will you be able to recognize me?</i>

103
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,180
<i>I will.</i>

104
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,320
<i>But that day will never arrive.</i>

105
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,040
<i>I don't care.</i>

106
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,040
<i>I'll take it as a promise then.</i>

107
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:12,630
<i>If one day you can't recognize me, I'll throw you off the Bridge of Emptiness!</i>

108
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,360
This is the Bridge of Emptiness.

109
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,700
The fire sanction is a minor punishment.

110
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,180
It won't put your life at risk.

111
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,899
But if you jump from here, your soul will shatter.

112
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:45,580
It's not worth it.

113
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:50,700
You think those who jumped from here were trying to escape the punishment of love.

114
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,940
They jumped from here because they believed there was nothing wrong with their love!

115
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,260
Yan Dan.

116
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,160
Dishonoring the Heavenly Rules is a serious crime.

117
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,540
Do I not carry enough sins as it is?

118
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,480
I did not poison anyone, but I was found guilty of it.

119
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,720
And now...

120
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:34,480
I'm also guilty of falling in love, guilty of being unwilling to let go, and guilty of showing sympathy.

121
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,440
I want to ask you.

122
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:43,180
Am I the worst offender ever, or are the Heavenly Rules absurd and abominable?

123
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,300
She fell in love?

124
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,820
You are but a young immortal attendant.

125
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,000
What do you know of love?

126
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,320
Stop talking nonsense.

127
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,420
That's right.

128
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,760
I'm just a little lotus plant.

129
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,319
But I know more about love than a lofty emperor like you.

130
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,480
You once said...

131
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,780
that one day, if I fell in love,

132
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,080
you would kill me yourself.

133
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,240
I've fallen in love already.

134
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,360
So why haven't you ended my life yet?

135
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:40,019
Your Majesty, this woman has gone mad and violated the Heavenly Rules. This cannot be tolerated!

136
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,579
Do not touch her!

137
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,520
Save whatever you want to say...

138
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,460
until after you've served your sentence.

139
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,620
I want to ask you this.

140
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,000
As an emperor,

141
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:12,720
you've seen the ups and downs of the Three Realms for tens of thousands of years, seen eons.

142
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:18,120
In your heart, was there really no one

143
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:23,420
or nothing that moved your heart?

144
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:27,160
That made you want to free yourself from the shackles of the Heavenly Rules?

145
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,200
Yan Dan. The answer you seek...

146
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,580
isn't as important as your life.

147
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,819
Do you not understand?

148
00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:38,960
But I want that answer right now!

149
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:49,040
Whether it was in Yanxu Heavenly Palace, or in the cottage in the Land Under the Horizon,

150
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,380
no matter the time, the location, or the nature of your feelings,

151
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,200
did you ever have me in your heart?

152
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,920
My heart is devoted to all beings.

153
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,620
There is no room for anything else.

154
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:42,340
<i>Ying Yuan, I stood on the Heavenly Gallows for you once before. I won't do it a second time.</i>

155
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:51,200
<i>The agarwood ember flickered wearily, the ash scattered endlessly.</i>

156
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:19,060
The throes of my previous life were all in vain.

157
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,840
And further longing...

158
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,980
has no meaning.

159
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,800
<i>If I knew it would end like this,</i>

160
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:52,100
<i>I wish the lotus never had bloomed.</i>

161
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:08,200
What a fool.

162
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,650
<i>[Bridge of Emptiness]</i>

163
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,220
Where is Yan Dan? Where is Yan Dan?!

164
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,700
She jumped off the Bridge of Emptiness.

165
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,600
For those who jump from this bridge, in the best-case scenario, their immortal spirit will be shattered.

166
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,319
Their immortal connection will be severed, and they can never be a deity again.

167
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:52,920
In the worst-case scenario, their soul will disintegrate and disappear into emptiness.

168
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,840
Yan Dan!

169
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,359
What exactly happened?!

170
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:20,179
After His Supreme Majesty learned that Emperor Ying Yuan jumped off the bridge too, he set this barrier up in a fit of fury.

171
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:24,640
He ordered that no one is to set foot in this place.

172
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,480
It's all my fault.

173
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,919
If I had noticed something unusual about you earlier and have left with you...

174
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,240
none of this would have happened.

175
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,860
<i>Yan Dan, don't worry.</i>

176
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:09,520
<i>Whether you're in the far corners of the world or in the depths of hell, I will find you.</i>

177
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,440
Emperor Ying Yuan?

178
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,740
I preserved some of your immortal power for the time being.

179
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,220
Your immortal spirit has completely shattered.

180
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,740
I'm afraid it can never recover.

181
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,000
On the bridge just now... you made yourself clear.

182
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,200
Why did you follow me here and save me?

183
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:24,940
You need not go through this hassle for me.

184
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:32,880
I know. You didn't tell me you saved me in order to protect your sister.

185
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,440
So...

186
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,120
you knew it was me all along.

187
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,540
You remembered our promise.

188
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,840
You know everything.

189
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,259
Then why did you say those hurtful words on the bridge?

190
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:07,560
Now that your immortal spirit and connection are gone, you will not be able to return to the Heavenly Court.

191
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,520
We'll have to bid farewell to each other here.

192
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,180
Night Forgetting River.

193
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:32,560
So... you didn't come for me.

194
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,740
You're here to send me off.

195
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,280
Immortals aren't allowed to fall in love.

196
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,640
This is the destiny of those in the Heavenly Realm.

197
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,480
No one can escape from it.

198
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:59,040
Even though I recognized you, the sacred Heavenly Rules... must be upheld.

199
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,980
All right, then.

200
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,020
If that's true...

201
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,240
Why did you jump off the Bridge of Emptiness with me?

202
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,100
Why did you risk your life to save me?

203
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:21,620
Why do you give me hope over and over again, just to destroy it in front of me?

204
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:34,740
I owe my eyes and half of my heart to you.

205
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,680
I can't possibly repay you.

206
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:45,080
You owe me more than that.

207
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,060
And this.

208
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,780
The Butterfly of Lucid Dreams is forbidden in Heavenly Realm.

209
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,420
It should never have existed.

210
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:21,820
In the Land Under the Horizon, you used agarwood embers to persuade me to live.

211
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,240
Yan Dan.

212
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,220
Do you know that it is symbolic of something else?

213
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:37,580
It has a tangible form and emits a formless fragrance.

214
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,060
This is it's essence.

215
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:46,700
In other words, it both has a form and doesn't have a form.

216
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,540
When it takes shape...

217
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,920
it's time to meet.

218
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,580
When it turns formless...

219
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,900
it's time to part.

220
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,460
I finally understand.

221
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,700
It's time for us to go our separate ways.

222
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,660
It's time to let go.

223
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,059
The living have their world and so do the dead.

224
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:30,080
The land of the deceased is called the Night Forgetting River.

225
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,200
I'm Yi Zang, the guide here.

226
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,999
Miss, you trespassed into this place and your soul is damaged.

227
00:26:35,999 --> 00:26:42,639
Only by traversing the Night Forgetting River and erasing your previous life can you take the Afterlife Path and leave this place.

228
00:26:42,639 --> 00:26:45,359
You will become a mortal and enter the Mortal Realm.

229
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:49,400
I will guide you across this river.

230
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,320
And if I can't?

231
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,080
I've held this position for millennia.

232
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,600
Most can cross this river within a day.

233
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,860
But there are some who might want to remember their previous life a little longer.

234
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:09,979
If you cannot traverse the river today, you can rest in the inn and try again the next day.

235
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,400
Every passenger carries a lantern.

236
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,220
This lantern contains your memories.

237
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,779
When you step into the Forgetting River, the lantern will light up.

238
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:29,500
And when you let go of your memories, your lantern will extinguish.

239
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:03,520
The moment I jumped off the Bridge of Emptiness, I was ready to die.

240
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:12,660
But if I have the chance to live, I'll forget about you, forget about us.

241
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,940
I will start over.

242
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:24,020
What you're too afraid to admit... I'll make sure it's seared in your mind.

243
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,900
You owe me.

244
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:35,300
As my compensation, I want you to watch me as I enter the Night Forgetting River

245
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,540
and witness how I forget you completely.

246
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,880
<i>Yan Dan. I'm sorry.</i>

247
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:25,180
<i>Forgive me for having pulled a sleight of hand with the cocoon.</i>

248
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,900
<i>Only by doing this...</i>

249
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:32,080
<i>will you give up completely.</i>

250
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,080
Your Majesty, you aren't a passenger.

251
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,539
The hellish aura here will harm your health. Please return.

252
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:50,000
I will... once I see her off.

253
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:56,760
Passengers will have to let go of their previous life to enter the Afterlife Path.

254
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:03,220
If you keep standing here, she might not be able to let go of you.

255
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:12,260
<i>This is the only thing... I can do for you.</i>

256
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,020
Your Supreme Majesty.

257
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,659
What an eventful day today.

258
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,220
First, the heavenly soldiers came with bad news.

259
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,280
Then the Heavenly Prosecutor came to ask questions.

260
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,179
Other immortals submitted memorials too.

261
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:56,380
You must be here for the same thing, right?

262
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:01,720
I violated the Heavenly Rules and entered the Night Forgetting River.

263
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,639
I'm here to accept my punishment.

264
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:05,940
So you know there's a punishment?

265
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,359
The war just ended, and there are a thousand things to get done.

266
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:14,339
As the Emperor, you should set an example for the Three Realms.

267
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:17,920
But instead, you violated the Heavenly Rules.

268
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,180
Do you admit your guilt?

269
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,040
Yes, I do.

270
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,300
I've let you down, Your Supreme Majesty.

271
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,860
Enough. Get up.

272
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,260
Get up!

273
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,019
Enough already.

274
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:48,260
Thankfully, you came back before this got out of hand.

275
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:51,180
As for this matter, I'll have someone take care of it.

276
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,140
Go reflect upon yourself.

277
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,020
There's no need to show me leniency, Your Supreme Majesty.

278
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,720
I wish to be punished.

279
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,980
Please agree to my request.

280
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,780
<i>Greetings, Your Supreme Majesty, Your Majesty.</i>

281
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,880
Emperor Ying Yuan you are extremely powerful.

282
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,359
Who wounded you like this?

283
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:21,300
Do not worry, Marshal. I'm all right.

284
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,180
I'm glad to hear that.

285
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,659
So what is happening?

286
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:31,339
I waited next to the Heavenly Gallows for a long time, but the criminal is yet to be seen.

287
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,920
Sorry for the long wait, Marshal.

288
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,920
The criminal is here.

289
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,220
<i>[Love]</i>

290
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:03,420
Ying Yuan, are you aware of the implications of choosing the punishment of love?

291
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,939
The war just ended.

292
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,420
The number of immortals in the Nine Heavens has dwindled.

293
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,460
You're the only emperor left.

294
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,700
Worry not, Your Supreme Majesty.

295
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:21,000
I survived the war, and I shall cherish my life.

296
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:25,960
However, I did commit this crime, so I shall be adequately punished.

297
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:31,759
I will preserve enough immortal power to keep myself alive so that I can serve the Heavenly Realm.

298
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,940
Please punish me, Your Supreme Majesty.

299
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:30,300
Your Supreme Majesty, I have served His Majesty and I can attest to his selfless dedication to the people.

300
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,530
I'm sure His Majesty didn't intend to violate the Heavenly Rules.

301
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:36,540
Please... Your Supreme Majesty, pardon him.

302
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:46,719
Your Supreme Majesty, Emperor Ying Yuan didn't commit the most heinous of crimes.

303
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:51,199
Besides, I promised I would give him the Letter of Immunity yesterday.

304
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:55,040
Your Supreme Majesty, let's just end this here.

305
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,580
No need to plead on my behalf, Marshal.

306
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,420
I made a mistake.

307
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:16,760
I failed His Supreme Majesty's education and let my colleagues down.

308
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,480
I also did her wrong.

309
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,760
I wonder which one is more painful.

310
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,360
This punishment, or the act of gouging one's heart out?

311
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:09,800
Your Supreme Majesty, His Majesty was merely affected by Yan Dan.

312
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,579
Please remove her from His Majesty's memory.

313
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:18,159
If the root of the problem is eradicated, he won't commit the offense again and there'll be no need for further punishment.

314
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:24,780
Your Supreme Majesty, His Majesty has served the Heavenly Realm for many years.

315
