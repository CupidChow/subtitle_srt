<i>[Episode 49]</i>

15
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,360
Back then, I didn't like the strict rules in the Nine Heavens.

16
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,120
I thought it was unreasonable.

17
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,800
But now, I've experienced the Mortal Realm once.

18
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:49,540
Only then did I realize that someone sacrificed themselves for the greater good.

19
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,920
As a result, the Three Realms is protected.

20
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,990
And it is because of them,

21
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,300
that demons like me and others can live a carefree and easy life.

22
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,980
Things have changed.

23
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,860
Why force things?

24
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,100
You have your own responsibilities.

25
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,280
And I have mine.

26
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,140
Go back and fulfill your duty as emperor.

27
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,760
I have to protect my family as well.

28
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,840
You should go.

29
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,040
What if I insist on doing this?

Spring is back!

39

The mountain is back to the way it was.

Look, Sister. Spring is back!

41
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,740
There is food for the Fox Clan again.

If everything went back to where it began and the agarwood was reignited,

48
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,040
would you change your mind?

49
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,780
How many times do you want me to tell you?

50
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,520
For us to be together... It's impossible!

51
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,140
But you've looked back already, haven't you?

52
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,440
Yan Dan...

53
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,700
I'm willing to wait.

54
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,760
Waiting for you to come back to me again.

55
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,420
The incense burner I gave you... is right here.

56
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,300
As long as our hearts and our feelings are still there,

57
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,360
the lingering feeling will never disappear.

58
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,260
I'm the emperor.

59
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,160
I'm also Tang Zhou.

60
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:13,970
When I complete my duty as emperor, Tang Zhou will come back

61
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,120
to spend the rest of his life with you.

62
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,760
Yan Dan,

63
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,380
wait for me.

64
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,400
The letter from Tianxin Temple was burned.

65
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,260
But Ying Yuan is still investigating it and won't give up.

66
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,620
Do you want me to intervene again?

67
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,520
There's no rush.

68
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,220
Even if he suspects now, it's already too late.

69
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,400
<i>It's already been five days.</i>

70
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,020
<i>Why hasn't Lu Ming come yet?</i>

71
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,960
Your Majesty!

72
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,380
I was going to tell Lu Ming about Yan Dan.

73
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,240
But I've searched all over the Heavenly Realm the past few days, he is nowhere to be seen.

74
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,700
The immortal attendants of Yuqing Palace said it's been a long time since they last saw Lu Ming.

75
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,560
I felt something was wrong, so I rummaged through the Pavilion of Books.

76
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,980
All I found was the Merfolk Orb he left behind, but I don't know how to use it.

77
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,040
This is the magic weapon of the merfolk.

78
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,340
Only merfolk can activate it.

79
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,520
Perhaps this will be helpful.

80
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,500
What is this place?

81
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,680
The Merfolk are part of the Aquatic Clan of the North Sea.

82
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,300
This should be in the realm of the North Sea.

83
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,700
It must be a hint from Lu Ming. I have to go there and take a look.

84
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,400
You haven't recovered fully yet. You shouldn't work so hard.

85
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,380
It's all right. Without Ground Block, the hot spring has lost its efficacy.

86
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,980
Now, I'm turning lotus spiritual power into a lotus to put it into the pool.

87
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,470
It makes it look nice and it can improve the efficacy of healing.

88
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:12,370
So if the demons in the mountain are injured, they can keep bathing here and heal their wounds.

89
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,780
It'll serve two purposes then, right?

90
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,780
You're such a responsible supporter.

91
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,560
Zi Lin should learn more from you.

92
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,720
Now all he does is stick to his wife.

93
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,280
He doesn't care about the mountain at all.

94
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,140
Elder, why have you come?

95
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,600
His Highness, Lu Ming, has been missing for days now.

96
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,000
Did something happen to him?

97
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,960
His Highness works in the Heavenly Realm all year round.

98
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,840
He contacts us through the Merfolk Orb every day to handle the affairs of the North Sea.

99
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,700
For the past few days, we haven't received any messages from His Highness.

100
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,420
We could only cast a spell and activate the Merfolk Orb.

101
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,140
All we can see is this image.

102
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,560
This is the secret territory of the Merfolk known as Crystal Falls.

103
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,760
Since it is most sacred, there's a barrier.

104
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,420
No one from our clan can break it.

105
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,800
Even Her Majesty, the Dragon Queen, can't break through the barrier either.

106
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,460
We're anxiously looking for His Highness.

107
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,520
So Her Majesty told us to come to Yelan Mountain to ask for help.

108
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,820
Please don't worry, Elder.

109
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,020
I'll definitely try everything I can to figure out the truth and find Lu Ming.

110
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,960
Yan Dan.

111
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,320
<i>Yu Mo, I know that you want to go to the North Sea with me.</i>

112
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,180
<i>But the mountain just experienced a great disaster.</i>

113
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,300
<i>You should stay and guard the mountain so that the demons can feel at ease.</i>

114
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,500
<i>Don't worry. My cultivation base is enough now.</i>

115
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,620
<i>I'm sure I can use my power to protect myself and get Lu Ming back.</i>

116
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,080
<i>Please trust me.</i>

117
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,780
<i>Don't worry or miss me.</i>

118
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,500
<i>Wait for me, I'll return safely.</i>

119
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,180
Yu Mo.

120
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,260
Where is Yan Dan? Has she left already?

121
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:01,680
Who was it that went missing that made the two of you so worried?

122
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,480
If you're worried, just go after her right now.

123
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,080
You can still catch up with her.

124
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,780
Since Yan Dan has made up her mind, I should respect her.

125
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:22,660
I believe that she'll get Lu Ming back.

126
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,820
Yan Dan.

127
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,980
Why are you here?

128
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,480
You came to the North Sea too.

129
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,400
You must've heard that Lu Ming went missing.

130
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,380
Are there any clues about him in the Heavenly Realm?

131
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,200
From Lu Ming's Merfolk Orb, I saw the waterscape of the North Sea.

132
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,200
So I followed the trace and came here.

133
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,920
Since we've run into each other, let's investigate it together.

134
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,060
<i>What matters is finding Lu Ming.</i>

135
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,360
<i>I don't know what the situation in the North Sea is like.</i>

136
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,200
<i>Another person means more help to be had.</i>

137
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,080
All right, then.

138
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,400
According to the Elder, this should be Crystal Falls.

139
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,640
These are the Merfolk Tears that store memories.

140
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,700
We're too late.

141
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,120
I just used the Seven Immortal Powers to break this barrier.

142
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,680
The person who came before us must've been powerful.

143
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,920
Let's go check if that person left behind any leads.

144
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,360
There's a monument over here!

145
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,180
"Hundreds of generations of merfolk, numerous descendants."

146
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:28,020
"The Crystal Falls was formed to worship our ancestors."

147
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,980
"Life is short. We all return to the earth."

148
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,120
"Year after year, you're remembered forever."

149
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,100
This is the ancestral hall of the Merfolk.

150
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,320
It is usually a place where they worship their ancestors.

151
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,340
If Lu Ming's Merfolk Orb is here, could it be...

152
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,300
It's impossible.

153
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,380
Lu Ming must have left me some more clues.

154
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,620
How could this be?

155
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,900
Impossible.

156
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,160
Yan Dan, Lu Ming gave us a hint to come here...

157
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,680
Is he already...

158
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,360
Impossible.

159
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,280
Lu Ming isn't dead.

160
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,900
He must have been trying to leave me some clues.

161
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,080
I'm sure he's fine!

162
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,340
Yan Dan.

163
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,960
You can't activate the Merfolk Orb.

164
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,600
Stop trying.

165
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,480
Lu Ming must be waiting for me to rescue him.

166
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,260
He'll be fine.

167
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,320
He'll definitely be all right.

168
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:19,280
After one of the merfolk dies, a lifetime of memories will condense into a Merfolk Tear,

169
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,340
and fly back to the merfolk's homeland.

170
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,180
This is Lu Ming's Merfolk Tear.

171
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,200
This is Spirit-Gathering Silk.

172
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,660
Lu Ming already had an ace up his sleeve.

173
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,420
Even though the person destroyed Lu Ming's Merfolk Tear.

174
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:41,240
But with Spirit-Gathering Silk, it can sense the breath of the host's kin.

175
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,220
It'll light up and it can somewhat gather his spirituality.

176
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:50,200
Lu Ming... what exactly have you been through?

177
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,220
What exactly happened to you?

178
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,640
<i>You wanted to see me, Your Supreme Majesty?</i>

179
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,700
<i>As an attendant, you should focus on your work and follow orders.</i>

180
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:16,120
<i>If you doubt your master, then that's the end of the road.</i>

181
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,260
How could it be His Supreme Majesty?

182
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:31,800
In the Three Realms, there are very few Immortals who can hurt you.

183
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,320
This mysterious man has always succeeded in sneaking up on you.

184
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,900
He even tampered with the register and contacted the East Sea.

185
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,420
It appears that His Supreme Majesty is indeed suspicious.

186
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,240
His Supreme Majesty raised me.

187
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,800
He is my master and also my father.

188
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,780
How could he possibly try to kill me?

189
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,160
Besides, His Supreme Majesty isn't a hypocrite who does bad deeds.

190
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,560
He has ruled the Three Realms for millions of years.

191
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,100
The only thing he has done with an ulterior motive

192
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,440
was concealing the fact that I'm from the Asura bloodline.

193
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,520
There must be some hidden secret in all this.

194
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:18,220
Indeed, the mysterious man's act is totally incompatible with His Supreme Majesty's past behavior.

195
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:22,180
But Lu Ming took the risk to keep this scene.

196
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,660
There must be something that he wanted to tell us.

197
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:30,520
Perhaps... there are clues in the Merfolk Orb.

198
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,600
Let me take a look.

199
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,720
<i>Let's go, Lu Ming.</i>

200
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,480
<i>Wait. We haven't put the candles out yet.</i>

201
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,400
<i>Did you become crazy from working the night shift with me?</i>

202
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,000
<i>Let me help you put them out then.</i>

203
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,200
<i>Rest assured, Lu Ming.</i>

204
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,980
<i>Even if you're an immortal attendant in the Pavilion of Books for ten thousand years,</i>

205
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:58,340
<i>I would do the night shift with you for ten thousand nights. Let's go!</i>

206
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,440
<i>How long is it going to take you doing it that way? Watch me.</i>

207
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,060
This was me and Lu Ming in the past.

208
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,000
Lu Ming really is dead.

209
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,020
He and I had made a deal to accompany each other for ten thousand years.

210
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:35,920
But I went to the Mortal Realm and left him alone in the Nine Heavens.

211
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,540
I thought we would see each other again.

212
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,160
But now I'll never have a chance to see him again.

213
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,260
Lu Ming must be blaming me.

214
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,140
He must be blaming me.

215
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,520
Lu Ming isn't blaming you.

216
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,120
He was saying goodbye to you.

217
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,960
As for the two scenes that just appeared,

218
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:15,600
he was trying to tell us that the location is at the Pavilion of Books.

219
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,320
Lu Ming must've prepared for this when he found some clues.

220
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,760
I'll go and check it out right now.

221
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,140
I'll come with you.

222
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:31,440
If it's at the Pavilion of Books, I'm sure I can find the clues since I'm familiar with the place.

223
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,160
Yan Dan, you're a demon now.

224
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,200
If you get caught, your life would be in danger.

225
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,500
I'll be careful. Please believe me.

226
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:47,160
Lu Ming was murdered, but the culprit is still out there.

227
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,480
I can't just stay in the Mortal Realm and wait.

228
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,060
Lu Ming was my best friend.

229
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,920
I want to avenge him.

230
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,760
I beg you.

231
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,560
All right.

232
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,560
Let's go there together then.

233
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,300
<i>[Lu Ming's Tomb]</i>

234
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,620
Your Majesty.

235
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,880
There's no need to be so formal.

236
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,840
Today, I'd like to go through the ancient books in the Pavilion of Books.

237
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,560
I don't wish to be interrupted.

238
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,180
Yes.

239
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,840
The Pavilion of Books appeared in Lu Ming's memory.

240
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,880
Let's split up and search.

241
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,620
<i>[Leave Slip, Lu Ming]</i>

242
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,440
There are many leave slips.
<i>(T/N: Leave of absence letters.)</i>

243
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:40,420
Though Lu Ming was promoted, he was still as lazy as ever.

244
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:52,980
"I wish my friend, Yan Dan, peace and happiness."

245
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,860
You prayed for me every year.

246
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:06,600
But now, I can no longer give you my well wishes.

247
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:13,900
<i>[A Detailed Explanation of Belts]</i>

248
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,580
<i>[Hundred Types of Leather Belts]</i>

249
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:19,220
Why are there so many books about belts?

250
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,260
<i>This was where I put the play scripts.</i>

251
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,900
<i>Lu Ming never stored other books in here before.</i>

252
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,940
<i>What matters now is the investigation.</i>

253
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,600
<i>I'll leave these personal effects aside for now.</i>

254
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,000
Are there any clues?

255
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,680
I didn't find any.

256
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,600
Why don't we call it a day.

257
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,560
After a while, the patrolling immortal attendant will arrive.

258
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,300
Let's go.

259
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,980
Wait.

260
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,960
I meant to say...

261
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,070
maybe the images Lu Ming left at the Crystal Falls weren't a farewell message to us.

262
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,240
As expected.

263
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:16,940
Due to the special nature of the Merfolk's bone and blood, it can form an unquenchable fire.

264
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:21,040
Lu Ming made these unquenchable candles with his own blood.

265
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,000
This is the clue that he wanted to show us!

266
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,280
Alignment of Nine Planets?

267
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:56,880
The Alignment of Nine Planets is a very rare celestial phenomenon.

268
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,120
Yan Dan, look.

269
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,220
The nine planets form an orderly line.

270
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:04,520
They cover the sky and sun and form an array between heaven and earth.

271
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,540
I can't be as simple as a celestial phenomenon.

272
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,820
When the Alignment of Nine Planets appears,

273
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,520
if someone gathers the spiritual qi of heaven and earth with the Golden Cicada's Wings

274
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:18,140
and uses a powerful immortal spirit as the vessel to worship the Nine Planets Array,

275
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,760
they'll be able to achieve the Universe Enchantment.

276
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,920
The Universe Enchantment?

277
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:33,920
The Universe Enchantment was used by the Lord of the Asura Clan, Xuan Ye.

278
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,660
Since it was sinister and vicious, it was banned after the War of Genesis.

279
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,960
Only those elderly immortals who went through the War of Genesis know about it.

280
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,560
The Alignment of Nine Planets was last seen during the Divine-Devil War.

281
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,060
Use an immortal spirit as the vessel?

282
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:53,560
Immortal Lord Bei Ming's immortal spirit was lost after returning from the war.

283
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:58,400
Did someone do that on purpose to practice the Universe Enchantment with his immortal spirit?

284
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,560
But to achieve the Universe Enchantment needs the Golden Cicada's Wings.

285
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:06,380
It's the magic weapon of the Three-Winged Raven Clan.

286
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,040
That clan was annihilated long ago.

287
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,360
What will happen to those who are killed by the Universe Enchantment?

288
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,600
The Universe Enchantment will engulf and absorb their divine power.

289
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,520
The immortal bones of those who are attacked will become brittle.

290
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,940
It'll be hard for them to form a shape.

291
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,740
Let's go to the Divine Cemetery Forest and check the body of Immortal Lord Bei Ming.

292
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,020
Everything will come to light then.

293
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,920
Okay.

294
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:44,120
Immortal Lord, you always said that you worked hard your whole life.

295
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,960
And if you ascended one day, you wished to eternally rest in the universe,

296
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,580
so that your existence could be peaceful.

297
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:56,260
But now, in order to give you justice, we must forcibly open your coffin and disturb your peace.

298
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,340
A GO piece!

299
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:28,920
<i>Your Majesty, long time no see.</i>

300
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,720
Immortal Lord?

301
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:39,280
<i>A part of my spirituality rests on your GO piece.</i>

302
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:44,020
<i>Through it, I can connect with your heart and communicate telepathically with you.</i>

303
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,880
My GO piece?

304
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,800
<i>In the Divine-Devil War, I was in charge of the rear</i>

305
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:54,180
<i> and allocated divine tools and immortal beasts to the immortals.</i>

306
00:27:54,180 --> 00:28:00,760
<i>On the eve of the war, His Supreme Majesty entrusted me to protect you if the war intensified.</i>

307
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,880
<i>However, I was at the rear and you were on the front line.</i>

308
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,920
<i>Worried that I wouldn't be able to take care of you,</i>

309
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:11,980
<i>I secretly took one of your GO pieces and connected it with your spiritual consciousness.</i>

310
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:17,200
<i>After so many years, I didn't expect to meet you here.</i>

311
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,440
<i>If His Supreme Majesty really is that mysterious person, why would he save me and then try to kill me?</i>

312
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:31,420
Immortal Lord, I wasn't... aware of your kind intentions.

313
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,380
Now that the living and the dead are separated.

314
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,300
I can't repay you.

315
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:42,220
Can I ask, Immortal Lord, what happened exactly during the war that year?

316
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,640
<i>The Devils forced me into a hopeless situation.</i>

317
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,900
<i>I fought the devil soldiers up front, but one of them attacked from behind.</i>

318
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:03,440
<i>Caught off guard, I tried to see who it was.</i>

319
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:11,520
<i>I looked up... and saw my face.</i>

320
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,100
<i>I understood immediately that this person could use the Puppet Spell </i>

321
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:26,260
<i>to pretend to be someone else and hide his identity.</i>

322
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:36,600
<i>I couldn't expose him in the end.</i>

323
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,720
What happened that year was due to my oversight.

324
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,940
To prove your innocence to the Heavenly Realm,

325
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:52,640
we have to ask your consent for us to open the coffin and find the evidence to avenge you.

326
00:29:52,640 --> 00:30:00,740
<i>This man plotted to kill celestial deities, absorb three emperors' divine power, and then quietly escape.</i>

327
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,900
<i>He has fathomless immortal power and is very cunning.</i>

328
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,320
<i>Others are no match for him.</i>

329
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:09,440
<i>If you continue to pursue this, you'll put your life in danger.</i>

330
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:15,120
<i>Your identity will be exposed and staying in the Heavenly Realm will become difficult.</i>

331
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,780
So, Immortal Lord, you already knew.

332
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:26,820
I dedicated my life to protecting the virtuous paths of the universe.

333
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,940
I might expose my identity and lose my immortal status,

334
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,860
yet I need to seek justice for those who were innocent but implicated.

335
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:37,000
I'll perform my mission without fear and regret.

336
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,920
Immortal Lord, please allow us to open the coffin.

337
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,780
<i>All right.</i>

338
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,680
<i>I knew it would end up like this.</i>

339
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,880
<i>It was only a matter of time.</i>

340
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:56,280
<i>If you must get to the bottom of things and turn things around, you will face perils.</i>

341
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,530
<i>If a war breaks out,</i>

342
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:04,200
<i>I believe you'll definitely save all beings and restore peace to the Three Realms.</i>

343
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,800
<i>However,</i>

344
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,400
<i>I have some selfish interests.</i>

345
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:13,380
Immortal Lord... are you concerned about Yan Dan and Yu Mo?

346
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:21,640
Don't worry. If they are dragged into this, I, Ying Yuan...

347
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,420
will bravely and selflessly protect them.

348
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,720
<i>Your Highness, I wish you safety and success.</i>

349
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,340
<i>I will entrust these two young ones to you then.</i>

350
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,320
Immortal Lord.

351
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,780
Dragon scales?

352
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,360
Back then, Yu Mo put these dragon scales on his body.

353
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,620
The Nine Fins Dragon Scales came from spiritual roots.

354
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,880
They're extremely hard.

355
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,600
Placed properly in a celestial coffin, they shouldn't break.

356
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:13,220
Sure enough, someone murdered celestial deities and took their immortal spirits to practice the Universe Enchantment.

357
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:20,020
In the Three Realms, there's only one who is capable of killing emperors.

358
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,060
That's the Heavenly Emperor.

359
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:28,640
In the War of Genesis, he led the immortals to destroy the Asura Clan.

360
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,200
Now, he uses Asura's evil art to harm those in the Heavenly Realm.

361
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,800
Why has he changed so much?

362
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,140
With his status, he used the Asura's evil art to harm those in the Heavenly Realm.

363
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,620
This is tantamount to subverting the Three Realms.

364
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,480
We must carefully confirm this.

365
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,600
If we want to find out the truth, we must collect more evidence.

366
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:58,100
I know that you have a deep friendship with him.

367
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:02,980
If you investigate this, you'll be put in an extremely difficult situation.

368
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,600
I'm a bit worried about you.

369
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,120
You're in the open. He isn't.

370
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,400
We can't let him take control of this.

371
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,560
Don't worry, Yan Dan.

372
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,660
I won't be partial.

373
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,120
A lot is at stake.

374
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,220
I am duty-bound.

375
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,740
Before we have the evidence,

376
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:28,560
we mustn't act rashly, or we'll be in danger.

377
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,240
Yan Dan. You should go back to Yelan Mountain first.

378
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,800
You're the emperor.

379
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,130
People will notice every move you make.

380
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:44,430
If I pretend to be an immortal attendant, then I can move around more easily and undetected.

381
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:48,560
Besides, Lu Ming left a wooden box in the Pavilion of Books.

382
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,980
I have to figure out why he did that.

383
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,120
Since you've decided to stay,

384
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,800
I will keep you safe.

385
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:15,160
Immortal Lord, I will seek justice for you.

386
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,340
The Immortal Lord was Yu Mo's mentor.

387
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:30,580
The one who killed you in the mortal world also caused the extermination of the Nine Fins Clan.

388
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:35,060
Given Yu Mo's temperament, he will kill his enemy.

389
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:39,240
I'll send him a letter to inform him about everything we've discovered.

390
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:44,020
After we get the evidence,

391
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:48,740
we can confront the Heavenly Emperor during the advisory council of the immortals.

392
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:57,440
But right now, we need the Nine Fins Dragon Scales to test the Universe Enchantment.

393
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:17,020
<i>[Wenshui Pavillion]</i>

394
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:22,420
What brat is looking to die? How dare you disturb my sleep!

395
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,420
Emperor Ying Yuan! What brings you here?

396
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:37,780
Old Marshal, I came to notify you that someone is moving into the house that I asked you to keep in the past.

397
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,580
I'm here to give her some items.

398
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,720
This place was yours to begin with.

399
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,240
Bring whoever you want. You don't have to notify me.

400
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,240
I don't mind, as long as I'm not disturbed.

401
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,100
Emperor Ying Yuan, you brought along a girl?

402
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:06,200
Old Marshal, someone will come live with you in the future.

403
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:11,240
If you drink heavily all day long, that would be a bit disgraceful.

404
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:23,140
Looks like I'm not going to get anymore shut eye.
