15
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,000
In my heart, Yelan Mountain has always been most important to me.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,800
And you... regard the Four Seas as your homeland and the Aquatic Clan as your subjects.

17
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,600
Those soldiers are grateful to you for saving them.

18
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,000
They are loyal to you.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,800
Just like what that kid said just now, they trust you.

20
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,300
Only you... can assume this position.

21
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,500
Brother Yu Mo. Thank you.

22
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,800
There's no need to thank me.

23
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,900
You saved me so many times.

24
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,000
I should be the one thanking you.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,600
What you've done for me... the gratitude endures in my heart forever.

26
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,800
I only just learned... the significance of the inverted scale.

27
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,800
This scale... I cannot accept it.

28
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,800
One cannot simply take back what is given as a gift.

29
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,400
Unless you promise me something.

30
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,300
On the day of my inauguration, I want you to put the crown on me.

31
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,200
I'm just a leader of demons from Yelan Mountain.

32
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,900
What right do I have to crown the Dragon Queen of the Four Seas.

33
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,400
You do have the right.

34
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:18,800
Because you are my... very best... very best...

35
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,700
good friend.

36
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,600
I promise you.

37
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,600
Your Majesty is significantly more beautiful than when you were a reluctant bride.

38
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,300
Yan Dan. When you don your wedding gown to marry Brother Yu Mo, you'll look even prettier.

39
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,400
You must invite me when that time comes.

40
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,700
No, no. You're mistaken.

41
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:36,700
Although my title says that I'm Yu Mo's consort, we secretly agreed that I would only be his loyal servant.

42
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,900
He is really in love with someone else, but they can't be together.

43
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,400
Please don't misunderstand.

44
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,000
He won't tell you his true feelings because he cherishes you too much.

45
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,500
He doesn't want to scare you away.

46
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,600
In this world, unrequited love is one of the biggest sufferings.

47
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,200
He is willing to endure it because he wants you to always live a carefree life forever.

48
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,600
What are you talking about?

49
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,400
I don't understand.

50
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,200
Are we talking about the same Yu Mo?

51
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,000
I mean look how he usually is.

52
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,900
He's suffering? He's sorrowful?

53
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,400
Your Majesty, the auspicious hour is near.

54
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,800
Congratulations, Dragon Queen of the Four Seas.

55
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,400
The cruel Ao Xuan was overthrown by the Four Seas.

56
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Such is the will of the people.

57
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,000
However, the Four Seas cannot remain leaderless for long.

58
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,100
The 48th generation of the Azure Dragon Clan, Zhao Lan,

59
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,800
hails from a noble bloodline and was raised in the Heavenly Palace.

60
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,000
She received due education and demonstrates kindness.

61
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,600
Thus, she will bear the heavy leadership responsibilities

62
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,800
while adhering to the teachings of the Five Sage and the Heavenly Rules.

63
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,800
She will succeed as the Dragon Queen of the Four Seas.

64
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,500
We announce this to the world.

65
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,800
Thus concludes this edict.

66
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,200
I shall proceed with the utmost vigilance and dedication

67
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,900
for the peace of the Four Seas.

68
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,200
I will not let my people down.

69
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400
<i>Greetings, Your Majesty.</i>

70
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,600

71
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,000
<i>and be granted all their wishes.</i>

72
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,500
Brother Yo Mo, I am happy to have met you and became who I am now.

73
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,300
Now that order has been restored to the Four Seas and you're now the new ruler, we will depart soon as well.

74
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,300
I hope I can still call you my friend when we meet again in the future.

75
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:26,000
I hope you'll find your loved one soon.

76
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:34,900
When you completed everything as you wish, you must remember to come visit the East Sea.

77
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,700
We'll definitely come!

78
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,500
I will come too.

79
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,800
Zhao Lan, do people of the East Sea love melons?

80
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,400
I have many melon seeds here.

81
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,700
All types too. Pick whatever you want.

82
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,800
<i>[Pavilion of Books]</i>

83
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,000
Did you see Yan Dan?

84
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,800
How is she?

85
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
She is well.

86
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,000
She is with Yu Mo now and has forgotten about her past.

87
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,200
She's happier and more carefree than before.

88
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,800
Her dream to become the greatest author in the Three Realms is still there,

89
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,800
she is traveling around the mortal world with her notebook, seeking inspiration.

90
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,900
That is exactly what she wanted to do back then. Travel in the Mortal Realm.

91
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,600
That's good.

92
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:43,000
If you miss her this much, why don't you go see her yourself to put your mind at ease?

93
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,700
She may have forgotten the past,

94
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,400
but I never forgot a single thing that happened.

95
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,000
I don't have it in me to face her.

96
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm her sister,

97
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,200
but I failed to protect her.

98
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:14,000
What I failed to do back then, I won't have an opportunity to do again.

99
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,400
It is all in the past now.

100
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,400
Other than the gibberish about the past, you didn't get any other clues out of Sheng De?

101
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,200
I'm sure she knows the spell to unlock Trust Duster.

102
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,000
Otherwise, why else would the King of Andu bring an ordinary duster into his palace and treat it like a treasure?

103
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,000
Should we still send her back to her sect?

104
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,600
I already discussed this with Yan Dan.

105
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,300
If she truly is evil, we should keep her close and check her out.

106
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,500
First, we can try to figure out her true intentions.

107
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,300
Second, we can figure out how to use Truth Duster.

108
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:05,900
If we abandon her, what if she tries to harm us? We won't be able to stop her.

109
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,000
You're right.

110
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,200
It's easy to be a thief forever, but you can't keep your guard up forever.

111
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,200
We're close to Hexin Sect anyway.

112
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,400
Let's see how it goes.

113
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,800
We shall find out what exactly she is up to.

114
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,600
It will become clear soon.

115
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,200
Let's go.

116
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,780
After this forest is Hexin Sect, where I learned my magical arts.

117
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:43,700
I know that the misunderstandings over the last few days

118
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,600
caused the two Young Masters to misunderstand me.

119
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,400
Once I arrive at my sect, I will definitely explain everything.

120
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,800
After all, fate caused us to encountered each other.

121
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,000
Even if we never see each other again,

122
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,500
I don't want you to resent me over some misunderstandings.

123
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,800
The divine tool is reacting.

124
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,600
Does this mean the forest up ahead used to be where the divine tool was hidden?

125
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:24,000
Exactly. I chanced upon this divine tool in this forest.

126
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,500
It is normal for the Truth Duster to react to this place.

127
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,200
This foliage is dense and the land is vast.

128
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:35,100
Miss Sheng De, since you are familiar with this place, why don't you lead the way?

129
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:40,000
Yan Dan and I will walk behind in case wild beasts attack.

130
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,300
Of course.

131
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,600
In the past, I came here every day to gather wood and water.

132
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,700
I am very familiar with this place.

133
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,700
Sheng De, didn't you say the Hexin Sect was located to the west of this forest?

134
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,000
Why are we heading north?

135
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,500
If we walk towards the west, there will be a swamp.

136
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,200
It is extremely dangerous.

137
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,900
Circumventing it by going north is safer.

138
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,500
<i>The layout of these trees isn't natural.</i>

139
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,000
<i>It's actually a Nine Palaces, Eight Trigrams Array.</i>

140
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,200
<i>When you enter the center, you activate the array.</i>

141
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,300
<i>The Life Door is on the east. The Rest Door is on the southwest.</i>

142
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,000
<i>The center should be...</i>

143
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,400
Stop.

144
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,400
Sheng De, what's going on?

145
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,800
How can this be?

146
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,000
Back then, I chanced upon the Truth Duster right here.

147
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,200
<i>Why are you standing there? Chop the wood.</i>

148
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,200
<i>If you don't gather three days' worth of wood, don't even think of returning to the sect.</i>

149
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,500
<i>This is an Eight Trigrams Array formed by the souls of devils.</i>

150
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,300
<i>Right! The Xiaohan Scriptures.</i>

151
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,200
<i>Why are you standing there? Hurry up, get to work!</i>

152
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,700
<i>Circulate qi through the internal organs, then gather it on the wrists.</i>

153
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,800
<i>Sheng De. What dark arts are you using?</i>

154
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,500
<i>Come forth!</i>

155
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,100
The Open Door is to the north. Go northward.

156
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,400
One step!

157
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,900
Yan Dan!

158
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,700
Thank you.

159
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,100
Sheng De! I knew you were up for something. What do you want?

160
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,000
Your life of course.

161
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,800
Your heart, to be precise!

162
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,200
So your motive in joining us was to kill me.

163
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,800
What about Jiang Chen and Pei Luo?

164
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,600
Did you cause their separation as well?

165
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,200
So what if that's true?

166
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:26,700
I used Pei Luo's greed and slowly wormed my way to become his favorite side consort.

167
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,400
I was above everyone else, with only the King of Andu above me.

168
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,800
I could have led a happy life,

169
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,900
but... you just had to appear.

170
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Why did you have to come here?

171
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,800
Over and over again, you ruin my life and take away everything I love!

172
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,800
What does this have anything to do with Yan Dan?

173
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,600
Your loved one doesn't love you back.

174
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,600
And you want to blame her for it.

175
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:59,300
Your true face has finally been revealed, possessive and selfish.

176
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,500
You don't deserve love. Do you even know what love is?

177
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,500
What do you know?

178
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,800
Tang Zhou. Everything I did was all for you.

179
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,000
But you trample my sincere heart all because of her.

180
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,600
Today, I will kill her myself!

181
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:21,400
Then I will force you to devour her heart bite by bite.

182
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,300
You are insane.

183
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,800
I'd rather die than let you have your way.

184
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,300
You will do what you're told.

185
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:36,500
Not only that, I'll also cast a spell on you and remove your memories from the Mortal Realm.

186
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:42,300
That way, you will forget about her completely and spend the rest of your life with me.

187
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,800
This black mist is ominous. Be careful, everyone.

188
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:58,100
Emperor Zhao Sheng used the Truth Duster and sealed a Devil Army here.

189
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:03,200
Then they transformed into this black mist and devoured anyone who entered this array.

190
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,000
You lost your memory and forgot how to use your immortal power.

191
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:14,600
Today, you shall witness these two demons turn into statues.

192
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:20,900
While I'll have two great tools in my hands, the Nine Fins Dragon Core and the Truth Duster.

193
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,800
I will dominate the Mortal Realm!

194
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:33,200
“Circulate qi through the internal organs, then gather it on the wrists.”

195
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,000
“Come forth!”

196
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,800
Don't touch the black mist!

197
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,700
Hurry up.

198
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,900
I can't hold it any longer.

199
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,300
You would rather die with them than stay with me?!

200
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:13,000
Tang Zhou, eat the pearl Zhao Yan gave you!

201
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,700
Once you eat it, your memory will recover.

202
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,400
You'll recall all your immortal power.

203
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,200
Why are you dallying? Hurry!

204
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,600
Otherwise, we'll all die here!

205
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,900
Tang Zhou. Can't the Truth Duster suspend smoke and get rid of all evil?

206
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,500
Hurry, use it!

207
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
Be careful!

208
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,200
You will die today!

209
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,000
“First cultivate heaven's secret,”

210
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,800
“then uncover heaven's will.”

211
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,000
The Xiaohan Scriptures?

212
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,300
<i>Hurry! Use the Xiaohan Scriptures!</i>

213
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,200
<i>First cultivate heaven's secret, </i>

214
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,200
<i>No.</i>

215
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,000
<i>The ancient way of training is different from today's method.</i>

216
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,400
<i>Memorizing it... isn't enough to understand the essence.</i>

217
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,300
<i>Hurry up. Invert it.</i>

218
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,400
<i>If Sheng De can command the black mist with the Xiaohan Scriptures,</i>

219
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,400
<i>then I can use the Truth Duster and the Xiaohan Scriptures to command it too.</i>

220
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,600
Tang Zhou. Follow what I say.

221
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,800
Use your inner power to control the Truth Duster.

222
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,600
Hunch your upper body.

223
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,300
Circulate qi through the internal organs, then gather it on the wrists.

224
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,800
The Xiaohan Scriptures? Why does it sound so familiar?

225
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,300
Impossible.

226
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,500
How do you know the Xiaohan Scriptures?!

227
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,600
“First cultivate heaven's secret,”

228
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,000
“then uncover heaven's will.”

229
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,800
“Begone!”

230
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,600
Who exactly are you?

231
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,000
Why are you planning such a resentful plan like this?

232
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,400
You've wronged me my entire life, so I want you to live the rest of your life full of regrets.

233
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,700
Can't you be more clear? What were you talking about back there?

234
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,100
What does it have to do with me?

235
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,600
Who exactly is the woman in Tang Zhou's dream?

236
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,100
Who was Tang Zhou in his previous life?

237
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,800
I'm sure you have the answers. Tell us.

238
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,900
I want you to live in confusion!

239
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:57,000
That way, you can never forget me.

240
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,020
She's dead just like that?

241
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,720
I guess that's what she deserved.

242
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:22,640
If Jiang Chen were to know about this, perhaps she would feel better.

243
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:30,800
Although Sheng De deliberately ruined Jiang Chen and Pei Luo's relationship, the ultimate reason

244
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,080
was still that Pei Luo didn't trust Jiang Chen enough.

245
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,780
So, Yan Dan, you don't have to be so hard on yourself.

246
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:44,100
Maybe this is the Five Aggregates of Clinging among the Eight Hardships,

247
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,080
material form, feeling, perception, mental formation, and consciousness.

248
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:51,680
They clouded her judgment and made her commit so many sins.

249
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,300
Looks like those stories are right.

250
00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:00,000
Love gives you reasons to live but can also give you reasons to kill.

251
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,400
Love can make you selfless... or insane.

252
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,320
Who exactly is the woman in your dream?

253
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,500
She resented you. You did her wrong.

254
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,860
Could it be... is it like Sheng De?

255
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,700
No, it's definitely different.

256
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,500
<i>Marshal Huo De is arrogant and obstinate.</i>

257
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:34,340
<i>If Sheng De was truly a fairy who was in love with him, she must have received bouts of his temper.</i>

258
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:38,200
<i>That's why she was scornful and resentful in this life.</i>

259
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,700
Why are you smiling? It's all in the past.

260
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,120
Since we have no answers, let's not talk about it anymore.

261
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,940
Sure.

262
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:54,960
You don't care. But now she's a statue.

263
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,840
Who is going to answer all the questions we have?

264
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,980
The Hexin Sect.

265
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,160
She claimed to have come from the Hexin Sect before.

266
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,460
Let's see if someone there can enlighten us.

267
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,400
Let's go.

268
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:27,122
This way, please.
<i>[Yunshui Inn]</i>

269
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,220
Have a safe trip.

270
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,240
Come in, please.

271
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,820
<i>Mister, your order is here.</i>

272
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,400
- Shopkeeper, this is all yours.
- Young Master.

273
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,200
Please make arrangements for us.

274
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,860
However, I have a question to ask.

275
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01,300
There should be a sect here called Hexin Sect.

276
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,460
Why can't I find it?

277
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,380
Young Master, why do you ask this?

278
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:09,540
The Hexin Sect isn't a good place.

279
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,620
You didn't spend a long time in the Dragon Palace,

280
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,260
but you definitely progressed a lot in your "Diary of the Mortal World".

281
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,060
What do you know?

282
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,400
Humans have Five Sufferings.

283
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,900
Ao Xuan suffered from arrogance.

284
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,100
While Sheng De suffered from possessiveness.

285
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,680
The way I see it, Zhao Lan is the wise one here.

286
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,620
Despite the pressure, she became the Dragon Queen of the Four Seas.

287
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:47,440
Plus she can also decide who to marry and protect her home on her own.

288
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,960
If only one day I could be like her.

289
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,620
Who do you want to protect and marry?

290
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,940
You're a demon catcher who rejects love.

291
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,540
Why do you care about a demon?

292
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:02,560
What? You want to be a guest on Yelan Mountain?

293
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,900
Can't I be curious?

294
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,900
You can't.

295
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,760
I've got the information.

296
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,320
What did they say?

297
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,720
Many years ago, when Sheng De was still practicing here,

298
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,620
she knew too many unorthodox arts and harbored ill intentions.

299
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,660
Her peers disliked her.

300
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:24,740
Later, Pei Luo came here to pray and she charmed him with a spell.

301
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,840
She became his side consort and was brought to the palace.

302
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,270
The night before her departure, an inferno consumed the Hexin Sect.

303
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:37,780
57 people were killed, not one was spared.

304
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:41,700
What a cold-blooded woman. I knew she was no good.

305
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,620
57 lives.

306
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,900
I never thought she could be so ruthless.

307
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,100
She wanted to leave no witnesses.

308
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:54,520
In the future, those who try to find the truth will be like us and find no leads.

309
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,940
Who exactly was she? How many cruel things has she done?

310
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:02,600
Everything is sealed away forever inside the statue hidden in the misty forest.

311
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,520
No one will ever know.

312
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,380
This is too scary now that I think about it.

313
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,380
Thank goodness you knew that long spell.

314
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,240
Otherwise, we would be ones who became statues.

315
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,660
I've been thinking a lot this whole way and I've figured it out.

316
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:20,720
I don't want to be your sidekick anymore.

317
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,880
Teach me how to cultivate so that I can become stronger. Then I can protect you from now on.

318
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,500
You're so talented, Advisor Lotus.

319
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,620
You're smart and pick up anything very easily.

320
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:35,480
If you devote yourself to your training, I might have to be your sidekick in the future.

321
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,600
That doesn't need saying.

322
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,960
What? You don't believe me?

323
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,480
Xiao Xin. What's the matter?

324
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,660
Xiao Xin!

325
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,440
Oh, no. He's not coughing, he's choking. I have to save him!

326
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,100
Are you choking? Hurry.

327
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,520
- Have some water.
- No, he shouldn't. Something's stuck in his throat.

328
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,160
Come on. Young boy. Push.

329
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,180
Cough.

330
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,160
What should I do?

331
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,360
Are you okay?

332
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,720
I was so worried!

333
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,000
Thank you, Miss.

334
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,720
You're welcome. You're welcome.

335
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,460
I came here with my grandson to seek refuge at my relative's place.

336
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:28,820
If something were to happen to my grandson, I wouldn't have a reason to live.

337
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,040
May I know your name, Miss?

338
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,040
I have to repay you for your kindness.

339
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,760
No need. No need.

340
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,000
I'm Yan Dan.

341
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,120
Sorry for the long wait.

342
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,980
Grandma, it's nothing. No need to be so generous.

343
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,320
Truly, there's no need.

344
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,920
It smells so nice.

345
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,260
All of you saved my grandson.

346
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,880
Today also happens to be the Dragon Boat Festival.

347
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,980
We have a custom of eating five types of yellow food.

348
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:13,920
I'm from a modest background, so I can only cook up a thank you meal.

349
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,600
I raised this yellow croaker myself.

350
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,560
It is very fresh.

351
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:23,040
I brewed this Chinese yellow wine. I made sure I added a lot of realgar powder into it.

352
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,320
It helps you get rid of evil demons.

353
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,960
So many of them roam about nowadays doing evil things.

354
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,320
All of you should be careful.

355
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,640
<i>Oh, what a coincidence. We are demons.</i>

356
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,560
<i>Once this yellow wine weakens us and our real body appears,</i>

357
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:41,280
<i>even if we mean no harm, some people will faint from fear alone.</i>

358
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,840
Madam, this fish is indeed very fresh.

359
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,040
You don't need to worry. Many demons live in the mountains.

360
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,560
They won't mingle with humans.

361
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,580
Besides, there are many demon catchers walking the world too.

362
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,880
So please put your mind at ease.

363
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,520
Why aren't you eating, Young Master?

364
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,120
Is my cooking too simple to your liking?

365
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,600
No, no. You're mistaken, Grandma.

366
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,860
He has gout.

367
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:23,020
So he can't stand the smell of fish at all.

368
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:26,040
You know what? I'll eat it on his behalf.

369
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,160
Advisor Lotus, have you forgotten? You're asthmatic.

370
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,080
You cannot have fish.

371
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,740
One bite is okay, isn't it?

372
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,540
Not even one bite.

373
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,420
I didn't know you both had dietary restrictions.

374
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,220
I'm so sorry.

375
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:47,860
While you are supposed to avoid fish if you have asthma or gout, this yellow wine should do no harm, right?

376
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:52,480
Please, I insist. Have some more.

377
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,680
<i>Not a demon. It should be fine.</i>

378
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,760
Have some, Miss.

379
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,940
Advisor Lotus can't hold her liquor usually. So this wine...

380
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,220
I'll drink for her.

381
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,500
This wine is wonderful.

382
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,420
I'm glad you like it, Young Master.

383
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:42,780
You are a chivalrous man and a loving husband.

384
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,920
What are you, if not a hero?

385
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,440
Here.

386
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,920
Again?

387
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:04,120
Yu Mo, how can you sully Yan Dan's name in front of a stranger?

388
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,800
Although she entered a pact with you when she was young, none of the rites were performed.

389
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,980
It doesn't count.

390
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:16,530
Madam. Pardon us.

391
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:18,360
I'm a demon catcher.

392
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,720
- Yan Dan is a maid I found.
- What?

393
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,230
Wait, when did I become your maid?

394
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,730
I, Yan Dan...

395
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:29,440
I tamed you that day.

396
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,230
Don't you remember?

397
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:42,320
Indeed. Taoist Master Tang kindness towards me is as great as a mountain.

398
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,780
Oh, Advisor Lotus look.

399
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:48,970
Taoist Master Tang is trying to separate us. But it's okay.

400
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:51,600
I'm one to follow my wife.

401
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,520
If you're his maid, then I shall reluctantly become his butler.

402
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,740
Look at this table.

403
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,960
We have delicious food and fine wine.

404
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,880
Surely, I do not have the right to enjoy them.

405
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,700
Please enjoy them on our behalf, Taoist Master.

406
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,280
Just you wait, you two.

407
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,100
You three share such a destiny together.

408
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,040
All the more reason why you should drink up.

409
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,440
Whether you're the master or the disciple, all of you are my saviors.

410
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,220
Come on. I have enough yellow wine.

411
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,400
Please don't be polite.

412
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,120
I can't anymore.

413
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:45,020
I have a splitting headache, I can't drink anymore.

414
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,660
Likewise. I...

415
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,600
I think my asthma is acting up.

416
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,920
I feel a little nauseous. I can't drink anything.

417
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,060
I'll drink it then.

418
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,640
Sly as a fox, the two of you.

419
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,560
You sure can hold your liquor, Young Master.

420
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:18,840
Madam. Truth be told, your wine is... really delicious.

421
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,720
Tang Zhou. Tang Zhou.

422
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,780
Drink to your heart's content, not drink till your heart's failing, buddy.

423
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,220
Are you okay?

424
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,320
Of course, I am.

425
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:35,280
I'm telling you. I... have never been drunk before.

426
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,200
I can keep drinking.

427
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,380
Madam. Another glass, please.

428
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,020
Careful.

429
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,440
Don't move.

430
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:59,400
I'm not drunk. I can keep drinking.

431
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,820
I'm telling you. I can keep drinking, no matter how much I drink, I can't get drunk.

432
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,060
Yes. You can carry on drinking.

433
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,140
You can't get drunk no matter what.

434
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,960
You drank yourself silly.

435
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,800
Do you want me to get you some sobering soup?

436
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,160
Yan Dan.

<i>You will suffer from the Eight Hardships.</i>

<i>Four from birth, aging, sickness, and death.</i>

Your Highness.

463
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,220
Well done.

464
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:43,100
Shenxiao Palace has eyes everywhere.

465
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:47,060
Setting up a trap for two demons and one mortal isn't difficult.

466
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,800
Pardon my curiosity.

467
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,360
Why not kill them when we have the chance?

468
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,960
This is a tool from the Heavenly Realm.

469
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,280
It also recognized it's owner.

470
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,560
Although I have it, I can't use it.

471
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:05,380
I sent you there to lure the three of them in so that they can do my bidding.

472
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:09,740
The trap is set in motion. Just return and wait.

473
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,360
Yes, Your Highness.

474
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,880
<i>Oh, no. The Truth Duster.</i>

475
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:08,480
No one has been staying in this inn.

476
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,760
I asked the shopkeepers nearby.

477
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,340
Apparently, this inn was booked three days ago.

478
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:20,240
That old lady and the kid have no relatives here either.

479
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,960
So, it was a trap they set.

480
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,920
The wine does contain a lot of realgar powder.

481
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,300
Realgar powder is spicy and bitter,

482
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,700
so it masked the other scent in the wine.

483
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:39,540
That means we were clearly their targets from the beginning.

484
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:44,160
They knew we would intervene to save a life, and then made us let our guard down.

485
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,740
They knew both of us are demons and cannot drink yellow wine,

486
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:51,280
so naturally, Tang Zhou would have to drink it.

487
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:56,780
Then they stole his tool.

488
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:03,640
Tang Zhou, you lost the Truth Duster because you had to drank on Yu Mo's and my behalf.

489
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:08,100
Don't worry. We'll definitely find a way to retrieve it for you.

490
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,460
But there are no other clues in the inn.

491
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:17,380
Many people use knock-out drugs as well. How do we proceed?

492
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:21,260
I once read the Encyclopedia of Herbal Medicine.

493
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:26,270
While they are many types of knock-out drugs, but this one here contains sweet flags.

494
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,800
It can only be found on Zhucui Mountain.

495
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,080
We are now in Zhucui Town at the foot of Zhucui Mountain.

496
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:42,380
Since we're tracking that knock-out drug, we should start from apothecaries or herb gatherers.

497
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:47,100
As expected from an inexperienced, naïve bookworm.

498
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:50,700
If a physician concocts a knock-out drug, he'll be arrested.

499
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,960
People will do it secretly, of course.

500
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,940
If the physician works for the black market, then we can't track him either.

501
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,800
Then what should we do?

502
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,140
You see that?

503
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,960
This is where you look for clues.
<i>[Indulgence House]</i>

504
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,640
Make the best out of your merry moments in life.

505
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,500
Do not greet the bright moon with an empty cup.

506
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,780
Such a poetic name. Is it an academy?

507
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,620
See? What did I say? How naïve.

508
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:16,720
It's called Indulgence, so it must be.

509
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:21,300
"I will give all the tenderness of my life so that you can enjoy the night to the fullest."

510
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,340
Such disrespectful lines. This is an indecent place. I'm not going.

511
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:27,760
Seriously? This is a dance hall, not a brothel.

512
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,760
It has beautiful girls, but not the decadence.

513
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:36,360
All walks of life frequent this place, it is perfect for finding clues.

514
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,660
There are only women here.

515
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,820
Men and women should avoid inappropriate contact. I'm definitely not going.

516
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,280
Fine, fine, fine. If you won't, I will.

517
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,540
I'll disguise myself as a man and bring both of you in to broaden your knowledge.
