Mountain Chief, the troublemaker from the neighboring mountain came here again to catch fish and shrimp!

Heitu, why are you only getting here now? Hurry, come help me.

10

Little Gou Dan, why do you suddenly want to eat fish?
<i>(T/N: Gou Dan means Rascal)</i>

11
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,660
Today is my mother's birthday.

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,200
She said that the food she craved the most in the first half of her life was fish,

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,980
so I want to catch two big fish for her.

14
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,000
Judging by the way you tried to do it, I'm guessing you haven't been cultivating hard enough.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,160
What? Didn't your father teach you properly?

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,460
Come here.

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,700
Now, you stay here and watch how I do it. Okay?

18
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,000
The fish are here! The fish are here!

19
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,100
Happy birthday, Mother!

20
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,580
Thank you, Gou Dan.

21
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,300
But the fish is so big.

22
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,780
You didn't steal it from the market, did you?

23
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,580
Of course not! I caught it from the river at Yelan Mountain.

24
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:48,330
Really? Then how come I heard that Mountain Chief Yu never lets anyone catch fish in his territory?

25
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,180
Well, that's because I had a good helper!

26
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,640
Helper? Who was it?

27
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,340
I don't really know who he is. I call him Heitu.

28
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,840
Gou Dan, remember what I'm saying. The next time you meet this "Heitu", you need to thank him. Understood?

29
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,260
Understood.

30
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,700
Good boy. Let's eat now.

31
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,860
Come on. Have some more.

Let's eat the melon while watching the play for a moment.

36
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,640
- Okay?
- All right.
- Sure.

37
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,520
What are you looking at?!

38
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,500
I'm here for that brat, Ying Yuan.

39
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,400
You can't let the other Divine Officials know that I'm here today...

40
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,760
You've become a big fan of plays after you retired.

41
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,270
When have you ever missed a play when the Troupe Zhenxi is here?

42
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,440
Just admit it.

43
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,560
You know about it already?

44
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,800

46
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,100
Zi Lin, give me the spiritual power.

47
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,900
What spiritual power?

48
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,540
We made a bet on who would get married first, Zhao Lan or Yu Mo.

49
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,300
This is all your fault. Why couldn't you try harder?

50
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,280
My father forced me to have men joust to be my spouse.

51
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,560
I didn't expect that I would meet someone who could make my heart flutter.

52
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,060
Zhao Lan, you shouldn't mind his nonsense.

53
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,000
This is great news. Congratulations.

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,740
- Congratulations.
- Exactly! Congratulations!

55
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,460
Zhao Lan, congratulations.

56
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,040
Thank you.

57
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,780
Zhao Lan, congratulations.

Yan Dan, where is that demon, Prince Troublemaker?

59
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,520
What Prince Troublemaker?

60
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,400
My Gou Dan went fishing with Zi Yan.

61
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,820
I'm telling you, you need to discipline him more often.

62
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:29,080
Every time he sees me, he becomes like a certain person. He gets that gleam in his eye, thinking about how to flip me.

63
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,220
You don't know, but your Gou Dan is just like her.

64
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,420
He is still so little, but he loves trying to find someone to support him.

65
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,640
Don't give him some random nicknames.

66
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,720
Besides, I don't rely on anyone now.

67
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,990
I set up Troupe Zhenxi and took in those homeless demons.

68
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,760
You're also the King of All Demons.

69
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,140
You should be thanking me, instead of raking my past up.

70
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,060
- Exactly.
- Fine.

71
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,280
Okay. I think it's almost time.

72
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,800
Everyone be seated. The show is about to begin.

73
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,600
Sit.

74
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,800

76

That's me...

77

Why are you...

78
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,480
It's really you, Novelist Yan Dan?

79
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,240
I've always been a fan of your plays!

80
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,260
I collected many excerpts from your plays and made a book, "Samsara Collection".

81
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:35,340
I've read it so many times, and every time I do, I'm always moved to tears.

82
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,960
May I have your autograph?

83
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,350
I'd like to keep it for memory's sake.

84

Of course.
