00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,160
<i>What emotions are these?</i>

19
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,760
Advisor Lotus, you really are biased.

20
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,820
You've kept all the delicious desserts for Tang Zhou.

21
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,440
Your poor master here is starving and can only cook for himself.

22
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,280
I made egg fried rice. Want some?

23
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,420
It smells so good.

24
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,580
What? Even your table manners have become better.

25
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,220
Is something bothering you?

26
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,740
And you still say there's nothing on your mind.

27
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,600
You can't even lie anymore.

28
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:49,100
Usually, when something happens, you would write it in the Diary of the Mortal World.

29
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:55,300
But right now, you haven't written anything and keep staring at it uneasily.

30
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,340
Yan Dan, what has happened?

31
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,620
Talk to me.

32
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,120
Given our relationship, is there anything we can't talk about?

33
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,640
I don't mean to keep it from you.

34
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,040
It's just that I don't know what's wrong with me either.

35
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,940
Whenever I see Tang Zhou, I always have a strange feeling.

36
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,620
I've never felt this before.

37
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,520
Plus I can't control myself at all.

38
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,980
So... you like him.

39
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,200
I don't know.

40
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,620
I often read sad and sentimental love stories,

41
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,980
and I also will write pieces like these.

42
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,160
But after so many years, I've never had any feelings for anyone before.

43
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,180
I don't know what love is either.

44
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:49,020
So, I don't understand what kind of feelings I have for Tang Zhou.

45
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,960
It's all right.

46
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,680
You don't know it right now, but sooner or later you will.

47
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,160
What's more, we demons live for a long time.

48
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,960
We have the time and energy to experience earthly emotions.

49
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,520
But Tang Zhou's identity is special.

50
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:18,620
As a human, he'll become the Sect Leader of Lingxiao Sect and must cut off all emotions.

51
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:24,560
After his ordeal is over, he'll return to the Heavenly Realm and live as a diety.

52
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,580
Regardless of what you think by then, I'll give you some advice right now.

53
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,960
You both have very different statuses.

54
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,740
You aren't a good match.

55
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,840
Either way, please don't force yourself.

56
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,740
I don't want you to get hurt.

57
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,240
Yan Dan, can you understand?

58
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,160
<i>I hope you truly understand.</i>

59
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,060
Palace Master, the plan is coming along smoothly.

60
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,300
They've already taken the bait.

61
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,800
I hit the leaves instead of the fruit.

62
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,740
My demonic power has already weakened to this point.

63
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,680
You have power, but your aim was off.

64
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,980
Try harder and you'll definitely hit your targets consistently.

65
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,660
Zi Lin, there's no need to try and make me feel better.

66
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:26,120
When the poison took effect, I gave Zi Yan 500 years of demonic power to delay the effects,

67
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,980
but I can't make up for those years

68
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:35,360
even if I practice 100 times or 1,000 times.

69
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:54,440
As long as you are willing to help, I will reciprocate in kind in the future.

70
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,720
This Fox Clan is always fussy and stubborn.

71
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,660
Plus they hate being deceived the most.

72
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,160
I am an unimportant brush object spirit.

73
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,740
How could I dare cross them?

74
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,400
Just forget it.

75
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:15,080
If they find out, I'll... it won't be good. Won't be good.

76
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:20,000
As the saying goes, divine object spirit, divine object spirit.

77
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,580
Better the object, better the spirit.

78
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:30,820
As long as you help me, I'll replace your bristles with top-quality wolf hair.

79
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,520
What do you think?

80
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,820
Really?

81
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,140
Yes.

82
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,120
Do Brush Fairies really exist in this world?

83
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,240
Try it and you'll find out.

84
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,960
A circle means yes.

85
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,580
If the brush drops, it means no.

86
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,480
Lofty Brush Fairy, answer my questions.

87
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,920
He is here.

88
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:08,760
Can the Fox Demon Lin Lang achieve mastery through practice, regain her power, and shoot with precision?

89
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,360
Look. The Brush Fairy shares my thoughts.

90
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,760
Thank you for the pointers, Brush Fairy.

91
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,600
I have one more question I'd like to ask.

92
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,420
I am at a marriageable age.

93
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,600
Brush Fairy...

94
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:36,100
Brush Fairy, may I know if there's someone I'm destined to marry?

95
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,420
You two teamed up to deceive me.

96
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,420
I didn't teach him this!

97
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,180
Do you know what the punishment for playing tricks and lying to the Fox Clan is?

98
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,980
No, no. M-Miss Fox Demon.

99
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,200
It wasn't me. H-he forced me to do it!

100
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,400
You lied to me again.

101
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,340
I told him to tell the first lie, but not the second one.

102
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,880
Right?

103
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:25,600
Maybe he's right and we really are fated to be together by destiny.

104
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,800
How about... we give it a try?

105
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,840
Great skill! I said you could do it!

106
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,640
You're the princess of the Fox Clan.

107
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,060
You're so pretty, but why is your temper so explosive?

108
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,280
Who would marry her a girl like her?

109
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,660
You nasty broken brush. How dare you slander my wife!

110
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,500
On the wedding day, I'll be the first to break you into pieces.

111
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,780
Who's marrying you? I'm not your wife!

112
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,640
Believe me, I'll break you right now!

113
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,180
- Don't run!
- No, no.

114
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,540
- No, no!
- Don't run. Don't run.

115
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,500
Don't run!

116
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,940
It seems that these two are indeed destined.

117
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,500
This...

118
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,180
To protect my life, I should just shut up.

119
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,780
None of these plum blossom hairpins matches Xiao Qi's wound.

120
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,671
Let's go to the next shop.

121
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,000
Y-Yan Dan.

122
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,740
What is it?

123
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:51,340
Well, I have something to tell you.

124
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,980
What is it?

125
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,520
There is nothing between Fu Shuang and I.

126
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:05,060
Yesterday, I wanted to find out the truth, so I put on an act in the room.

127
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,760
Don't get us wrong.

128
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,880
I would never give your things to anyone else.

129
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,240
What are you doing? Why explain all this to me?

130
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,560
I just don't want any misunderstandings, that's all.

131
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:30,040
Last night, I wanted to... explain it to you, but I was afraid I might not sound sincere.

132
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,940
So, I read a few novels.

133
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,740
It says in a script that misunderstandings must be explained promptly.

134
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,160
You know that, right?

135
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,740
You have always been old-fashioned and stubborn.

136
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,600
I'm surprised that you would go read novels to help you apologize.

137
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,360
All right then. Since we've cleared up the misunderstanding, I forgive you.

138
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:56,340
As for this bouquet... since you've watched so many plays, have you heard this saying?

139
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,680
"Every time I pass by the garden, I care not about the flowers."

140
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,580
What does it mean?

141
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:07,940
It means I don't like anything else,

142
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,000
except for this Agarwood Flower Hairpin.

143
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,600
<i>I didn't expect Tang Zhou to be so affectionate towards her.</i>

144
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,920
I've already checked the other shops. There was no match.

145
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,540
All right then.

146
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,420
Miss, your hairpin has a very unique pattern, but the material is a bit ordinary.

147
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,660
Would you like to order a gold and jade one from my store?

148
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,120
It will be even more resplendent.

149
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,380
Your shop does customize hairpins?

150
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:57,080
As long as you pay and give us the design, our shop can make any style you desire.

151
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,540
The shopkeeper said that this hairpin was custom made by Fu Shuang.

152
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:13,320
From the looks of it, this hairpin matches the shape of Xiao Qi's wound.

153
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,880
Looks like Fu Shuang might be the old lady who killed Xiao Qi.

154
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,660
Are the people of Shenxiao Palace this skilled?

155
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,140
Have they all mastered the art of face changing?

156
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:26,520
If we only have a drawing as proof, she might not confess that easily.

157
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:32,120
Xiao Qi said before that Shenxiao Palace members all have a three-petal plum blossom tattoo on them.

158
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,060
If we can confirm this, then they must have done it.

159
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,040
If there are tattoos, they would be hidden.

160
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,160
You two can't check her. I'll do it.

161
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,560
Miss Yan, why are you here?

162
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,400
It's like this. Tang Zhou asked me to apologize for being unromantic.

163
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,960
He said he was wrong.

164
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:20,720
He wanted to order some clothes for you as an apology, but he doesn't know your size.

165
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,740
So he asked me to come here.

166
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,100
I see.

167
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,000
Then I'll ask my maid to get my measurements and let you know later.

168
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,160
- You can leave first.
- No problem. We are both women.

169
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,820
- It's my pleasure. Come on. It's my pleasure.
- But...

170
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,620
- Here I go.
- I don't think this is appropriate.

171
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,120
- I think it's about that long.
- You don't have to, Miss Yan.

172
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,980
- I'll have my maid do it.
- Relax, it's all right.

173
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,000
Really, Miss Yan.

174
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,740
Miss Yan.

175
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,520
To my surprise, the evidence was right in front of us.

176
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:59,400
The butterfly tattoo that we saw on her arm becomes a three-petal plum blossom when soaked in hot water.

177
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,040
From the looks of it, she must be from Shenxiao Palace.

178
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,290
I can't be wrong this time.

179
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:11,340
Since her identity has been exposed, she'll try her best tonight to notify other palace members.

180
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:17,960
We just need to wait quietly, follow the clues, find Shenxiao Palace and retrieve the Truth Duster.

181
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,560
Have some tea.

182
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,180
Where is this?

183
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,900
I read about this in the classics before.

184
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,640
There is a magic spell in the world called Moon in the Mirror Lake.

185
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,500
One can transform spiritual power into the Spiritual Domain, hide in it, and cover up one's trail.

186
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,640
The scenery in the Spiritual Domain is completely different from the real scenery.

187
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,840
The spell-caster can change it as desired.

188
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,740
It was clearly nighttime just now.

189
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,820
In an instant, it became daytime.

190
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,820
It's summer now, but the plum blossoms are blooming here.

191
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:27,100
If my guess is correct, this is the Spiritual Domain of the Palace Master of Shenxiao Palace.

192
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:39,180
I knew the person behind Fu Shuang was you, the Palace Master of Shenxiao Palace.

193
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,800
When did you start suspecting me?

194
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,720
There's no influential Liu family in the city.

195
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,600
It was easy to figure out if your identity was real or not.

196
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,540
Moon in the Mirror Lake moves because of you.

197
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,540
Who else but you would have such skills?

198
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,800
You went to such great lengths to trap us here.

199
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,900
You must have other motives.

200
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,000
All three of you are quick-witted and have superb magical skills.

201
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,180
Had Fu Shuang not lured you in, it would've been hard for me to trap you in the array.

202
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,370
That being the case, hurry up and undo this stupid magical spell.

203
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:17,280
Otherwise when we undo it, your energy would be wasted.

204
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:23,200
Although you know that this is my Spiritual Domain, you can't breach my array.

205
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:28,530
You will only be drained of your spiritual power in here and turn into nothing but bones.

206
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,340
The array is powerful indeed.

207
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:44,520
Had he wanted to kill us, he could have done it in Indulgence House.

208
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,300
You once said that the Palace Master of Shenxiao Palace wanted to use the Truth Duster,

209
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:55,660
but didn't know how to do it, so he couldn't activate the divine tools.

210
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,440
You did everything possible to lure us here.

211
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,940
It is because you want us to help you, right?

212
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,760
Do you want to be candid or fight?

213
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,780
The decision is yours.

214
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,460
What is this?

215
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,860
Why do I feel that my spiritual power gets weaker when I'm near it?

216
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,440
This... is the reason I brought you here.

217
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,740
<i>I was once seriously injured and lost my memory.</i>

218
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,160
<i>When I woke up, I was already on Zhucui Mountain.</i>

219
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:11,080
<i>In front of me was an old man and this vortex.</i>

220
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,540
<i>The old man told me that this place was the Illusion of Devils.</i>

221
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:31,420
<i>He taught me how to extract energy from it and use it for my cultivation to enhance my spiritual power.</i>

222
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:36,040
<i> He also taught me a magic spell to change my appearance.</i>

223
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,660
<i>I wanted to ask him who he was,</i>

224
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,940
<i> - Elder!
- but he didn't want to say more.</i>

225
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:51,000
<i>In the end, he passed away.</i>

226
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:02,880
<i>I had no choice but to create the Spiritual Domain to conceal the Illusion of Devils.</i>

227
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:21,020
<i>Later, I practiced using the Illusion of Devils and gradually recovered.</i>

228
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:36,140
<i>But when I tried entering the Illusion of Devils to retrieve my memory and gain more power,</i>

229
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:40,620
<i>I discovered a miasma at the entrance that I couldn't break through.</i>

230
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,540
<i>Greetings, Palace Master.</i>

231
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,920
<i>Meanwhile, I built the Shenxiao Palace</i>

232
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:53,680
<i>and recruited palace servants to find a way to break the miasma.</i>

233
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,280
<i>All the dancers in Indulgence House are from Shenxiao Palace.</i>

234
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,080
<i>After I stole the Truth Duster, I couldn't activate it.</i>

235
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:20,380
<i>Thank you for coming to Indulgence House and enabling me to beat you at your own game.</i>

236
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,920
<i>Palace Master.</i>

237
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,040
You chicken thief!
<i>(T/N: cunning)</i>

238
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,420
You invited me to play GO because you wanted to find out how to use the Truth Duster.

239
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,740
When you got nothing from me, you made Fu Shuang approach Tang Zhou

240
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,860
to see if he had anything on him to control the Truth Duster.

241
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:53,240
When the plan failed, you used the plum blossom hairpin as a clue to get us to investigate it.

242
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,160
Looks like every one of our moves was part of your plan.

243
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,710
I've already shared my explanation.

244
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,640
As long as you help me enter the Illusion of Devils,

245
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,420
I will return the Truth Duster and let you out of the Moon in the Mirror Lake.

246
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,980
However, you still refuse to explain what the Illusion of Devils is,

247
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,980
and why it'll suck our spiritual power, and whether it is dangerous or not.

248
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,820
If you don't tell us more, how could we help you?

249
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,900
This is all I know about the Illusion of Devils.

250
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:29,540
If you want to know more, take me in to retrieve my memory, and then I'll tell you.

251
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,500
Shenxiao Palace stole from us first.

252
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,900
Besides, you lied to us before.

253
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,560
Now, you've deceived us again.

254
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,920
Do you think we are stupid?

255
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:43,200
If you three don't want to help, you won't be able to take back the Truth Duster.

256
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,380
That's not up to you.

257
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,900
I have an idea.

258
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,340
How about we go into the Illusion of Devils?

259
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,760
What are you doing?

260
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:05,860
In the Divine-Devil War 1,000 years ago, many heavenly treasures were lost in the Mortal Realm.

261
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:10,460
Tang Zhou said before that where there is a tool, there will be an anomaly.

262
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,640
The right now the Illusion of Devils is lingering here.

263
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,860
There must be a divine tool here.

264
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,560
Why don't we make a deal?

265
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,640
We help you enter the Illusion of Devils, and you help us find the tool.

266
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,560
From now on, we'll consider ourselves even. Deal?

267
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,920
All right.

268
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:15,480
All right. I'll back you up.

269
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,920
I'll become useless if I keep depending on you.

270
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,340
I'll rely more on myself from now on.

271
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,220
<i>Where am I?</i>

272
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,340
<i>Tang Zhou, is that you?</i>

273
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,920
Yu Mo! Yu Mo!

274
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,860
Yu Mo! Hurry! Wake up!

275
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:20,400
Yu Mo! Yu Mo, wake up!

276
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,820
<i>This is a dreamscape.</i>

277
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,660
<i>Yan Dan!</i>

278
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,220
Tang Zhou!

279
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,860
What is going on?

280
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:07,440
Tang Zhou! Wake up! Tang Zhou!

281
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,640
<i> Why does my heart hurt and I feel like crying when I touch him?</i>

282
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,080
Wake up!

283
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,640
Yan Dan!

284
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,820
Yan Dan.

285
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,860
Tang Zhou.

286
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,240
Yan Dan!

287
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:54,000
Yan Dan! We can't save him with magic spells, but what you are doing won't help him either.

288
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,460
The sand haunts those in the dreamland.

289
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,820
The spell can only be broken when you wake up.

290
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,240
Hurry, wake him up!

291
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,160
All right. Tang Zhou. Tang Zhou, wake up!

292
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,200
<i>Tang Zhou!</i>

293
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,920
Tang Zhou! Hurry! Wake up!

294
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:12,300
<i>Do you want to choose her or the right path?</i>

295
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:26,420
<i>Kill her! Kill her!</i>

296
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,960
<i>No. No!</i>

297
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,280
<i>No!</i>

298
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,380
You're finally awake.

299
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:00,240
Just now I thought if you didn't wake up, I'd slap you awake!

300
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,040
<i>I mustn't fall in love.</i>

301
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,460
<i>I can't let Yan Dan get hurt.</i>

302
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,220
<i>This is the first time I've seen him so panicked.</i>

303
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,560
<i>What did he dream about?</i>

304
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,120
Brother Tang, you have superb magic skills.

305
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,000
Why couldn't you escape from the nightmare?

306
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,340
Even though it was a nightmare, it felt real.

307
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,120
Even the pain felt real.

308
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,260
I couldn't find a way to escape.

309
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:30,680
Those entering the Illusion of Devils will recall painful memories.

310
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:35,780
Although it is difficult to stay calm, we'll feel better after waking up.

311
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,700
How did you know?

312
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,260
I was in a dreamland that I never experienced before.

313
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,560
Because I dreamt that the person I love died.

314
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:49,060
This is what I fear the most in the Three Realms.

315
00:29:53,802 --> 00:29:59,940
<i>Tang Zhou's expression meant that in the fantasy land, he saw the person he desired.</i>

316
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,200
<i>He is so sad.</i>

317
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,700
<i>He must be deeply in love with that person.</i>

318
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,080
Didn't you say you lost your memory?

319
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,940
Did you recall anything in the dreamscape?

320
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:17,940
I only saw the traumatic time after I was healed and was practicing magic and spells.

321
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,680
Nothing else.

322
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,920
This Illusion of Devils is empty.

323
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,840
Where does its energy come from?

324
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,660
The wind is blowing the sand around pretty badly. Let's look around first.

325
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,240
Let's go.

326
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,240
Let's go.

327
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,160
There is a pond up ahead.

328
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,280
I'll go fetch you all some water.

329
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,140
Why did the color of the water change?

330
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,620
- Be careful! Run!
- Yan Dan!

331
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,900
The oasis transformed from a giant snake.

332
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,620
My heavens, why does this snake have nine tails?

333
00:31:54,580 --> 00:32:00,100
Is this the devilish beast from the classics, the Nine-Tailed Hydra?

334
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,740
If it really is the Nine-Tailed Hydra, protect your entire body.

335
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:07,260
Its blood is poisonous. Don't let it touch you.

336
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,180
Step back, Yan Dan!

337
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:10,460
Watch out! It can regrow its tails!

338
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:16,000
The classics say that it has an unusual tail which is its life-gate!

339
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,320
As long as you find it, that'll solve it!

340
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,720
It can't regrow that tail!

341
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,720
The two tails on the far right intertwine with and protect each other.

342
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,240
One of them must be the life-gate.

343
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,900
Don't act rashly. If you cut the wrong tail, it'll regrow and become more deadly.

344
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,560
Let's do this. I'll distract it. You both watch it carefully.

345
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,500
Be careful, everyone!

346
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,600
Yan Dan!

347
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,720
What have you done? Why did you gouge your skin? I can heal you.

348
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:19,420
The venom is strong. Only removing it can heal it.

349
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,560
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

350
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,280
Watch out for the illusions!

351
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:19,080
Didn't they say all of the Nine-Tailed Hydras disappeared along with the Devils?

352
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,960
Why would it appear here?

353
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,280
One of us must have seen it before and had a scary memory.

354
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,900
That's why it appeared in the Illusion of Devils.

355
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,580
Who has seen it before?

356
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:36,320
<i> This hydra must be from Marshal Huo De who participated in the Divine-Devil War.</i>

357
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,880
<i> Back then, he sent my master back to the Deity Realm.</i>

358
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,680
This hydra is related to the Devil Clan.

359
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,240
I want to see what price l can sell news about the Devils at the tea house for.

360
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,800
Stupid. That's not profitable.

361
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,500
I would say there's more value in pulling its teeth out.

362
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:57,040
I wanted to write some strange tales about immortal beings lately.

363
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,880
If I can use the hydra teeth as props, then I'll definitely have a full house.

364
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,400
Obsessed with money.

365
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,840
I got a tooth. Let's go.

366
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,460
Where are we?

367
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,440
An unknown place. Everyone, be careful.

368
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,020
This is so weird.

369
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:36,680
This is obviously a chamber hall. Why are there so many mirrors?

370
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:45,080
I got it. Is this what the old lady referred to as the place for retrieving memories?

371
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,040
What's wrong, Liu Weiyang?

372
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,240
I'm fine.

373
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,900
I know. You must be looking for your memory.

374
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:04,280
Look how difficult it is for other people to find lost memories.

375
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,960
Why won't you use the Recall Memory Pearl the Dragon King gave you?

376
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,780
I am a disciple of the Lingxiao Sect.

377
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:13,300
I must bear responsibility to the present. It has nothing to do with my past.

378
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,260
There is no rush.

379
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,940
I think there is something there.

380
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,180
You're right.

381
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,140
No longer desolate, all things reincarnate.

382
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:04,720
This should be the third divine tool, Paper and Ink.

383
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,700
Paper and Ink?

384
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,560
I can't believe a treasure like this exists in the world.

385
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,900
If others found out about it, how many would flock here and fight over it?

386
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,780
Who are they?

387
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:52,020
Were they the former owners of the chamber hall?

388
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,780
Liu Weiyang, do you know them?

389
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,840
He was high-ranking and powerful and was leading the officials.

390
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:30,500
He looks like an important person.

391
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:36,360
No one has lived here for a long time and the mirrors can reflect past scenes.

392
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,260
There must be more to it than meets the eye.

393
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,380
We have to be careful.

394
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:45,560
Paper and Ink must have been reactivated and its divine power is leaking.

395
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,560
Look here.

396
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:57,940
<i>We offer our bodies and blood for the deity's blessings.</i>

397
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:03,640
<i>We ask for ultimate power and reverse the origin of the universe.</i>

398
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,880
Blood charisma.

399
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,160
This is an evil magic and is not done by deities.

400
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,920
What's wrong?

401
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,620
I'm fine.

402
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,020
Oh no! The Nine-Tailed Hydra is coming back to life!

403
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,500
Everyone, hurry, get the Paper and Ink away from here.

404
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,000
Liu Weiyang!

405
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,940
That is not a mirror image!

406
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,900
You're back.

407
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,340
You are finally back.

408
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,700
Who on earth are you?

409
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,540
Are you all right?

410
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,950
I'm fine.

411
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:32,980
- What about you?
- I'm fine too.

412
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,040
Sure enough. I've got it.

413
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,500
He has no consciousness and only attacks moving objects.

414
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,140
Let's do this. Two of us fly out of here and lure him out of here.

415
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,200
The other two stay here to get the tool.

416
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,700
- All right.
- Protect Yan Dan.

417
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:57,760
I'll go dispel the fog. You go get the tool.

418
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,920
All right. You've got the tool. Let's hurry and go.

419
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,620
- Wait.
- What now?!

420
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,080
Take it. It's a thank you gift for saving me.

421
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:34,040
<i>Is this what happens when your heart is moved?</i>

422
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,920
Take it.

423
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,460
You saved my life in the desert too.

424
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:50,720
It cost a petal, so I'm giving a petal back to you.

425
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,040
Keep it so that you can protect yourself later.

426
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,780
Take it!

427
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,180
Thank you.

428
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,620
Let's go.

429
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:03,260
I don't really want it, but I'll accept it reluctantly.

430
