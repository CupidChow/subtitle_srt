After a busy day, we finally got them together by raining flower petals.

You're the one who won the water lantern.

Mountain Chief, the koi fish are still here and refuse to leave.

You're a fish too. Could you please reason with them, tell them to swim further away so people can't catch them?

Sure, no problem.

<i>[Lingxiao Sect]</i>

43
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,860
Tang Zhou, do you acknowledge your mistake?

44
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,120
I accidentally hurt my peers out of desperation.

45
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,360
I'll accept the punishment.

46
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,680
If you admit your mistake and make changes, cease your affections,

47
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,380
I'll be lenient on you considering your past contributions.

48
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:23,380
You've misunderstood, Sect Leader. I'll accept the punishment, but I did no wrong.

49
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,600
What did you say?

50
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,380
Previously, I held to your teachings and stayed away from desires.

51
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,480
I deemed affection as the absolute evil deep inside and the magical bracelet alerted me to cut it off.

52
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,080
I also feared that I'd fall into the abyss of evil.

53
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,740
However, feelings grow from within and my desire won't stop if my heart is still alive.

54
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,160
If it's wrong to have feelings,

55
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,540
then between the feelings of human beings or the righteousness of the world, which one is right?

56
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:00,040
I would rather suffer from deep feelings and love than be a heartless person.

57
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,380
So, if I'm not wrong, I naturally won't admit to it.

58
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,100
Absurd!

59
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:10,260
Since you're unrepentant, I'll punish you according to sect rules without showing mercy!

63
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,840
Fine.

64
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,980
Before I launch the punishment, I ask you once again.

65
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,060
Are you willing to cut off your feelings?

66
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,460
I'm not willing.

67
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:47,580
Tang Zhou is my successor, yet he failed to practice the abstinence of love!

68
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,920
Per the rules, all members of the Lingxiao Sect are responsible to get him back on the right track!

69
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,900
Starting from me, every disciple has to ask him that same question again!

70
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,320
The whip won't stop until he changes the answer!

71
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:13,420
Tang Zhou. Are you willing to cut off your feelings?

72
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,040
I'm not.

73

Qin Qi. Do you want to go against me too?

74

Junior sister. Do it.

75
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:50,260
Senior Brother. Are you willing to cut off your feelings?

76

I'm not.

The other foxes made fun of him so he's hiding in his room crying.

Those fox demons being judgmental about someone's appearance really isn't a good thing.

Don't learn this from him, okay?

Senior, I saw the medicine you sold could heal any wound.

127
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:21,220
And there's an herb from the Yanbi Pill that can heal disfigured faces.

128
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,620
A friend of mine has old scars all over.

129
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,260
I wonder if you can concoct an antidote to remove the scars?

130
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,940
Well...

131
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,200
This medicine is enough to heal common scars.

132
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:45,460
However, to heal old scars completely, there's one more herb needed to remove them.

133
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,320
- Take this medicine.
- Thank you.

134
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,120
I'll write the prescription for you.

It's not easy to find such a rare herb.

My friend is very important to me. I'll willing to forsake my life for his sake.

Tell me, had I persisted in my decision, would you have chosen me instead?

144
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,120
Did you all stop me here just to ask this one question?

145

There's nothing between Tang Zhou and I.

149
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,020
You should go back.

150

151
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,180
Very good then.

Sect Leader? Exactly who wants to see me?

154
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,420
What has happened to Tang Zhou?

155
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,060
That's none of your business, Miss.

156
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:23,000
Just come with me. I'll protect you.

157
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,740
What if I say no?

158
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,520
Miss Yan Dan, no one can disobey the Sect Leader's order.

159
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,880
In that case, pardon my rudeness.

160
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,980
- I won't allow you bully Sister Yan Dan!
- Dan Shu.

161
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,540
Isn't he the demon who ran away from the Demon Suppression Hall?

162
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,240
It was him! I remember, he's a wolf demon!

163
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,180
Why are you with a demon?

164
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:47,420
Don't tell me you were involved in the incident in Demon Suppression Hall.

165
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,740
Watch out!

166
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,300
<i>[Grand Chancellor Manor]</i>

167
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,400
- Are you all right, Dan Shu?
- I'm fine.

168
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,420
You're a demon too?

169
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,520
Senior Dao Yuan, the two of us are just powerless demons.

170
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,300
We have never harbored bad intentions or committed evil deeds.

171
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,060
You're a sensible man.

172
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:15,400
We knew each other from before, you should know that I'm not lying.

173
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,260
Could you please spare us and let us leave based on our past friendship?

174
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,300
I can't believe I was bewitched by a demon.

175
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,480
You... are malicious!

176
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,060
Sure enough.

177
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:36,200
This is the typical reaction we demons expect from demon catchers.

178
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,760
Form the formation and seize the demons!

179
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,600
Dan Shu, get out of here.

180
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,300
Sister Yan Dan. I can't move.

181
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:59,160
I performed the demon locking spell when he showed his tail just now.

182
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:04,160
Crushing such little demons is as lifting a finger.

183
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,000
If you want him to live, then come with us.

184
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,960
We wolves are born tough.

185
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,660
Sister Yan Dan, leave now. Don't worry about me. Don't let them capture you!

186
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,900
Dan Shu, don't worry. I'll figure out a way.

187
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,740
We'll go with them first.

188
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,520
I'll come with you!

189
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:36,000
Previously, we lost track of the demons when we got to this area.

190
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,620
However, Lin Lang and I overheard that someone saw a demon here when we were walking around this morning.

191
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,740
We've been in the mortal world for more than half a month,

192
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,760
yet there's no sign of the demons after they went missing.

193
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,140
Only he was spotted by someone.

194
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,800
Let's search carefully.

195
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,060
We'll definitely discover something new.

196
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,360
More and more demons are going missing lately.

197
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,520
Those who live in Yelan Mountain are all nervous and agitated.

198
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:15,200
I think need to get back quickly and calm them down as soon as possible.

199
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,020
We'll head back right after the investigation.

200
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,880
We can't let them down and return empty-handed.

201
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,960
Don't be scared. Look carefully at us.

202
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:57,080
Mountain Chief Zi Lin. Mountain Chief Yu Mo. I'm finally saved.

203
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,720
Please take me back to the mountain, I beg you.

204
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,840
I'll never leave the mountain again!

205
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,540
Hurry, get up.

206
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,400
Are you all right, hurt anywhere?

207
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,450
In order to ensure no other demons get hurt,

208
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:16,350
I have a question I want to ask you.

209
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,320
You must have seen this before.

210
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:31,800
After I snuck out to play, I was captured by a Taoist in this outfit.

211
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,300
He locked me up in a pitch-black space.

212
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,760
It was so scary.

213
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,200
Do you remember where you were locked up?

214
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,320
I had no idea at first,

215
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,520
but I heard from the other demons say that it was the Lingxiao Sect.

216
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,500
Turns out it really is Lingxiao Sect behind this.

217
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,740
I've told you not to trust Tang Zhou.

218
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:00,260
We were tortured by those from the Lingxiao Sect.

219
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,920
They cut our skin and drained our blood.

220
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:09,630
One day, I had an opportunity and transformed into my real form and climbed out.

221
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:13,140
However, I broke into a place

222
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:20,100
and I saw a man they called "Sect Leader" throw a demon into an alchemy furnace!

223
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,440
Lingxiao Sect tends to claim they are righteous and just.

224
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,280
Never would've thought they would dare to kill demons to refine into pills!

225
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,260
Yu Mo. We, demons from the mountain never torment humans,

226
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,520
and our kindness has caused us trouble instead.

227
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:41,180
There are so many demons missing right now, they must've captured them!

228
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,700
Let's go.

229
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,540
We'll raze the Lingxiao Sect to the ground and get the children back.

230
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,400
No.

231
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,140
The Lingxiao Sect is powerful.

232
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,580
We need to plan meticulously before any decisions are made.

233
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,060
We mustn't act rashly.

234
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:58,120
Right now their safety is our top priority.

235
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,980
We can't put the mountain demons in danger again.

236
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,420
Do you remember how you escaped from there?

237
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,120
I didn't dare eat or sleep.

238
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:15,960
I hid in a crevice and managed to escape their grasp after a month.

239
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,300
I was planning to return to the mountain, but demons catchers were everywhere.

240
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:25,840
I was too afraid of them... so I kept hiding.

241
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,840
I'm sorry.

242
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,400
I saw so many demons who were being tortured,

243
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,400
but I wasn't brave enough to save them.

244
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,020
It's okay. You've already done well.

245
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:46,000
Don't worry. We promise to get you back safe and sound.

246
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,120
<i>Yan Dan. Yan Dan.</i>

247
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,920
Have you seen Yan Dan?

248
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,540
I've gone to the places she used to visit, but she's nowhere to be found.

249
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:12,800
This morning, the staff in the inn saw Yan Dan going out with Dan Shu.

250
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,500
But it's late already, why haven't they come back yet?

251
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,380
Come with me.

252
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,600
Dan Shu and Yan Dan were involved in a fight here.

253
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,200
The people they fought were in a group and they had a divine tool for catching demons.

254
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,100
Would it be those from the Lingxiao Sect, the ones who captured the snake demon earlier?

255
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,500
Yan Dan is shrewd and has no demonic aura.

256
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,100
Besides, she's just regained her memory lately and her demonic power is stronger than before.

257
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,600
Even if she encountered them she would've found a way to escape.

258
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,200
Could it be... because of Dan Shu?

259
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,060
Dan Shu?

260
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,760
What have you found?

261
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,920
<i>[Tang]</i>

262
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,400
<i>[Records of Tang Dynasty's General Supernatural Events, The Romantic Affair]</i>

263
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,040
This is the book that Yan Dan bought from the temple fair.

264
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:35,280
Yan Dan had a habit of bringing along a book that she hasn't finished reading.

265
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,000
She'll tear the corner of the book when she's in danger.

266
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,020
And it's the word "Tang".

267
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,760
- Tang Zhou.
- Tang Zhou?

268
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,840
Why did he capture Yan Dan? What's wrong with him?

269
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,300
It's impossible.

270
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,920
Tang Zhou values promises a great deal.

271
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,700
Even if he really wanted to capture Yan Dan, he would've come alone.

272
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,200
Looking at all these foot prints, it was definitely more than one person.

273
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,980
I got it.

274
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,400
Yan Dan was trying to tell me that it wasn't an accident that the Lingxiao Sect seized her.

275
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,700
Instead, they seized her because of Tang Zhou.

276
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,200
All right. I know what's happening now.

277
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,080
The Lingxiao Sect is too outrageous.

278
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,860
We cannot sit by and do nothing.

279
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:24,300
Forget discussing things, it's more important to go to the Lingxiao Sect immediately to rescue them.

280
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,080
True, we can't wait anymore.

281
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,060
But I'll go by myself.

282
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,220
You two should go back first.

283
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,760
Demon catchers from Lingxiao Sect are everywhere.

284
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,780
I'm afraid something will happen.

285
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,760
Demons in the mountain need you two right now.

286
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:54,970
<i>[Lingxiao Sect]</i>

287
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,700
Senior brother.

288
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,880
I don't need your help.

289
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,020
The Sect Leader summoned the disciples to capture Yan Dan.

290
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,240
What did they do to her?

291
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,820
They found out her identity.

292
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,500
Senior Brother. You knew this all along.

293
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,700
Senior Brother. Why are you such a fool?

294
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,300
Although Yan Dan is a demon, after all is said and done, she saved my life in the past.

295
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,700
I can't bear to see her die in front of me.

296
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:35,250
<i>[Memorial Tablet of the Founder, Fu Qingyang]</i>

297
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,420
Is this how the Lingxiao Sect treats their guests?

298
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:05,700
The this the only outcome when an evil being enters the Lingxiao Sect.

299
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:12,120
Little flower demon, you've got some tricks, managed to hide your demonic aura and deceive my disciples.

300
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,900
The mastermind behind the incident at Demon Suppression Hall must have been you, right?

301
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,960
I thought Tang Zhou wanted to see me.

302
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,920
You wanted me to come here to meet Tang Zhou.

303
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,400
Where is he?

304
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,260
You'll never see him again.

305
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,800
Had you been human, dealing with you would've taken longer.

306
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,400
Since you're a demon, that makes it easier then.

307
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:42,000
The demon execution mirror formation will devour you like an ant and crush your primordial spirit into ash.

308
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,070
This is the cost you have to pay for seducing the future sect leader of the Lingxiao Sect.

309
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:08,400
Although I'm a demon, I've never committed an evil deed or seduced anyone.

310
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,220
And I have absolutely nothing to do with Tang Zhou!

311
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:15,500
Is the Lingxiao Sect going to kill me indiscriminately?

312
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,620
Do you actually cultivate a bloodthirsty practice instead?!

313
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:27,190
You're indeed a powerful demon, no wonder you dare to utter nonsense here.

314
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:30,500
However, it ends here.

315
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,300
The practice of Taoism should be clean and pure.

316
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,400
Why does your power contain an intense heinous aura?

317
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,000
Were those missing demons captured by you?

318
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:01,000
Unbelievable! The sect leader of Lingxiao Sect secretly practices evil skills!

319
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,380
What's the difference between you and those malicious demons you mentioned!

320
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,760
How dare you spout nonsense when you're about to meet your end!

321
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,360
Stop trying to bewitch people!

322
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,900
All disciples, listen to my orders! Eliminate this demon!

323
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,480
Who released him?

324
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,960
Sect Leader. This has nothing to do with Yan Dan.

325
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,440
Please don't kill her!

326
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,880
Tang Zhou. Do you remember why we established the Lingxiao Sect in the first place?

327
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,540
To wipe out all demons, uphold justice and punish evil.

328
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:02,110
You've practiced Taoism since you were little, and you're always prudent and conscientious.

329
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,460
You were the role model for all the disciples.

330
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:09,400
However, because you were bewitched by her you've done such ridiculous things!

331
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:14,600
You keep a demon by your side and let her deceive your sect!

332
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,100
Have you forgotten how your master, Tang Jiang, died?

333
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:23,040
He trusted a fox demon who used him to steal the secret scripture

334
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,060
and then killed his entire family!

335
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:32,180
Sect Leader. There are good and evil amongst humans, it is the same with demons.

336
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,900
Yan Dan has a kind soul!

337
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,060
Don't make excuses for her!

338
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:44,400
She used you to harm the sect by setting free the demons in the Demon Suppression Hall.

339
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,590
She's just as malicious as that fox demon.

340
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:52,020
Are the grievous lessons from sacrificing the lives of one family not enough to wake you up?

341
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:58,300
Today, this demon... must be killed!

342
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:02,700
Since you're here, I'll give you a chance to turn over a new leaf.

343
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,000
Kill her with your own hands and I'll let bygones be bygones!

344
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,240
You can still be the next sect leader!

345
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:14,700
However, if you're unrepentant over your mistakes, I will take her life myself!

346
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,160
Make your choice.

347
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:25,760
Your silence has answered me.

348
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,360
I'll do it!

349
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,760
<i>Sure enough.</i>

350
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:40,120
<i>Be it Ying Yuan or Tang Zhou, you still insist on choosing responsibility and righteousness.</i>

351
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:45,000
<i>As for me, I'm always the one you abandon.</i>

352
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:51,580
<i>This time, Ying Yuan, I won't let you hurt me again.</i>

353
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,000
<i>Yan Dan. I've decided to give up the position of Sect Leader of Lingxiao Sect.</i>

<i>I want to ask you this.</i>

359
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:00,000
<i>As an emperor,</i>

360
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,600
<i>you've seen the ups and downs of the Three Realms for tens of thousands of years, seen eons.</i>

<i>I didn't fall for you in the past and I will never fall for you in the future.</i>

370
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:55,000
Taoist Master Tang,

371
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:01,200
I told you a long time ago not to promise what you can't deliver.

372

♫ <i>my love and longing for you makes my pain unbearable </i> ♫

♫ <i> When the lotus blossoms again, you and I will be together </i> ♫

375
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,300
I thought this magical bracelet could constrain me.

376
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:23,000
It turns out that the bracelet breaks when I'm overwhelmed with affection.

377
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:30,200
I told you no matter what choice you made, my heart would never change.

378
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:46,100
Sect Leader. My apologies. But I can't let you hurt her.

379
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,800
Tang Zhou. Why do you continue to make mistake after mistake?

380
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,500
Do you really want to go against your master and destroy the whole sect?

381
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,200
I was an orphan adopted by my master

382
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,600
and raised in the Lingxiao Sect.

383
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,200
There's not one day where I dare to forget his kindness,

384
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,000
but I have no choice but to disobey the teachings today.

385
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,100
I know I have let the sect down.

386
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:14,400
I'm willing to drain off all my cultivation base and be expelled from the sect.

387
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:21,100
Sect Leader, please consider our past and allow me to leave with Yan Dan.

388
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,400
A cultivation base is the foundation of all skills.

389
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,500
Are you really willing to go to this extent for her?

390
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,100
Tang Zhou!

391
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,400
Are you out of your mind? Why did you do that?

392
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,200
Don't worry.

393
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:07,200
It's just that I can't bully you from now on anymore.

394
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,400
Rebellious disciple. Such a rebellious disciple!

395
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,400
Tang Jiang shouldn't have taken you in back then and I've misjudged you for so many years!

396
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,800
My cultivation base was given by my master and the sect

397
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,600
and now it's all gone.

398
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:36,800
Lingxiao Sect... no longer has a disciple named Tang Zhou.

399
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,400
You can leave.

400
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,400
But I never agreed to let you take her away.

401
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,400
Lingxiao Sect never releases any demons!

402
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,400
I'll get you out of here.

403
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,300
You're all my peers.

404
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,600
Even if I still had my cultivation base, I wouldn't fight you.

405
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:20,900
If you want to kill me, then go ahead and come.

406
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,800
However, today,

407
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,900
no matter what, I will take her with me.

408
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,900
Stop it!

409
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,600
We've all grown up together since we were young.

410
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,400
Amongst you, is there anyone who has never received kindness from Senior Tang?

411
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,700
To us, he's our family!

412
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,700
Can you really bear to see him die?

413
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,400
Yu Mo!

414
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,200
I'm taking them.

415
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,400
However, Lingxiao Sect isn't rightful or righteous, I'll visit you again another day.

416
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,000
You will be fine soon.

417
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,800
Your celestial vest is practically gone.

418
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,200
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

419
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,100
You even drained off your cultivation base to save me.

420
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:18,600
Now that your cultivation base is gone, your body is really weak.

421
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,800
You'll regret this decision.

422
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,900
I only did what I had to do.

423
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,000
You don't need to feel bad.

424
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,000
Hurry and consume the flower petal I gave you before.

425
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
It can help ease your pain.

426
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,400
What?

427
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,800
Did you already use that flower petal?

428
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:56,800
That flower petal is the last thing you gave me.

429
