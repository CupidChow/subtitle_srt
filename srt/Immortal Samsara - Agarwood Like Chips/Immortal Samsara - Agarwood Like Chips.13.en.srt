If Marshal Huo De finds out, you'll be punished. Stop it!

17
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,619
Ao Xuan!

18
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,840
Watch out!

19
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,620
Yu Mo!

20
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,600
Brother Yu Mo! Brother Yu Mo!

21
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,100
Why do you keep defending him?

22
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,880
- Let me go!
- What's so great about Yu Mo?

23
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,900
He's just an insignificant black fish.

24
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,079
I'm the Dragon Prince of the East Sea!

25
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,530
Let me go! I'm going to save Brother Yu Mo!

26
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,740
<i>Yu Mo might not fear fire, but if he continues to burn,</i>

27
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,280
<i>his identity as a Nine Fins Clan member might get exposed.</i>

28
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,199
<i>This won't do. I need to put out the fire.</i>

29
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,459
It's useless. That is the Blazing Dragon Flame of the East Sea Dragon Clan.

30
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:32,220
Your insignificant divine arts won't stand a chance.

31
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,300
Yu Mo! The precious item you just consumed will keep you safe.

32
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,420
Don't be afraid! You'll be fine.

33
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,320
A mere immortal attendant can't possibly have anything useful.

34
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,840
You'll watch him turn into a fish crisp.

35
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,639
Ao Xuan, you're cruel and ruthless. I will never marry you!

36
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,840
You can't save him. Just stay by my side.

37
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,440
Once I become King of the Four Seas, you'll be my queen.

38
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,540
I will be good to you.

<i>This is the Light of Ashes of the Nine Fins Clan.</i>

<i>Is Brother Yu Mo a descendant of the Nine Fins Clan?</i>

41
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,659
Well? Are you convinced?

42
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,260
What's all this ruckus at this late hour? What's going on?

43
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,500
Marshal Huo De, I was having a battle of skills with Yu Mo.

44
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,579
- But he suddenly–
- Nonsense!

45
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:28,300
You were the one who set him on fire.

46
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,000
Brother Yu Mo!

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,059
Brother Yu Mo, how are you feeling?

48
00:03:32,059 --> 00:03:34,460
I'm fine. Just a little hot.

49
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,240
Hot? Let me cool you down.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,800
You're still alive?

51
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,200
How could a mere black fish survive the Blazing Dragon Flame?

52
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,040
Marshal Huo De, there must be something fishy about him!

53
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,460
Marshal Huo De, it's like this.

54
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,840
I'm not sure if you've heard of the Snow Lingzhi.

55
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,220
The Snow Lingzhi is a divine herb from the Aquatic Clan.

56
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,580
It can help restore divine powers.

57
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,020
Yu Mo just consumed a Snow Lingzhi.

58
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,160
That's how he survived.

59
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,820
Where did you get such a precious divine herb?

60
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,960
Everyone in the Nine Heavens knows about this.

61
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,540
My sister, Zhi Xi, saved Emperor Ying Yuan.

62
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,240
To repay her good deed, His Majesty gave her the Snow Lingzhi.

63
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,680
She then gifted it to me.

64
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,599
Also, Yu Mo and I are good friends.

65
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,119
I heard he was punished by you.

66
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,860
So I gave him the Snow Lingzhi.

67
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,280
That's how he survived.

68
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,799
That was a really long story!

69
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,780
Why aren't you staying put at Emperor Ying Yuan‘s palace

70
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,400
but hanging out at my place in the middle of the night?

71
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,040
Go back to where you belong!

72
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,779
Yes. I shall take my leave.

73
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,360
And you rascals just can't learn! Was your punishment not harsh enough?

74
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,740
Is Xuanxin Cliff a battle zone?

75
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,180
Immortal Lord Bei Ming spent thousands of years raising rare spiritual beasts.

76
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,799
What if you rascals had hurt or burned them?

77
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:09,380
Would you be able to bear the consequences?

78
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,300
From today onwards, Ao Xuan, Yan Dan...

79
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,619
No, no. Yu Mo!

80
00:05:24,619 --> 00:05:28,780
You two must go back to your own rooms.

81
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,039
Reflect on your mistakes.

82
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:35,860
Without my permission, none of you will set one foot outside your rooms!

83
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,300
I understand.

84
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,620
<i>[Yanxu Heavenly Palace]</i>

85
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,980
Your Majesty.

86
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,920
I have something to ask.

87
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,160
Your Majesty should know this.

88
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,380
Yan Dan has no interest in divinity or cultivation.

89
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,820
Her post at Yanxu Heavenly Palace has been weighing her down.

90
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,360
Yan Dan and I are close and we care about each other.

91
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,380
I can't bear to see her struggle.

92
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,800
Could you send her back to Xuanxin Cliff?

93
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,900
Is this what Yan Dan wants?

94
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,960
A fire broke out at Xuanxin Cliff last night.

95
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,900
In order to save her black fish friend, Yu Mo,

96
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,740
Yan Dan gave him the precious Snow Lingzhi.

97
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,360
Yan Dan has known Immortal Lord Bei Ming for hundreds of years. They were close.

98
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,680
Now she has a confidante in her life.

99
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,880
If it were me, I'd wish to go back too.

100
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,640
How generous of her.

101
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,700
You may rise.

102
00:06:57,926 --> 00:06:59,860
If you were the one who sacrificed your heart,

103
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,660
why would you ask for grace for someone else?

104
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,800
Isn't there anything you want?

105
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,899
I heard Yanxu Heavenly Palace has a divine art called "Flying Strings."

106
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:12,520
It uses the qin. A very unusual art.
<i>(T/N: "Qin" - an ancient stringed instrument)</i>

107
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,640
I'm very interested in it.

108
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,260
I wonder if Your Majesty is willing to teach me.

109
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,520
These are the essences of Flying Strings.

110
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,060
Have you memorized it?

111
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,280
Yes.

112
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:31,280
Back in the Land Under the Horizon, I taught you the Isolation spell.

113
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,040
In order to learn the art, you need to get rid of unnecessary thoughts and have a pure heart and mind.

114
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:41,100
Cultivation is about training the heart. Do you understand?

115
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,960
<i>Isolation Spell? Luckily, I learned it before.</i>

116
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,600
Of course, I remember what you taught me.

117
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,260
<i>She's lying to my face and shows no remorse.</i>

118
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,600
<i>Punishing Zhi Xi is easy.</i>

119
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,840
<i>But how should I punish her without hurting Yan Dan?</i>

120
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,240
<i>I'll have to think this through.</i>

121
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,200
<i>His Majesty taught Sister the Isolation Spell.</i>

122
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,360
<i>That's right.</i>

123
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,980
<i>I thought I was the one in his dreams.</i>

124
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,740
<i>But he never called out my name in those dreams.</i>

125
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:55,860
<i>After all, Ying Yuan is only in love with the one who stayed by his side in the Land Under the Horizon.</i>

126
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:02,400
<i>To him, the wife he grew old with wasn't me, but Zhi Xi.</i>

127
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,020
I'm still injured. My divine arts are unstable.

128
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,160
I'm sorry I startled you, Your Majesty.

129
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,560
I'm willing to receive punishment.

00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,420
<i> [Qianyun Palace]</i>

156
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,160
Fairy Yan Dan, what brings you here?

157
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,199
- You recognize me?
- Of course.

158
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:01,819
You and Emperor Ying Yuan worked together to catch the devil spy at Qianyun Palace.

159
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:04,860
The attendants of Qianyun Palace are indebted to you.

160
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,760
That was all His Majesty's effort.

161
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,599
I only assisted him from the side and got lucky.

162
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,179
Don't say that. Fairy Yan Dan, you are brave and smart.

163
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:17,599
I also heard that your sister, Zhi Xi, gouged out her heart to save His Majesty.

164
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:20,700
You and your sister are respectable heroines.

165
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,580
Are there any fruitless divine tools you'd like discard?

166
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,800
You can give them to me.

167
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,539
This agarwood incense burner is finely crafted. It's as good as new.

168
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:46,899
Fairy Yan Dan, are you sure you want to burn it?

169
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,260
Yes.

170
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,860
Please wait here, then.

171
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,840
Your Supreme Majesty. I have checked.

172
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,599
Emperor Ying Yuan indeed asked Fairy Zhi Xi to stay.

173
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,419
The rumor is true. His Majesty is fond of her.

174
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:34,659
Not only does he look out for her, but he also personally taught her the Qin and divine arts.

175
00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:39,879
His Majesty also gifted the Snow Lingzhi from you to Fairy Zhi Xi's younger sister.

176
00:17:39,879 --> 00:17:44,920
Looks like I have to make a trip to Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

177
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,380
Greetings, Your Majesty and Your Supreme Majesty.

178
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,220
Is she Fairy Zhi Xi, the one who saved you?

179
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,940
Yes, she is.

180
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,520
Fairy Zhi Xi risked her life in order to help Ying Yuan.

181
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,739
You're not only Ying Yuan's savior, but you're also the Heavenly Court's benefactor.

182
00:18:20,739 --> 00:18:22,039
Your Supreme Majesty is too kind.

183
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,519
I only did my duty.

184
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,520
You are Magical Pavilion's Deputy Curator.

185
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,439
Since when did your duty include treating ailments and saving others?

186
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,500
There have been a lot of rumors circling in the Heavenly Court.

187
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,640
Supposedly, you and Ying Yuan are in a secret relationship.

188
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,240
Is this true?

189
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,220
Emperor Ying Yuan has brought peace to the world.

190
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,159
His Majesty's well-being directly affects the Three Realm's well-being.

191
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:51,599
I saved him for the sake of the Heaven Realm.

192
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,540
There were no ulterior motives.

193
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,440
And I dare not have any desire for His Majesty.

194
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,620
Your sacrifice should be rewarded.

195
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:04,460
If we find out you secretly fell in love with the Emperor, that is against the Heavenly Rules. You will be punished accordingly.

196
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,580
This is the Uncoupling Cord.

197
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,160
You two will be bound with the red string.

198
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,240
If the string breaks, it means there is no love.

199
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,240
If it doesn't, there is love.

200
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,739
Whether you'll be rewarded or punished, it will know right away.

201
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,040
The Nine Heavens have existed for ages.

202
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:32,240
I dare not forget your teaching, and the example of Si Xuan.

203
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,840
Naturally, I have no problem being tested with the Uncoupling Cord.

204
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,660
My conscience is clear.

205
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,380
I'm willing to be tested to prove my innocence.

206
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,980
I'm sure the result will not disappoint you.

207
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,320
Good.

208
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,200
Emperor Ying Yuan has never let me down.

209
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,080
Fairy Zhi Xi is of noble character.

210
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,359
I shall bestow you with a grace.

211
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,959
What would you like? Go ahead and speak your mind.

212
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:55,159
I am devoted to the Heavenly Court.

213
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,700
I saved His Majesty for the sake of the Heavenly Realm.

214
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,500
I ask for no reward.

215
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,280
Fairy Zhi Xi, you made a great contribution to the Heavenly Court.

216
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,850
Yet you ask for no reward.

217
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:09,680
Very good. I see that you're truly righteous.

218
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,560
Don't you have a younger sister?

219
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:18,499
She asked for a blessing for your sake at the Jade Pool Festivity, right?

220
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,540
One has wisdom, and the other has strength. It brings out the best of each other.

221
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,800
How about this? I will exempt your sister from the mortal trials.

222
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,799
She is allowed to attend the Divine Ascension Ceremony as an audience.

223
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,280
I will make your sister's wishes come true.

224
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,920
What do you think?

225
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,060
Thank you for the blessing, Your Supreme Majesty.

226
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:52,260
<i>[Yanxu Heavenly Palace]</i>

227
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:58,120
Ying Yuan, throughout the Three Realms' vast history,

228
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,760
how many calamities were caused by love affairs?

229
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,520
Your mother was one of them.

230
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,059
Only when the immortals are without any thoughts of love can the Three Realms be safe.

231
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,279
I hope you remember how your mother died, and the suffering her people endured.

232
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:20,999
You must not make any mistakes and let the Three Realms fall into turmoil again.

233
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,840
Please rest assured, Your Supreme Majesty.

234
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:33,640
I will obey the Heavenly Rules, live up to my mother's spirit,

235
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:39,560
devote myself to protecting the world, and ensure peace for all.

236
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:59,380
<i>Yan Dan, I know you were the one at the cottage.</i>

237
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,320
<i>But the Heavenly Rules are above all.</i>

238
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,040
<i>I must not disobey it at any cost.</i>

239
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,540
<i>So what am I to do with you?</i>

240
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,720
To celebrate Your Majesty's return, His Supreme Majesty will host a festivity

241
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,760
at the Jade Pool in two days. He will personally cast a spell

242
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,879
to make the lotuses in the Jade Pool bloom overnight.

243
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,840
His Supreme Majesty ordered every palace to send attendants

244
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,600
to the Jade Pool to collect divine dew to be used during the festival.

245
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,359
Send Yan Dan to collect divine dew.

246
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,860
Yes, Your Majesty.

247
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:15,140
How come you're admiring the flowers alone, Your Majesty?

248
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,000
How about I keep you company?

249
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,120
There's no need.

250
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:32,220
All these years, I'm sure my feelings and dedication toward Your Majesty are obvious.

251
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,920
Why won't you even give me the chance to admire the flowers with you?

252
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,320
Do you think I don't know of your intentions?

253
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,180
There is no shortcut to cultivation.

254
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:48,520
Taking care of the heart comes before cultivation.

255
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,000
If your heart is not pure, forget being a Divine Spirit...

256
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,220
not even the Nine Heavens has a place for you.

257
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:01,960
As the curator of a pavilion, you should set a good example.

258
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,960
Do you not know your faults? You lack self-respect.

259
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,540
Everything I did was out of respect for you.

260
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:13,920
I hoped that, one day, I could also benefit the Three Realms, as you do.

261
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,500
Your Majesty.

262
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,200
How could you criticize and slander me like this?

263
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:27,640
No matter when you do, you know your intentions.

264
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:32,980
I hope you practice what you preach, Curator Ying Deng,

265
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,900
and have some self-respect.

266
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,800
You should obey the Heavenly Rules.

267
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,000
Remove any impure or selfish thoughts.

268
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,860
I will heed your advice, Your Majesty.

269
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,880
However... talking about others is easy.

270
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,160
But keeping yourself in check is hard.

271
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,480
Is Your Majesty truly able to do what you said?

272
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,480
"Have a pure heart and obey the Heavenly Rules"?

273
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,360
The dew is clearest when the lotus blooms.

274
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:19,400
Yan Dan, collect the dew here. Make sure to fill the bottle before sunset.

275
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,260
I'll go over there.

276
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,820
Yan Dan.

277
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,200
The lotus flower's fragrance has a calming effect.

278
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,240
It is beneficial for your injuries.

279
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,200
You can stay here for a while longer.

280
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,480
There's no need to leave so soon.

281
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,479
Did Your Majesty ask me to collect divine dew because of that?

282
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,720
Yan Dan.

283
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,300
- Actually–
- My sister's injury is more severe than mine.

284
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:11,280
She should've come here, not me.

285
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,300
You work at Yanxu Heavenly Palace. Zhi Xi does not.

286
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,080
Five hundred years ago, you two took on human forms.

287
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:28,960
Zhi Xi was distraught, while you stayed and calmed her down.

288
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,340
You showed no signs of fear.

289
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,000
It was as if you were the older sister.

290
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,940
That happened so long ago. There's no need to bring it up.

291
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,020
When I was in the Land Under the Horizon...

292
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,540
I also came across lotuses in full bloom.

293
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,900
But I couldn't see them due to my blindness.

294
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,840
I could only smell their fragrance.

295
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,440
But the lotuses back then...

296
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,480
were much more impressive than these lotuses.

297
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:20,880
The lotuses at the Heavenly Court grow magnificently, but they are filled with a sense of grimness.

298
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,640
I wonder how the lotuses are in the mortal world.

299
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,819
Are they more exuberant? More alive?

300
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:36,180
Zhi Xi has received a blessing from His Supreme Majesty.

301
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,840
She is exempted from mortal suffering.

302
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,900
So you need not do it in her place.

303
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,880
I'm sorry.

304
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,960
I broke my promise.

305
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,420
I couldn't watch "The Tale of The Genesis Hero."

306
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:06,340
Could you... put on the show one more time at Yanxu Heavenly Palace?

307
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,300
This time...

308
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,640
I will not miss it.

309
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,580
It's all right, Your Majesty.

310
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,880
It doesn't matter that you missed it.

311
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,940
There's no need to make up for it.

312
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,960
I need to collect the divine dew.

313
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,820
Please excuse me.

314
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,520
Lu Ming.

315
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,580
Have you ever had that feeling?

316
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,959
As if someone is living in your heart.

317
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,860
They're all you can think about.

318
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,160
I couldn't get rid of it.

319
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,940
I can't seem to forget him.

320
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,600
What an annoying feeling.

321
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,099
Never mind. I am sure you've never felt that before.

322
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:36,780
If you wish to drown your pain with wine, then today, I will drink with you as much as you want.

323
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,720
We'll drink till we drop.

324
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,960
I'm doing my best to avoid him and not see him.

325
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,580
But today, I saw him again, at the Jade Pool.

326
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:58,240
He kept talking about the time at the Land Under the Horizon.

327
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,860
I guess he's really pleased that the person who saved him was my sister.

328
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:16,680
I finally understand why love is forbidden in the Heaven Realm.

329
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:20,500
Love really is a painful thing.

330
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,280
It's worse than being struck by thunder.

331
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:31,240
Lu Ming, I feel heartbroken.

332
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,779
So painful. Do you understand that feeling?

333
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:47,980
If I got you the Forget Love Potion, will you drink it?

334
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,520
I won't.

335
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:01,500
Compared to this pain, it will be worse to forget him.

336
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,680
The time we spent in the Land Under the Horizon was too wonderful.

337
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,100
I really miss it a lot.

338
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:20,260
If you go on like this, you'll drive yourself insane.

339
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:26,420
To be honest, sometimes, a person should let it all go.

340
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,120
Follow your heart.

341
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,280
It's okay to dream again.

342
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,440
To dream again?

343
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:21,780
<i>Yan Dan, I can't let you sink deeper and deeper.</i>

344
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:26,499
<i>If you continue to lose yourself in this love, you'll lose your life.</i>

345
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,730
<i>Even if you disguise yourself as Zhi Xi, I still recognize you.</i>

346
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:52,920
<i>Yan Dan, I'm sorry.</i>

347
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:58,620
<i>For your safety, I cannot acknowledge our relationship.</i>

348
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,820
<i>[Yuqing Palace]</i>

349
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,480
Your Supreme Majesty. Your Majesty.

350
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,739
It has been confirmed that Curator Ying Deng was poisoned by the lotus around midnight last night.

351
00:35:29,739 --> 00:35:33,579
The physician said that although the Four-Leaf Lotus can heal all things,

352
00:35:33,579 --> 00:35:38,179
when its root is mixed with cinnabar, it becomes poisonous.

353
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:40,640
I've served the Heavenly Court for thousands of years.

354
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,140
I never took a day off.

355
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:47,040
But now, I was poisoned by someone wicked.

356
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,639
I implore Your Supreme Majesty to bring justice.

357
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,300
Rest assured, Curator Ying Deng.

358
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,759
There are only two people who are of Four-Leaf Lotus descent in the Nine Heavens.

359
00:35:55,759 --> 00:35:57,399
They are both in Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

360
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,039
I have already summoned them.

361
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,679
I believe Emperor Ying Yuan is fair and honorable.

362
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,560
He will get to the bottom of this and do you justice.

363
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:15,160
Your Supreme Majesty, the lotus sisters were born with good natures.

364
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,599
They wouldn't break the Heavenly Rules to purposely harm others.

365
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,460
My divine power is severely damaged.

366
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:33,640
If I hadn't noticed it in time, I probably wouldn't even be standing here.

367
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,640
His Majesty is kind-hearted.

368
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,439
Naturally, he wouldn't suspect the people around him.

369
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,960
But one never knows a person's true intentions.

370
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,640
Most likely, it was because I punished Zhi Xi for stealing the divine tool.

371
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,940
Hence, they started to resent me.

372
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:57,870
And because they are protected by His Majesty, they thought they could poison others without consequences.

373
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,180
- Greetings, Your Supreme Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Supreme Majesty.

374
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,660
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

375
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,060
I have something to ask.

376
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:22,559
Fairies, where were you around midnight last night?

377
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:24,440
What were you doing?

378
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,080
His Majesty has been having bad dreams.

379
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:40,110
Last night, I brought some As Desired Wine and stayed in His Majesty's room all night.

380
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,240
That means it was Fairy Yan Dan who poisoned me.

381
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:51,379
In this world, no one else possesses the root of the Four-Leaf Lotus.

382
00:37:51,379 --> 00:37:53,079
You wicked thing!

383
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:58,800
To get back at me for sending Zhi Xi to the Heavenly Gallows, you tried to kill me.

384
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,700
What poison?

385
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,360
I was poisoned with a refined toxin made of Four-Leaf Lotus root.

386
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,660
I almost died.

387
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:12,520
His Majesty has given orders to investigate this.

388
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,200
I did not poison anyone.

389
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,799
Then tell me. Where were you last night?

390
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,319
You are doing fine standing here, Curator.

391
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,679
Your life isn't at risk.

392
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,759
I doubt the supposed poison was that serious.

393
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,279
- So...
- Today, Yan Dan dared to poison a Heavenly Court official.

394
00:38:50,279 --> 00:38:53,300
Who knows if she will harm someone else?

395
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:57,720
A wicked person like her cannot be forgiven.

396
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:01,100
Zhi Xi, you are different from Yan Dan.

397
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,760
She has a complete lotus heart.

398
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,840
She won't die from heavenly punishment.

399
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,960
You mustn't let your personal feelings get in the way.

400
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,780
I do not have proof right now.

401
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,559
But I really did not poison her.

402
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,760
Is there a record of the divine attendants on duty last night?

403
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:35,200
According to the records, Fairy Yan Dan did leave the palace around midnight, but she returned in two hours.

404
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,539
The truth has come to light. It's obvious.

405
00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:52,619
Your Majesties, please render punishment, as a warning to evildoers.

406
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,479
Yan Dan is my sister.

407
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,720
I know her better than anyone else.

408
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,359
She can be a little reckless, but she has a good heart.

409
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,079
This is a misunderstanding.

410
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,839
Yan Dan couldn't have poisoned anyone or harmed them.

411
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,100
Please give us justice, Your Majesties.

412
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,260
Enough. You don't need to deny it any longer.

413
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,040
The evidence is irrefutable.

414
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,020
The culprit is none other than Yan Dan.

415
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:27,000
Ying Yuan, she works at Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

416
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,519
You can decide how she will be punished.

417
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,380
But this person has ulterior motives.

418
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,260
She must not be allowed to stay at Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

419
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,700
Your Majesty.

420
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,140
Do you not believe me either?

421
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:02,620
Is Your Majesty trying to cover up for your palace attendant?

422
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,920
She is a mere immortal attendant.

423
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,700
Why is she so important to His Majesty?

424
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:13,950
If other immortals hear about this, it could be seen as His Majesty bending the rules for his own sake.

425
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,580
Ying Yuan. As the Emperor, you should set an example.

426
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:29,380
I hope you remain impartial, fair, and honest.

427
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,760
Give the Curator and the Heaven Realm justice.

428
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,420
Do not disappoint me.

429
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,100
I swear.

430
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,080
I did no such thing.

431
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,120
Plotting against a divine official...

432
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,560
is punishable by the Heavenly Flame.

433
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,760
Incarcerate Yan Dan in the Heavenly Prison.

434
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:14,120
In three days, I will personally send her to the Heavenly Gallows for punishment.

435
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,120
From now on...

436
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,980
I hope you will behave yourself

437
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,520
and get rid of your distracting thoughts.

438
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,399
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

439
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,620
Yan Dan is being framed!

440
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,359
- Take her away.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
