<i>Yu Mo's letter was written in a hurry.</i>

<i>He asked us to go to Yelan Mountain immediately.</i>

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,300
<i>However, Ziqi... where are you now?</i>

19
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,400
Heavenly Emperor, we have no business with each other. Why do you want to kill me?

20
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,500
I don't need any reason to purge a war criminal and Devil King.

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Ziqi!

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,200
Tao Ziqi colluded with the Devils.

23
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,200
Her divine bones and spirit should be destroyed.

24
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,900
Once I shatter her spirit and soul, she'll never be reborn.

25
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,200
If that's what you wanted to do, you wouldn't have waited for me to show up.

26
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,300
You're not as stupid as I thought.

27
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,400
What do you want exactly?

28
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,200
Let her go and I'll give you what you want.

29
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,000
Do you want her?

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,400
You can give me the Eye of Infinite Devils in exchange.

31
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,600
Ziqi!

32
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,800
I'll give it to you as long as you don't hurt her.

33
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,900
Now that you've gotten it, let her go!

34
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,400
I promised to let her go, but not you.

35
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,400
These are objects from the Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

36
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,000
He helped me to preserve them.

37
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,400
Stardust bottles.

38
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,200
It’s my sister.

39
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,300
<i>Yan Dan. In order to look for you in the Mortal Realm, Yu Mo severed his dragon horns.</i>

40
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,000
<i>He was so nice to you even though he had just met you.</i>

41
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,200
<i>I am your kin sister, and yet I couldn't do anything.</i>

42
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,000
<i>I could only fill up the stardust bottles.</i>

43
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,500
<i>I wish you all the best in the Mortal Realm.</i>

44
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,900
Yu Mo severed his dragon horns to look for me.

45
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,200
Yu Mo, how can I repay your kindness?

46
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:20,900
<i>Yan Dan, if you can forgive me, on your wedding day, I'll put this wedding dress on you.</i>

47
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,600
<i>I hope your wish will come true.

<i>Break all Heavenly Rules and stay with Emperor Ying Yuan forever.</i>

49
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,900
Zhi Xi had been worrying about me all these years...

50
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,400
but now Ying Yuan and I can't let go of the past and can't go back.

51
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,300
Who are you?

52
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,800
Yan Dan!

53
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,500
I tried to disguise myself as you but you saw through it.

54
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,700
You are a demon. Why did you venture into the Heaven Realm?

55
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,900
Did something happen?

56
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,000
It’s because I miss you.

57
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,200
Can’t I come back to see you?

58
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,400
Sister, to save me, you gave me half of your heart.

59
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,800
And allowed me to be reborn.

60
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,300
Thank you.

61
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,100
Why were you so silly?

62
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,000
You suffered excruciating pain to cut out your heart.

63
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,700
How’s your recovery?

64
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,300
I'm fine now.

65
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,200
What about you? How is your body?

66
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,000
Have you recovered?

67
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,000
What do you think?

68
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,200
Sister, I saw the stardust bottles you collected for me.

69
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,000
You have ascended to divinity, while I live happily and freely in the Mortal Realm.

70
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,400
I suddenly remembered the wishes we made with the stardust bottle.

71
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,200
They have come true.

72
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,900
Did you see the wedding dress I prepared for you?

73
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,800
That's always been my wish.

74
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,700
You left Heaven Realm for so many years.

75
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,200
It’s His Majesty who preserved your items.

76
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,000
He cherished and protected all your things.

77
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,500
You're in his heart.

78
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,000
Let's not talk about that, Sister.

79
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,600
What he has to protect is far more than these trivial things.

80
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,200
All beings in the Three Realms are waiting for him.

81
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:32,600
Now I know that It isn't all love relationships that bear fruit.

82
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,400
I no longer expect anything from him.

83
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,600
I just want him to be safe and healthy.

84
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,600
He is clearly in your heart.

85
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,300
Why must you force yourself to let go?

86
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,600
One day, there will be peace in the Three Realms.

87
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,800
By then, maybe he will be relieved of his responsibility and live with you forever.

88
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,200
I have grown up.

89
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,600
There's no need to comfort me like when I was a child.

90
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,800
Stop worrying.

91
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,500
Over the years, I've learned to seize the day without worrying about the future.

92
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,000
I don't want to force it anymore.

93
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:19,400
If you don't want to talk about him anymore, I won't ask again.

94
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,700
Did you sneak back to the Heaven Realm because something happened?

95
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,200
Can't you tell me the truth?

96
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,300
<i>Our investigation involves Heavenly Emperor.</i>

97
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,500
<i>If he becomes aware of that, he will get rid of us.</i>

98
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,000
<i>It's better not to get Zhi Xi involved.</i>

99
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,900
Yan Dan, I know you're hiding something from me.

100
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:51,600
However, don't forget that half of my heart is in you.

101
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,200
Your life does not belong to you alone.

102
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,200
No matter what, you must let me know if my half heart is safe.

103
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,300
Sister, I...

104
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,600
You told me that someone from the Heaven Realm attacked the emperor.

105
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,200
You must have found out that Lu Ming is missing.

106
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,600
Did you venture into the Nine Heavens to investigate this?

107
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:21,490
Yan Dan, we agreed to trust and never leave or forsake each other.

108
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,860
Are you breaking your promise?

109
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,660
All right.

110
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,360
I can't hide anything from you.

111
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:39,040
Recently, the physician complained to me that he can't find you and can't treat you.

112
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,820
Why are you free today to invite me for a chat?

113
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:47,880
Your Supreme Majesty taught me that deities should practice self-control.

114
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,360
You never drink wine and forbade deities from drinking to excess.

115
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,000
Why did you bring wine along?

116
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,280
After the war, I realized that life is short.

117
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,600
The sacred rules in the Heaven Realm are tedious.

118
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,280
Don't be shackled by them.

119
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,440
Your Supreme Majesty has changed a lot.

120
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,980
I don't know you anymore.

121
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,920
We are not made from stone.

122
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,620
How can we remain the same?

123
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:25,080
Your Majesty, weren't you unemotional in the past?

124
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:30,520
After undergoing mortal trials and returning here, aren't you troubled by love as well?

125
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,820
Haven't you also changed?

126
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,640
Returning here...

127
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,700
after so many years, many things feel unfamiliar to me.

128
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,180
I went to the Xuanxin Cliff and stayed for a few days.

129
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,660
Marshal Huo De mentioned something that I didn't understand.

130
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:03,160
It is said that before the war, you said that Tai You couldn't be trusted.

131
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:08,000
Why was he exceptionally promoted to Head of the Heavenly Soldiers?

132
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,020
I had no choice.

133
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:18,520
You know that he is the disciple of Emperor Wan Yun, who died in the war.

134
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,500
My heart hurt, and I missed him often.

135
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,300
Therefore, when the Three Realms were trouble-free,

136
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,700
I made an exception and promoted him

137
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:36,280
to comfort the spirit of Emperor Wan Yun.

138
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,520
All right.

139
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,820
I am in charge of celestial affairs.

140
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,380
You've just resumed your position. Your body has not recovered.

141
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,180
Don't worry too much.

142
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,240
I was just worried...

143
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,880
that Your Supreme Majesty might be too occupied.

144
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,680
I wish to share some duties with you.

145
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,120
On the day I returned to Nine Heavens,

146
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,140
your Supreme Majesty said that you would investigate the inside story of the Divine-Devil War

147
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,930
and the attacker in the Mortal Realm.

148
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,710
A few days have since passed.

149
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,520
Your Supreme Majesty, have you found anything?

150
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,780
I have a few suspects.

151
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,490
I am investigating them one by one.

152
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:30,280
Your Supreme Majesty, the attacker often used the Phantom Griffin to send messages.

153
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:35,340
I have already checked, and many divine officials in the Heaven Realm can attest to it,

154
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:40,270
that in the Yuqing Palace, many people have heard the cries from the Phantom Griffin.

155
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:43,280
Presumably the attacker was in the palace.

156
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,440
Correct.

157
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,340
I think so, too.

158
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:51,200
This person likes to collect and keep various spiritual beasts.

159
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,340
Also, when you descended to the Mortal Realm, he secretly descended, too. This was very suspicious.

160
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:00,420
This person was my personal attendant, Lu Ming.

161
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,720
Emperor Ying Yuan.

162
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,900
I heard that you and Lu Ming have a very good relationship.

163
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:12,020
Did he take the opportunity to stab you in the back?

164
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,140
I don't know why, but Lu Ming is not in the palace now.

165
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,640
He left without a trace.

166
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:24,860
Otherwise, I would tie him up myself and let you interrogate him.

167
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:30,520
<i>The seven-day Shared-Fate Spell I cast upon the mysterious man will expire in one day.</i>

168
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:36,220
<i> If I could find the marks on his hand, I'd have the solid proof.</i>

169
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,680
We haven't met for a long time.

170
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,960
I miss you, Your Supreme Majesty.

171
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:05,980
Back then, you often threw cups and bowls to test my divine arts.

172
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:12,240
If I defeated you in ten moves before the cups and bowls hit the floor, I would be rewarded.

173
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,060
Today, can we have a contest?

174
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,820
You're in a good mood today, aren't you?

175
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:32,470
However, your divine body has been injured, and your divine power has not recovered.

176
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,640
We'll do it another day.

177
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:40,260
So are you scared, Your Supreme Majesty?

178
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:47,680
You said that a coward would be defeated.

179
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,320
I have nothing to fear.

180
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,340
I'm just afraid of hurting you.

181
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:08,000
Do you remember that when you were young, I fought with you with one hand?

182
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,740
Let's relive your childhood dream today.

183
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,760
I'll fight with you with one hand.

184
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,640
You first.

185
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,480
Emperor Ying Yuan, I said I was afraid I would hurt you.

186
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,800
Thank you for your mercy, Your Supreme Majesty.

187
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,920
I'm fine.

188
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,600
Your divine body has just recovered.

189
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,700
Today, I won't go all out.

190
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,460
It's getting late. I should return to the palace.

191
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,260
<i>If I missed the chance.</i>

192
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,900
<i>The seven-day Shared-Fate Spell will be expired.</i>

193
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,900
<i>His Supreme Majesty doesn't like playing GO with me.</i>

194
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,300
<i>He's also not good at it.</i>

195
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:52,040
<i>How could he casually re-do the whole game?</i>

196
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,080
<i>Could it be...</i>

197
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:02,220
I didn't expect Lu Ming used his flesh and bones to leave you a clue.

198
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:07,240
He frequently visited the Magical Pavilion and always stopped in front of this storage box.

199
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,840
I think it holds a secret for sure.

200
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,910
How come it's belts again?

201
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:27,000
At the Pavillion of Books, the wooden box left by Lu Ming was full of books about belts.

202
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,980
However, he never cared about divine tools and accessories.

203
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:33,120
He must have a reason for doing this.

204
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,220
Where did these belts come from?

205
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,280
All the deities regularly change their divine tools and items.

206
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,480
Their old items are temporarily stored in the Magical Pavilion.

207
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,080
This box is dedicated to storing the belts of deities.

208
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,200
Do you keep a record of the divine tools they replaced?

209
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,800
May I see it?

210
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,660
Yes.

211
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,700
<i>[Divine Tool Replacement Record]</i>

212
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,840
Look.

213
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,980
How come these two pages are blank?

214
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,880
Two deities never changed their belts. So, there is no record of them.

215
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,520
His Supreme Majesty and Emperor Ying Yuan.

216
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,240
Why?

217
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,840
After the Divine-Devil War, His Supreme Majesty never replaced or repaired his belts.

218
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:25,120
Presumably, because his old friends died, and he cherishes old items.

219
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:32,120
His Majesty refuses to replace the Cosmic Jade Belt because it has the Four-Leaf Lotus embroidered by you.

220
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,340
For 1,000 years, he hasn't changed his belt once?

221
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,920
Since you appeared, he has never replaced it.

222
00:19:55,540 --> 00:20:01,500
<i> The marital art Ying Yuan used during the day was the Eternal Darkness created by Xuan Ye.</i>

223
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,700
<i>This skill was only practiced by the bloodline of the Lord of Asura Clan.</i>

224
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,180
<i>Xuan Ye is dead.</i>

225
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,040
<i>The bloodline is broken.</i>

226
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,400
<i>Why has this martial art resurfaced?</i>

227
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,580
<i>Could it be...</i>

228
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:23,140
<i>Xuan Ye's Soul Ripping Sword is gone?</i>

229
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:29,000
<i>Only the bloodline of the Lord of Asura Clan can subdue the wraith of that sword.</i>

230
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,340
<i>Ying Yuan was the only one living in Land Under the Horizon.</i>

231
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,120
<i>The wraith must have surrendered to him.</i>

232
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,300
<i>So, Ying Yuan, you are the son of Xuan Ye.</i>

233
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,100
Now I get it.

234
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:52,500
Ying Yuan, if I get your bloodline, I don't have anything to worry about anymore.

235
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,520
<i>His Majesty refuses to replace the Cosmic Jade Belt</i>

236
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,420
<i>because it has the Four-Leaf Lotus embroidered by you.</i>

237
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,460
Who's there?

238
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,660
Yan Dan?

239
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,500
I was changing. Why are you here?

240
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,020
The Four-Leaf Lotus should be able to remove all poisons and heal all wounds.

241
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,560
Why are there scars on your body?

242
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,560
I was punished for falling in love back then.

243
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,980
The icicles pierced my body.

244
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,260
Nothing in the world can remove these scars.

245
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,400
Your Majesty, what happened?

246
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:15,460
Y-Your Majesty, you are violating Heavenly Rules.

247
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,000
I don't care about the rules anymore.

248
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,180
I just want to protect the person I care about.

249
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,820
Why are you standing there? Get out.

250
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,060
Your Majesty...

251
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:40,420
I... I came to tell you that I found a new clue.

252
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,240
Don't misunderstand.

253
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,680
After the Divine-Devil War, His Supreme Majesty went against Heaven Realm's norm,

254
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:51,960
saying that he cherishes old things and has never replaced his belt since.

255
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,340
But he doesn't care about other divine tools as much as the belt.

256
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,360
My guess is that there is a secret in the belt.

257
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,240
In the past, His Supreme Majesty emphasized marital arts than civil arts.

258
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,040
He was extremely frugal, too.

259
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,260
Now, the Heaven Realm indulges in luxury.

260
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,120
His diet and temperament are very different from before.

261
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,700
It is indeed suspicious.

262
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,940
Did you find any other clues?

263
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,980
The Phantom Griffin was once the evidence.

264
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,680
I found this broken ring in Lu Ming's bedroom.

265
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,500
Unfortunately, the Phantom Griffin is dead now.

266
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,880
There is no proof.

267
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:35,980
His Supreme Majesty must have planned to frame Lu Ming.

268
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,560
So we can't find any other criminal evidence, then?

269
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,560
I tested him during the daytime.

270
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,620
I found his physical strength was extremely powerful.

271
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:48,180
However, according to his spiritual practice record, there was no trace of him attaining that level.

272
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,940
This might be because he was practicing Universe Enchantment.

273
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,980
If we can prove that he studied astronomical phenomena

274
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:04,280
and used the Alignment of Nine Planets in the process of cultivation, then we can expose his crimes.

275
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,680
The Alignment of Nine Planets determined the role

276
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:13,080
His Supreme Majesty played in the Divine-Devil War.

277
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:17,600
If the astronomical phenomena predicted accurately, he might have

278
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,600
calculated the perfect timing and provoked the war.

279
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:29,060
I went to Huan Qin's former residence and found the constellation map.

280
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:34,140
However, I can't find any pattern in the motion of the Nine Planets.

281
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,940
<i>[Constellation Map]</i>

282
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,300
<i>[Record of the Nine Planets]</i>

283
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,440
The Nine Planets have irregular motions.

284
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,480
How is it possible?

285
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,100
I have seen this map before.

286
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,740
<i>[Chart of the Nine Planets' Positions]</i>

287
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:20,880
Do you mean positions of the Nine Planets on this chart?

288
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,840
The previous charts are the same.

289
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,620
I find the planets' positions rather familiar.

290
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,940
Give it to me.

291
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,520
We use white pieces for this.

292
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:56,060
The Nine Planets are in charge of Heaven, Earth, Yin, and Yang.

293
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,460
Yin is black. Yang is white.

294
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,840
Black and white crisscross. Yin and Yang stack up.

295
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,420
They become this GO game.

296
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:07,900
I saw this GO game in Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

297
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,840
This was an endgame that Huan Qin came up with.

298
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,440
For a long time, he couldn't find any solution.

299
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,240
He said he would send it to the palace to embarrass me.

300
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,640
Then, I gave it to you.

301
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,060
You solved it in three days. He was overjoyed.

302
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:31,300
He intercepted and rode Immortal Lord Bei Ming's divine crane to watch the GO game.

303
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,680
Sure enough.

304
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:44,240
The nine GO pieces were aligned like the Nine Planets.

305
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:53,590
If Huan Qin had predicted the orbits of the Nine Planets, why did he hide them from others?

306
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,420
Did he work for His Supreme Majesty?

307
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,220
If you want to find out the truth,

308
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:03,480
we must go to the Star Setter Pavilion where Huan Qin used to guard and look for clues.

309
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,900
For tonight, the stars are already set.

310
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,700
We missed the opportunity.

311
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,260
Let's investigate tomorrow night.

312
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,820
Okay.

313
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,980
It's getting late.

314
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,600
I'll head back to the Xuanxin Cliff.

315
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,820
Yan Dan...

316
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,280
I want to say one more thing.

317
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:46,900
What I said to Qing Yun... was from the bottom of my heart.

318
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,340
I will not be bound by the Heavenly Rules anymore.

319
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,060
Do you understand?

320
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,860
I got it.

321
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,360
Your Majesty.

322
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,420
Why are there people outside?

323
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,220
Please continue. Lu Jing and I will stand guard.

324
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,620
No one will know.

325
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,380
How long will they be there?

326
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,240
According to the new palace rules, maybe the entire evening.

327
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,560
"The entire evening"?

328
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,500
So I won’t be able to leave tonight?

329
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,080
Maybe.

330
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,980
What should I do now?

331
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,660
Are you sure you're fine sleeping down there?

332
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,660
It's getting late. Just go to sleep.

333
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,080
The floor is cold.

334
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,740
If the cold air enters your body, your old wounds will relapse.

335
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,700
That'll be awful.

336
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,680
How about this? I sleep on the floor, and you sleep on the bed.

337
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,940
What are you doing?

338
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,500
What are you doing?

339
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,460
How about this? We'll demarcate with a line.

340
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,340
You sleep there. I sleep here.

341
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:12,380
Don't cross the line. We'll sleep peacefully.

342
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,260
Why do I feel that you planned this ahead of time?

343
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,920
I didn’t.

344
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,860
Bastard!

345
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,300
What are you doing? Stop staring at me!

346
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,600
Had you not turned around, how would you find out?

347
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,400
I felt it with my back.

348
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,400
Anyway, don't stare. Close your eyes.

349
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,060
You can’t look at me!

350
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,800
You crossed the line.

351
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,400
It’s because…

352
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,490
Because you keep staring at me.

353
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:11,900
That's why I crossed the line.

354
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:17,320
All right... Put it here.

355
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,960
What are you doing?

356
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,200
Don't move.

357
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,360
You are such a shameless deity.

358
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,200
Sleep.

359
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:42,460
<i>I haven't seen him looking so peaceful in a long time.</i>

360
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:48,060
<i>I assume that after your return, you haven't had an enjoyable time.</i>

361
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:52,580
<i>If you didn't have to be Ying Yuan and could remain as Tang Zhou forever, </i>

362
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,600
<i>and I wasn't the immortal attendant Yan Dan,</i>

363
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:00,600
<i>but a lotus demon who enjoys her time in the world writing stories, how nice it would be.</i>

364
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:09,900
♫ <i> I blame time for the mortal world's woe is on your shoulder </i> ♫

365
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:15,400
♫ <i> Like the surging tides of stars, I continuously ask where the origin of love comes from </i> ♫

366
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:19,000
How can I sleep if you keep staring at me?

367
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,840
Scoundrel!

368
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:31,640
♫ <i> In my momentary childishness, I now understand that all living things wither away </i> ♫

369
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:37,660
<i>Yan Dan. I promised you that I would perform my duties as an emperor.</i>

370
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,360
<i>A crisis is looming.</i>

371
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,160
<i>There will be a battle in the Heaven Realm.</i>

372
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:47,000
<i>As the emperor, I will be at the front line of the crisis.</i>

373
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
<i>When it's time for death to do us part,</i>

374
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,020
<i>tonight's tender moment will leave me with no regret.</i>

375
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,720
Greetings, Your Supreme Majesty.

376
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:34,270
Our informant in Yanxu Heavenly Palace has come to inform us that Yan Dan is in the Heaven Realm.

377
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:36,300
She spent the night with Ying Yuan last night.

378
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,020
They seem very close.

379
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,800
Keep an eye on this girl.

380
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,900
She is Ying Yuan's only weak point.

381
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,840
I'm afraid they've found a clue.

382
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:52,800
- We...
- Since the day he came back, I knew this day would come.

383
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,520
Don't worry.

384
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,280
The overall situation is still in my control.

385
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:02,900
I will turn my inexorable doom into Ying Yuan's inexorable doom.

386
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:19,900
In the entire Star Setter Pavilion, this Star-Observing Stone Screen is the weirdest.

387
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:25,200
Star Deity Ji Du measured the trajectory of the Nine Planets by observing this stone.

388
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,420
Could there be a clue hidden inside?

389
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,020
I have sent away the star-setting official for you.

390
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,540
Don't slack off from here on.

391
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,680
Star-Setting Stone Screen will eventually open.

392
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:44,380
If you don't have enough spiritual power, I can teach you like before.

393
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,660
There seems to be something attached to it.

394
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,920
What is this?

395
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,380
It is Three-Winged Raven Clan's treasure.

396
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:41,160
The best tool for practicing Universe Enchantment.

397
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,880
Golden Cicada’s Wings.

398
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:50,240
That day I battled with His Supreme Majesty, his divine power was mysterious and unfathomable.

399
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,800
If he really has practiced Universe Enchantment, then it would all make sense.

400
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,640
Now that I think about it,

401
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,060
His Supreme Majesty personally decreed to exterminate the Three-Winged Raven Clan back then.

402
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:11,140
But if it's a stolen item, why didn't he hide it, but put it here on display?

403
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,500
The sun and moon are hidden in the sky, and all phenomena are transformed into nothing.

404
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,800
Golden Cicada's Wings is the perfect divine tool for practicing Universe Enchantment.

405
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,040
It brings the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, as well as the essence of the sun and moon to its own use.

406
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,340
The Heavenly Corner is filled with spiritual energy.

407
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:32,700
This place will provide it with a constant supply of spiritual energy.

408
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,820
But Huan Qin observed the stars here every night.

409
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,740
It shouldn't be hard for him to notice it.

410
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:45,800
These cicada wings might be the cause of his death.

411
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:08,280
<i>[Wenshui Pavilion]</i>

412
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:18,240
Our relationship can no longer hold me back.

413
