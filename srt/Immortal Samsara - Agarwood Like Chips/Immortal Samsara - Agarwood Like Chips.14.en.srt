16
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,100
We agreed to frame Yan Dan for a small mistake and chase her out of Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

17
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,199
Why did you break your promise?

18
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:51,379
Are you out of your mind? This is Yuqing Palace!

19
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,099
You were the one who gave her the lotus root that harmed her.

20
00:01:57,099 --> 00:01:58,780
Why are you pretending to be innocent?

21
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,280
Now you're telling me to act in good faith?

22
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,899
I was just worried that Yan Dan would make a big mistake in the future.

23
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:06,780
I wanted to lightly punish her so she would realize that.

24
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,440
I didn't intend to kill her.

25
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,239
She just received the thunder strikes after losing half her heart.

26
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:13,919
If she is found guilty and sent to the Heavenly Gallows again,

27
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,679
even if she survives, she'll revert to her original form!

28
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,960
My intention was for her to disappear from this world.

29
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,340
Zhi Xi, no matter if the punishment is serious or not, you've already gotten your hands dirty.

30
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,140
Your sisterhood ties with her have been severed long ago.

31
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,620
This case has alerted His Supreme Majesty.

32
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,140
You had better keep quiet if you don't wish

33
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,500
to ruin both your career and life.

34
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,980
<i>Why? Why did everything end up like this?</i>

35
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,600
<i>What exactly went wrong?</i>

36
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,219
His Majesty has ordered us to move all these things away in two hours.

37
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:30,040
No delays are allowed.

38

<i>[Yanxu Heavenly Palace]</i>

39
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,380
What are you doing?

40
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,519
How dare you taint His Majesty's item with your terrible embroidery?

41
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,160
It's no wonder His Majesty couldn't wait any longer.

42
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:04,199
He has ordered his men to move all your wretched belongings out of the palace.

43
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,560
<i>Emperor Ying Yuan, do you hate me that much?</i>

44
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,460
You should enjoy the view while you can.

45
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:20,120
Now that you've stepped out the palace door, you won't be able to return again.

46
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,339
Looking at you now, I'm reminded of my past self.

47
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:30,340
However, I left the palace gloriously for a promotion,

48
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,200
while you're leaving in shame.

49
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,700
No matter if it's me, who was assigned to His Majesty by His Supreme Majesty,

50
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,840
or Zhi Xi, who sacrificed half her heart to save his life...

51
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,240
No fairy can stay in Yanxu Heavenly Palace forever.

52
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,199
His Majesty's heart only has space for the beings of the Three Realms.

53
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,500
His heart has no space for a single woman.

54
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,040
Is that so?

55
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,800
If that's true, why did you rack your brain just to transfer me from the palace?

56
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,780
I wasn't the one who chased you out and sent you to prison.

57
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,680
It was him!

58
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,879
So what if he played GO with you and taught you divine arts?

59
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:12,959
To him, you're nothing but an inferior attendant who's there to entertain him.

60
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,820
However, you're different from the others indeed.

61
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:26,060
Unlike all the fairies who left the palace, you're leaving in shame.

62
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,300
Do you know what His Majesty said about you?

63
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,880
He said you were a disgrace to Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

64
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,759
He has ordered his men to burn your belongings in the Soul Incinerator.

65
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,260
You should have seen this coming, from the day you harbored thoughts...

66
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,360
you shouldn't have had.

67
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,620
Take her away!

68
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,360
<i>Yes.</i>

69
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,720
<i>[Yanxu Heavenly Palace]</i>

70
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,680
You must have suffered.

71
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,240
Why?

72
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,560
Why did you do this to me?

73
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,300
I'm sorry.

74
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:02,680
I just wanted to frame you for a small mistake, so that you could leave Yanxu Heavenly Palace and His Majesty's side.

75
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,900
I don't want you to be trapped by love.

76
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,700
I didn't expect Ying Deng to use me as her pawn and land you in this state.

77
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:19,120
I know nothing I say matters now.

78
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,500
However, I truly did it for your sake initially—

79
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
For my sake?

80
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,499
If so, why didn't you speak up for me when Ying Deng framed me for the poison?

81
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,620
Do you know how you looked back then?

82
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,220
I felt like you were no longer the sister I knew.

83
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,740
I was a coward.

84
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:48,280
I didn't dare to admit my mistake in front of His Supreme Majesty and His Majesty.

85
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,520
Ever since I was little...

86
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:57,660
I always thought you were the dearest person to me.

87
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,320
I thought you would always protect and support me.

88
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,800
Even if everyone else betrayed me, I've always thought you wouldn't.

89
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,620
I even swore a secret vow that I would share joy and sorrow with you.

90
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,760
But now...

91
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,360
After all that has happened...

92
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:26,679
Now that I'm looking at the current you, I still don't understand what happened.

93
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:32,400
Can you please tell me why you did that?

94
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:40,130
Since we were little, you always thought I was strong and didn't fear anything, right?

95
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,570
It was because you didn't understand me at all.

96
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:47,659
You don't know how much I've suffered all these years!

97
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,420
You suffered?

98
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:56,119
Ever since we acquired our human forms, and after His Majesty said...

99
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,860
that I was the weaker twin,

100
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,680
I started training harder than anyone I knew

101
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,680
so that people would not take me lightly!

102
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:18,440
You understood the essence of the Xiaohan Scriptures just by copying it.

103
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,240
Something that's easy for you to attain was actually my lifelong wish.

104
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,660
I've never wanted you to be sent to the Mortal Realm for me.

105
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,940
However, you requested it in public.

106
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,640
People mocked my ineptitude.

107
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:39,000
I finally became Deputy Curator, yet you went and stole my job.

108
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,960
You eliminated devils and protected His Majesty.

109
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,140
Everyone took me lightly.

110
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:50,360
Even your fellow attendants mocked me behind my back!

111
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,540
I didn't expect you...

112
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:05,640
to be troubled over people saying that you were the weaker twin.

113
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,460
I actually didn't notice at all.

114
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,980
I know you didn't want to go to the mortal world.

115
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,640
You wanted to be promoted.

116
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,219
That's why I wanted to use my own ways to help you out as much as I could.

117
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,220
However, I've never thought about how you felt.

118
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:33,500
I've never asked you about it, causing you to hold a huge grudge against me.

119
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,240
I thought...

120
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,040
we could walk together, hand in hand, forever.

121
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:47,060
I thought... we would always be best sisters.

122
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,460
But I didn't expect that...

123
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,640
I didn't expect us to end up like this.

124
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,320
I'm sorry.

125
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,020
I'm a terrible sister.

126
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,680
I'm sorry.

127
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,080
Yan Dan.

128
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,580
I'm sorry.

129
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,440
I know. This is my fault.

130
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,540
I'm sure you've held this grudge for a century.

131
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,380
You may never let go of it...

132
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,380
as long as I'm around.

133
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:51,060
Maybe now, the best outcome for us...

134
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,460
is to never see each other again.

135
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,600
Zhi Xi.

136
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,800
Live well for yourself.

137
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,000
Leave now.

138
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,200
Yan Dan!

139
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,700
Leave!

140
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,300
Just go!

141
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:07,000
Your Majesty, although Yan Dan is mischievous, she has a kind nature.

142
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I don't believe that she's the culprit.

143
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,800
Should we really do nothing about it as she receives the punishment of fire?

144
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,900
Yan Dan isn't willing to speak the truth to protect the person she wants to protect.

145
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,800
However, I will not let her suffer for a crime she didn't commit.

146
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,200
I will find other evidence and prove her innocence.

147
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,600
Your Majesty, this is an immortal attendant from Qianyun Palace.

148
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,800
He's here to look for Yan Dan.

149
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,200
Why are you looking for her?

150
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:54,100
Your Majesty, Fairy Yan Dan told me to burn this agarwood incense burner with fire a few days ago.

151
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,800
However, the incense burner is blessed with divine arts. I couldn't burn it, no matter what I did.

152
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,600
I had no choice but to return it to her,

153
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,800
but I couldn't find her.

154
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,000
I will return it to her.

155
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You all may leave, for now.

156
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,800
<i>Yan Dan, since you were willing to burn this agarwood incense burner, </i>

157
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,100
<i>I'm sure you are thoroughly disappointed with me.</i>

158
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:41,000
<i>However, the only way for you to sever your emotions is to leave Yanxu Heavenly Palace.</i>

159
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,200
<i>By doing so, you will no longer be hurt or sad in the future.</i>

<i>[Wenshui Pavilion]</i>

<i> Yu Mo! This is bad. Something huge happened!</i>

162
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,400
Didn't you tell me this yourself?

163
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,000
"We shouldn't panic, no matter what." Why are you panicking?

164
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,600
<i> For some reason, Yan Dan was arrested for poisoning the Curator!</i>

165
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,500
<i> Emperor Ying Yuan had sent her to Heavenly Prison!</i>

166
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,400
<i> We have to save her!</i>

167
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,800
Don't worry.

168
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,900
I will surely try everything to save her.

169
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,900
Brother Yu Mo. Brother Yu Mo!

170
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,000
Brother Yu Mo!

171
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,700
Brother Yu Mo, why are you trying to break the barrier, all of a sudden?

172
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,600
Did you know that Yan Dan was sent to the Heavenly Prison?

173
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,700
However, this barrier is connected to my immortal spirit.

174
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,600
Anyone can enter and exit at will, except for me.

175
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,000
This won't do.

176
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,600
I have to rescue Yan Dan as soon as possible.

177
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,000
Brother Yu Mo! Since Yan Dan is your friend, naturally, she's my friend as well.

178
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,600
I'll find the Marshal right now so that he can dispel the barrier.

179
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,800
Don't do that!

180
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,400
Marshal Huo De will never agree to it.

181
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,000
It's impossible for me to leave Yan Dan in the lurch.

182
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,900
I must save her, even if it means I have to sacrifice myself.

183
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,700
Lu Ming?

184
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,000
Don't worry about me.

185
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,200
I'm doing great over here.

186
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,800
<i> Do you even know the situation you're in?</i>

187
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,300
<i> Yan Dan, you have to tell His Majesty the entire truth now.</i>

188
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,500
<i> If not, you'll die!</i>

189
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,000
<i> I'd never believe that you were the culprit behind the poisoning incident.</i>

190
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,100
<i> Apart from you, Zhi Xi is the only Four-Leaf Lotus in the entire Heavenly Palace!</i>

191
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,200
<i> Are you keeping quiet because you want to protect her?</i>

192
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,800
<i> Even though Zhi Xi is your sister, she framed you for her crime.</i>

193
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,200
<i> I'll go explain everything to His Majesty now if you insist on keeping quiet!</i>

194
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,900
No!

195
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,800
You mustn't do that if you see me as your friend.

196
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,400
But why?

197
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,200
I've already discussed it with Zhi Xi.

198
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,500
She has her painful reasons.

199
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,700
I was the cause of her suffering.

200
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,900
She has been living in my shadow for the past century.

201
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,700
However, she still protected me during that time.

202
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,200
<i> Even so, she shouldn't just frame you like this!</i>

203
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,800
Her kindness and crimes have canceled each other out.

204
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,800
Anyway, you shouldn't make it hard on her.

205
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:29,200
I'm willing to leave this place if Zhi Xi can be relieved of her suffering.

206
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,600
Anyway, she's still my sister, no matter what other people say about her.

207
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,400
<i> "Leave this place?"</i>

208
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,500
<i> Could it be that you're seeking death?</i>

209
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,300
How is that possible?

210
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:50,700
Emperor Ying Yuan promised he would keep me alive and send me to Mortal Realm.

211
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,100
<i> - Really? </i>
- Really!

212
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,400
I didn't expect that either.

213
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,700
I guess this is a blessing in disguise.

214
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,800
In the past, I used to fantasize about how beautiful the Mortal Realm will be.

215
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,300
I wanted to visit it someday.

216
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,000
This time, I guess I can finally check it out myself!

217
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,300
<i> Since you've already decided to go to the Mortal Realm...</i>

218
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,200
<i>you may never be able to return again.</i>

219
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,300
<i> Why don't you take Yu Mo with you?</i>

220
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,600
<i> Emperor Ying Yuan is too far out of your reach.</i>

221
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,800
<i> So you should consider being with Yu Mo instead.</i>

222
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,600
You like him as a friend, right?

223
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,800
Can you not match us up randomly?

224
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,600
Yu Mo is the black fish I raised.

225
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,100
It's perfectly reasonable even if he regards me as his mother.

226
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,000
<i> I will bear the consequences myself.</i>

227
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,700
<i> There's no need to implicate other people.</i>

228
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,500
Anyway, I've already made up my mind.

229
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,600
You should stop persuading me.

230
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,900
If you can withstand my willfulness and still treat me as a friend,

231
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,600
from now on... stand by Emperor Ying Yuan for me.

308

313
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,600
I've completed the investigation.

314
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,600
You were concocting an elixir...

315
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,000
that could protect one's artifact spirit right before you were poisoned.

316
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,800
It would only be effective if you took it three days in a row.

317
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:12,400
You were the one who poisoned yourself.

318
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,600
Yan Dan wasn't supposed to be punished.

319
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,400
The person who should be sent to the Heavenly Gallows is you.

320
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,800
Yan Dan?

321
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,000
Yan Dan.

322
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,000
Your Majesty, you only have Yan Dan in your heart.

323
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:50,100
Even though I stood by you for a millennium, why have you never looked at me once?

324
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,400
<i> This is my firefly lamp. It never extinguishes.</i>

325
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,200
<i> Emperor Ying Yuan, you're occupied with the affairs of the Heavenly Court every day. You have worked hard.</i>

326
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:07,500
<i> I hereby grant you this lamp as a token of appreciation.</i>

327
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,400
<i> I assume the palace has an abundance of heavenly aura.</i>

328
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:46,900
<i> After a millennium, the wick of the firefly lamp actually became an artifact spirit and acquired a human form.</i>

329
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:51,100
<i> Emperor Ying Yuan, she kept you company for a millennium.</i>

330
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:55,400
You should take her back and let her serve you in Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

331
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,500
Your Majesty and I were fated to be together.

332
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,700
Do you really think I don't know?

333
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:22,000
You disrespected the Heavenly Rules and attempted to use a loving relationship to make me enlighten you

334
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,700
so that you could transform into an immortal spirit!

335
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,000
That's not it!

336
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I admit that I did have an ulterior motive for approaching Your Majesty back then.

337
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,400
But I did have feelings for you.

338
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,800
You had feelings for me?

339
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:40,589
I was already benevolent enough not to send you to the Heavenly Gallows back then!

340
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,400
Both Yan Dan and I...

341
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,400
were your immortal attendants.

342
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,800
I was cautious and loyal to my duties.

343
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,200
Not only did she lie, but she also made plenty of mistakes!

344
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:09,200
But Your Majesty defended her and chased me out of the palace instead!

345
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,400
Why?

346
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:20,800
Your Majesty, why can you never see me?

347
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,700
Because immortals should have no feelings.

348
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,060
"Immortals should have no feelings"?

349
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:38,260
If so, Your Majesty, why did you shed tears just now?

350
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:56,440
Your Majesty, if you do have feelings for Yan Dan…

351
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,080
no matter how severe the punishment of love is,

352
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:06,500
Your Majesty is immensely powerful, and you're protected by His Supreme Majesty. I'm sure you can escape unscathed.

353
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,480
But what about Yan Dan?

354
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,080
She's still injured and has to face such a severe punishment.

355
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,080
I'm afraid she will perish.

356
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,640
Are you trying to threaten me?

357
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:38,320
Your Majesty, I just hope you can spare me.

358
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,799
His Supreme Majesty has already given his verdict on the poison.

359
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:43,659
If you reopen the case again, His Supreme Majesty will surely get to the bottom of it.

360
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:47,699
The fact that Yan Dan was secretly helping you will be exposed.

361
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:50,379
His Supreme Majesty has never been lenient toward those who committed the crime of love.

362
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,280
If he uses the Uncoupling Cord to test her love for you,

363
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,099
I'm afraid she will face the punishment of love, instead of the punishment of fire.

364
00:36:58,099 --> 00:37:01,900
Yan Dan might still survive the punishment of fire.

365
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:06,080
It's better than serving the fatal punishment that is the punishment of love.

366
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:12,440
Your Majesty, if you spare me right now, I will make a vow.

367
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,259
I will keep quiet.

368
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:21,000
I will never tell anyone about your relationship with Yan Dan.

369
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:33,000
I won't destroy this evidence.

370
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:39,880
If you dare to do something like this again, I will never spare you.

371
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,540
Thank you, Your Majesty.

372
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:52,400
I will surely turn over a new leaf. I will never do this again.

373
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:55,460
You better keep yourself in check from now on.

374
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:08,080
<i>Ying Yuan, back then, you rejected me, using the Heavenly Rules as your excuse.</i>

375
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:14,460
<i>Now I will watch you as you send the person you love to the Heavenly Gallows.</i>

376
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:21,000
<i>She will misunderstand you, hate you, and will never know what you have done for her.</i>

377
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:49,759
Emperor Ying Yuan, you told your men to send her belongings here this morning.

378
00:38:49,759 --> 00:38:55,099
Now, although it's getting late, you came all the way to Xuanxin Cliff to clean her room?

379
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:02,200
Marshal, I have a favor to ask of you.

380
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,820
Please help me.

381
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:10,820
<i>[Qingli Playbook]</i>

382
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:17,940
Back then, I was the one who attacked you.

383
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,659
It's been ages since then.

384
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:23,959
Moreover, too many things happened in the Heavenly Court during that time.

385
00:39:23,959 --> 00:39:26,340
I've long forgotten about it.

386
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:37,939
You and I were lucky to return from the battlefield alive.

387
00:39:37,939 --> 00:39:42,440
Just tell me if you need any help.

388
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,160
Marshal, I hope that you can give me a Letter of Immunity.

389
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,820
A Letter of Immunity? But why?

390
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,900
Could it be that you've committed a grievous sin?

391
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:57,200
I'm not requesting it for my sake. It's for Yan Dan.

392
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,480
You mean that mischievous brat?

393
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,200
She will be punished at the Heavenly Gallows in three days.

394
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,880
She has already endured the punishment of thunder strikes.

395
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,260
I'm afraid her immortal spirit will perish if she receives the punishment of fire now.

396
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:18,860
Marshal, that's why I hope you can spare her from punishment with the Letter of Immunity.

397
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:23,339
What exactly has the little attendant done wrong for her to receive such heavy punishment?

398
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:26,760
It's inconvenient for me to reveal the reason to you.

399
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:31,320
However, Yan Dan is not a criminal.

400
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,659
You and I have competed for many years.

401
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,419
Your morality can be seen through the way you compete with me.

402
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:44,019
I know your personality well. I won't ask you why.

403
00:40:44,019 --> 00:40:47,020
I'll do you this favor.

404
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:52,180
Marshal, I'm deeply indebted to you.

405
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:01,200
Besides that, I have another favor to ask of you.

406
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,600
Speak up.

407
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:08,120
After this, I will transfer Yan Dan back to Xuanxin Cliff.

408
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,779
Although she doesn't have much immortal power, she has extraordinary talent.

409
00:41:11,779 --> 00:41:17,640
Marshal, I hope you can take her as your disciple and ensure her future.

410
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:26,480
Although that little attendant joined hands with you to beat me up, I love sassy brats like her!

411
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,559
She's witty and brave too.

412
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:32,300
She's good enough to be my disciple!

413
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:38,320
Emperor Ying Yuan, this is my first time

414
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:42,720
seeing you being this concerned about an immortal attendant after so many years.

415
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:48,419
You actually parted with your favorite GO manual because of her.

416
00:41:48,419 --> 00:41:50,640
However, don't worry.

417
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,879
I know how much you adore this GO manual.

418
00:41:53,879 --> 00:41:58,779
I will surely return it to you in perfect condition after reading it.

419
00:41:58,779 --> 00:42:00,360
No need.

420
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:05,060
I've already solved all of the GO riddles in there.

421
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:09,680
From now on, I will stop playing GO.

422
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:37,879
Brother Yu Mo, I know you're a descendant of the Nine Fins Clan.

423
00:42:37,879 --> 00:42:39,219
Nine Fins Clan members are born with extraordinary power.

424
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,259
But why can't we dispel the Marshal's barrier?

425
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,980
Don't worry.

426
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,880
I will keep this a secret.

427
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:01,800
Brother Yu Mo, you should try using my Heartseeker Bell.

428
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,360
Zhao Lan, I'm sorry.

429
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:46,100
The Heartseeker Bell was destroyed because of me.

430
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:49,799
I will surely make it up to you after I save Yan Dan.

431
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,019
It's fine. The Heartseeker Bell…

432
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,899
is just one of the random divine tools I carry with me.

433
00:43:58,899 --> 00:44:00,750
The Dragon Clan has plenty of other divine tools like this.

434
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:02,870
You should hurry and save her.

435
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,660
<i>The Heartseeker Bell has already rung.</i>

436
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:32,420
