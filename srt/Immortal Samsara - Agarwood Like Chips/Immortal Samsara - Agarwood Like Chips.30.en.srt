15
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,720
Your Highness, this is Whirlwind Bow, a tribute from the Shell Clan.

16
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,140
It's sharp and lightning fast.

17
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,400
It'll surely be a great tool to hunt that Nine Fins man.

18
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,640
Your Highness, do you want to try it out?

19
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,520
You don't usually come to me voluntarily.

20
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,640
There must be a reason. Tell me, why are you here?

21
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,520
I am indeed here for a reason.

22
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,440
I know you have been leading your army on a manhunt to kill Yu Mo.

23
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,720
I'm sure you know already that he is a Nine Fins member.

24
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,320
Yu Mo is a romantic lover.

25
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,340
He only wishes to travel around with his beloved.

26
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,880
He doesn't covet power and is not at all interested in becoming the Lord of the Four Seas.

27
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,060
You are playing with fire.

28
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,240
If the other Aquatic Clans find out, the East Sea's image will be affected.

29
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,980
Zhao Lan!

30
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,080
Did you come in person today just to defend Yu Mo?

31
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,180
For centuries, we kept each other company in Xuanxin Cliff.

32
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,300
Don't you know my feelings?

33
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,680
Do you truly think I'm after him because he threatens my position?

34
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,880
If that is true, then we are in this together.

35
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,900
I will believe you one more time.

36
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,840
Will you also believe me one more time?

37
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,640
What do you mean?

38
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,380
The Azure Dragon Clan is not sentimental with love.

39
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:26,660
Since Yu Mo is in love with someone else... I will stop loving him.

40
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,820
From now on, he and I...

41
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,540
are strangers.

42
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,240
This time...

43
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,240
I won't give any excuses anymore.

44
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,900
We will fix a date, and I will marry you.

45
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,920
Are you serious?

46
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,100
Yes. With a marriage between the South Sea and East Sea,

47
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,120
you will definitely secure your position as the future Lord of the Four Seas.

48
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,340
However, I am against bloodshed.

49
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,740
If you can let Yu Mo go and treat all Aquatic Clans with kindness,

50
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,780
from now on... I will be with you wholeheartedly.

51
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,860
We will protect the Four Seas together, and I'll stay with you forever.

52
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,340
All right. I promise.

53
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,920
I will not hunt Yu Mo down.

54
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,700
I'll write to your father to fix the date of our wedding.

55
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,460
I shall return to the South Sea and prepare my wedding gown.

56
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,460
I will wait for you.

57
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,320
Wait for me.

58
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,920
Your Highness, do you truly believe what Princess Zhao Lan said?

59
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,720
I want to believe her, for once.

60
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:22,890
However... tell our informants in the South Sea to keep a close eye on her and her father.

61
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,340
Report any unusual activity to me.

62
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,680
Yes, Your Highness.

63
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,500
Then... regarding the Nine Fins man...

64
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,020
Continue the manhunt and kill him.

65
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,640
Yes, Your Highness.

66
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,700
Your Highness, the fabric of this wedding gown was given by the Heavenly Realm.

67
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,580
The motifs and the decorations are of great quality.

68
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,920
Do you like it?

69
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,100
It's too lavish. Get me another one.

70
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,960
I quite like this one.

71
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,360
Royal Father!

72
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,440
Royal Father, why didn't you tell me that you would be here?

73
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,280
I wanted to look at you in a wedding gown.

74
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,280
I have only seen you riding, shooting, and drumming, like the heroine that you are.

75
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,380
I hardly see you in this kind of attire.

76
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,120
Your Highness, your medicine is here.

77
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,040
Are you sick? Why didn't you tell me?

78
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,160
Father, I'm actually…

79
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,680
You are all dismissed.

80
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,120
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

81
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,200
Did you lose your inverted scale?

82
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,340
No wonder you're so weak.

83
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,060
That scale is not only the manifestation of your spiritual power,

84
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,920
but it's also a token of loyalty for the Dragon Clan.

85
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,820
Your wedding is soon. How could you lose it?

86
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,380
My friend was gravely injured. I gave him my inverted scale to protect him.

87
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,860
What kind of friend deserves such a sacrifice?

88
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:22,540
Heartseeker Bell will crack once it makes a sound.

89
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,540
I guessed it correctly, then.

90
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,520
Someone managed to ring the bell.

91
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,440
And you set your heart on this person.

92
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,320
Therefore, you gave him your inverted scale as proof of your love.

93
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,080
So why did you agree to marry the Dragon Prince of the East Sea?

94
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,260
This person and I are not meant to be together.

95
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,920
We can only be friends.

96
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:55,980
Now that I have accepted my fate, I only wish this marriage can help Ao Xuan claim the throne.

97
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,320
I hope it will bring the Azure Dragon Clan peace and prosperity.

98
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,960
I've never longed for dominion over the Four Seas.

99
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:12,420
Why should we sacrifice your happiness for so-called prosperity?

100
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,780
In my heart, your happiness matters the most.

101
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,120
Tell me. Who is the one you admire?

102
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,560
I will send my people to him and find out his intentions.

103
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,430
I will not allow you to regret this.

104
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:34,260
Royal Father... this marriage is not just about me.

105
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,540
Ao Xuan is a ruthless person.

106
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,300
The Dragon Clan of the East Sea is cruel.

107
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:44,650
If you go looking for him, he will face more persecution.

108
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,760
It might even affect the entire South Sea.

109
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,380
Royal Father, this is my fate.

110
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,280
Please don't offend the East Sea because of me.

111
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,820
We don't need more bloodshed.

112
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,760
Thank you.

113
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:34,120
It's a shame that the one who hurt you managed to flee.

114
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,440
I feel disappointed.

115
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,540
It's okay. Karma will get him.

116
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,560
Maybe we'll run into him later.

117
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,920
She's bluffing again.

118
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,820
Yu Mo. I once read a book.

119
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,880
It said that when demons die,

120
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,480
our souls will leave the Three Realms and enter a place called Night Forgetting River.

121
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,220
When our souls let go of the past, we can cross the river and re-enter the Mortal Realm.

122
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,420
We would live another life.

123
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,900
Maybe this is for the better.

124
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:13,480
Perhaps Jiang Chen is now an ordinary epiphyllum.

125
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,700
She has forgotten her past and leads a carefree life.

126
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,540
I don't think she'd let go of her memory just like that.

127
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:27,100
I'm sure she'd still want to live happily with Pei Luo in her next life.

128
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,060
Yan Dan...

129
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,680
Nothing.

130
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,720
Y-Yu Mo.

131
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,080
Don't be so upset.

132
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,890
Although your beloved has departed, you still have Yelan Mountain and me.

133
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,220
We all care about you.

134
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,500
You need to cheer up.

135
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,880
<i>She thinks I was in love with Jiang Chen.</i>

136
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,510
<i>If I told her how Jiang Chen got the Extraordinary Eye, I'm sure she'll dig further.</i>

137
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,680
<i>She'll find out that I kept her past memory from her.</i>

138
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,080
Yan Dan. I don't wish to bring up the past.

139
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,760
But there was nothing between Jiang Chen and me.

140
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,480
Don't worry about it anymore.

141
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,940
All right. Let's not mention it. I'll never mention it again.

142
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,100
Sheng De said she knows the art of divination.

143
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,300
She can see someone's past and present.

144
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,340
Do you want her to help you?

145
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,280
Maybe your soulmate is on her way here.

146
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:42,680
<i>How can a mortal see someone's past and present?</i>

147
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,840
<i>Who is she?</i>

148
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,920
Young Master Tang, you have walked a lot.

149
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,500
Your forehead is sweaty. Please allow me to wipe it.

150
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,920
No need.

151
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,300
My sect has rules that forbid inappropriate contact with women.

152
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,420
Pei Luo suffered from a grave illness for half of his life.

153
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:31,380
After he was cured, he wasn't satisfied. Then he killed people to gain more power.

154
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,020
He even killed the one he loved.

155
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,900
Greed really is one of the Five Sufferings in the mortal world.

156
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,540
Jiang Chen devoted her life to love and help him.

157
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,560
But she ended up heartbroken.

158
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,320
Clearly... life is unpredictable.

159
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,180
With the volatility of human sentiments, we should all learn to love ourselves better.

160
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:59,180
I should write all of this down for my future plays.

161
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,020
Those who have never experienced it would think it's a love story,

162
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,900
while those who have would reflect upon themselves.

163
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,680
The world would have fewer tragedies, then.

164
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,720
Yan Dan.

165
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,740
Sheng De.

166
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,720
I made a few delicacies. Try some.

167
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,020
They look amazing. I've never seen them before.

168
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,360
You sure are a good cook, Sheng De!

169
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,220
Try them.

170
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,860
<i>They're from the cuisine of the Heavenly Realm.</i>

171
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,560
<i>You lost your memory. Of course, they are new to you.</i>

172
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,080
It's just some home cooking.

173
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,140
If you like them, I'll make them for you every day.

174
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:51,340
It feels like I've tasted this in my dreams.

175
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,960
I'm glad you like them. Have more.

176
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,980
Yan Dan. I'm new here.

177
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,840
I'm not close to anyone, and I can't help but feel lonely.

178
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:12,000
Young Master Tang rescued me, but I don't know what he likes.

179
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,180
I find it hard to repay his kindness, and it's been frustrating me.

180
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,960
So I am here to seek your advice.

181
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,260
Easy.

182
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,960
He's a prankster.

183
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,320
He flips tortoises. He bullies powerless demons.

184
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,810
He might look elegant and educated on the outside, but he's devious on the inside.

185
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,540
Last time, he was...

186
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,260
All that sounds like trivial daily matters.

187
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:40,860
Do you know what he is especially fond of?

188
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,060
"What he is especially fond of"?

189
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,680
After today, I'll leave with her.

190
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,540
I said I would capture you, too.

191
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,040
Is that an invitation to a duel?

192
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,180
Sure. To ensure fairness, I won't use my demonic power.

193
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,940
You truly underestimate me.

194
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,580
I won't use my spiritual power either.

195
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,860
Let's fight with our weapons.

196
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,680
My observation so far has been accurate.

197
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:38,350
Tang Zhou is stubborn, violent, and so petty that he insists on pointing out who's right and who's wrong.

198
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,060
See? There he goes again.

199
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,160
Young Master Tang is having a spar.

200
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,040
That shows his will to become stronger.

201
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,100
I think that's quite charming.

202
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,640
Is this what they call being "blinded by love"?

203
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,080
Love will truly turn you blind.

204
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,880
You have exceptional sword skills, befitting that of a hero.

205
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:22,980
However, you overestimated yourself and poked your nose where you shouldn't.

206
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,140
Do you truly have a death wish?

207
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,660
You are both smart and brave, befitting that of the king of all demons.

208
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,920
However, Lingxiao Sect has the duty to purge all evil.

209
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,480
You are bound to be captured by me.

210
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,147
There are good and evil demons.

211
00:16:39,147 --> 00:16:44,080
We on Yelan Mountain know to punish evil and promote kindness.

212
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:50,340
Ironically, the leader of all sects only knows to capture demons indiscriminately.

213
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,580
How can you lead like this?

214
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,060
Purging all evil and helping the righteous is my sect's belief.

215
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:58,080
Of course, I know there are good and evil beings.

216
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,460
I will remember my teachings and practice them.

217
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,540
Again? Wait!

218
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,600
Stop fighting! Stop it already.

219
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,020
Yan Dan. What are you trying to do?

220
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,480
What are you trying to do?

221
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,980
You, the king of all demons. The Chief of Yelan Mountain.

222
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:24,300
And you. The future leader of Lingxiao Sect.

223
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,500
Both of you are reputable and respectable commanders.

224
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,260
Yet you're here, fighting a petty competition.

225
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,060
Even I feel the second-hand embarrassment.

226
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,500
<i>He is the future leader of Lingxiao Sect?</i>

227
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,740
<i>That sect is known to reject love.</i>

228
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,420
<i>Then he...</i>

229
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,400
However, I have a solution.

230
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:51,660
Since you two are on an equal level, why don't we work together?

231
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,560
Tang Zhou has an illness.

232
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,420
He needs the Four Divine Tools to live.

233
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,660
Let's show sympathy and help him out.

234
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,900
Obviously, to repay us, if you ever become the future sect leader,

235
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,780
you cannot attack Yelan Mountain. What do you think?

236
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,400
Come on! Enough with your long face.

237
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,700
We're in the same circle. More friends, more help.

238
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,100
More enemies, more walls.

239
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,840
Besides, this alliance between mortals and demons will become a legend.

240
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,520
It will ease the tension between demon catchers and demons.

241
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,000
There'd be fewer casualties.

242
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:36,700
Please say something for the greater good.

243
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,680
Okay. I shall harm no mortals.

244
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,140
I'll appreciate the good and purge the evil.

245
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:57,820
Good! In this case, "Team One Good Deed A Day" has been created.

246
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,380
We're now partners.

247
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,460
You can't possibly continue to restrain me with the Distance-Keeping Lock.

248
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:10,240
Can't you take it off as a good start to our alliance?

249
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,940
Come on!

250
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:17,040
Turn animosity into friendship. Now is the time to prove your sincerity.

251
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,140
I've removed the spell.

252
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,600
You can keep the bracelet as a souvenir.

253
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,220
Am I free?

254
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,800
I'm free!

255
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,400
I'm free!

256
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,400
<i>[Qingyuan Inn]</i>

257
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,920
This feels amazing!

258
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:47,360
I don't have to worry about bumping into things while sleeping or being restrained during the day.

259
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,880
And I don't have to be with him all the time!

260
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,600
It's good that the spell has been removed.

261
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,290
Young Master Yu will also feel better.

262
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,540
Yu Mo? What happened to him?

263
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,580
Lately, you have always been with Young Master Tang.

264
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:04,100
I often see Young master Yu walking alone, watching you.

265
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,780
He looks so lonely.

266
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,880
I guess he feels left out.

267
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,440
Now that you mention it, it does seem like that.

268
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,060
He has been a bit down lately.

269
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,940
When I ask him why, he says he's fine.

270
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,360
Also, he never admits that he liked Jiang Chen.

271
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:28,890
I don't know if he's doing that so I won't be worried or if there's another reason.

272
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:32,440
I have experienced the pain of leaving my loved one.

273
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,720
He is the Mountain Chief, so he doesn't want to show his vulnerability to you.

274
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,900
But that doesn't mean he's okay.

275
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,120
Otherwise, how can you explain his sorrow?

276
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,460
Since you're close to him, you should spend more time with him.

277
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,080
Don't make him feel left out.

278
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,400
You're right.

279
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,520
I shouldn't be an ungrateful demon.

280
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,260
Should I stay with Young Master Tang Zhou tomorrow so you can have some privacy with Young Master Yu?

281
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,960
Then, you can talk to him privately.

282
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,060
He has been taking good care of me.

283
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:12,000
It's my time to repay that kindness.

284
00:21:34,775 --> 00:21:36,820
<i>[Don't feel sad. Don't be discouraged.]</i>

285
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,100
"Don't feel sad. Don't be discouraged."

286
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,740
<i>Tomorrow will be better.</i>

287
00:22:16,939 --> 00:22:19,125
<i>[May we all live a long life so that we can share this beautiful moonlight.]</i>

288
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:21,400
<i>[With a hearty laugh I left, for I will never settle for less]</i>

289
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,650
<i>[I will head to the top and the world will be under me.]</i>

290
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,800
<i>[Burdened not by endless woes, let's finish the glass before us.]</i>

291
00:22:33,475 --> 00:22:35,775
<i>[Though the fire within you will diminish as you age, it is still a source of light.]</i>

292
00:22:35,775 --> 00:22:37,250
<i>[No one can stop a fresh start.]</i>

293
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,875
<i>[Let go of your pursuits and your life will be a great.]</i>

294
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:40,550
<i>[The path stretches to the edge of clouds, the river runs through in Spring.]</i>

295
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:07,400
The innkeeper said someone was looking for me up here.

296
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:12,240
Are you disappointed to see me?

297
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,300
How can I help?

298
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:20,980
I came across this unsolved GO game, and I haven't been able to solve it.

299
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,840
Would you care to enlighten me?

300
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,160
I don't know how to play GO.

301
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,360
Why?

302
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,820
For some reason... whenever I see the GO board,

303
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,840
or think about learning GO, I feel distraught and upset.

304
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,560
You said you can look into the past.

305
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:48,820
Can you tell me why there's always a woman in my dream jumping off a bridge?

306
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,980
I can't see her face clearly.

307
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:56,480
And when I wake up, I feel guilty and distraught.

308
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,560
Did I do her wrong in the past?

309
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,060
<i>You still remember her?</i>

310
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,520
Based on my divination...

311
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:20,240
she was your trial, not the love of your life.

312
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,840
You were tricked by her and died from anguish.

313
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:29,160
Your dream is a warning.

314
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,540
Stay away from her.

315
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:40,060
If she was a trial, I should've been happy when she jumped off the bridge.

316
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,000
Why would I feel the pain, too?

317
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,060
Lotus Advisor.

318
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,460
You're here!

319
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:03,620
You wrote many comforting words in my room.

320
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,600
What’s the purpose?

321
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,100
Look. I made these lanterns for you.

322
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:13,860
You've been down lately. If I didn't do anything to console you, I'd be a bad friend.

323
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:20,260
I heard that, when the mortals are troubled, they write their worries on the lanterns and send them to the sky.

324
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:24,500
Their worries disappear with the lanterns. Should we give it a try?

325
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,020
Come. You'll write on that side, and I'll write on this side.

326
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,060
Are you done?

327
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,260
I'll light it, then.

328
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,140
Okay.

329
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,320
Wait.

330
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,840
I want to see what you wrote.

331
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,720
No!

332
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,060
So petty. Won't you let me see it?

333
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:08,240
Show me yours, and I'll show you mine.

334
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,580
Go ahead. I didn't write anything.

335
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,840
I realized that I have no worries.

336
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:22,120
Whether it's here or on Yelan Mountain, I've been living a carefree life.

337
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:26,840
I believe hardships are a part of life.

338
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:31,540
I don't want to forget anything I feel. I want to remember every moment.

339
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,060
I've told you everything.

340
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,560
Can you tell me what you wrote, now?

341
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,020
All right.

342
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:42,960
I wrote that the meal you sent me today was quite disgusting.

343
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,160
I wasn't moved by it, and I hope your culinary skills will improve.

344
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,520
Is that all?

345
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,320
You're heartless! I made those specially for you.

346
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:10,840
<i> I wonder if I should tell you about your past.</i>

347
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,780
<i> Maybe if I hide it from you, you'll forever be happy, like now.</i>

348
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,760
Should we send this away together?

349
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,540
Sure.

350
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,900
I'll get more.

351
00:27:55,420 --> 00:28:00,160
I wonder what kind of journey all these lanterns will experience.

352
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:04,540
Looking at this scenery, I sure envy them.

353
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,240
Do you want to find out?

354
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,980
Since you can't play GO,

355
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:21,760
I shall play music for you to ease your boredom.

356
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,440
Sheng...

357
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,980
Stop! The inn is right there.

358
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,920
If you go further, the mortals will notice.

359
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,440
I'm here. It'll be fine.

360
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,820
If you haven't had enough fun, we can go further.

361
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,940
It's okay. I've seen enough lanterns.

362
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:14,360
I wanted to talk you out of your troubles today, but instead, you gave me a lantern show.

363
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:19,320
It’s fine. As your master, I should spoil you.

364
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,760
Yan Dan!

365
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,160
Be careful.

366
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,020
Thank you.

367
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,080
You are all useless!

368
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,840
If you can't save my royal father, all of you will die with him!

369
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,120
<i>Your Highness, have mercy.</i>

370
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,720
Ao Xuan.

371
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,740
Royal Father.

372
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:22,200
My time has come.

373
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,880
Nothing more can be done.

374
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:32,280
I have one last wish for you.

375
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,750
Marry Zhao Lan as soon as possible.

376
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:45,120
Control the South Sea to stabilize our reign.

377
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,000
Royal Father, you don’t need to worry.

378
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,400
I will carry out your last wish and rule over the Four Seas.

379
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:55,120
I will perpetuate the glory of Dragon Clan of the East Sea.

380
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,360
Royal Father. Royal Father!

381
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:07,100
Father!

382
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,700
Your Highness, our scout in the South Sea said Zhao Yan, Dragon King of the South Sea,

383
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,080
left his palace in secret to look for the orphan of the Nine Fins Clan.

384
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,640
Zhao Lan.

385
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,700
How dare you lie to me?

386
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:36,500
My father just passed away, and you turn to another leader right away.

387
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,760
All right.

388
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:46,080
Let me show you who is the Dragon King of them all.

389
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,480
Gather the army.

390
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:58,500
We're going to the South Sea to get my wife!

391
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:04,120
I think you're cheating.

392
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:09,680
I'm an expert gambler, the best in Yelan Mountain.

393
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,700
Accept your defeat. You and Sheng De will start a fire here

394
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:17,720
while Yu Mo and I look for food. We'll leave after the meal.

395
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,370
Miss Yan Dan has a close relationship with Young Master Yu.

396
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:27,180
You two are inseparable.

397
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,480
Don't get me wrong.

398
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,120
I'm just a loyal servant to Yu Mo. Right?

399
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,060
You are so nonchalant, Young Master Yu Mo.

400
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:43,840
Do you know the Four Seas will soon be in turmoil because of you?

401
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,420
I sense hostility.

402
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,500
Who are you?

403
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,420
<i>Emperor Ying Yuan is still alive?</i>

404
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:03,020
<i> The Heavenly Realm claimed he passed away. Is there more to it?</i>

405
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,980
A deity is experiencing the mortal trials. Show some respect!

406
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,020
"A deity"?

407
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:15,040
Who? Him? He's a deity?

408
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,560
Sheng De, you weren't lying!

409
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,280
You really are a deity!

410
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,240
Not bad!

411
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,120
If I ever angered you, forgive me.

412
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,180
Forgive me.

413
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:36,360
<i>Tang Zhou is a deity undergoing mortal trials?</i>

414
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,780
<i>Who exactly is he?</i>

415
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,980
Your Majesty, I am Zhao Yan, Dragon King of the South Sea.

416
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,880
I'm not here to disturb you during your trials and defy the Heavenly Rules.

417
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,560
However, this is about the Four Seas and my family.

418
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,600
Please stay out of it, Your Majesty.

419
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,480
No need to be so formal.

420
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,660
I'm a mortal now, and I know nothing about my past.

421
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,440
Yu Mo is my friend.

422
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,280
I will not be excluded from this.

423
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,480
Ao Xuan must have sent you here to kill me.

424
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,290
If you think you can do it, come at me.

425
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:22,940
Why did you accuse me of threatening the peace of the Four Seas?

426
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,550
I have no gain in killing you.

427
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:29,180
I just want peace for the Four Seas and happiness for my daughter.

428
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,360
Are you here for Zhao Lan?

429
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,200
Zhao Lan agreed to the marriage.

430
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,000
But once she arrived in Mortal Realm,

431
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,300
she used her illness as an excuse to postpone the wedding.

432
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,800
Now that she is finally getting married, she has been unhappy.

433
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:49,100
That's when I found out she is sacrificing her happiness in exchange for your safety!

434
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:56,600
Do you know that the inverted scale is not only the treasure of a dragon, but it is also a token of love?

435
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,900
You took her inverted scale, so you should take up the responsibility!

436
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,400
Not bad, Yu Mo!

437
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,700
We were separated in the Mortal Realm for a month,

438
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,000
and you already managed to steal the Dragon Princess' heart.

439
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,600
- It seems like Yelan Mountain will have an heir soon.
- Shut up!

440
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,000
I'm just happy for you.

441
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,300
Your Highness.

442
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,000
I was unaware of the significance of the scale.

443
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,500
If I knew, I wouldn't have accepted it.

444
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,000
Nonsense!

445
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,100
If you weren't courting her with your sweet words,

446
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,100
why did you ring her Heartseeker Bell and accept her inverted scale

447
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,200
without coming to the South Sea to ask for her hand?

448
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,200
The wedding is approaching,

449
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,400
but Zhao Lan can only think of you.

450
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,800
You have the inverted scale.

451
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,800
The South Sea was accused of rescinding the agreement.

452
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:58,400
And you are loitering around with women.

453
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,500
As a father and a dragon king, I need to settle this today!

454
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,800
Hear me out, Your Highness!

455
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,600
It's just a misunderstanding.

456
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,700
My mountain chief here is an honest man.

457
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:11,200
He is not a philanderer who toys with women's feelings.

458
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,200
Also, coincidentally,

459
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,500
Yelan Mountain is preparing livestock and collecting rare treasures

460
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,300
for Miss Zhao Lan's dowry right now.

461
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,400
Shut up!

462
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,000
I'm trying to defuse the situation.

463
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,500
Since this is the case, I have to see Zhao Lan in the South Sea.

464
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:50,000
Wonderful! I'll return to Yelan Mountain and assemble your wedding marching band for you.

465
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,600
Shut up already!

466
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,400
I never said I would marry her.

467
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,800
Exactly. She's the Princess of the South Sea.

468
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,400
Making her rescind the agreement to be your concubine is unfair.

469
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,200
I don't mean that!

470
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,400
Zhao Lan and I are not meant to be together.

471
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,800
Besides, I've already found someone I love.

472
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,000
Zhao Lan and I never did anything inappropriate either.

473
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,600
<i>He still can't let go of Jiang Chen.</i>

474
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:21,200
She gave me this inverted scale to save me.

475
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,900
Now that I know what it also represents,

476
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,400
I have to return it to her.

477
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,200
I have to tell her my true feelings.

478
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,600
I cannot make her marry someone she doesn't like for my safety.

479
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,600
Yan Dan. Come with me.

480
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,700
Me?

481
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,600
No! Unless I'm there too.

482
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,200
No!

483
00:37:54,600 --> 00:38:01,900
Well, when I was still studying in the past, I heard about the deity's mortal trials.

484
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:06,800
If the deity dies before his trials are complete,

485
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,800
he might...

486
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,600
he might be unable to return to the Heavenly Realm.

487
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,400
Young Master Tang is just a mortal now.

488
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,500
The Aquatic Clan is having a change of leadership and is unstable.

489
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,800
If he tags along, the risk will be huge.

490
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,100
It's okay.

491
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,700
When I was attacked, the deity who saved me told me my celestial vest was broken.

492
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:44,100
If I don't repair it with the Four Divine Tools, I will die, sooner or later, as the divine power dissipates.

493
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,500
I don't fear death now.

494
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:59,400
If I don't go with you and let the demons I caught escape, I'll lose more than I'll gain.

495
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,800
Okay, that’s fine.

496
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,000
How about this?

497
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,600
The four of us will go together.

498
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,100
We'll deal with Yu Mo's love problem first, before sending Sheng De back to her sect.

499
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,400
Is that good enough?

500
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,400
<i>Okay.</i>

501
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,400
Fortunately, I have learned some spirit-mending techniques.

502
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,000
It might help stabilize Young Master Tang's divine power.

503
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,800
<i>His Majesty is going through the Eight Hardships now.</i>

504
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:35,700
<i>Without the protection of his celestial vest and the Divine Tools, he will cease to exist.</i>

505
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:39,800
<i>Unless... he takes another half of the Lotus Heart.</i>

506
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,800
Your Majesty.

507
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:01,400
To avoid interfering with your trials, you'll need to conceal your face in the Dragon Palace.

508
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,900
Forgive this inconvenience, Your Majesty.

509
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I require your assistance in my family matters, and I am not proud of it.

510
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,500
Here, please.

511
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,000
Who exactly is Tang Zhou?

512
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,800
Even the Dragon King of the South Sea treats him with utmost reverence.

513
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,500
Is he one of those almighty gods you see in plays?

514
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,500
Sheng De, do you know his identity?

515
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,900
You must be joking, Sister Yan Dan.

516
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,100
Only deities who wish to rise in ranks or who made a mistake have to go through the trials.

517
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,800
Those belonging to the rank of Greater God are exempted.

518
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,800
There are many deities who've descended from the Heavenly Realm, and many have a noble status.

519
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,700
We shouldn't waste time guessing.

520
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,920
Miss Sheng De, you know a lot.

521
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:10,900
Yan Dan. Judging by what you just said, I'm sure you have relied enough on me.

522
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:14,700
Why don't you find someone better now?

523
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,400
I have learned something on this journey.

524
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,800
Be self-reliant.

525
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:24,800
Also, if I want to rely on someone, I prefer relying on someone warm and friendly like you.

526
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,000
Wise answer.

527
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,500
Let's go.

528
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:40,000
I personally picked the palace guards.

529
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,100
No amendments can be made without the military seal.

530
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,100
Who are you?

531
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Let go of me!

532
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,300
Ao Xuan. Let go of me!

533
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,400
Pardon me for the violation, Dragon King Zhao Yan.

534
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,600
The East Sea wedding marching band has been unable to enter for a few days,

535
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,200
so I have to come here to get my wife.

536
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,800
Royal Father, they planted their people here a while ago.

537
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,800
Once you left, he barged in with his soldiers!

538
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,000
He then started killing!

539
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Ao Xuan, stop it!

540
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,500
Ao Xuan. Even though you are now the Dragon King of the East Sea, I am the ruler of the South Sea.

541
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:44,500
Today, you attacked the South Sea with your army, killed my guards, and kidnapped my daughter.

542
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,200
You are violating the Heavenly Rules!

543
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,900
Zhao Yan. You colluded with Yu Mo in secret

544
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:56,800
and allowed him and his cohorts to enter the South Sea to steal my noble consort.

545
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,400
I came with my army to take over the South Sea.

546
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,800
Isn't it expected?

547
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,900
His Supreme Majesty can't do anything about it.

548
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,200
Ao Xuan, don’t be arrogant and conceited.

549
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:13,000
Luckily, I noticed Zhao Lan's feelings and stopped everything before it was too late.

550
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:20,100
Even if she hasn't found a lover, I will not hand her over to someone ruthless, like you!

551
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,600
You and Zhao Lan deceived me.

552
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,600
You refused my wedding marching band's entry.

553
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:30,600
I will not take this shame!

554
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Even though you've ascended the throne, the Dragon King of the South Sea is still your elder.

555
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,500
Yet you barged into the South Sea, hurt and kidnapped his people.

556
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,600
You're no different from bandits.

557
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,600
I am a dragon king.

558
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,700
I am the Lord of the Four Seas.

559
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,500
All beings in the Mortal Realm shall bow down to me.

560
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,800
