15
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,220
Miss Yan Dan, what is this?

16
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,440
I'm going to leave the mountain in a few days.

17
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,360
You've taken care of me well, Eldest Senior Brother.

18
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,720
I'm very grateful.

19
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,780
So I brought two jugs of fine liquor.

20
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,840
I came to say goodbye and to thank you.

21
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,800
Tang Zhou is under confinement.

22
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,460
But you have me.

23
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,620
If you marry me... then you can stay.

24
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,640
You're right.

25
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,240
But he...

26
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,640
I'm indebted to him.

27
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,140
Right now, he's injured and being punished.

28
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:10,880
Without his approval, I wouldn't be able to do it.

29
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,880
Let's put aside those unpleasant topics.

30
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,240
It's a beautiful night and there's fine liquor.

31
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,300
Eldest Senior Brother, don't let my good intentions go to waste.

32
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,260
You're right. Fate is destined.

33
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,480
Tonight, let's drink! We will leave everything else for tomorrow.

34
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,680
That's the right attitude!

35
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,360
Here!

36
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,900
This is fine liquor!

37
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,740
Another!

38
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,200
Dan Shu, hurry and leave first.

39
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,640
No. Sister Yan Dan, let's leave together.

40
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,560
Dan Shu, be good.

41
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,380
There's something I need to take care of.

42
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,160
I can't leave with you.

43
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,100
How about this? Head back to Yelan Mountain.

44
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,900
If I don't return in two weeks, ask Yu Mo to come rescue me.

45
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,860
I can't leave you behind.

46
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,300
I won't be able to explain to Mountain Chief if I return without you.

47
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,720
If you're staying, I'll stay too.

48
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,880
Dan Shu, I'll definitely keep myself safe.

49
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,680
I remember your birthday is coming up soon.

50
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,320
I'll make sure to return before your birthday, and ensure that Yu Mo and I give you a proper celebration.

51
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,640
Then I'll have Sister Bai Ling prepare your favorite foods and wait for you to return to celebrate with us.

52
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,540
All right. Hurry, go now!

53
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,480
Be careful!

54
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,960
<i>Thank you.</i>

55
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,380
Don't mention it. Please get up.

56
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:01,020
Actually... It is all thanks to someone's help that I was able to save everyone.

57
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,560
I owe him a favor.

58
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,980
I wonder... Would you all be willing to help me?

59
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,480
Why are you still here?

60
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,040
This is no place for you to be. You shouldn't be here!

61
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,720
We demons know to repay our debts.

62
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,420
You were punished because of me. How could I leave?

63
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,080
Listen. The Demon Suppression Hall is on fire.
<i>[Memorial Tablet]</i>

64
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,680
Some demons took advantage of the situation and launched an attack.

65
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,660
You'll redeem yourself if you arrive in time to save the day.

66
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,540
Then the sect leader won't make things hard for you anymore.

67
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,780
Hurry! There's no time to waste!

68
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,920
You're so reckless!

69
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,920
Remember, you must never use your power.

70
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,600
If your identity is exposed, I won't be able to protect you, even if I died trying!

71
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,180
Also, go alert the sect leader right now and then find somewhere to hide.

72
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,080
I'm going to make up for my mistakes now.

73
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,700
I underestimated you that day.

74
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,580
I was careless and let you catch me off guard.

75
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,520
Now you've fallen into my hands.

76
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,320
So much demonic power has been drained from me.

77
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,160
I'll devour a few Taoist masters to regain my strength!

78
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,480
<i>They're actually trying to kill everyone in the Lingxiao Sect.</i>

79
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,660
<i>They used me and tricked me!</i>

80
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,940
<i>I caused this mess. I'll fix it myself!</i>

81
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,020
Qin Qi!

82
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,300
Qin Qi! Are you okay?

83
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,860
Watch out!

84
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,360
Didn't I ask you to stay inside?

85
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,700
I don't want your sect members to die because of me!

86
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,620
Don't mind me. Hurry up and take care of the demons!

87
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,160
Why are you helping them?

88
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,140
You're a...

89
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,360
That was really manly of you!

90
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,840
Some days ago, a rainstorm broke the magical array of the Demon Suppression Hall.

91
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,460
The tiger demons teamed up to rescue their members.

92
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,520
Before leaving, they set the place on fire, in retaliation.

93
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,800
I led the disciples to capture all the evil demons and restored the magical array.

94
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,360
From now on, such a thing will never happen again.

95
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,380
You protected the sect and your brethren, despite being in confinement.

96
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,760
I am pleased by your devotion.

97
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,380
You did well defeating the demons tonight.

98
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,380
You have redeemed yourself.

99
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,100
I will let the previous matter go.

100
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,580
Thank you, Sect Leader.

101
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,180
Sect Leader!

102
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,660
You are most wise, Sect Leader.

103
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:48,500
Sect Leader, it was actually not Tang Zhou's fault, to begin with.

104
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,100
He only did it to protect me.

105
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,700
On our way back, I was curious about what demons look like.

106
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,100
So I opened the jade calabash when he was not looking.

107
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,320
I didn't know the demon would take the chance to escape.

108
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,480
So it was not Tang Zhou who let the demon go.

109
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,640
I was the one who did it accidentally.

110
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,120
He promised to help me keep it a secret.

111
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,660
He is a man of his word, and he kept his promise.

112
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,020
Just now, he even saved my life.

113
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,400
I really cannot bear to see him suffer anymore because of me.

114
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,940
I was so focused on the fight last night. I forgot I dropped my hairpin.

115
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,660
Thanks.

116
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,440
This is odd.

117
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,840
Why did it look like the petals on the hairpin just glimmered?

118
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:47,600
Back then, when Master gave me the hairpin, he said it was made of very rare material.

119
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,640
Perhaps, because you're a demon, the color changes when influenced by your demonic power.

120
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,360
Actually...

121
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:14,500
Actually, before, when I said I hated you, I only said it in the heat of the moment.

122
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,160
I can tell you are different from the other Taoist masters.

123
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,560
You're not really that self-righteous.

124
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,280
You... are a good person.

125
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,640
"A good person"?

126
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,340
I rescued people all night.

127
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,980
Is this all I get from you?

128
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,180
How is your injury?

129
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,680
Let me see if it's better.

130
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,280
It's fine! I'm just fine.

131
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,360
I'll take care of it myself.

132
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,840
All right.

133
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,740
You were wrong about demons. I was wrong about you.

134
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,140
But after all of this, you know that there are good demons now.

135
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,660
I’ve also learned there are bad demons.

136
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,060
Let's call it even!

137
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,120
From now on, you're not just a good person, to me.

138
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,840
We're friends too!

139
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,240
Give me a chance! Let's start over!

140
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,900
Who'd want to be friends with a clumsy, lying lotus demon?

141
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,760
I only heard "smart, brave, beautiful, and generous!"

142
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,400
So narcissistic!

143
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,620
You resolved the crisis last night.

144
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,680
Not only did you get Sect Leader to forgive you, but you also earned the respect of the entire sect.

145
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,300
Most importantly, you profited from a disaster.

146
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,680
Don't I deserve a reward for that?

147
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,460
Maybe this bangle, for example?

148
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,200
You acted recklessly. Now, you dare to ask for a reward?

149
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,880
I wasn't interested in the sect leader position, to begin with.

150
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,940
I didn't take the path of cultivation for these superficial titles.

151
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,040
You're not interested in being Sect Leader?

152
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,760
Then do you plan to marry and have children?

153
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,740
You didn't actually fall for me... did you?

154
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,480
Never mind the fact that you're a demon.

155
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,960
Even if you were a goddess, there's no way I would ever fall in love with you!

156
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,100
That is great!

157
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,160
Starting now, let's part ways.

158
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,020
May everything between us be forgotten!

159
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,100
Farewell!

160
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,700
Didn't you say you would let me go?

161
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:26,540
Since the crisis has been resolved, I take back what I said earlier.

162
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,500
You despicable man! I'll...

163
00:11:33,987 --> 00:11:35,347
<i>[Almond Cake]</i>

164
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,740
And you say you don't consider me a friend.

165
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,700
You just won't admit it.

166
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,570
Brother Yu Mo! Brother Yu Mo, do you feel better?

167
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,880
I'm fine now.

168
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,020
Back then, in Heaven, my dragon horn was damaged and my powers destabilized. I almost fell unconscious.

169
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,940
It was you who saved me with your elixir.

170
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:36,800
It's been so long. I thought I’d never see you again, let alone be saved by you.

171
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,900
Now… I owe you two lives.

172
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,860
Brother Yu Mo, there’s no need to be so courteous with me.

173
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:52,140
When we parted in Heaven, who knew we'd be separated for so long?

174
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,340
Brother Yu Mo, were you able to find Yan Dan?

175
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,260
Yes.

176
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,720
Then are you two... enjoying life in the Mortal Realm?

177
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,600
Life in the Mortal Realm is free of restraints and worries. There's no pressure...

178
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,540
unlike the Heavenly Court.

179
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,460
Cold. Oppressive.

180
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,860
We are doing well here.

181
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,580
What about you?

182
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:38,540
My... My wedding with Ao Xuan is coming up soon.

183
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,060
Ao Xuan is cunning and deceptive.

184
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,600
He is definitely not a man to marry.

185
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,100
You must not let yourself be coerced to marry him.

186
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:51,940
You also shouldn't sacrifice your happiness for the sake of the South Sea.

187
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,500
Thank you.

188
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:09,430
In the entire world... you’re the only one who would put yourself in my shoes and consider my well-being.

189
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:26,060
You've been away for so long. Why hasn’t Yan Dan come to find you yet?

190
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,840
Yan Dan was captured by Demon Catchers. She's been gone for days.

191
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:36,860
I was searching for her. I didn't imagine I would run into Ao Xuan.

192
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,630
Yan Dan is in danger right now.

193
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,640
I have to hurry and save her.

194
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,160
I'll go with you!

195
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,400
Yan Dan is also my friend. I might be able to help.

196
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,040
You can't! You'll be implicated if Ao Xuan were to find out.

197
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,460
I don't care about that!

198
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,820
The answer is still no.

199
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,020
Even if Ao Xuan doesn’t know, your father will surely send someone for you.

200
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,790
I don't want to get your father involved.

201
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,340
I also don't want to drag the South Sea into this.

202
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,540
You're right.

203
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:10,500
If I follow you, it will only increase the chances of them finding you.

204
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,040
Ao Xuan knows that you lost your dragon core.

205
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,300
He will definitely do everything he can to get rid of you.

206
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,420
This is my inverted scale. Use it to cover your wound.

207
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,580
No weapon can penetrate it.

208
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,080
If you run into danger, you can also use this to summon me.

209
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,960
You can't! The inverted scale... is a dragon's most precious treasure.

210
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,720
I can't...

211
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,720
This item is too valuable. I can't accept this!

212
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,700
Only if you are safe can you find Yan Dan.

213
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,100
And only if you are safe will I—

214
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,660
I can't repay your kindness, Zhao Lan.

215
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,860
Right now, I live in seclusion on Yelan Mountain.

216
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:10,720
If the South Sea is ever in need of help, come to me at any time.

217
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,060
I'll do everything I can to help.

218
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,140
I'll do my best to stall Ao Xuan.

219
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,420
The East Sea doesn't want the other Aquatic Clans to learn of the Nine Fins' existence.

220
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,540
I'll pressure him so he'll think twice before making his move.

221
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,280
When you find Yan Dan, let me know immediately.

222
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,940
All right.

223
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:33,040
When things calm down, I'll come with her to see you.

224
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,820
It is a promise!

225
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,460
Your qi was damaged during the fight last night.

226
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,600
Drink this to recover.

227
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,000
This isn't really necessary. No need to be so courteous.

228
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,980
I wasn't hurt.

229
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,980
Who knows what you put in that medicine?

230
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,380
You might’ve slipped something in it to get back at me.

231
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,740
I'm taking care of you out of the kindness of my heart, and you don't even know it.

232
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,240
Fine. Don't drink it, then.

233
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,900
No, wait, wait! Just kidding.

234
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,920
I was just joking.

235
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,160
I'll drink it. I will.

236
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,860
I'll do it.

237
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,400
Come here.

238
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,540
I'm usually the one who serves you.

239
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,760
I never thought you’d serve me one day!

240
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,800
You talk too much. Drink this and stop talking.

241
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,800
One more.

242
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,060
Hello, Sect Leader!

243
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:49,820
<i>[Memorial Tablet]</i>

244
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,960
You saved her twice.

245
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,240
And you are taking care of her with such dedication.

246
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,580
Have you developed feelings for her?

247
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,140
You are mistaken, Sect Leader.

248
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:07,040
Yan Dan was injured while protecting the disciples last night.

249
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,340
She has no family here. It is my duty to take care of her.

250
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,220
I have no other intentions.

251
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,260
You are a cultivator.

252
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:21,900
Putting worldly matters, such as love, behind you is part of your cultivation.

253
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:26,340
In the past, your master told me with conviction that you are the chosen one.

254
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,800
You will become a pillar of the Lingxiao sect someday.

255
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,600
Over these years, you haven't let us down.

256
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,940
You carry the future of our sect on your shoulders.

257
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:41,140
A demon catcher is devoted to capturing demons, eliminating evil, and serving justice.

258
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:46,300
As Sect Leader, one must understand that the nature of everything is emptiness.

259
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:50,360
Your heart must be pure and untainted by mortal affairs.

260
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,540
Love must be discarded.

261
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,160
I have no intention of becoming the sect leader.

262
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,360
Should the Lingxiao Sect need me…

263
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:08,620
I am willing to dedicate my life to cultivation and cut off all affairs of the heart.

264
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:15,880
Only by becoming the sect leader can you truly lead this sect to flourish and prosper.

265
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,560
I hope you will live up to your master's expectations to carry this sect forward.

266
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:25,320
The future of the Lingxiao Sect rests on your shoulders.

267
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,020
Yes, Sir.

268
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,800
An unusual phenomenon has occurred in the royal capital. The people are unsettled.

269
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:38,080
For this reason, the King of Andu is recruiting demon catchers to remove the demon.

270
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,660
This is a great opportunity for us to establish our sect's name.

271
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,470
I am entrusting you with this task.

272
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,260
You will represent our clan and head to the royal capital.

273
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,920
You will depart immediately after the succession ceremony.

274
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,580
All right.

275
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:57,420
Today, Tang Zhou is granted the magical bracelet as the new sect leader.

276
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:01,160
♫ <i> "Love" is the word for everything </i> ♫

277
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:06,700
♫ <i> My loneliness and longing for you leaves a mark like fragments of the moon </i> ♫

278
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,950
With the magical bracelet in hand and conviction in the heart,

279
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:14,420
from now on, you shall be bound to your devotion and reject all mortal affairs.

♫ <i> Life after life, this is the longing I missed the most</i> ♫

291
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,920
Have you seen a woman with a water caltrop mark on her wrist?
<i> (T/N: Water caltrops are aquatic plants with edible seeds) </i>

292
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,720
Who are you? What do you want with her?

293
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,800
<i>Could he be the demon who killed Yan Dan's entire family? </i>

294
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,820
<i>Has he come to seek revenge?</i>

295
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,860
Answer me.

296
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,420
She left for the royal capital with my junior to answer the royal edict.

297
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,140
<i>[Royal Edict]</i>

298
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,940
So many demon catchers have come to the royal capital.

299
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,440
The demon in the palace must be a tough one.

300
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,880
Once we take care of it, we'll be able to claim credit when we return.

301
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,960
- Here.
- Here.

302
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,720
This is an order from the King of Andu.

303
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,820
All of those who have come to subdue the demon shall stay at this inn for the night.

304
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,660
You'll enter the palace tomorrow together.

305
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,700
No wonder the King of Andu issued an edict to recruit demon catchers.

306
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:10,540
Crows and blood. It’s suspicious indeed.

307
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:14,400
Recently, many women born at the hour of Zi have disappeared.
<i>(T/N: Between 11 PM and 1 AM)</i>

308
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,060
It must be connected to what is happening in the palace.

309
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,540
I heard the entire palace was covered with white flowers.

310
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,120
It's as if there’s a state funeral. It is so unlucky!

311
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,940
You don't really think there is a demon in the palace, do you?

312
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,860
Are you interested in catching demons?

313
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,660
Isn't it all because of you?

314
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:34,380
Your sect leader sent you to suppress the demon. Why did you bring me along?

315
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,620
If I leave you behind, you might cause trouble.

316
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,000
I...

317
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,600
Weren't you looking for some divine tools to heal your wound?

318
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,660
Why didn't you just tell your sect leader that?

319
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,260
Instead, you came here to catch demons.

320
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:50,080
An assignment from the sect should be done with due diligence.

321
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,920
I don't want him to worry about me.

322
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,180
It won't be too late to tell him after I find all the divine tools.

323
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,880
What's going on?

324
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,420
There is movement nearby.

325
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,460
<i>Yan Dan is close by.</i>

326
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,640
Yu Mo!

327
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,140
- Yan Dan!
- Yu Mo!

328
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,320
I missed you! You finally came!

329
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,840
Yan Dan, I've been looking all over for you. But I couldn't find you!

330
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,920
- Are you all right?
- Hey!

331
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,140
Your clothes suit you well. Where did you steal this from?

332
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,820
It's a long story.

333
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,320
What am I? Invisible?

334
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,620
This is my friend. He came for me.

335
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:48,200
You must be the person who ate my pastries.

336
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,380
Were you the one who took Yan Dan?

337
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,760
Yes. It was him!

338
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,220
Did he mistreat you?

339
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,860
Honestly, he's vicious.

340
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,720
He orders me around like a servant!

341
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,720
He had me wash clothes, cook, peel crabs, and grind ink for him.

342
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,480
Most importantly, he even forced me to eat fish!

343
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,800
Yu Mo?

344
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,960
So you're her fish friend.

345
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,460
Her cousin, Yu Heitu.

346
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,000
Not just anyone is allowed to mispronounce my name.

347
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,620
If you are a fish demon, why can't I sense a demonic aura?

348
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:22,160
We’re in a hurry to return home. I can't be bothered with you.

349
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,230
I'll settle things with you another day.

350
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,980
Let us go.

351
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,780
It's only righteous for a demon catcher to subdue demons.

352
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,700
Yan Dan, stand aside.

353
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,580
I'll make him pay for everything he put you through.

354
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,200
If it's a duel you want, I'll gladly oblige.

355
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,200
<i>I need to rely on both of them.</i>

356
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,800
<i>It's my loss if either of them gets hurt.</i>

357
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,020
Stop fighting! Stop!

358
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,820
We can't afford to pay for all this damage!

359
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,460
He broke them all.

360
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:22,880
I exaggerated a little just now. He wasn't all that bad to me.

361
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,380
He took you away for so long. Why are you defending him?

362
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,380
All right. I'll make it quick, then.

363
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,440
Bring it on!

364
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,340
All right.

365
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,100
I can't exactly stop you both with force.

366
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,320
Forget it. I’m out of here.

367
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,720
You two carry on!

368
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,240
Call me when it's time to eat!

369
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,620
Blossoms nurtured by a demon's blood.

370
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:14,400
These flowers are looking better than ever.

371
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,660
Who's there?

372
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,820
Didn't I say I don't need anyone to serve me in the rear courtyard?

373
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,260
Please forgive me!

374
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:29,280
His Majesty, King of Andu, asked Your Highness to meet him in the back garden.

375
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,700
His Majesty warmly summoned Your Highness today, for the first time in years.

376
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,280
The King of Andu must still have feelings for Your Highness.

377
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:48,500
Ever since the palace was sealed, Your Highness stopped dressing up. The mirror is dusty.

378
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,100
Your clothes and hairpins are out of style, as well.

379
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,620
It doesn't matter.

380
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:57,680
This is probably the last time I will be using these things, anyway.

381
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,020
Please do not say such inauspicious things, Your Highness.

382
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,980
Others will not understand our love and relationship.

383
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,520
Let me do it.

384
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,240
I know what he likes to see me in.

385
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,200
Today...

386
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,540
I will bid him a proper farewell.

387
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,620
Jiang Chen.

388
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,020
Your Majesty and I made a promise.

389
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,080
If we are holding a paper umbrella, then we shall put our titles aside.

390
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,860
We would only refer to each other as husband and wife.

391
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,700
He came alone.

392
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,320
I also don't need anyone to serve me.

393
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,740
Leave us.

394
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,600
Yes, Your Highness.

395
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,360
Have you missed me all this while?

396
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,700
Jiang Chen, you've always been in my heart.

397
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:47,920
Have you forgotten the reason why we stopped seeing each other?

398
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,620
You made your decision. There must be a reason why you asked to see me today.

399
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,860
Why don’t you just speak directly?

400
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:58,280
I will grant your wish if I can.

401
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,740
I haven't changed since I became the King of Andu.

402
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,280
I only wish to treat you well.

403
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,680
I remember you love plum blossoms.

404
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:12,140
But your frail health prevents you from being out in the snow.

405
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:16,920
So I used a charcoal fire to make the first plum blossom of this season bloom.

406
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,240
I wanted to see them with you.

407
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:27,060
Although the scenery is beautiful, the people have changed. Why bother?

408
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:36,420
Jiang Chen, I'll always be your Pei Luo.

409
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,220
A while back, you lost your faith in me.

410
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:44,240
Now, will you give me another chance?

411
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,740
I have fine liquor and good food.

412
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:17,140
I'm definitely going to have those two make peace with each other.

413
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:57,440
Who would have thought that, after we parted ways in heaven, I would run into you here?

414
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,480
Heaven blesses me.

415
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:05,800
This time... let's settle the score in the Mortal Realm.

416
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:19,520
There are traces of spells used here.

417
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,000
If you hadn't stopped us from leaving, Yan Dan wouldn’t have been put in danger.

418
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,940
I won't trouble you to save her this time.

419
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,040
I captured her. Naturally, I’m responsible for her safety.

420
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,000
<i>[Red Bean Cake]</i>

421
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,320
Yan Dan dropped these.

422
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:04,580
Yan Dan, Zhi Xi deliberately left me with my memories, to avenge you.

423
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:09,680
How could she know that you would fall into my hands again?

424
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,780
The position of a superior deity. The love of the emperor.

425
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,300
The suffering of being reincarnated as a mortal.

426
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:21,980
Today, I’ll make you pay for all of them!

427
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,860
Yan Dan! Yan Dan!

428
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,660
She should be around here.

429
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,500
Over there!

430
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,840
It takes only a hundred steps to climb up this tower.

431
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:02,460
But to stand and enjoy the view from here...

432
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:08,080
how many times have we gone through life and death together? It took too much of our time.

433
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,080
It wasn't easy for us to get here.

434
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,240
We must cherish it.

435
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:19,880
You are the only one who wanted all of this.

436
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,540
This is not what I wanted.

437
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,600
- Pei Luo...
- Jiang Chen.

438
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:32,560
Back then, I was so sick. I couldn't even hold an umbrella for you.

439
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,430
But now, I can shelter you from the wind and rain.

440
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:36,910
All of this is thanks to you.

441
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:41,160
If you're willing, this country does not have to be mine alone.

442
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,580
It can be yours too.

443
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:53,100
Jiang Chen, give me a chance.

444
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,720
Let me stay by your side…

445
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,560
and hold the umbrella for you.

446
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:28,390
This is the candle that was lit on our wedding night.

447
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:33,520
When I see it, I am reminded of the happy times we shared that day.

448
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,000
So I've always kept it safe.

449
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:00,840
You once told me that you wanted to grow old with me and have our love engraved in our hearts.

450
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,420
But a mortal doesn’t live long.

451
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,720
We are forgetful.

452
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:09,680
One day, we will forget all of our precious memories.

453
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:16,480
So I made this revolving lantern to light up our memories so we never forget them.

454
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,260
Jiang Chen.

455
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:30,840
I have never forgotten your wish.

456
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,380
A false dream will eventually be shattered!

457
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,880
Why must you still insist on pulling me into one?

458
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,120
Everything you did today was just to force me.

459
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,460
You've never had a change of heart.

460
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:17,980
You could've just told me! Why bother doing all of this?

461
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,580
After everything I’ve done for you…

462
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,780
will you still not agree to it?

463
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,680
All right.

464
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:34,080
At the very least… let's see this dream through.

465
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,840
His Majesty has not seen Consort Jiang Chen in so long.

466
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,700
Why did he suddenly change his mind today?

467
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,940
And he is even making Your Highness prepare the liquor for them!

468
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:01,960
I know what I am doing. Be quiet.

469
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,920
I had this custom-made specifically for you.

470
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:49,160
Will you wear this new costume and perform for me once more?

471
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,600
You don't even enjoy opera.

472
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,200
Why bother with this request?

473
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,200
You involved yourself in power struggles and watched opera performances often.

474
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,960
You only did that to create an illusion of frivolousness and incompetence.

475
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,320
You disguise yourself and deceive others to protect your own interests.

476
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,520
You and I are both well aware of that.

477
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,040
Why must you unveil the truth?

478
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,520
Our love has come to an end.

479
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:27,140
It's time for us to wake up.

480
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,500
I only wish that you could finally shed your mask.

481
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,700
Be sincere with me.

482
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,960
Just like how it was at the beginning.

483
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,620
Jiang Chen.

484
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:46,540
As long as you are willing... we can make our dream last forever.

485
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,580
I have fulfilled your heart's desires one by one.

486
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:52,000
I'll ask you this, one last time.

487
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:57,560
Are you still unwilling… to change your mind for me?

488
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,160
My feelings have never changed.

489
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,460
My choice will remain the same, no matter what.

490
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:09,160
Pei Luo, since you are willing to grant my wish...

491
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,940
will you change for me?

492
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,780
Today, we finally saw each other again.

493
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:35,960
We should enjoy ourselves. Let's avoid unhappy things.

494
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,680
I've prepared your favorite plum wine for you.

495
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:45,260
Tonight, we'll drink freely, to our hearts' content.

496
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:57,420
Drink this... and everything between us will be resolved.

497
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:01,920
You’ll continue to be my most beloved consort.

498
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,740
Pei Luo...

499
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:29,320
Is this really what you want?

500
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,520
Yes.

501
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,760
Your wish...

502
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,060
is my wish.

503
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,680
This is the last time I’ll do something for you.

504
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:59,620
You’ll be satisfied... once I drink this, right?

505
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:09,580
Jiang Chen, you and I should not have come to this.

506
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:12,660
You stopped being Pei Luo a long time ago.

507
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:15,760
You are the King of Andu.

508
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,140
I was wrong.

509
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:26,020
I was wrong from the moment I gave you the elixir!

510
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:29,840
It's my fault.

511
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,420
All of this is my fault!

512
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,220
Be careful, Your Majesty. This demon has revealed her true colors.

513
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,040
After her!

514
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:00,780
