<i>this is my first and last time standing at the Heavenly Gallows for you.</i>

<i>The agarwood ember flickered wearily, and the scattered dust extended boundlessly.</i>

19
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,360
The anguish of my previous life was all in vain...

20
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,710
and my yearning for you...

21
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,280
provided no relief.

22
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:40,440
<i>If I knew it would end like this, I'd preferred for the lotus to not have bloomed.</i>

<i>[500 years ago]</i>

24
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,659
This is the only descendant of the ancient bloodline, the Four-Leaf Lotus.

25
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:11,880
You can't touch it.

26
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,100
Immortal Lord, this looks like an ordinary flower.

27
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,909
- Are you sure it's a panacea?
- Of course.

28
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:21,220
Not only that, these two lotuses sprouted from the same root.

29
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,870
They share mystic power with each other,

30
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,280
so they're even more potent than a normal Four-Leaf Lotus.

31
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,579
Otherwise, why would His Supreme Majesty hold such festivities by the Jade Pool

32
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:36,620
and share this view with those from the Demon, Devil and Underworld Realms?

33
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,240
Star Deity Ji Du.

34
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,800
You are close to Emperor Ying Yuan.

35
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,080
May I know if he will be attending today's festivities?

36
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,219
Emperor Ying Yuan is fond of solitude.

37
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,400
I don't think he will join us.

38
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,020
He's probably playing GO and drinking tea in his palace.

39
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,539
Attention, please! Everyone!

40
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:48,080
In a few days, the Devil King will celebrate his ten thousandth birthday.
<i> (TN: "Devil" - evil creatures; different from demons)</i>

41
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,960
The treasure you have here is a perfect gift from the Divine Realm.

42
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,480
Elder Shuo Hua!

43
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,760
Marshal Huo De.

44
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:13,060
Elder Shuo Hua, though the Devil King is considered a Greater God,

45
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,440
he's only ten thousand years old.

46
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,539
Wait, no... It'll be few days from now.

47
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:24,019
In the Divine Realm, all the superior deities here are older than him.

48
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:27,459
A youngster like him is not old enough to consume such a treasure.

49
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:31,760
What if he becomes ill and he blames it on us?

50
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,780
Do you not agree?

51
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,060
Marshal Huo De!

52
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,060
You are the commander of the immortal army.

53
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:48,440
How dare you disrespect our Devil King with such insolence?

54
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,600
This lotus is mine!

55
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,639
Your Majesty, things have turned grim.

56
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,300
I believe this tea is best for when the Delusion Flower blooms.

57
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,990
<i>Greetings, Your Majesty.</i>

58
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,500
His Supreme Majesty rules the Demon, Devil and Underground Realms with unfairness.

59
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,340
The rules he follows are pedantic and outdated.

60
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,540
The Six Realms should seek a new governor.

61
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:12,059
The Demon and Devil Realms have been unsatisfied for a long time.

62
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:14,740
But they are cowards who don't want to speak up.

63
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,240
They won't fight alongside me!

64
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,700
You are an elder from the Devil Realm, yet you bring dishonor to your realm.

65
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,060
If the Devil clans have any complaints,

66
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,780
the Devil King will come and talk to the Supreme Majesty himself.

67
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:33,210
Unless... Was today's fiasco ordered by the Devil King?

68
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,100
This was my idea.

69
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,560
It has nothing to do with the Devil King.

70
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,400
Do whatever you want with my life.

71
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,060
I will not kill you.

72
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,800
Tell him...

73
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:55,020
that after the War of Genesis, the Six Realms agreed on a peace accord.

74
00:11:55,020 --> 00:12:00,620
The Devil Realm can rebel, but the Divine Realm will continue to do its part.

75
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:06,400
Blood will not be spilled in the Jade Pool nor in the Six Realms.

76
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,000
Well said.

77
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,880
<i>Greetings, Your Supreme Majesty.
(T/N: Addressing the Heavenly Emperor - Ruler of the Heavens)</i>

78
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,560
There are only a small group of rebels in the Six Realms.

79
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,439
I trust that, as long as Emperor Ying Yuan is here,

80
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,820
the Six Realms shall remain at peace.

81
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,199
<i> -We, the Demon Realm...
- And we, the Underworld Realm...</i>

82
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:37,080
<i>swear utmost loyalty to the Divine Realm.</i>

83
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,279
A broken sword, a blooming lotus.

84
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:47,260
This is the proof that the Six Realms have laid down their arms and live in harmony.

85
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:51,159
Today, the lotuses blossomed and took on human forms.

86
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,460
This is a prosperous sign.

87
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:58,040
Emperor Ying Yuan, you saved both of them.

88
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,480
You shall name them.

89
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,420
A garden full of fresh blooms, all focused on two beautiful ladies.

90
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,179
Though many days have passed, her appearance has remained the same.

91
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:21,800
The older sister is Zhi Xi.

92
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,520
A refined, happy face, but harsh brows filled with sadness.

93
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,560
Embellished words lead to emptiness, while simple phrases have deeper meanings.

94
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,340
The younger sister is Yan Dan.

95
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,940
<i>[East Land Hall]</i>

96
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,009
<i>[Five hundred years later]</i>

97
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,890
<i>[Pavilion of Books]</i>

98
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,179
Why are you still on the bed? It's getting late!

99
00:14:58,179 --> 00:15:00,399
Yan Dan! Yan Dan! Get up now.

100
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,959
Hide the divine tools we won.

101
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,220
Your sister is coming for you!

102
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,080
My sister?

103
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,060
Fairy Zhi Xi.
<i>(T/N: "Fairy" - term used to describe a woman of otherworldly beauty)</i>

104
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,679
- Where is Yan Dan?
- She's not here.

105
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,459
As expected of you, you saw through my magic spell right away.

106
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,859
Zhi Xi, shouldn't you be working in the Magical Pavilion now?

107
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,899
Why are you here? What brings you here?

108
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:48,879
Why didn't you take the exam?

109
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,300
Do you want to be a lowly immortal attendant forever?

110
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,160
I didn't mean to offend you.

111
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,600
I understand.

112
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:06,640
I'm from the Merman clan. I consider myself lucky to be able to ascend to divinity and manage this library.

113
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,279
Please continue.

114
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,079
Immortal Lord Bei Ming asked me to get him the "East Sea Aquatic Life Encyclopedia".

115
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,720
I should get going.

116
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,179
Sister, even though you're the deputy curator of the Magical Pavilion,

117
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:24,820
without immortal attendants like me doing the legwork for you, your work will be a lot tougher.

118
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,360
Stop looking for excuses.

119
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,980
Tell me. Why didn't you take the exam?

120
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,140
I'm just not interested in the divine arts.

121
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:37,339
Yan Dan, you need to know that Lu Ming can only be an immortal attendant

122
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:39,719
because he was a demon who achieved divinity.
<i>(TN: "Demon" - born when an organism absorbs spiritual energy and then gains spiritual awareness; not inherently evil)</i>

123
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,409
You're different. You were born a deity.

124
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:44,420
Everyone has high hopes for you.

125
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,079
Besides, you hold far more superior magical talents and spiritual powers.

126
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,039
Can't you put in a little more effort?

127
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:55,539
Do you know? Some busybodies have made a bet regarding this examination.

128
00:16:55,539 --> 00:16:58,600
They all bet that you wouldn't pass the exam.

129
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,420
It's fine. You can represent Four-Leaf Lotus anyway.

130
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,140
You're smart, hardworking, and exceptional.

131
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,960
You have a bright future ahead of you.

132
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,119
You can work hard and then I can use your name to intimidate others.

133
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,860
- Stop playing around.
- I'm serious, Sister. I have made up my mind.

134
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,359
I'm counting on you.

135
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,679
I know you love me the most.

136
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,640
And now, I can just be a carefree immortal attendant.

137
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,719
Fairy Zhi Xi, the assistant of the head of the Magical Pavilion, Bi Yi, is looking for you.

138
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,820
She said it's something regarding the ceremony.

139
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,159
All right. I'll be there.

140
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:38,860
If you're not interested in the Divine Realm, then at least read more books about the divine arts.

141
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,319
All right. It must be something serious. Go back to your work.

142
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,439
We'll talk later.

143
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,079
Don't worry about me. Just go!

144
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,820
That was a close call.

145
00:17:53,920 --> 00:18:00,059
If your sister knows we're the ones who started the bet, will she skin me alive and burn you to ashes?

146
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:01,720
Lower your voice.

147
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,860
What are you doing?

148
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,159
Your divine tool. Take it.

149
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,620
Wait. You can't distribute our winnings like this.

150
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,400
This is too little.

151
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,879
Too little?

152
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,780
I only got these divine tools because I was shameless.

153
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,500
Fine.

154
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,680
By the way, do you want to watch the Star Catching Ceremony?

155
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,039
What is that?

156
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,940
It's the ascension ceremony the Magical Pavilion is in charge of.

157
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,039
You were born at an unfortunate timing, so you missed it.

158
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,359
This ceremony takes place every five hundred years.

159
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:57,359
All deities will gather by the Heavenly Corner and receive divine blessings from the four Emperors.

160
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,119
I heard the view is breathtakingly beautiful.

161
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,359
That's why the low-ranking immortal attendants call it the Star Catching Ceremony.

162
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,620
It sounds interesting. I think it'll be fun.

163
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,679
Do you have a way to smuggle me there?

164
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,499
Smuggle you in there? Impossible.

165
00:19:14,499 --> 00:19:16,039
Heavenly Corner is heavily guarded.

166
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,140
Lowly immortal attendants like us cannot enter at all.

167
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,880
We have to find another way.

168
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,220
Congratulations on becoming the Deputy Curator, Sister Zhi Xi.

169
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,499
You are the youngest divine official in the Nine Heavens now!

170
00:19:40,499 --> 00:19:43,479
Indeed. Fairy Ying Deng, the incumbent curator of the Magical Pavilion,

171
00:19:43,479 --> 00:19:47,279
only became Deputy Curator at eight hundred years of age.

172
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,959
You flatter me.

173
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,700
It is through sheer luck that I am where I am now.

174
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,180
Curator, everything is ready.

175
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,620
Stand guard over there.

176
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,500
Curator, that's too far away.

177
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,340
I will miss the view of the Emperor's blessings.

178
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:46,019
Heavenly Corner is only accessible to those ready for ascension.

179
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:48,639
If Magical Pavilion wasn't in charge of the lanterns,

180
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,900
a lowly deity like you could never be here.

181
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:57,240
You are undeserving of His Majesty's magnificence.

182
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,820
I understand.

183
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,660
I will do as I was told.

184
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,060
Isn't this Merfolk Orb the treasure of your clan?

185
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,400
Why can't you project anything with it?

186
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,039
Don't tell me your spiritual power is that weak.

187
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,499
I stole it from my father, and this is my first time using it.

188
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:32,599
Be patient.

189
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,060
It's almost the twelfth hour. In another fifteen minutes, the Star Catching Ceremony will be over!

190
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,719
Forget it. Let's try it together.

191
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,459
- Sure.
- Come on.

192
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,200
There it is!

193
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,900
Emperor Ying Yuan's back!

194
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,679
That's all?

195
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,000
Your treasure is worthless!

196
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,359
I could barely see anything.

197
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,460
I expended a lot of power for nothing.

198
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,759
At least we saw Emperor Ying Yuan's back.

199
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,319
It wasn't a worthless endeavor.

200
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,299
Indeed. Emperor Ying Yuan's back looks majestic.

201
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:21,359
I wish I could serve him in his palace.

202
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,039
In the Nine Heavens, there are thirty-six palaces.

203
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,660
Emperor Ying Yuan's Yanxu Heavenly Palace

204
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,279
is the hardest to get into, surpassing His Supreme Majesty's Yuqing Palace.

205
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,099
In that case, the one in charge of post delegation will be very happy.

206
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:37,780
Many deities will give her gifts.

207
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,140
Wrong.

208
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:42,959
Any staff changes within Yanxu Heavenly Palace need Emperor Ying Yuan's approval.

209
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:45,240
Not anyone can join.

210
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,180
This emperor sure is troublesome.

211
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,019
He behaves all mighty just because he has immense divine power.

212
00:22:51,019 --> 00:22:53,039
There are only six Greater Gods,

213
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,759
His Supreme Majesty, the Four Emperors, and the Devil King.

214
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,759
Emperor Ying Yuan is a one-man army.

215
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,619
For a millennium, the Devil Realm dared not step out of the line because of him.

216
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:05,619
Five centuries ago, if it wasn't for him, you and Zhi Xi would have been killed by the Devils.

217
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:07,519
He's your savior.

218
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,019
How can you forgo your good conscience and call him a villain?

219
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:10,999
Exactly.

220
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,540
I... Either way,

221
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,040
I don't like him.

222
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,879
Emperor Ying Yuan is a recluse.

223
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:23,079
Other than the ones close to him, not many outsiders can catch a glimpse of him.

224
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:26,039
Yan Dan, what does he look like?

225
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,759
<i>The Jade Pool was our home.</i>

226
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,460
<i>Where are we going to stay from now on?</i>

227
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,319
<i>Sister, we have human forms now.</i>

228
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:40,660
<i>We can't stay in the pool anymore.</i>

229
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,920
<i>We’ll need to ask him where our future home is.</i>

230
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,380
<i>The Four-Leaf Lotus holds immense mystical power.</i>

231
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,819
<i>If a pair of twins were born from it, one must be stronger than the other. </i>

232
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,939
<i>You're the weaker one. That’s why you were injured by the Devils' sword.</i>

233
00:24:03,939 --> 00:24:05,959
<i>Head to the Heavenly Infirmary to stabilize your condition.</i>

234
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,240
<i>Do not delay your treatment.</i>

235
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,960
<i> Our Divine Family is concerned about your personal training.</i>

236
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,760
<i>Your hard work will shape your future.</i>

237
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,079
<i>Do not feel defeated.</i>

238
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,559
<i>Zhi Xi is not weak.</i>

239
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,319
<i>When we were still lotuses, she shielded me from the rain and wind.</i>

240
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:23,279
<i>How can you criticize her so nonchalantly?</i>

241
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,220
<i>Apologize to her now!</i>

242
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,580
<i> You're a bad person!</i>

243
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,759
I had just transformed into a human form back then.

244
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,260
I saw him once and... never again.

245
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,060
I can't possibly remember how he looked!

246
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,279
Also, the rules here have outlawed romantic pursuits.

247
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,199
You should give up now.

248
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,700
You can't do anything, no matter how perfect he is.

249
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,679
The younger one is lazy, and the older one uses her position for personal gains.

250
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,800
You two sure have drawn a lot of attention in the Nine Heavens.

251
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,919
Yan Dan has always been serious with her work at Immortal Lord Bei Ming's Xuanxin Cliff.

252
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:52,460
She has never made a mistake.

253
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:56,479
Though she might not be powerful, she has a pure heart and an honest personality.

254
00:25:56,479 --> 00:25:58,199
She is not like what you said.

255
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,159
I do not mind whatever you say about me.

256
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,559
However, you have no right to criticize my sister.

257
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:07,519
Just because you're the deputy curator now doesn't mean you can speak to me in this tone.

258
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:14,580
If Si Xuan hadn't disobeyed the rules, you wouldn't have had this position even after another five centuries.

259
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:18,260
Curator Si Xuan has always been magnanimous.

260
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,900
She looked after you too.

261
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,520
Yet, you reported her for committing romantic pursuits.

262
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,440
You have taken over her position now.

263
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,519
I wonder how you can sleep soundly at night.

264
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,439
She behaved untowardly and violated the Heavenly Rules.

265
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,840
It is only natural for me to take her position.

266
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,980
Even if you don't like it, you still have to deal with it.

267
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,079
I am now the Curator of the Magical Pavilion,

268
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,540
and you are just an assistant, without any divine rank.

269
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:51,640
Also, I was the candle wick on His Supreme Majesty's desk in my previous life.

270
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,520
When I achieved divinity,

271
00:26:54,520 --> 00:27:00,460
Emperor Ying Yuan placed this divine headpiece personally on me.

272
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,460
This is our main difference.

273
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:13,780
You do not deserve any of his blessings, even these objects as tiny as dust.

274
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,360
Discard its contents.

275
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,040
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

276
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,300
It is a waste to leave this divine dust on the ground.

277
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,260
It must be tough for them to stand guard here for a night.

278
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:46,059
Collecting some of them as a souvenir is not a horrible crime.

279
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,060
Your Majesty.

280
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:52,320
The Heavenly Rules state that we should devote ourselves to our positions.

281
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,340
The fairies should perform their duties with integrity.

282
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:59,000
I am her superior, so I was merely disciplining my subordinate.

283
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,799
I was not trying to give her a hard time.

284
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:05,420
The Heavenly Rules do not state that working fairies are not allowed to collect divine dust.

285
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,060
So there's no need to be hypercritical.

286
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,100
Yes.

287
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,520
I understand, Your Majesty.

288
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,199
<i>Why did the same legend lead to two different outcomes?</i>

289
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,239
<i>One became an important official looking after the divine treasures,</i>

290
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,099
<i>while the other became a lowly maid for Immortal Lord Bei Ming!</i>

291
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,060
Zhi Xi!

292
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,759
What is this? It's so beautiful.

293
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:05,400
After the ceremony, I saw some uncollected starry dust.

294
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,280
I collected them in a bottle and secretly brought them to you.

295
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,879
Zhi Xi, you spoil me.

296
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:12,119
You're my sister.

297
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,039
If not you, who else should I spoil?

298
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,979
You must be exhausted. Sit down and rest.

299
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,239
How did it go today?

300
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,439
I saw the Four Emperors.

301
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,440
And then?

302
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,980
I really want to be as powerful as they are.

303
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:30,859
<i>I hope that, during my ascension, Emperor Ying Yuan can place the divine headpiece on me.</i>

304
00:29:30,859 --> 00:29:33,479
Zhi Xi, I’ve faith in you.

305
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,199
You're a Four-Leaf Lotus.

306
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,220
When you were born, His Supreme Majesty said you were a good sign.

307
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:41,359
Don't you know? You set an example for all fairies.

308
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,120
From the moment you were born, everyone has been singing your praises.

309
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,480
And you? What is your dream?

310
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,819
You know it already. I like to read and write.

311
00:29:54,819 --> 00:29:59,720
If possible, I want to be the best author in the Six Realms.

312
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,479
I hope I can perform my shows in the Divine and Mortal Realms!

313
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:05,399
I hope everyone will like it!

314
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,340
They will.

315
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:15,540
Yan Dan. Before we can ascend, you know

316
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:19,840
we will have to head to the Mortal Realm to go through the Eight Hardships.

317
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,400
But I’ve never left the Nine Heavens.

318
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,380
I'm a little worried.

319
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,120
Zhi Xi, don't worry.

320
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,880
I'm here.

321
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,220
I'm not scared because I have to protect you forever.

322
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,200
<i>[Xuanxin Cliff]</i>

323
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,939
<i>Someone always flips the divine tortoise in Xuanxin Cliff every day.</i>

324
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,519
<i>But we could never catch the culprit.</i>

325
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,320
<i>Could it be him?</i>

326
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:06,400
<i>[Xuanxin Cliff]</i>

327
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,180
You criminal!

328
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,840
<i>He looks familiar. Have I met him before?</i>

329
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,939
You insolent man! Which palace do you belong to?

330
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:41,840
How dare you flip the divine tortoise of Xuanxin Cliff!

331
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,876
Why?

332
00:31:42,877 --> 00:31:47,359
You dare to pull this prank, but you don't dare tell me your name and title?

333
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,040
Are you running away?

334
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,279
His face and his back look so familiar.

335
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:02,359
I feel like I’ve seen him somewhere, but I can't recall it.

336
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,759
Immortal Lord! Immortal Lord!

337
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,120
I found the one who flips the tortoise!

338
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,180
Where is he?

339
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:29,999
He escaped. But I almost caught his sleeves.

340
00:32:29,999 --> 00:32:36,100
If you were more powerful, you could have arrested him.

341
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,280
I know you're mocking me for not being powerful.

342
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,319
But think about it. If I was powerful,

343
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:48,010
I would be in the Magical Pavilion now, and no one would feed your fish in Xuanxin Cliff.

344
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,020
If you catch him,

345
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:56,590
I will lend you my precious copy of the play, “Four Riverside Dreams.”

346
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,320
What do you think?

347
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,659
Immortal Lord. Can I take your word for it?

348
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:05,660
Have some mandarins.

349
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,999
Careful!

350
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,420
I'm solving a GO game!

351
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,799
What GO game is this?

352
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,239
You look stumped.

353
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,959
It's all because of Emperor Ying Yuan.

354
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,599
He made this Six Crown Puzzle.

355
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,420
And for the love of my life, I cannot solve it.

356
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,840
Immortal Lord.

357
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:29,760
If I solve it, will you do me a favor?

358
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,239
You can solve it?

359
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,260
I can try.

360
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,410
Even though it's called "Six Crown Puzzle,"

361
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:45,760
it's actually just a Triple Crown with hidden triple cycles.

362
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,470
Hitting it head on will be useless.

363
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:51,600
Using the knight to seal off the exit will solve it.

364
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,940
Try it.

365
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,460
Use the knight to seal off the exit...

366
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,969
I see. Wonderful!

367
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,429
Look at you, child.

368
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:18,600
You're good for nothing except for GO.

369
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,210
Is that supposed to be a compliment?

370
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,140
Can I hold you to your words then?

371
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:33,100
As long as you can help me solve Ying Yuan's puzzle every day, anything else is negotiable.

372
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,340
No problem.

373
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:39,239
I want to come earlier every day and leave early. Is that all right with you?

374
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,399
Sure.

375
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,679
You don't need to feed the other immortal beasts.

376
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:48,379
Feeding the aquatic life on this cliff will be enough. All right?

377
00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:51,540
Immortal Lord. You're the kindest of them all!

378
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,680
Let me give you a massage.

379
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,480
- Enough.
- You're so kind.

380
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,540
- That's enough.
- The most generous one.

381
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:03,420
<i>This self-taught, intelligent fairy is indeed a rare gem.</i>

382
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,420
<i>Unfortunately, she's too impulsive.</i>

383
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:10,720
<i>If someone can guide and mentor her, she will become a great talent in the future.</i>

384
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,520
When did you become this hardworking?

385
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,580
I know I'm not the chosen one.

386
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:35,360
But the chosen one will protect me.

387
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,880
Therefore, I'm still a winner.

388
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,860
Who will protect you?

389
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,319
Zhi Xi, my sister.

390
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,039
She will take the ascension examination soon.

391
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,660
Knowing her power, she'll pass it with flying colors.

392
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:49,200
However, after she passes it, she will have to go through hardships in the Mortal Realm.

393
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,359
I heard the best performer at the Jade Pool Festivial can ask a favor of His Supreme Majesty.

394
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:57,599
I'm planning to write a show-stopping script.

395
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,559
And then I'll ask His Supreme Majesty to allow me to endure the hardships on Zhi Xi's behalf.

396
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,380
Are you a fool?

397
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:06,199
The hardships are challenging trials.

398
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,799
Many have failed to come back.

399
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,319
Of course, I know that.

400
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,680
If it was easy, why would I go to such lengths?

401
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,859
All right. Eat this.

402
00:36:17,859 --> 00:36:21,100
In another four hours, you have to work at Xuanxin Cliff.

403
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,000
Oh, right.

404
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,080
Tomorrow, you will help me get "The Four Riverside Dreams."

405
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,120
Aren't I a genius?

406
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,519
We'll hide in Xuanxin Cliff later.

407
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:45,880
When the Tortoise-Flipping Man appears and flips the tortoise, he'll touch my thread.

408
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,039
And then, we'll gang up on him.

409
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,180
I don't believe I can't handle him!

410
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,959
Are you sure this will work?

411
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,119
Of course!

412
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,119
We just need to lie in wait now.

413
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,540
Let's go!

414
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,940
- Hurry up!
- Careful!

415
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,359
Didn't we tie a thread to it?

416
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,599
Why weren't we alerted when he appeared?

417
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,419
I know, right? How is that possible?

418
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,520
<i>[Stupid]</i>

419
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,300
This evil tortoise-flipping man!

420
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:56,240
I swear on my name that I'll get you!

421
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,300
Move aside!

422
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,000
Shi Yun.

423
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,740
Yan Dan, have you caught the Tortoise-Flipping Man?

424
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:12,080
Next time, I will.

425
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,300
What is this?

426
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,819
When did Immortal Lord Bei Ming keep a green snake and a white snake?

427
00:38:21,819 --> 00:38:24,979
They are not snakes. They are dragons.

428
00:38:24,979 --> 00:38:28,679
The silver one is the son of the East Sea Dragon King, Crown Prince Ao Xuan.

429
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:32,319
The green one is the Princess of South Sea Dragon Clan, Zhao Lan.

430
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:38,099
The Dragon Clan likes the richness of the divine energy here, so they sent their offspring here.

431
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,340
I really can't tell that they are dragons.

432
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,740
Little friends.

433
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,659
What on earth? He bit me!

434
00:38:52,659 --> 00:38:55,239
You... How can you toss him away like that?

435
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,519
Isn't he a dragon? And it's the lotus pond.

436
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,380
He should survive, right?

437
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,820
<i>Did this fish die because of the silver dragon?</i>

438
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,279
I found him.

439
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,700
I found Ao Xuan!

440
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,400
Awesome, you're awesome.

441
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,800
Shi Yun, look.

442
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:44,000
Why do I feel like this black fish is looking at me with hatred?

443
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,959
Impossible. It's just a fish.

444
00:39:46,959 --> 00:39:49,220
It can't have facial expressions like humans.

445
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,960
That's right.

446
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,860
I'm sorry for what happened.

447
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,820
Good thing I'm full of medicinal values.

448
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:04,380
If I did cause you to pass out just now, I apologize.

449
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,360
And you're still glaring at me!

450
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:14,359
Not only are you black in color, but your heart is also black.

451
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:16,960
I just saved you, all right?

452
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,259
Once you turn into a human, I'll teach you how to be a decent human.

453
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,999
I thought you don't like to learn divine arts.

454
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,159
What changed your mind?

455
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:44,359
To catch that evil Tortoise-Flipping Man, I have to learn some divine arts.

456
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:46,599
I'll get you "Introduction to Divine Arts" then.

457
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,559
It will teach you basic divine arts.

458
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,440
It's perfect for you.

459
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,960
But you have to be patient and study little by little.

460
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,020
Thanks, Sister!

461
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,060
What's the matter?

462
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,080
His Majesty adores this Jade Belt.

463
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,100
What should we do?

464

♫ <i> I still have an image of you imprinted in my mind even after washing away the fine dust </i> ♫

472
00:42:55,810 --> 00:43:02,040
♫ <i> Life after life, this is the longing I missed the most</i> ♫

473
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:09,820
♫ <i> You are the breeze of a fallen flower in the world of flowers adding to the mound of fallen flowers </i> ♫

474
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:16,130
♫ <i> Will you shed tears over the truth of the mortal world? </i> ♫

475
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:23,950
♫ <i> You're like the unattainable Autumn Moon in the vast sky, don't dare to shine bright yet not hesitate to shine </i>♫

476
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:32,350
♫ <i> In my dream, the one I loved is with me </i> ♫

477
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:52,210
♫ <i> After bidding farewell, when Spring becomes Autumn, where can I find my heart in this world? </i> ♫

478
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:58,410
♫ <i> Several lifetimes will not be enough for our parting </i> ♫

479
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:06,360
♫ <i> As I watch lovers enjoying fireworks on the riverbanks, my love and longing for you makes my pain unbearable </i> ♫

480
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:13,420
♫ <i> There will be a time when the world is beautiful </i> ♫

481
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:21,140
♫ <i> When the lotus blossoms again, you and I will be together </i> ♫
