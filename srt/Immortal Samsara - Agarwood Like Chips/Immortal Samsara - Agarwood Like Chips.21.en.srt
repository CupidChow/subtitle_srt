00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,000
Mountain Chief, what's wrong?

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,400
Let me take you back to the mountain.

17
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,200
I'm fine.

18
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,200
I'm guessing you were too busy and didn't look hard enough.

19
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,100
Promise me. Even if you have to turn the place upside down, you have to find her.

20
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,200
I beg you. Please.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,700
Yes.

22
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,300
Yelan Mountain got a new chief, and Yu Mo found the love of his life.

23
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,900
This is one good thing after another!

24
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,100
For today's welcome dance, make sure you give it your all!

25
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,300
I am telling you,

26
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,200
that flower demon lady will be Mountain Chief's future wife.

27
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,200
Let her experience our hospitality!

28
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,500
- Do you hear me?
<i> - Yes! We hear you!</i>

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The Mountain Chief is here!

30
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,000
<i>Lovely flowers under a full moon, wishing you two happiness.</i>

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,200
<i>Two mandarin ducks playing in the water, hoping your love lasts forever.</i>

32
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:35,000
<i>We don't ask for money, because love is more solid than gold and the envy of the immortals!</i>

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,000
What's wrong with Mountain Chief?

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,700
Did your bride run away?

35
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,800
Why do you look so weak?

36
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,000
Did you get ambushed?

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,400
No.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,200
Your internal strength is weak. Your meridians are a mess.

39
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,400
Where's your Extraordinary Eye?

40
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,800
Quick! Use it to cure yourself.

41
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,600
I lost it.

42
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:06,700
When you were at the troupe, you took the Extraordinary Eye and gave it away as a dowry, didn't you?

43
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,100
How could you be so foolish?

44
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,200
Now you've lost two things at once!

45
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,500
I want to be alone for awhile.

46
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,400
What is the matter with Mountain Chief?

47
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,300
He's heartbroken.

48
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,500
He gave her the Extraordinary Eye and she still refused to come back with him.

49
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,000
Mountain Chief Zi Lin, Flower Spirit Clan is here to present a gift.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,200
They are already at the foot of the mountain.

51
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,000
Other than elixirs and divine tools, they brought a lot of beautiful ladies too.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,600
Mountain Chief Yu Mo is not looking well.

53
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,200
Do you think he wants to meet the beautiful ladies?

54
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,600
His former wife is from Flower Spirit Clan.

55
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,500
If we told him to pick another beauty right now, it'll only sadden him more.

56
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,000
I am afraid that it will make things worse.

57
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,300
But it is all right. We are good brothers.

58
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,200
When it comes to this, I can do it on his behalf!

59
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,500
Bai Piaoliang. How is it going?

60
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,300
Is Zi Teng done yet?

61
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,400
Leader, as the saying goes, people have three urgencies.
<i>(T/N: to pee, poop, and fart)</i>

62
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,000
Judging by how Miss Zi Teng is doing, I don't think she will be done soon.

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,400
We need to give her some time.

64
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,400
You...

65
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,300
If she doesn't come out soon, I'll hang myself on this crooked tree!

66
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,400
Please don't.

67
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,200
You'll be even more embarrassed if she came out now.

68
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,800
Don't you have seven other ladies from Flower Spirit Clan?

69
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,600
One less person won't affect anything.

70
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,400
There's still a glimmer of hope for Flower Spirit Clan!

71
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,800
How could we do that?

72
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,700
I submitted the gift list a long time ago!

73
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:43,600
Eight beauties. How am I supposed to explain this if there is one missing?

74
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,000
Leader, do not worry.

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,800
There's always a road in front of a mountain. Everything will be all right!

76
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,500
There is always a way out!

77
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,000
Mountain Chief Zi Lin has arrived!

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Greetings, Mountain Chief.

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,800
I am sorry that you came at the wrong time today.

80
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,200
The other Mountain Chief is currently cultivating in seclusion.

81
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,500
I had no choice but to receive you on my own.

82
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,200
<i> Enemies on a narrow road.
(T/N: encountering someone you don't want to see)</i>

83
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,000
<i>Isn't he the stupid tortoise who called me ugly?</i>

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Mountain Chief Zi Lin is too humble.

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,500
Prison Lizard harmed people inside and outside of the mountain.

86
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,800
We owe it to the two brave mountain chiefs, who brought peace to the Demon Clans.

87
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,600
It's for this reason that the entire Flower Spirit Clan is very grateful.

88
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,000
To celebrate the Mountain Chiefs' ascension to the throne, on behalf of Flower Spirit Clan,

89
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I am here to present the treasure of our clan, the Yanbi Pill.

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,600
This pill has condensed demon power. It can eliminate the yin and enhance the qi.

91
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,100
It is the perfect pill for one who is cultivating.

92
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,300
Mountain Chief, these eight ladies are the most beautiful in Flower Spirit Clan.

93
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,300
If you like any of these ladies, you can keep them as your maid or servant.

94
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,400
It is their honor to be able to serve you.

95
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,600
This is Wan Yan, a chrysanthemum demon.

96
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,300
This is Zi'e, a plum demon.

97
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,800
The rose demon, Leng Xiang.

98
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
This is a lotus demon.

99
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,400
Bai Piaoliang, what are you doing?

100
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,900
I need to use the washroom. E-Excuse me.

101
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,800
The ugly woman who stole my horse! Stop!

102
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,500
How dare you steal my horse? Ugly woman!

103
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,500
Which part of her is ugly?

104
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,960
I think she's quite eye-catching.

105
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,100
Buddy, who are you?

106
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,900
<i>The Water of Forgetfulness really did make you forget everything.</i>

107
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,300
Yu Mo, are you blind?

108
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,800
Isn't this the young man who nearly knocked my carriage over?

109
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,600
You are being rude. He is the other mountain chief of Yelan Mountain.

110
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,800
<i>Greetings, Mountain Chief.</i>

111
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,800
<i>Mountain Chief? He's the halfwit who stood in our way?</i>

112
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,900
M-Mountain Chief?

113
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,000
I remember you. I was in the carriage that day.

114
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,600
You knocked our carriage over with your horse.

115
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,000
I almost returned to my real form because of you!

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,800
Really? What a coincidence. What should we do about it?

117
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,000
If that's true, I guess fate has brought us together. Why don't you let me stay here?

118
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,100
Then you can compensate me for the injury you caused. What do you think?

119
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,400
It would be my pleasure. Does that make you happy?

120
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,800
Then... do you want to stay in my arms for a little longer?

121
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,200
No need. No need.

122
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,200
Lotus Spirit Bai Piaoliang,

123
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,700
hurry and show your gratitude.

124
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,000
It's fine.

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,500
I do not like the name "Bai Piaoliang." It doesn't sound good.

126
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,800
Why don't we change it?

127
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,200
So close, yet so far... searching for my old love.

128
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,000
Only writing about my deep love.

129
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,400
"Yan Dan." What do you think?

130
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,100
"Yan Dan"?

131
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,400
"Yan," as in "cheeky". "Dan," as in "simple."

132
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,700
This name suits me pretty well!

133
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,900
I now understand why they say heartbroken people are desperate.

134
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,300
It feels nice having the right person to back you up.

135
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,400
What are you all doing? What are you doing?

136
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,700
Your skin is so thick and rough.

137
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,700
If we don't give you a proper scrub, how can you spend the first night with Mountain Chief?

138
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,600
No! No! No! Spend a night with him? What are you saying?

139
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,400
Your Mountain Chief said I am here to recuperate.

140
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,800
My body isn't for sale!

141
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,200
That's not up to you!

142
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,700
However, the Mountain Chief has been a little ill lately.

143
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:27,800
When you see him later, you have to remind him to take the Yanbi Pill the Flower Spirit Clan gave him.

144
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,500
Yanbi Pill?

145
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,200
We left it by his bed.

146
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,400
You mustn't forget!

147
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,100
Give Miss Yan Dan a good bath. Get to work!

148
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,600
No, no. Wait. Wait a minute.

149
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,800
Let's talk this out!

150
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,100
Keep scrubbing!

151
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,300
Stop pushing me. I can walk myself!

152
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,500
Mountain Chief？

153
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,900
Mountain Chief？

154
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,500
<i>He is just ill. He won't die from it, will he?</i>

155
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,000
<i>But ugliness will kill me.</i>

156
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,600
<i>However, I am just an attendant.</i>

157
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,800
<i>Is it too much for me to take my master's pill?</i>

158
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,000
Mountain Chief.

159
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Did you want to use this Yanbi Pill to cover the green spots on your face?

160
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,400
To be honest, you are pretty the way you are.

161
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,200
It is not that. Mountain Chief, this is a misunderstanding.

162
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,200
To me, being ugly isn't all that important.

163
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,400
I'm just afraid I might embarrass you when we go out together in the future.

164
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,600
I can tell that you are very weak right now, and you really need this pill.

165
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
I am not weak.

166
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,800
Of course, you are not. But I shouldn't just take advantage of you.

167
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,400
You are my concubine. Isn't it normal for me to give you a present?

168
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,800
About this concubine thing... You've misunderstood.

169
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,900
I was there to replace someone.

170
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,300
I am just a demon who recently arrived in Mortal Realm.

171
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,100
I know nothing about love.

172
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,900
In my current state, I can't marry anyone.

173
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,000
All right.

174
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,300
If you want to get out of this marriage arrangement, then the Yanbi Pill—

175
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,000
The Yanbi Pill... really is something I need.

176
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,740
Mountain Chief. Look.

177
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,600
You are a hero. You are always surrounded by beautiful women.

178
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:37,480
Instead of marrying an unwilling concubine like me, how about making me your loyal attendant? Does that sound good?

179
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,100
What?

180
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,520
I'm the Mountain Chief, and you are my attendant?

181
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,700
I can be a general, too!

182
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,360
Liu Bei was assisted by Zhu Geliang. You can have a sidekick too!
<i> (T/N: Zhu Geliang was warlord Liu Bei’s war advisor and right hand man in the Three Kingdoms period) </i>

183
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,020
But everyone on the mountain knows about our marriage.

184
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,020
How will we explain this to them?

185
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,220
That is easy to solve.

186
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,140
Only Heaven and Earth, and you and I will know.

187
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,960
If you still can't rest assured...

188
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,640
I can sign a contract with you.

189
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,580
Then how long will the contract last?

190
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,800
<i>It'll make me look insincere if the time is too short, which would ruin the deal.</i>

191
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,760
<i>But if it's too high, I'll have promised too much of myself.</i>

192
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,300
- What about a hundred years?
- It's a deal.

193
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,920
He agreed that quickly?

194
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,960
I must have made it too high!

195
00:12:27,517 --> 00:12:29,575
<i>[Contract]</i>

196
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,120
You have signed the contract and left your fingerprint.

197
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,320
You have to listen to me from now on.

198
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,520
Otherwise, this Yanbi Pill—

199
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,340
Understood. Understood.

200
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,180
But I think you really do look kind of weak.

201
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,840
I'm not weak!

202
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,300
How strong?

203
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,200
I know of a way to recuperate. Are you interested?

204
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,920
What is it?

205
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,660
What are you doing?

206
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,840
All of Yelan Mountain belongs to me now. I am the Mountain Chief.

207
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,240
Do I really need to sneak around to eat some late-night snacks?

208
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,860
You don't understand. We are doing this for the excitement.

209
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,320
Let me, the attendant, teach you how to enjoy life.

210
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,800
Let's go!

211
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,220
<i>Yan Dan, you had a tough time in Heavenly Realm. It isn't a bad thing to have forgotten all of it.</i>

212
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:44,040
<i>Now that you are in the Mortal Realm, whether you understand it or not, it's fine.</i>

213
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,330
<i>All I want is to protect you so that you can live a happy life.</i>

214
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:52,430
<i>Whatever happens, I will be there for you. You can always take shelter behind me.</i>

215
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,660
<i>No one will ever lay a finger on you.</i>

216
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,160
<i>All the eggs in the Nine Heavens are laid by divine chickens.</i>

217
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,260
<i>It's very good for your immortal spirit. Are you sure you don't want to eat it?</i>

218
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,880
<i>I still won't eat it. I said I won't eat—</i>

219
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,360
<i>Hesitating? Then we're doing it the hard way.</i>

220
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,180
<i>I told you...</i>

221
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,060
<i>This tastes great!</i>

222
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,040
What's the matter? Don't you like it?

223
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,540
I like it.

224
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:35,260
The late night snacks you make are my favorite.

225
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,860
What is this? Is it a seal?

226
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,040
As long as I'm alive, it will glow.

227
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,100
I promise that I will always keep you safe, as long as I'm alive.

228
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,700
From now on, I will take care of you.

229
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,000
From now on, this mountain will be your home.

230
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,860
- All right?
- Of course!

231
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,120
It is a huge bargain for me!

232
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,320
From now on, you are my master.

233
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,180
And I am Lian, your dear attendant for 100 years.
<i>(T/N "Lian" means "lotus")</i>

234
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,420
All right.

235
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,760
During these 100 years, if there's anything you wish for, just tell me.

236
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,140
I can help you fulfill all of them.

237
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,340
I don't think you can fulfill my wishes.

238
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:49,220
My biggest dream is to be the best novelist in the world.

239
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,160
However, according to my friend, I haven't seen enough of the world.

240
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,140
I have to travel to all the corners of the world, experience the Five Sufferings of the mortal world,

241
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,620
the Six Delusions, Seven Emotions, and Eight Hardships.
<i>(T/N: Six Delusions: desire , detestation , delusion , pride , doubt , and evil views)</i>

242
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,590
When I finally understand what human nature is, I can write a moving story.

243
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,820
Although I can't be the pen in your hand,

244
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:12,070
showing you the mortal world and experiencing different events in life... that's not hard at all.

245
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,400
Are you really willing to do that?

246
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,020
Of course, I am.

247
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,750
This is what I want to do most, in my life.

248
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:23,690
When I recover from my injury, you and I will leave the mountain and travel the world.

249
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,720
We will do one good deed every day.

250
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,120
Then you'll always have new stories to write about in your books.

251
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,940
All right. Great!

252
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,120
"So close, yet so far, searching for my old love."

253
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,320
"Only writing about my deep love."

254
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,940
Yan Dan.

255
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,520
Do you understand?

256
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,050
I do.

257
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:54,120
<i>"So close, yet so far, searching for my old love. Only writing about my deep love."</i>

258
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,320
<i>The old love he is talking about is definitely the flower demon who took the Extraordinary Eye from him.</i>

259
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,810
<i>He is the master of the mountain,</i>

260
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,940
<i>but he failed to win the heart of the girl he loves.</i>

261
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,280
<i>One of the Eight Hardships is not getting what you wish for.</i>

262
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,850
<i>It seems like demons are not spared from this either.</i>

263
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,000
I understand!

264
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,760
You don't understand.

265
00:17:26,326 --> 00:17:29,650
<i>[Lingxiao Sect]</i>

266
00:17:30,264 --> 00:17:31,600
<i>[Get Rid of the Evil Demons]</i>

267
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,775
<i>[Eliminate Demons and Devils]</i>

268
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,940
It's the Lingxiao Sect's duty to get rid of demons and protect the people.

269
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,480
Madams, there is no need to thank us.

270
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,700
My daughter was possessed by a cat demon.

271
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,520
It's all thanks to Taoist Master Tang Zhou that our family was reunited.

272
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,160
If it wasn't for Taoist Master Tang Zhou, our family's field would probably still be occupied by rat demons.

273
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,960
I had to come here to thank you personally.

274
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,240
But where is Taoist Master Tang Zhou?

275
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,280
Madams, what has actually brought you here?

276
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,160
Why don't you be direct?

277
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,290
I am embarrassed by what my daughter has done.

278
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:15,240
After Taoist Master Tang got rid of the demon power in her, she fell in love with him at first sight.

279
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,660
She said she would only marry him and no one else!

280
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,140
It is the same thing with my daughter.

281
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,290
I know the rules of the Lingxiao Sect.

282
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,980
The chief must practice celibacy.

283
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,140
However, that rule doesn't apply to the other disciples of the sect.

284
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,880
I heard that Tang Zhou is approaching his twenties, but he isn't betrothed to anyone yet.

285
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,440
So I've brought my daughter's birth date with me.
<i>(T/N: for zodiac compatibility)</i>

286
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,640
I did so too. We must see Taoist Master Tang today.

287
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,040
We want to share our gratitude with him. Chief, please do not turn us away.

288
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:53,360
Despite Tang Zhou being in his current state, you are still so kind to him.

289
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,620
I am grateful beyond words. Why would I turn you away?

290
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,620
Taoist Master Tang Zhou, he...

291
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,280
Tang Zhou has been diagnosed with smallpox.

292
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,900
If there really is a woman who wants to marry him and take good care of him,

293
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,480
then I will honor my late senior brother.

294
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,920
Well...

295
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,840
Sect Leader.

296
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,300
Sect Leader, have the madams left?

297
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,340
They have.

298
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,340
You are approaching your twentieth birthday.

299
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,600
There are more and more people visiting us, hoping to marry their daughters to you.

300
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,520
According to the sect's rules, the sect leader's successor must practice celibacy.

301
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,160
Fortunately, all you want is to cultivate, instead of being in a romantic relationship.

302
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,660
I am very glad about that.

303
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:48,620
However, there is no need to lie about having smallpox or tuberculosis, jinxing yourself.

304
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,420
Sect Leader, Lingxiao Sect's duty is to eliminate demons and devils.

305
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,420
We fear nothing.

306
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:58,300
Since I am already lying, of course, I need to lie effectively.

307
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,280
Sect Leader...

308
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,020
There is something I want to ask you.

309
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,580
This year is the tenth anniversary of Master's passing. I will leave the mountain to travel the world.

310
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,880
I won't be able to visit his grave and pay respects.

311
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,020
I will ask you to burn this on my behalf, Sect Leader.

312
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,420
I will definitely take care of it.

313
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:27,580
Senior Brother didn't put his hopes on the wrong person. You also didn't let him down.

314
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,540
This is your first time leaving the mountain. Take good care of yourself.

315
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,920
I will.

316
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,120
By the way, Sect Leader...

317
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:42,920
I... I have another question to ask you.

318
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:53,860
I have no idea why, but I've often had the same dream over the past few years.

319
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,860
In my dream, there was a heartbroken woman.

320
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,700
She jumped off a bridge, right before I did.

321
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,720
Is the woman... someone you know?

322
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,580
I don't think so.

323
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,280
Her back is always to me. I've never managed to see her face.

324
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,080
Every time I wake up from that dream, my heart aches terribly,

325
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,900
and have a hard time breathing.

326
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,540
Could it be from my past life?

327
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:29,300
According to the Zhou Gong's Interpretation of Dreams, we see our weaknesses in our dreams.

328
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,900
Tang Zhou. You have always been a very talented person, and your skills are outstanding.

329
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,440
You are the most outstanding disciple the Lingxiao Sect has had over the years.

330
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,380
However, it is true that you are inexperienced and too soft-hearted.

331
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:45,510
Perhaps the dream is trying to remind you not to be too soft-hearted and get deceived by a woman.

332
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,500
Do not fall into a demon's trap.

333
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,560
Because your softhearted master trusted a demon,

334
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,140
he got himself killed.

335
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,520
I understand.

336
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,660
The Lingxiao Sect will eliminate all devils and demons without exception.

337
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,190
I don't dare to ever forget this.

338
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:08,150
Sect Leader, you can rest assured. I'll prove my determination when I complete my expedition.

339
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:15,360
I'm sure you will never let the Lingxiao Sect down.

340
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,500
Good.

341
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,380
"Kill All the Tortoise-Flipping Men in the World"?

342
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,700
Why does this tortoise look so familiar?

343
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,220
You... You are actually a little tortoise!

344
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,660
Stop mocking me!

345
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,220
Keep mocking me and I will kill you!

346
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,000
Hey! Stop right there!

347
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,280
Yu Mo! Yu Mo!

348
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,429
- What is the matter?
- Quickly, help me!

349
00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:26,820
- Shut up!
- Are you trying to bully her?

350
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,960
- Shut up!
- Yu Mo. Yu Mo, do you know what his real form is?

351
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,720
I'm guessing he is a dung beetle.

352
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,960
What do you mean, "dung beetle"?

353
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,080
In your heart, am I just a bug that rolls dung into balls?

354
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,180
He is not that much better than a dung beetle!

355
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:45,500
His real form is a big tortoise!

356
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,840
I am not just any tortoise.

357
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,380
- I am a divine tortoise.
- Please!

358
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,300
Why would a divine tortoise sleep in a coffin?

359
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,040
Would a divine tortoise be that insecure?

360
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:58,760
Fine. I'll tell you the truth. I was supposed to live in the divine lake, eating fish and prawns.

361
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,660
I was living an idle life...

362
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:04,460
but I had the worst luck. I met an immortal who would flip me over every day.

363
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,760
Later, a kind immortal turned me the right side up again.

364
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,940
However, all that flipping almost killed me.

365
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:15,520
If you were me, you... w-wouldn't you lay in a coffin to keep yourself safe?

366
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,140
That divine tortoise was you?

367
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,940
You really are that divine tortoise!

368
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,400
Don't you remember the two immortals who saved you?

369
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,380
I almost died of excessive puking after all that flipping.

370
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,980
I had no time to find out who they were!

371
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:33,820
Yu Mo, I am warning you. You better make sure she keeps this secret.

372
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,700
If you dare let this slip, I...

373
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,100
You, you, you... What will you do?

374
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,320
Demons of Yelan Mountain, listen to this!

375
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,560
Zi Lin's real form is a little tortoise!

376
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,200
- You...
- What are you doing?

377
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,340
Yu Mo, how can you put your wife before your brother? I will deal with you later!

378
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,040
Ugly woman!

379
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,200
Little Tortoise.

380
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,340
You darned lotus spirit!

381
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,000
Stop right there!

382
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,800
Stupid tortoise, stop chasing after me.

383
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,520
As a tortoise, you will never catch me!

384
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,680
Got it? Guess what this is?

385
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,660
I must kill you today!

386
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,640
- You...
- This... Catch it!

387
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,960
Sister Bai Ling, I bet you five dried fruits that

388
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,300
Yan Dan will get beaten up so badly, she'll return to her original form today.

389
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,600
I bet ten dried fruits that Yan Dan will surely win the fight.

390
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,140
Because she has Mountain Chief Yu Mo backing her.

391
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,080
Bai Ling is right.

392
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,400
I just dried that fruit!

393
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,140
You can do it again later.

394
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,960
Yan Dan, stay strong!

395
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,520
Understood!

396
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,380
Catch this!

397
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,600
Little Tortoise!

398
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:03,120
<i>This is the good life. Nothing is better than this.</i>

399
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,500
You are done for!

400
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,520
I'm going to kill you!

401
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,840
Help!

402
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,640
I will kill you!

403
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,180
Move. Move!

<i>[Lingxiao Sect]</i>

Senior Brother Tang Zhou. You're leaving the sect just to avoid meeting all those ladies.

406
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,580
However, I predict... that you will run into another love disaster during your trip.

407
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,380

<i>[Lingxiao Sect]</i>

We have subdued the Bear, Rat, and Cat clans.

413
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,600
Other than the Fox Clan, that refuses to surrender, we have subdued all demons!

414
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,140
Congratulations to the Mountain Chiefs for becoming the Kings of all Demons!

415
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,840
From now on, all will obey you!

<i>We are ready to serve you!</i>

Please rise.

419
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:21,020
Since you have bowed to me, I will let bygones be bygones.

420
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:26,280
Zi Lin and I will definitely find you a place to stay on this mountain.

421
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,040
A place for everyone to live.

422
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:32,060
I'm sure you understand the rules of Yelan Mountain.

423
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,640
There cannot be fighting between clans,

424
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,380
nor fights for power.

425
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,860
You are not allowed to wreak havoc in the mortal world when you leave the mountain.

426
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:47,500
If I find out that any of you are breaking these rules, I won't show any mercy and punish you myself.

427
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,300
We are so grateful for the Mountain Chiefs' kindness.

428
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,680
Henceforth, we will definitely change our ways.

429
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,500
However...

430
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,440
What? What do you want to say?

431
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:04,000
In the past few years, Miss Yan Dan has often led the mountain demons to rob our clans.

432
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,000
I beg your pardon.

433
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,800
- Can you repeat that?
- No, no.

434
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,120
I was just offering some advice, that's all.

435
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,940
We clan leaders have already sincerely repented.

436
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,400
Can we ask Miss Yan Dan for a favor?

437
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,740
Can she at least return our demonic essence pills to us?

438
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,320
Yan Dan told me about this before.

439
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,380
She said that your clans are very powerful.

440
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,820
You disturbed the mortal world and bullied innocent people.

441
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:35,580
If you have your demonic essence, you will keep causing more trouble.

442
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,500
I think she is right.

443
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:43,940
That is why she turned your demonic essence into dice to play with.

444
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,400
Mountain Chief, Yan Dan is looking for you.

445
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,720
Can't you see that I am in a serious meeting?

446
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,140
Tell her to wait.

447
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:57,700
She said that, if you don't come, there'll be no late-night snacks tonight.

448
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,080
I'm coming.

449
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,660
What...

450
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,640
- This—
- What is with the fuss?

451
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:11,480
Though he is the King of All Demons, he fell head over heels in love with a lotus demon.

452
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,800
You told her everything?

453
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,760
Didn't I say I wanted to surprise her?

454
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,380
I told you not to let her find out.

455
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,000
But you still told her.

456
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,160
Mountain Chief, others give surprises in the form of jewelry. They're easy to hide.

457
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,380
But you are building a pavilion of books.

458
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:33,320
How could she not notice such a huge pavilion? It's impossible.

459
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,040
I don't need you to tell me that.

460
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,100
Yan Dan!

461
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,520
Yu Mo! Look what I found.

462
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,540
Yan Dan.

Fish soup with lotus seeds?

468
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,040
Sounds good.

469
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:25,320
We've subdued all Yelan Mountain demons, except for Three-tailed Snow Fox Clan, who would rather die than surrender.

470
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,360
We admire your confidence and won't force you to submit.

471
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:32,140
But why are you suddenly here today?

472
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,380
I am Lin Lang, the daughter of the Fox Clan leader.

473
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,920
Zi Yan.

474
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,780
Where is your greeting?

475
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,920
This is my brother, the future successor of the Fox Clan.

476
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,320
He was accidentally poisoned, and no one in our clan knows how to save him.

477
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:06,420
If the two Mountain Chiefs help us, the Fox Clan will surely submit to you.

478
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:10,960
I am willing to stay and serve the Mountain Chiefs for the rest of my life, as well.

479
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,980
There are two Mountain Chiefs here.

480
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:18,440
Which one are you looking for?

481
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,140
The one who killed Prison Lizard and unified the mountain clans.

482
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:27,520
The only man whom the Three-tailed Snow Fox would marry...

483
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,340
is naturally you.

484
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,280
I am sitting right here!

485
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,720
How could you just ignore me like that?

486
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,480
I heard that Mountain Chief Zi Lin was once severely injured.

487
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,680
The man behind you saved you with the Extraordinary Eye.

488
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,440
Isn't that right?

489
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:57,300
I will save him, but forget about marrying me.

490
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:01,260
The Fox Clan has our pride. We always repay kindness.

491
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,060
Please do not turn me down, Mountain Chief.

492
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,960
Our Mountain Chief Yu Mo has a heart of stone.

493
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,520
Moreover, he has more than enough wives and concubines already.

494
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,840
How about this?

495
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,840
Perhaps... you can consider marrying me.

496
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,360
All members of the Fox Clan are loyal to their partners.

497
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,980
Once we have made up our minds, we are never swayed.

498
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:28,140
Mountain Chief, please respect our clan's custom and divorce all your other concubines.

499
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,940
I will be your one and only wife, from now on.

500
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:35,360
I swear to give you my all and stay loyal to you forever.

501
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,380
Three-tailed Snow Foxes... They are a noble bunch...

502
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:47,840
If we can save their future leader, we will be able to bring peace to the mountain.

503
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,620
You have everything to gain and nothing to lose here.

504
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:55,340
Why don't you just go along with it?

505
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,020
Close the door. Bring Yan Dan here.

506
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:03,080
Sister, it hurts a lot.

507
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,760
Is it hurting you again?

508
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,400
Zi Yan, don't worry. Hold my hand.

509
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,640
Zi Yan, stay strong.

510
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,170
They will cure you very soon.

511
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,100
Zi Yan, don't worry.

512
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:22,660
If they can't heal you, I'll take you to Shenxiao Palace...

513
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,300
and we'll ask the Shenxiao Palace Chief for help.

514
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,130
He will definitely be able to cure you.

515
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,070
Hang in there for a while more. Okay?

516
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,620
Your Highness. Your Highness.

517
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,160
- Can I come in?
- Yes.

518
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,660
Good boy. You will be fine soon.

519
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,200
Your Highness, may I take a look at your brother's leg?

520
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,800
Zi Yan, please endure it.

521
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,940
Can you cure him?

522
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:16,700
Your Highness, the Fox Clan might not be grateful for what you've done for them.

523
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:21,000
Our Mountain Chief isn't the only person who can cure him.

524
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,780
Why don't you seek help somewhere else? What do you think?

525
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,140
Are you trying to tell me to leave? Are you Mountain Chief's concubine?

526
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,480
I am from Flower Spirit Clan.

527
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,500
When I first came here, I was made his concubine. However—

528
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,320
What is the matter?

529
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,480
Your Highness, I shouldn't be here.

530
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,180
I won't bother you further and leave.

531
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,840
I hate it when someone doesn't finish their sentence.

532
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,360
What are you trying to say?

533
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,280
Your Highness, it isn't actually a big deal...

534
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,160
How should I say this?

535
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,260
What is this?

536
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,940
- Did the Mountain Chief—
- No, no!

537
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,480
The Mountain Chief didn't do this to me!

538
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,400
H-He didn't do anything to me.

539
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,120
Your Highness, do not let anyone know that I was here.

540
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,100
Also, keep what you saw just now a secret. All right?

541
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,840
I'll leave now.

542
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:38,380
<i>Mountain Chief, please have mercy! I won't do it again!</i>

543
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,660
<i>- How dare you meet with the Princess of the Fox Clan behind my back?
- I won't do it again!</i>

544
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,420
<i>Tell me! What did you say to her?</i>

545
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,840
<i>I did not say anything to her!</i>

546
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,900
<i>I said nothing, Mountain Chief!</i>

547
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,380
<i>Please don't hit me there! The wound hasn't healed yet!</i>

548
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,080
It hurts!

549
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,900
I understand!

550
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:06,840
You're venting all your anger on me because you can't find the wicked demon who stole your Extraordinary Eye, right?

551
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,460
Come at me! Just kill me. Do it now!

552
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:13,240
You are right. I really am a heartless man. Say it again!

553
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,080
<i>I will kill you. I will kill you now!</i>

554
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,800
<i>Help!</i>

555
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:34,040
The Princess of the Fox Clan spent way too long hiding and eavesdropping on us.

556
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,040
My throat is so dry from all the shouting. I'm losing my voice.

557
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,060
She finally left.

558
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,880
Thank you, my dear Attendant Lian.

559
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,060
It's my honor.

560
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:47,120
Solving problems for my master is my duty.

561
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:55,380
What we did to avoid marriage is something worth writing down in my novels.

562
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:00,180
I'm curious to see if Lin Lang will leave tonight.

563
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,700
Master.

564
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,760
I can tell that Lin Lang is a beautiful lady just from her eyes.

565
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,140
She was born into a noble family.

566
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:12,080
She's a little arrogant, but she's also very straightforward and honest.

567
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,720
She is a rare, wonderful lady. Why do you want to reject her?

568
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:22,220
Have you still not gotten over the wicked demon who stole your Extraordinary Eye?

569
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,420
I'll have to kick you out if I marry her.

570
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:30,240
Why don't you marry Zi Lin and be his concubine?

571
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,620
No way. Never.

572
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:36,720
Although I'm just an attendant, if I have to find a backer, he needs to be good, right?

573
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:14,200
Taoist Master Brother, please spare my life.

574
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:19,720
If you let me go, I'll give you the primordial spirit that I've spent a hundred years building.

575
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:25,000
My spiritual pill is a rare treasure for people like you, who are cultivating.

576
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,400
Consuming it can effectively grow your cultivation base.

577
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,980
A mortal will only get an upset stomach from consuming a spiritual pill.

578
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,580
Enough of your nonsense.

579
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,440
Get inside.

580
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,880
Go on.

581
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,720
Good morning, Madam.

582
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,220
Good morning!

583
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,280
Yan Dan.

584
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,140
Princess Lin Lang! Why are you here?

585
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,980
Are you all right?

586
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:24,740
I overheard your conversation with Yu Mo last night.

587
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:30,980
I know that you can help others, but you're too scared because you're intimidated by his power. Right?

588
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:35,880
Yan Dan. If you save Zi Yan, I will help you get out of here.

589
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,140
Zi Yan?

590
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,740
Thank you! Thank you, Yan Dan!

591
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,960
Thank you very, very much!

592
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,580
You are welcome, very welcome.

593
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:16,700
Now that your brother's poison has been removed, you two should leave before Mountain Chief Yu Mo sees you.

594
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,500
We just met by chance, and you were willing to risk your life to save us.

595
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,960
The Fox Clan will definitely repay your kindness.

596
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,060
Yan Dan, let's leave together.

597
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:28,420
From now on, you will no longer be abused by that beast, Yu Mo.

598
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,320
You are welcome. It's not a big deal, really.

599
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,880
The Flower Spirit Clan sent me here to be his concubine.

600
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,760
If I leave now, the Flower Spirit Clan will be implicated.

601
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,200
You should just leave with your brother.

602
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,020
Don't worry about that.

603
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,920
When you marry a Fox Clan member someday, I will surely keep your family safe.

604
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,900
Then you won't have to worry about anything ever again.

605
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,040
"Marry a Fox Clan member"?

606
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,200
Don't tell me you want me to marry him!

607
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,000
That's not a good idea.

608
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,820
I still prefer someone older than me, a more mature man.

609
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,780
We Three-tailed Snow Foxes always keep our promises.

610
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,980
From now on, no one will bully you again!

611
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,160
You went overboard.

612
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:09,700
Looks like your little concubine is about to get kidnapped.

613
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,320
- That's not appropriate. It's really not appropriate.
- Let's go now.

614
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,120
Wait, but—

615
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,620
You..

616
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,820
She is mine. Let go of her.

617
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:22,160
But you don't love her. Why won't you let her leave with me?

618
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,880
Hitting and yelling at her is a form of love too. Don't you get it?

619
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,420
Nonsense! Yan Dan is leaving with me!

620
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,200
If you don't let her go, don't blame me for not showing you any mercy.

621
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,700
I won't let her go.

622
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,400
Yan Dan.
