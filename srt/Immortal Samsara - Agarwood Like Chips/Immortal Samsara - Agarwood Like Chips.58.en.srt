15
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,960
This Waist Sword is stained with Huan Qin's heavenly essence.

16
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,920
So, Magical Pavilion has performed Breath-Silencing Spell on it.

17
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,400
Currently, everyone in the Nine Heavens knows that I'll be cultivating my divine power again.

18
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:47,620
If anyone leaks this to Huan Qin, they'll be punished by a thunder strike.

19
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,980
You didn't punish me like that when I saw you flipping a tortoise back then.

20
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,440
That was benevolent of you, I guess.

21
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,720
Can you teach me this spell?

22
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,840
Are there any secrets that you can't share with others?

23
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,060
I... I don't have any secrets.

24
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,440
I'm just thinking to use it on Zi Lin when I'm back at Yelan Mountain.

25
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,600
Now that the trap has been set for Huan Qin,

26
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,980
I wonder who'll be struck by thunder.

27
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,000
No matter who it will be, I hope it's not Si Mu.

28
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,760
<i>Si Mu, you weren't rescued by Huan Qin by accident.</i>

29
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,480
Although you've lost your divine power, I've stabilized your spiritual power.

30
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,360
Since your identity has been exposed, you don't have to hide anymore.

31
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:25,260
When I reclaim the throne, I'll exonerate the Three-Winged Raven Clan.

32
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,920
You asked Lu Jing to pass Si Mu a secret message when he performed the spell.

33
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,420
If he can reconsider and let go of grudges, he'll be granted freedom.

34
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,880
However, if he still dwells on his grudges and helps Huan Qin to execute the evil acts,

35
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,620
you mustn't blame yourself. You've done enough for him.

36
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,900
The destiny of the Three-Winged Raven Clan...

37
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,380
lies in your hands.

38
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,900
Your Supreme Majesty, please don't waste your divine power on me.

39
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:23,260
When you know I'm no longer the heavenly emperor... why do you call me that?

40
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,420
You are the master I follow.

41
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,520
Regardless of your situation, you're always Heavenly Emperor to me.

42
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:36,980
You managed to save me because it was planned by Ying Yuan.

43
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,260
They cast a vast web...

44
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,620
and I'm the bait to lure you out.

45
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,700
I knew it all along.

46
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,700
Ying Yuan and I have known each other for ten thousand years.

47
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,640
He predicted that I'd fall into the trap.

48
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,640
Tell me, then.

49
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:10,060
In five days, Ying Yuan is going to reclaim the three divine tools and restore his divine power.

50
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,100
They've lost track of me.

51
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,200
They know I won't just sit still and do nothing while he recovers his spiritual power.

52
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,400
Therefore, they try to lure me out with you.

53
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,880
To them, this war is their chance for survival, or maybe even the turning point.

54
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:39,140
As long as I can stop it from happening, both him and the Nine Fins Clan will be far inferior to me.

55
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,320
Your Supreme Majesty, the path is full of peril.

56
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,780
Don't lower your guard.

57
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,580
Please take a break to recuperate and don't worry.

58
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:04,420
Your Supreme Majesty, I'm tired now.

59
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,720
I'd like to take a nap.

60
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,220
Sure.

61
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,880
It's Breath-Silencing Spell.

62
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,120
Si Mu.

63
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,260
Celestial Deity Yue Yao said each divine tool has its own will,

64
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,880
and they don't change easily once they've chosen their master.

65
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,160
If one's going to set up an array to alter their master

66
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,900
and assemble the spiritual power, the person has to risk his life.

67
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,040
While forming such an array, the performer will become frail and vulnerable,

68
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,060
as his divine power will be drained.

69
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,220
The performer's spiritual power can only be rebuilt after he's connected to the divine tool.

70
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,860
As for now, you've lost almost all of your cultivation base.

71
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:30,560
You'll be overwhelmed by the divine power of the three divine tools if they enter your body simultaneously.

72
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,680
So I'll join the array with you to share half of your pain and risk.

73
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,620
And me, too.

74
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,320
Even though my spiritual power is inferior to yours, I won't sit idly by.

75
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,300
When you're setting up the array, I'll use my lotus essence to calm your breath

76
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,180
and protect you from Huan Qin's attack.

77
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,840
I can handle this myself.

78
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,300
It's a matter of the Heaven Realm.

79
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,420
As Heavenly Emperor, I should resolve it myself.

80
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,160
Oh, come on.

81
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,700
Don't think too highly of yourself just because everyone regards you as Heavenly Emperor.

82
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,460
Don't forget that you've lost your spiritual essence.

83
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,780
But I still have the Extraordinary Eye with me.

84
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,960
I'm much more powerful than you at the moment.

85
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,400
Whenever it might be, you're always Tang Zhou to me.

86
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,920
When you went through immeasurable pain and torment in the Mortal Realm,

87
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,900
it was me who saved you so many times.

88
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,460
Do you still remember that?

89
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:29,100
But now, you are turning me down when you're going to face a huge challenge.

90
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,840
Yu Mo is right.

91
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,760
You don't have to act like Heavenly Emperor in front of us.

92
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:42,180
Since it concerns the sentient beings, I won't refuse your offer again.

93
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:47,280
Yu Mo, we will have a friendly showdown after everything is settled.

94
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,620
Sure. It's a deal.

95
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,380
And me, too.

96
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,140
We're the chivalrous Team One Good Deed A Day.

97
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,360
No one should be left out.

98
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,420
Your Supreme Majesty, there's news from Heavenly Gallows

99
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,300
saying the Breath-Silencing Spell was activated and the thunder strike was launched.

100
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,800
- Who got struck?
- It's Si Mu.

101
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:21,000
Now that we've got Huan Qin, I shall go back to the mountain and get prepared.

102
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,060
I'll go with you.

103
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,480
Yelan Mountain is my home in the Mortal Realm.

104
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,380
Before the war starts, I'd like to go back and keep them company.

105
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,900
Let's go.

106
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,080
Recovering the spiritual essence is a menacing process.

107
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,380
You'll be doomed if something goes wrong.

108
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:56,860
Young Lord, you possess both the divine powers of the Asura King and the Primordial Lord Ran Qing.

109
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,720
By activating the power of this bloodline, you can bring down Huan Qin effortlessly.

110
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,160
As well as bring the innocent members of the Asura Clan back to life.

111
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,120
If I activate the power of the bloodline, it'll kill more people than just Huan Qin.

112
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,000
Young Lord. Don't you want to revive His Supreme Majesty?

113
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,680
We won't stand a chance unless you release the primordial spirit of the late heavenly emperor inside you.

114
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,740
The primordial spirit of the late heavenly emperor suppresses the Asura blood inside me.

115
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,080
I only gained my divine power after being trained in the Heaven Realm.

116
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:34,700
I can bring down Huan Qin even without the Asura blood.

117
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,980
After this war, Young Lord, you'll be the ruler of the Three Realms.

118
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,040
Yet you only care about the sentient beings in the Three Realms.

119
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,600
Why do you always ignore the entire Asura Clan?

120
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,360
Resurrecting the dead is against the natural law and the order of the Three Realms.

121
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,340
Asura blood is not controllable.

122
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:55,020
If I use it to resurrect the dead, the world will be turbulent.

123
00:10:55,030 --> 00:11:00,880
I know you grew up in the Heaven Realm, but please don't forget the blood that flows in your body.

124
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,240
You're the son of His Majesty. You're destined to be the young lord of the Asura Clan.

125
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,720
My identity isn't determined by my lineage.

126
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,840
Stop calling me "Young Lord".

127
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,800
You're the last survivor of the Asura Clan.

128
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,180
Don't repeat Si Mu's mistake.

129
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,240
Go to the Pool of Eight Hardships.

130
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,340
Forget the past and live a carefree life in the Mortal Realm.

131
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:34,260
Young Lord, my only wish in this life is to serve His Majesty and you.

132
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,920
Please don't ask me to leave.

133
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,720
You should have let go of your obsession from the War of Genesis.

134
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,360
Your Supreme Majesty!

135
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,160
Please allow me to be your aid for the last time.

136
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,380
I'd like to repay the kindness of His Majesty.

137
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:58,180
After Huan Qin dies, I'll go to the Pool of Eight Hardships right away.

138
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,340
Fine.

139
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,140
I'll grant your wish.

140
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:10,240
Ling Jiang. The Asura King once said, "Let bygones be bygones, don't dwell on the past."

141
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,440
Hope you keep this in mind.

142
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,800
Brother Yu Mo. You're going to join the war tomorrow.

143
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,080
I fear that I won't see you anymore.

144
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,500
Sister Zhao Lan. Don't worry.

145
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,140
I already have a fail-proof plan.

146
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:47,380
Brother Yu Mo. Aren't you going to ask Yan Dan for her answer?

147
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,400
I hope you both return safe and sound.

148
00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:00,940
However, if something bad happens to either of you,

149
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:05,920
won't you regret not confessing to her?

150
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:12,310
If I come back safe and sound, I'll spend the rest of my life loving her.

151
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:19,990
But if I don't, I'm not willing to make her feel bad and upset.

152
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:30,360
The greatest wish in my life is that Yan Dan will never be fearful or sad.

153
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,160
I want her to be happy and safe.

154
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,640
Yan Dan. His Supreme Majesty went missing.

155
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,280
After fighting Huan Qin, he was severely injured.

156
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,080
However, he pretends to be fine to soothe our worries.

157
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,660
It's been hard for him to fall asleep in the past few days.

158
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,680
He's going to set up the array tomorrow.

159
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,960
What if something bad happens to him now?

160
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,320
We'll split up and look for him.

161
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,880
Sure.

162
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,060
There's no time for you to indulge yourself with wine.

163
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,980
Lu Jing has been worried sick. Do you know that?

164
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,200
Yan Dan. It's so great to be in a dream.

165
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,320
Because you showed up again.

166
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,800
Why are you so drunk?

167
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,200
Fine.

168
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:58,320
Since you said that we're in your dream, answer my questions truthfully.

169
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,320
When did you build this lotus pond?

170
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,540
You once... lied to me...

171
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,180
that countless lotuses were blooming outside the cottage.

172
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,780
Now, your lie has turned into reality.

173
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,720
Are you happy?

174
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:43,380
I lied to you as I didn't want you to give up your life.

175
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,580
However, you were high-maintenance even when you were blind.

176
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,400
The happiest time of my life...

177
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,500
was when I was in the Land Under the Horizon.

178
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,980
Honestly, Yan Dan...

179
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,880
I knew it was you.

180
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,260
Since you knew it was me,

181
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,600
- why did you...
- At that time...

182
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,900
I was on the brink of death.

183
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,400
What could I do even if I had acknowledged you?

184
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,640
I feared that both of us...

185
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,180
would fall helplessly for each other.

186
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,360
Stop drinking.

187
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,400
You only show up...

188
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,620
when I drink.

189
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,520
Yan Dan.

190
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,360
In the Divine-Devil War...

191
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,740
I'm the one who should have died.

192
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:30,600
If it weren't for my mistake, the three emperors...

193
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,900
and Immortal Lord Bei Ming wouldn't have died.

194
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,040
I should be blamed.

195
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,980
I owe you a lot, too.

196
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,220
If you didn't have to save me,

197
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,740
you would've been...

198
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,780
living your life carefreely and away from trouble.

199
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,440
Do you know what is the biggest problem about you?

200
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,200
You always take on all the blame yourself.

201
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,160
It's not your fault.

202
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,000
Stop blaming yourself, all right?

203
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,020
No.

204
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,900
I was wrong from the very beginning.

205
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:27,440
When everyone told me that it was Zhi Xi who ripped out her heart to save me...

206
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,500
I wanted to tell you...

207
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,560
that I knew it was you.

208
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,520
However, His Supreme Majesty admonished me.

209
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:53,340
I was really afraid that I would lose you.

210
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,520
I knew you would be upset and heartbroken.

211
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,160
Still, I kept it from you.

212
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,620
Besides...

213
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:09,280
you jumped off Bridge of Emptiness in despair in front of my cold-eyed stare.

214
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:15,060
Yan Dan. I was wrong.

215
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,820
I let you down.

216
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,820
Then, why did you...

217
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,220
erase our memory?

218
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:48,320
The memory would torture you.

219
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,160
You kept failing to cross the Night Forgetting River.

220
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,460
So, you should start your life afresh...

221
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,880
even if you had to forget me.

222
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,600
I'd endure the torments...

223
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,000
myself.

224
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,420
You left me this As Desired wine.

225
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,480
I take a sip...

226
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,860
when I can't sleep.

227
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,480
What a shame.

228
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,960
I have to lose you eventually...

229
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:51,340
no matter how wonderful my dream is.

230
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,500
♫ <i> My most bewildering memory is the moonlight falling like frost on the ground full of fallen leaves </i> ♫

231
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,600
Yan Dan.

232
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,600
♫ <i> For a single teardrop, I'm drowning myself in sorrow, obsessing with forgetting you </i> ♫

233
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,720
I'm to be blamed.

234
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,200
♫ <i> If we'd have to walk till we separate, to where would you want to go? </i> ♫

235
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,600
Silly.

236
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,200
I've forgiven you a long time ago.

237
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,100
No.

238
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,500
Please don't forgive me.

239
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:14,400
But... please don't let go of me.

240
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:23,000
♫ <i> I still have an image of you imprinted in my mind even after washing away the fine dust </i> ♫

241
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,100
♫ <i> Life after life, this is the longing I missed the most</i> ♫

242
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:37,000
♫ <i> You are the breeze of a fallen flower in the world of flowers adding to the mound of fallen flowers </i> ♫

243
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:43,200
♫ <i> Will you shed tears over the truth of the mortal world? </i> ♫

244
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:51,200
♫ <i> You're like the unattainable Autumn Moon in the vast sky, don't dare to shine bright yet not hesitate to shine </i> ♫

245
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,100
♫ <i> In my dream, the one I loved is with me </i> ♫

246
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:47,600
♫ <i> After bidding farewell, when Spring becomes Autumn, where can I find my heart in this world? </i> ♫

247
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
<i>Yesterday... it wasn't a dream.</i>

248
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,300
<i>Yan Dan, if you've totally let go of me,</i>

249
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
<i>why would you keep this agarwood incense burner?</i>

250
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:12,700
<i>So... the agarwood incense never turned into ashes.</i>

251
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:33,600
<i>[House of Rascal]</i>

252
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,900
Ying Yuan, I knew you neglected your cultivation all these years.

253
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,800
However, I didn't expect you to be this weak.

254
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,600
You don't deserve to be Heavenly Emperor.

255
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,600
It's the Puppet Spell.

256
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,200
I set a magical array in the vines.

257
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,800
You could just tie him up.

258
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,100
Why did you act on your own accord?

259
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,600
Huan Qin is not stupid.

260
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,100
If he realizes that I'm trying to buy time purposely, he'll break through the vines.

261
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,200
You and Yu Mo would be in danger. I had no choice.

262
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,200
Huan Qin is much more powerful than we ever imagined.

263
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,300
<i>In terms of the two things we need to do, we need to first set up the array to collect the divine tools.</i>

264
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,700
<i>If we fail to bring Huan Qin down, we'll lure him into the Illusion of Devils.</i>

265
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,300
<i>The Illusion of Devils makes one see what they fear the most.</i>

266
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:31,600
<i>To Huan Qin, the most fearful thing is the four emperors from the previous war.</i>

267
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,600
<i>We can defeat Huan Qin with the help of the emperors.</i>

268
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,000
<i>Huan Qin is tough and composed, the Illusion of Devils isn't enough to trap him.</i>

269
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,300
<i>However, in the Nine Heavens, there's a divine art that turns illusions into reality temporarily.</i>

270
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:52,000
<i>As long as he doesn't leave the Illusion of Devils, the three emperors will be helpful to me.</i>

271
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,800
<i>What if Huan Qin can't be killed even if he enters the Illusion of Devils?</i>

272
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,700
<i>In the Nine Heavens, there's a way to eradicate both illusions and essence.</i>

273
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,700
<i>Only thirty minutes are needed.</i>

274
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:06,200
<i>After thirty minutes, both the Illusion of Devils and Huan Qin will perish together.</i>

275
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,800
Oh no. We're running out of time.

276
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,500
<i>Yu Mo!</i>

277
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,600
Now.

278
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
Ying Yuan!

279
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,200
-Ying Yuan!
-Ying Yuan!

280
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,800
Where's Ying Yuan?

281
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,300
Something bad has happened.

282
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,700
It seems that he was absorbed into another nightmare illusion.

283
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,400
I get it.

284
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:21,100
If the Illusion of Devils acts on our minds, we shall make good use of it.

285
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,900
Ying Yuan, you can't defeat me.

286
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:01,800
So, you tricked me with the dead.

287
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,000
How despicable of you.

288
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,100
If you had no guilt or fear, they wouldn't appear.

289
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:13,800
Deep inside, you know very well what you did is all evil.

290
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,800
I don't care if I'm guilty or not.

291
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:24,100
Since I killed them back then, I don't mind killing them again.

292
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,960
Ying Yuan. The Illusion of Devils evokes the evil in you.

293
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,840
Since you used it on me, I shall retaliate on you.

294
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:56,550
The more you want to get rid of the Asura blood, the more I want you to remember that Xuan Ye is your father.

295
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:59,480
You're born a sinner.

296
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,640
Your Majesty?

297
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:59,580
You actually transferred all your divine power and cultivation into this primordial pill.

298
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:03,720
You neutralized the primordial spirit that suppresses the Asura blood in Ying Yuan.

299
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:11,060
As long as the Asura King's lineage reappears, the entire Asura Clan will rise again.

300
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:14,020
My mission is accomplished now.

301
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,200
What a fool.

302
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,720
It's merely an illusion.

303
00:39:27,386 --> 00:39:31,313
When falsehood is taken for truth, the truth seems false, too.

304
00:39:31,313 --> 00:39:37,393
If it weren't for repaying His Majesty's kindness, I would've died in the War of Genesis.

305
00:39:37,393 --> 00:39:42,040
Now, I get to meet His Majesty again.

306
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:48,660
Even if I have to drown in the illusion, I'm content

307
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:52,360
and have no regrets at my last breath.

308
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,980
Fine.

<i>''Never Forget'' - Zhang Lei</i>

311
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:13,060
♫ <i> The moment of our first meeting in Heaven and on Earth </i> ♫

312
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,840
♫ <i> Even the star frost can't stop the fleeting time </i> ♫

313
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:28,200
♫ <i> I once borrowed your eyes to warm the coldest moment </i> ♫

314
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:35,300
♫ <i> I've traveled across the Night Forgetting River, but it's hard to forget this fate </i> ♫

315
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:41,500
♫ <i> I followed you across the endless seas reluctant to leave you </i> ♫

316
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:48,180
♫ <i> It seems too hard to profess my love, the words are caught in my throat </i> ♫

317
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:56,320
♫ <i> I've wasted a millennium thinking about how to let go of my endless longing for you </i> ♫

318
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:03,000
♫ <i> Love can only be redeemed if the deadline is forgotten </i> ♫

319
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:12,940
♫ <i> Deep love is engraved in my heart with just one look, I'm willing to take the leap for you </i> ♫

320
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:19,840
♫ <i> As epiphyllum withers, I'm willing to sink in deep and never let you down in this life </i> ♫

321
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:28,120
♫ <i> I'm keeping the last glimpse of you, so I won't fear missing you after reincarnation </i> ♫

322
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:35,560
♫ <i> Your heart is still beating in my chest </i> ♫

323
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:51,760
♫ <i> Deep love is engraved in my heart with just one look, I'm willing to take the leap for you </i> ♫

324
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:58,640
♫ <i> As epiphyllum withers, I'm willing to sink in deep and never let you down in this life </i> ♫

325
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:06,880
♫ <i> I'm keeping the last glimpse of you, so I won't fear missing you after reincarnation </i> ♫

326
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:13,920
♫ <i> Your heart is still beating in my chest </i> ♫

327
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:24,000
♫ <i> The flowers bloom and fall, even though I say nothing and you hear nothing </i> ♫
