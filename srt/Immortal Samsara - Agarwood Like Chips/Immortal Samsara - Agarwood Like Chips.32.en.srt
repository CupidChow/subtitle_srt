15
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,340
Sheng De. Where did you go just now?

16
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,960
We couldn't find you during dinnertime.

17
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,020
This palace is huge. I got lost while taking a walk.

18
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,500
By the way, the army has been training day and night,

19
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,060
and the war starts tomorrow. Have you come up with any countermeasures?

20
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:51,360
Have you heard of a play called "Jing Ke's Assassination Attempt on the King of Qin"?

21
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,760
Yan Dan, this concerns the military strategy.

22
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,160
Don't joke around.

23
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,620
I'm not joking!

24
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,100
This plan was the best in history.

25
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,020
What about this? I'll act as Fan Wuqi, while you'll act as Jing Ke.

26
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,860
With our intelligence, we can surely defeat Ao Xuan easily!

27
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,460
Back then, Jing Ke tried to assassinate the King of Qin by offering Fan Wuqi's head to him.

28
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,950
If not because Jing Ke panicked and failed to stab him three times,

29
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,560
history would have been re-written.

30
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,580
Sister Yan Dan, are you trying to re-enact the scene?

31
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,540
- That's right.
- No way.

32
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,570
Ao Xuan wants Zhao Yan to offer Mr. Yu's head to him to show his sincerity.

33
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,250
I know demons can use contortion.

34
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,740
It's not hard to squeeze yourself inside a box.

35
00:02:39,749 --> 00:02:42,880
However, I don't think there's a technique for facial transformation.

36
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,740
How will you disguise yourselves?

37
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,300
That's simple.

38
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,220
Yu Mo just needs to dress up as a dragon palace guard.

39
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,340
No one will recognize him once he puts on a mask.

40
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:56,640
And I just need a lot of hair to cover my face to pretend as Yu Mo.

41
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,000
When Ao Xuan opens the box, I'll blow lime powder all over his face.
<i>(T/N: A white powder that is produced when quicklime is mixed with water.)</i>

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,880
I'm amazing, right?

43
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,200
That's right. You're so amazing.

44
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,420
Don't try to brush me off, okay?

45
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:12,960
Yu Mo, please! It's been so long since we attended a rehearsal after leaving the mountain.

46
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,080
Just let me try this for once, okay?

47
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,320
Besides, you only need to hand him the box with the head inside.

48
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:24,320
I guarantee that you'll assassinate him in one blow before he can open the box.

49
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,660
Then, you'd just need to throw me on the ground.

50
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,920
All right. I'll follow your instruction.

51
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,440
I'll throw you to the ground. I won't care if your face gets disfigured or not.

52
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,760
There's only one Yanbi Pill in the world, anyway.

53
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,300
To me, one's appearance isn't the most important.

54
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,940
The most important thing is one's intelligence. Understood?

55
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,660
Indeed.

56
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,580
Young Master Yu, you have a great relationship with Yan Dan.

57
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,940
Young Master Yu, you're worried about Yan Dan and reluctant to expose her to danger.

58
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,040
I understand how you feel.

59
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,080
It's a pity that person doesn't appreciate me the way you appreciate Yan Dan.

60
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,180
I don't understand love at all.

61
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,440
I think our priority right now is to save people.

62
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,920
Young Master Yu, I understand. You're wary of me.

63
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,990
However, I still need to beg you.

64
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:24,900
Can you please not drag Young Master Tang into this wedding battle?

65
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,040
He's my benefactor.

66
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,720
I can't bear to see him fail his trial and put himself in danger.

67
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,360
I'm willing to replace him and risk my life for him, so he can fulfill his wish of assisting you both in the battle.

68
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:44,360
Yu Mo, I think the Dragon King also said not to involve Tang Zhou in this.

69
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,580
How about we won’t take him with us this time?

70
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,920
We can share our victory with him once we succeed.

71
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,900
I guess he got off easy this time. What do you think?

72
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,480
You've returned. How was it?

73
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,520
The Three Seas are willing to elect me as their commander.

74
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,040
We intend to overthrow Ao Xuan during the wedding.

75
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,300
It's very dangerous to fight in their territory. Let me join you.

76
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,960
No need. Your identity is too noble. I'm afraid you'll be in trouble if people see you.

77
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,080
Don't worry. Both the West and the North Seas have agreed to join me in battle.

78
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,860
I think we have a high chance of winning.

79
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,440
That's why the three of you should just wait here for me.

80
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,400
It's not that we don't trust your ability. It's just better to be more cautious.

81
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,940
Enough already. You're nagging so much!

82
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,720
You're used to being the hero. We already told you that we would be fine.

83
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,220
Tomorrow you just need to be our female chef and cook us some fine dishes to celebrate Yu Mo's victory.

84
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,740
You're the female chef.

85
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,040
The battlefield is ever-changing. Notify me immediately if you're in danger.

86
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,580
Don't worry.

87
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,740
<i>Even if you still don't fall for me in this lifetime,</i>

88
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,800
<i>as long as you consume the lotus heart and lead a healthy life,</i>

89
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,120
<i>I'm satisfied with staying by your side until the end of our lives.</i>

90
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,860
The rebels have around 80,000 troops. They will attack from the North Sea.

91
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,740
Yan Dan and Yu Mo intend to play out "Jing Ke's Assassination Attempt on the King of Qin".

92
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:23,220
They plan to put Yan Dan's head inside the box and pretend that Yu Mo is dead.

93
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,940
They will try to assassinate you when you let down your guard.

94
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,380
<i>Yu Mo! Sheng De!</i>

95
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,040
<i>Come in and help me out!</i>

96
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,340
Is anyone there?

97
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,380
Come and help me out!

98
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,400
Stop shouting!

99
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,080
What're you up to this time? What exactly are you trying to do here?

100
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,520
Why is it you again? Go away!

101
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,100
Tell me the truth.

102
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:21,440
I... I just think that the box is cooler.

103
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,580
I just want to enjoy myself here. Can't I do so?

104
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,640
Fine. My jade calabash is pretty cool, too.

105
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,680
Why don't you come inside?

106
00:07:32,173 --> 00:07:36,413
The Dragon King of the East Sea and his son are tyrants!

107
00:07:36,413 --> 00:07:39,820
I had been enduring them due to our alliance.

108
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:45,400
However, Ao Xuan actually invaded the South Sea,

109
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,080
slew my warriors, kidnapped my daughter, and cut off my arm.

110
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:58,340
A kind heart has become a disaster for the Four Seas.

111
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,040
I shall not tolerate their demeanor any longer.

112
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,120
Now, the heavens are helping the South Sea.

113
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,320
The orphan of the Nine Fins Clan has resurfaced.

114
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,740
We shall eliminate Ao Xuan during the wedding banquet.

115
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,380
The Three Seas shall attack the East Sea together.

116
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,320
We shall elect a new ruler for the Four Seas.

117
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,420
According to customs, the number of participants at the banquet should be less than 1,000.

118
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:29,220
That's why His Majesty has selected elite troops, like you all, to join me on this conquest.

119
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,280
We shall seize control of the hall using the box as our signal.

120
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:38,340
If we can kill Ao Xuan successfully, that would ensure our victory.

121
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:44,000
The safety of the Four Seas falls on you now.

122
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,260
<i>We shall slay Ao Xuan!</i>

123
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,660
Your Majesty, the South Sea's bridal team has arrived.

124
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,380
Your Majesty, the warriors in the hall are ready.

125
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,340
Summon my consort here.

126
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,980
The banquet seems a bit boring.

127
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,920
We should enjoy a show before the ceremony begins.

128
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,240
<i>Princess Zhao Lan, the Dragon King of the South Sea is here to offer his congratulations.</i>

129
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,840
<i>His Majesty requests your presence in the main hall.</i>

130
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,780
<i>Would my royal father actually kill Brother Yu Mo?</i>

131
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,580
<i>Princess Zhao Lan, if the wedding gown is difficult for you to wear,</i>

132
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,900
<i>I can come inside and help you out. His Majesty is...</i>

133
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,360
The head of the rebel, Yu Mo, is inside this box.

134
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,220
Your Majesty, please take a look.

135
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:56,380
Your Majesty, I hope you will be appeased and marry my daughter.

136
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,860
I hope you two will stay in love forever.

137
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,640
Bring it here.

138
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:09,260
Yu Mo, put down your weapon and surrender immediately.

139
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,640
If not, I shall destroy this box immediately.

140
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,760
If you like the item inside the box, you may have it.

141
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,160
Bring her here!

142
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,840
Yan Dan?

143
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,320
<i>Aren't you spoiling her too much?</i>

144
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,680
<i>Weapons are dangerous. She won't win against Ao Xuan if anything happens.</i>

145
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,240
<i>This plan is too risky.</i>

146
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,720
<i>How can you both hide this from me?</i>

147
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,780
<i>You know her personality as well.</i>

148
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,060
<i>If you don't obey her will, she might slip into the wedding </i>

149
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,440
<i>and take things into her own hands. Isn't that more dangerous?</i>

150
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,040
<i>No matter what, we shouldn't put her head inside the box.</i>

151
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,700
<i>Fine, then. We can drop that act</i>

152
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,000
<i>and change it to another one. Why don't we swap his consort with me?</i>

153
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,940
<i>Princess Zhao Lan, I'm Yan Dan, a friend of Yu Mo's.</i>

154
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,880
<i>Hurry and take off your gown.</i>

155
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,880
Where is Zhao Lan?

156
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,520
Bring me Zhao Lan immediately!

157
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,060
If not, I'll kill you!

158
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,200
Does an ugly toad like you deserve a beauty like her?

159
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,360
I've already instructed our men to send Her Highness back to the South Sea.

160
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,700
Now, she's the wife of our mountain chief.

161
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,760
Yan Dan, watch out!

162
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,860
Tang Zhou, remove his inverted scale!

163
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,180
It's on his chest!

164
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,820
Ao Xuan, you ruled like a tyrant and oppressed the people of the Four Seas.

165
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,000
I wasn't intending to hurt you.

166
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,720
If you surrender your throne now, I won't kill you, and I will treat your subordinates well.

167
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,260
Ao Xuan, you should surrender.

168
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:26,280
Back then, you were just another random fish in the divine pond.

169
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:31,760
How dare you covet the throne now and persuade the Three Seas to stage a rebellion?

170
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,400
You want me to surrender?

171
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,540
Dream on!

172
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,200
Sheng De!

173
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,780
They changed their plan suddenly. I had no idea.

174
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,920
Yu Mo was actually assisted by Emperor Ying Yuan?

175
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,080
Why have you never mentioned that to me?

176
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,060
I... I am but an ordinary mage.

177
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,170
An Emperor? I have no idea what you're talking about.

178
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,060
Do you take me for a fool?

179
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,150
After you left, I had someone investigate your background.

180
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:15,780
You're Ying Deng, the ex-curator of Magical Pavilion.

181
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:21,700
You better pray that you're important enough to them.

182
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,240
If so, I shall swap you for Zhao Lan.

183
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:31,040
If not, I will show you the price of tricking me.

184
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,600
- What are you trying to do?
- Heavenly Emperor announced His Majesty died during his trial in the Mortal Realm.

185
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,180
Now I know he faked his death.

186
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,000
He lives here with a hidden identity.

187
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,940
Don't lie to me!

188
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,600
Love is forbidden in the Heavenly Realm!

189
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,500
You were banished to the Mortal Realm because of love.

190
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,140
Even now, you're still committing the same crime.

191
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,800
Fine.

192
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,360
Let me grant you your wish!

193
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:24,040
I've been lighting the dark for His Majesty ever since I was a divine object spirit.

194
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,800
I stood guard over him for 10,000 years.

195
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,460
Naturally, I'm loyal to him.

196
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,160
Protecting him is my priority.

197
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,800
That was the case in the Heavenly Realm.

198
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,940
And all the more so...

199
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,880
in the Mortal Realm.

200
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,600
His Majesty was harmed during his trial.

201
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,960
I'm sure someone in the Heavenly Realm did it intentionally.

202
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,640
No one shall know...

203
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,360
that His Majesty is still alive.

204
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,420
<i>Sheng De?</i>

205
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,800
<i>Sheng De, are you okay?</i>

206
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,440
<i>Sheng De, where are you?</i>

207
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,520
Sheng De?

208
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,080
Sheng De, are you okay?

209
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,960
Are you okay?

210
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,640
Ao Xuan wanted to swap me for Zhao Lan.

211
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,560
I wasn't willing to submit to him.

212
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,380
He tried to kill me.

213
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:41,040
While defending myself, I remembered that Young Master Tang removed his inverted scale.

214
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:45,520
So I killed him with the Soul-Crushing Hook when he got distracted.

215
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,380
It's fine. He deserved it.

216
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,340
Stop blaming yourself.

217
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,760
<i>Looks like the spiritual beast was also hurt by the soul-crushing hook.</i>

218
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,900
Ao Xuan is dead.

219
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,900
You should stop your meaningless defense.

220
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,940
Ao Xuan ruled like a tyrant.

221
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,400
The Four Seas hate him.

222
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,240
Why are you all still serving such an unwise ruler?

223
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:14,460
You were supposed to be the Dragon King of the Four Seas from the start.

224
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,940
Your clan was once an Immortal Clan.

225
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,740
But now, you're known as a demon.

226
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,920
Are you satisfied with that?

227
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:32,340
My days living as a demon have been the happiest days since I was born.

228
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:38,500
I'm willing to pay the price to live like that forever.

229
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,420
Your Majesty, I agreed to lead your troops for two reasons.

230
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,560
First, to repay your daughter for saving me twice.

231
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,840
Second, to fulfill my filial duties.

232
00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:00,640
Now that everyone knows about the meritorious deeds my parents did, I'm content.

233
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,780
As for my existence... I'm satisfied so long as my beloved knows about me.

234
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,560
What has this ring got to do with Ao Xuan?

235
00:22:28,266 --> 00:22:30,580
It's the spiritual beast of the White Dragon Clan.

236
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,820
The Phantom Griffin has the ability to transmit messages.

237
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,960
Ao Xuan and his father have one each.

238
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,240
This beast belonged to Ao Qi, the old dragon king.

239
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,340
<i>You just need to force the Nine Fins Clan into the valley.</i>

240
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,760
<i>The Asura Clan will annihilate them.</i>

241
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,440
<i>No one shall survive.</i>

242
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,880
<i>Then the White Dragon Clan can become the ruler of all the Aquatic Clans.</i>

243
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,950
The plots of the East Sea ever since taking over the Four Seas,

244
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:10,390
their tyrannical rule, and the rebellion, I shall report them all to His Supreme Majesty.

245
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,520
With the Phantom Griffin, we have ironclad evidence of their crime.

246
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,960
The truth of the Nine Fins Clan's annihilation can finally be revealed.

247
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,940
<i>The Divine Realm and Deity Realm are under our control.</i>

248
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:26,960
<i>We must protect Immortal Lord Bei Ming, Star Deity Ji Du, Marshal Huo De,</i>

249
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,140
<i>and especially the Four Emperor's safety.</i>

250
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,820
<i>Though their deaths would be hugely beneficial to us,</i>

251
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,420
<i>we cannot let the Devil Clan kill them now.</i>

252
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:38,200
<i>This concerns our 10,000-year plan. No mistakes are allowed.</i>

253
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,480
Those statements were uttered by the same person.

254
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,800
Your Majesty, do you know who he is?

255
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:49,320
Judging by his tone, he should be from the Heavenly Realm.

256
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,840
In the past, Ao Qi sent this Phantom Griffin to the Heavenly Realm quite often.

257
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,820
Seems like the old dragon king was getting instructions from someone.

258
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:05,100
And the War of Genesis and Divine-Devil War were part of his plan, too.

259
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:11,440
Could it be that this the person is behind the deaths of the three emperors,

260
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,740
Immortal Lord Bei Ming and Star Deity Ji Du?

261
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,900
<i>So Master didn't die in the war. He was killed by someone.</i>

262
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:27,220
<i>Just like my parents, he suffered a wrongful death.</i>

263
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,680
Commander Yu Mo.

264
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:44,820
If it weren't for Immortal Lord Bei Ming, I would've perished in their plot 10,000 years ago.

265
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,800
I cannot live on without avenging him.

266
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,860
It's just that we don't yet know who the mastermind is.

267
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,780
If we report he Nine Fins Clan's annihilation plot right now,

268
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:00,070
I'm afraid we'll alert him to our discovery. And it will implicate your clan.

269
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,160
That's why we mustn't submit the evidence just yet.

270
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,620
Yu Mo, there's no need to go after it.

271
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,600
Phantom Griffins tend to seek out their owners.

272
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,230
If their previous master is dead, they will track

273
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:19,820
and locate the last person who transmitted a message through them.

274
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:24,440
If you wish to find that person, you must let it go.

275
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,320
It's just that the Phantom Griffin doesn't leave any traces behind.

276
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,910
If we can't find the mastermind, our evidence will be gone.

277
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:39,180
If he's still alive, whether in the Nine Heavens or the Night Forgetting River, I will capture him myself.

278
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:43,700
I can only be appeased by killing him myself.

279
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,100
You and Young Master Tang are great friends.

280
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:50,090
He was also one of the lucky few to survive both wars.

281
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:55,860
When he returns to the Heavenly Realm, he'll surely help you find out the truth and arrest the culprit himself.

282
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:01,600
Just like what the Phantom Griffin said, Young Master Tang was almost killed by the same person back then.

283
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,500
Now, he's here to undergo his trial.

284
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,240
His trial has been full of difficulties.

285
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,960
I'm afraid he might be in danger again.

286
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,820
Both of you have assisted the South Sea in getting through this ordeal.

287
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,540
I have no way to repay you both.

288
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:18,860
There's a treasure in the South Sea that might help Young Master Tang.

289
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,320
Sheng De was acting suspiciously before the war.

290
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,200
And the incident with the Phantom Griffin ring was highly suspicious, too.

291
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:37,280
If she was devious enough... to collude with Ao Xuan,

292
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:43,720
I'm afraid she might be devious enough to set up the so-called "rescue" in the palace.

293
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,920
Not just that, Pei Luo's relationship with Jiang Chen got worse because of his greed.

294
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,390
Regardless, he didn't need to resort to killing her.

295
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:55,110
And Pei Luo is an ordinary human.

296
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:57,900
Even so, he obtained immense power.

297
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,660
Could it be that it was related to Sheng De?

298
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:04,280
If so, why are you still brewing medicine for her?

299
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,790
I'm just suspicious of her. I have no solid evidence against her.

300
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:17,350
However, even if she can hide everything, I'm sure I'm right about her on one thing.

301
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:19,160
I'm sure that she loves you.

302
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:24,260
If not, why would she give up on her luxurious life and ask for you to stay out of the battle?

303
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,040
So are you saying...

304
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,540
That's right! You should deliver the medicine to her.

305
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,440
You can try to seduce her and get some information out of her.

306
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,860
But acting is your expertise. I'll leave it to you.

307
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,760
It's not that hard to act. Just be attentive towards her.

308
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,380
You can also verify whether she's the girl in your dream.

309
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,400
What are you doing?

310
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,800
What are you doing?

311
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:14,880
Is this how I'd do it?

312
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:19,840
If so, why don't you teach me how to act?

313
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,340
You must be out of your mind!

314
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,340
I was just joking around.

315
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:09,200
<i>Since Yu Mo has obtained the ring, I'm sure he's more suspicious of me.</i>

316
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,740
<i>Now that Ao Xuan is dead... I shall do it myself.</i>

317
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:21,860
Miss Sheng De, Miss Yan Dan has brewed a soothing soup for you.

318
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,760
<i>I'll place it at your doorstep.</i>

319
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,400
Young Master Tang, I feel very unwell.

320
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,640
<i>I don't know if my meridian was damaged.</i>

321
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,600
Can you please come inside and examine me?

322
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,700
You haven't used any spells for the past few days.

323
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,120
I don't think your meridian is damaged.

324
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,960
Young Master Tang... I feel very weak.

325
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,820
Can you please sit beside me and examine my pulse?

326
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,820
Young Master Tang, can you please come closer?

327
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,740
We should be reserved. Just give me your wrist.

328
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,580
Young Master.

329
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,460
Miss Sheng De, please mind your behavior.

330
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:45,400
Your reputation will be ruined if other people see this.

331
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,100
Please let go.

332
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,280
This palace is humid and hot.

333
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:55,580
Due to the humidity, I feel cold and weak.

334
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:59,040
Miss Sheng De, please let go of me.

335
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,520
I'm so cold. Young Master Tang, please provide me with some warmth.

336
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,830
It's Lingxiao Sect's duty is to aid the people.

337
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,180
I'm one of the many people here.

338
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,900
Young Master Tang, are you going to do nothing for me?

339
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,600
Do you truly want me to save you?

340
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,680
What is this?

341
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,400
Didn't you want me to save you? I'm saving you now.

342
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,020
I already told you that I wasn't interested in you.

343
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:42,120
You just had to pester me. You are even willing to forsake your reputation.

344
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,810
This is the Love-Forgetting Curse.

345
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:47,560
Black spots will grow on your face for the next 7 days.

346
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:51,060
I pray that you regret your actions and stop pestering me.

347
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,220
Young Master, I love you.

348
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:57,760
I only want the best for you. Is that wrong?

349
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,440
In order to save you, I injected 10 years worth of power into the Moon View Cake.

350
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,380
But you... you didn't even touch the cake.

351
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:11,420
I was almost killed by Ao Xuan because I tried to stop him from reporting you to the Heavenly Realm.

352
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,780
You say that you're concerned about me.

353
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:21,720
However, you put Yu Mo and Yan Dan in danger.

354
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,880
That's wrong of you.

355
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,280
Ao Xuan's death is filled with doubts.

356
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,880
And you tried to harm them by taking advantage of the confusion.

357
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,580
That's your second mistake.

358
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,740
I hope you're not truly behind it.

359
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,100
If not, it's my mistake

360
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,960
for saving you in the first place.

361
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,360
If what I did was wrong, you'd be the cause of it.

362
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:48,820
You only know that my hands are dirty. But I did everything because of you!

363
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,500
Your celestial vest is torn.

364
00:32:54,500 --> 00:33:01,740
If you don't locate the other divine tools soon, you'll perish in one year due to the immense power.

365
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,890
There's only one person in the world who knows how to cure you.

366
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:06,300
That's me!

367
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:10,320
And there's only one person who can act as your medicine.

368
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,680
That's Yan Dan.

369
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,820
What have you done to her?

370
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,460
I've never hurt her.

371
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,860
Yet you point your sword at me.

372
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:31,820
If you hurt her, this sword will pierce through your heart.

373
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,580
The living beings that you deemed more important than your life, the Three Realms,

374
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:43,400
can you abandon everything for her sake?

375
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,600
You cultivated your powers in the Heavenly Realm for many years and saved all those living beings from calamities.

376
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,900
But now, you're abandoning everything for the sake of a lotus demon?

377
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:00,500
Listen, the Three Realms still exist because of you.

378
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,940
If you don't kill Yan Dan today,

379
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:09,140
the Three Realms will be in trouble when you perish.

380
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,660
Do not spout nonsense in front of me.

381
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,230
I'm not doing it for Yan Dan's sake.

382
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,280
You said that you had a noble task to accomplish, and that you had no feelings for her.

383
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,330
You are just deceiving yourself.

384
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:31,340
You've already fallen for Yan Dan. Am I right?

385
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:35,120
That has nothing to do with you.

386
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:39,580
Only the unorthodox would use one's life as medicine.

387
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:42,060
Do not try to deceive me again.

388
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:46,400
If you dare to spout nonsense in front of Yu Mo and Yan Dan again...

389
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,000
I will not spare you.

390
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,040
I will send you back to your sect according to our promise.

391
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,925
You better don't deceive me.

392
00:34:54,925 --> 00:34:59,720
If I realize something's off after you return to the sect,

393
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:04,180
besides slaying demons, I can slay evil humans with my sword too.

394
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,320
Are you going to kill me?

395
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,540
If you deserve to die...

396
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,040
I won't let you off.

397
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,160
<i>I've already made up my mind.</i>

398
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,260
<i>In the future, if I do pass the divine exam and become a high-level deity, </i>

399
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,840
<i>I will be the leader of the Heavenly Infirmary.</i>

400
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,420
<i>I won't need to live at someone's mercy.</i>

401
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:45,080
<i>Dream on. Ying Deng, what about you?</i>

402
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,400
<i>I'm a divine attendant assigned to His Majesty by His Supreme Majesty.</i>

403
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,800
<i>He will enlighten my divine power one day.</i>

404
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,400
<i>By then, I'll stay by his side forever and enjoy a luxurious life.</i>

405
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,600
<i>What are you doing?</i>

406
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:24,900
<i>You spent half a day barely cleaning a cauldron and the floor?</i>

407
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,600
<i>Hurry up.</i>

408
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,200
<i>Are you itching for a beating?</i>

409
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,600
<i>Listen up.</i>

410
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,300
<i>The King of Andu is coming here to practice his magic skills today.</i>

411
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:37,900
<i>The Hexin Sect will kick you out if you delay this any longer.</i>

412
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,900
<i>For your sake, I endured humiliations and insults.</i>

413
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:28,800
<i>I endured everything. And I finally became a consort.</i>

414
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,400
<i>I only had one wish.</i>

415
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,600
<i>That was to reunite with you in the Mortal Realm.</i>

416
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:40,800
<i>I was elated when we encountered each other in the palace.</i>

417
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,400
<i>I came up with plans for your sake.</i>

418
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,400
<i>In the end, you pointed your sword toward me...</i>

419
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,800
<i>and threatened to kill me.</i>

420
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,200
<i>His Majesty is just down there to go through the mortal trials.</i>

421
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,000
<i>He'll return to the Heavenly Palace one day.</i>

422
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,200
<i>However, you can never come back.</i>

423
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:47,300
<i>You'll go through the pain of being a mortal in the Mortal Realm.</i>

424
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:54,100
<i>I'm sure, for the pretentious Fairy Ying Deng, this is a fate worse than death.</i>

425
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,800
This time...

426
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,500
I'll not let you do what you did in the Heavenly Realm.

427
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,800
I'll not let you suffer because of Yan Dan.

428
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:14,700
Your Majesty... no matter if you appreciate it or not...

429
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:19,500
this time... I have to do this.

430
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,400
Your Majesty.

431
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,600
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

432
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,200
Your Majesty has saved the South Sea.

433
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,100
I have no way to repay the favor.

434
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,900
The South Sea is lacking in supplies.

435
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,400
We don't have excellent divine artifacts or manuals.

436
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,600
This pearl shines like the stars.

437
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,600
It's the treasure of the South Sea.

438
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,300
Your Majesty, please accept it.

439
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:03,100
We only managed to defeat Ao Xuan because of Yu Mo's plan.

440
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,600
I dare not take the credit.

441
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,200
This item is too precious.

442
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,600
Your Majesty, please take it back.

443
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:14,200
Your Majesty, I do have something to ask you.

444
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,600
Your Majesty, please go ahead.

445
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,800
I shall tell you what I know.

446
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,300
Your Majesty,

447
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:37,000
back then, when I was still a deity, did I let anyone down?

448
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,100
Your Majesty was a graceful presence to the world.

449
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,600
You always followed the rules.

450
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,800
And helping the world was the only thing you did.

451
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,000
How could you let anyone down?

452
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
What if it doesn't concern all living beings?

453
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,700
I have always dreamed of a girl...

454
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,600
ever since I could remember things.

455
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,300
She jumped off a bridge with a sorrowful look.

456
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:09,800
Whenever I wake up, I feel heartbroken and guilty.

457
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,600
Maybe this is my past memory.

458
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,800
Your Majesty has a noble identity.

459
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:24,700
Although I was lucky enough to see you in person, we were not close to each other.

460
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,000
I do not know much about Your Majesty.

461
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,200
However, Your Majesty, if you wish to find out who the girl is,

462
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,600
this pearl can aid you.

463
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,400
It's called Recall Memory Pearl.

464
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,800
It can help to draw out one's memories.

465
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,800
If you consume it in powder form, you will remember your past experiences.

466
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,700
Your Majesty, the South Sea is deeply indebted to you.

467
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,200
I have no way to repay you.

468
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,400
Your Majesty, the sooner you regain your memories,

469
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,000
the sooner you can retrieve the divine artifacts and return to the Heavenly Palace.

470
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,800
That would benefit the Three Realms immensely.

471
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,000
Princess Zhao Lan!

472
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,800
You can just call me sister.

473
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,500
Why aren't you studying today?

474
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,800
Instead, you're sulking here alone.

475
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,400
Today we were practicing our magic skills.

476
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,700
I did badly in class. My classmates teased me for it.

477
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,200
They said the Four Seas would wage war against each other soon.

478
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,700
If I don't know how to use magic skills, the East Sea might be in jeopardy in the future.

479
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:51,000
Sister Zhao Lan, will the East Sea be in jeopardy in the future?

480
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,000
I promise you this.

481
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
The Three Seas won't invade the East Sea.

482
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,400
From now on, there will be no war in the Four Seas.

483
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:08,200
Your parents won't need to bear the heavy taxes that they used to bear.

484
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:11,400
And your siblings won't need to be slaves.

485
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,200
The East Sea will get better and better.

486
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,200
Sister Zhao Lan, I even heard that you will be the new Dragon Queen of the Four Seas.

487
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,900
Is that true?

488
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,000
You're right.

489
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,400
Brother Yu Mo.

490
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,900
Zhao Lan will definitely become a compassionate and loving dragon queen.

491
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,400
I promise you that.

492
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,000
The throne is vacant.

493
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,100
To calm the people's hearts, Father and everyone else hope that I can inherit the throne.

494
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:50,700
However... I've never prepared to be a ruler.

495
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:55,600
And my magic skills and cultivation aren't the best.

496
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,400
That's why I'm very worried.

497
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,200
There's no need to worry.

498
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,600
You don't need powerful magic skills to be a ruler.

499
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,200
That's the job of a warrior.

500
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,200
You don't need to be well-versed in tactics either.

501
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,200
That's the job of a strategist.

502
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,800
You have the best trait that a ruler should have... that is a loving and compassionate heart.

503
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,600
That's the one quality that all rulers need.

504
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:21,400
However, I think you're better for the position.

505
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:26,000
You're wrong. There's one attribute you have that I don't.
