<i>and be together, safely and happily.</i>

17
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,659
How is His Majesty now?

18
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,159
His Majesty's vital energy has been severely depleted.

19
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,159
He's lost a lot of power and lacks the strength to recover.

20
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,320
We could only try our best to keep his divine power safe.

21
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:17,200
Whether His Majesty can wake up and recover depends on him.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,419
If His Majesty can't be awakened for a thousand or ten thousand years, what should we do?

23
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:26,859
Normally, the pulse of comatose people is stable, while His Majesty's pulse is erratic.

24
00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:30,619
Perhaps His Majesty has a deep attachment to this place, making him restless.

25
00:02:30,619 --> 00:02:36,019
Since he has such a strong will, His Majesty will wake up one day.

<i>I caught a big fish!</i>

00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,480
- <i>Really?
- Look!</i>

29
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,520
<i>- Yes. It really is a big fish.
- There are other types too.</i>

30
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,020
<i>- Pass it to me.
- There are more over there.</i>

31
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,620
<i>Be careful.</i>

32
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,460
<i>There are more on that side.</i>

00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,440
<i>Be careful.</i>

00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,160
<i>I've got this.</i>

35
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,900
Lu Ming? You cultivated for 800 years

36
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,179
to get out of the Pavilion of Books and become His Supreme Majesty's attendant.

37
00:05:34,179 --> 00:05:37,220
Why do you keep coming to our Pavilion of Books?

38
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,960
Today is Yan Dan's birthday.

39
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:48,720
Her birthday makes me think of when Yan Dan and I would have fun together in the past.

40
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,560
I wonder if she's living a good life in the mortal world.

41
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,380
Was she able to meet up with Yu Mo?

42
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,600
I just can't help but worry about all this.

43
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,759
How about you sort out the scriptures with me, to distract yourself and change your mood?

44
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,390
The Underworld King from Night Forgetting River sent in so many petitions.

45
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,710
And we're short on manpower right now.

46
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,639
By the way, river crossers who fail to cross the river in nine hundred years turn into ash.

47
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,900
Most spirits cross the river in seven days.

48
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,630
There hasn't been an exception in thousands of years,

49
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,759
but today, an Underworld guard handed in a record of failed river crossers.

50
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,139
He said that there's a Heavenly Realm fairy who's been with him for over 800 years and not crossed yet.

51
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:33,979
He made a special request to the Heavenly Court, enquiring if amnesty was possible.

52
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,370
<i>[Yan Dan, the immortal attendant of the Heavenly Realm]</i>

53
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:58,480
<i>I can't see the flame clearly. Even the pain is dull.</i>

54
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,780
<i>However, the pain in my heart hasn't decreased at all.</i>

55
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,340
<i>Perhaps, once I've lost all my senses...</i>

56
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,860
<i>it won't hurt anymore.</i>

57
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,560
Lu Ming, why are you so panicked?

58
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,560
Yan Dan has been crossing Night Forgetting River for 800 years, but she never finished the journey!

59
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,980
She'll reach the nine hundred-year deadline in a few days!

60
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,670
Yan Dan's life is going to end soon!

61
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:35,939
Are you satisfied now?

62
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,240
How can that be possible?

63
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,340
I clearly saw her name in the list of river crossers.

64
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,170
<i>[House of Rascal]</i>

65
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,040
Your Majesty, please wake up!

66
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,640
Yan Dan will turn into ash if you don't go and save her!

67
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,640
Your Majesty!

68
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:25,020
Both you and Yan Dan were deeply in love with each other...

69
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,860
yet you were separated and ended up in a sorrowful parting.

70
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,620
Your Majesty... for Yan Dan's sake...

71
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,900
Please wake up!

72
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,660
Fairy Zhi Xi.

73
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,980
I'll atone for the mistake I made.

74
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,340
I'll never allow any accidents to happen to Yan Dan again.

75
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,880
Zhi Xi, thank you so much.

76
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,000
If His Majesty wakes up...

77
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,800
you don't need to tell him about what I did.

78
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,960
I'm ashamed of what I did to them.

79
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:04,360
Please don't let His Majesty think he owes me.

80
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:25,599
Curator, this Underworld King really fawns over people, sending so many divine tools to the Heavenly Realm every year.

81
00:10:25,599 --> 00:10:30,079
So what if there are more of them? They're all just metal scraps.

82
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,870
If it weren't for his severe wound, that could only be healed

83
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:38,210
by medicine from the Heavenly Realm, why would he be so diligent?

84
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:42,180
He's the ruler of Night Forgetting River. How could he have been so severely injured?

85
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,810
Why would I care about that?

86
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,950
But it's good that he's injured.

87
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:53,260
Once a person has a weakness, he can be of great use.

88
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,219
- What's this?
- A Sonic Bat.

89
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:05,039
Once you release the bat, you can hear sounds from afar and converse with people.

90
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,200
This is quite a useful divine tool.

91
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,919
Curator, His Majesty has awakened.

92
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,680
Really?

93
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,579
When I heard that His Majesty was awake, I'm here to visit him with dew that protects divine power.

94
00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:30,720
His Majesty is currently meeting with someone.

95
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,820
He made it clear that no one is allowed to enter.

96
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,359
Curator Ying Deng, if you enter the room without permission, His Majesty might be unhappy.

97
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:41,859
Your kindness would be wasted.

98
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:47,559
Why don't you wait to visit His Majesty after he returns to Yanxu Heavenly Palace?

99
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,200
In that case, I'll come another day.

100
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,340
Please relay this message to him for me.

101
00:11:55,340 --> 00:12:00,530
During the eight hundred years that His Majesty was in a coma, I've been praying daily.

102
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:04,200
Hopefully, His Majesty can grant me an audience.

103
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:31,545
<i>[Yan Dan, immortal attendant from Heavenly Realm, is still wandering in Night Forgetting River. I ask for amnesty...]</i>

104
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:39,300
The water of Night Forgetting River weakens one's past and will.

105
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,920
There has been no exception over the past thousands of years.

106
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,060
But she's been walking alone...

107
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,200
in Night Forgetting River for over eight hundred years.

108
00:12:54,040 --> 00:13:00,100
How did she manage... to endure so many days and nights?

109
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,800
<i>[River Crossers of the Night Forgetting River]</i>

110
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:16,080
Yan Dan never yearned for ascension. She only wanted to live in freedom.

111
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:26,739
However, Your Majesty refused to meet with her for the so-called future, forcing her to jump off the Bridge of Emptiness.

112
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:33,760
One who fails to cross the Night Forgetting River in nine hundred years will be turned to ash and disappear.

113
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,920
Your Majesty, do you wish to see her turn into ash?

114
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,700
How long until the deadline of nine hundred years?

115
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,228
Only three days are left.

116
00:13:51,732 --> 00:13:53,472
Please think carefully, Your Majesty.

117
00:13:53,472 --> 00:13:56,675
You must rescue her and keep her safe.

118
00:13:56,675 --> 00:13:58,900
I hereby express my gratitude...

119
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,120
on Yan Dan's behalf.

120
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,900
So I was wrong from the beginning.

121
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,740
She sacrificed her heart for me.

122
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,560
While I...

123
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,020
I never understood her.

124

00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,859
Your Majesty, the Night Forgetting River is just up ahead.

127
00:15:19,859 --> 00:15:22,059
Without a decree from His Supreme Majesty, no one is allowed to enter.

128
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:24,299
Please don't come forward anymore, or you're forcing my hand.

129
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,720
Move.

130
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,840
Ying Yuan!

131
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,780
- Your Supreme Majesty.
- <i>Your Supreme Majesty.</i>

132
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,459
You abandoned your duty as an emperor for hundreds of years.

133
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:43,959
You finally woke up. Are you going to violate the Heavenly Rules and keep making mistakes?

134
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:50,240
Your Supreme Majesty, there's something I can't let go of. I need to go to Night Forgetting River to save someone.

135
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:57,340
Ying Yuan, if you still insist, I will punish you as per the Heavenly Rules!

136
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:01,819
Your Majesty, you're one of the Greater Gods of the Heavenly Realm, and a role model for them.

137
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:05,739
If you publicly go against His Supreme Majesty, how does that set an example?

138
00:16:05,739 --> 00:16:08,360
Everyone is forbidden from violating the Heavenly Rules.

139
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:12,320
Since I've done so, I'll naturally punish myself.

140
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:22,060
The first punishment is for the assault of the heavenly soldiers.

141
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,920
The second punishment is for defiance against His Supreme Majesty.

142
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,960
The third punishment is for breaking into Night Forgetting River without permission.

143
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,960
I've executed the punishments myself.

144
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,820
I beg for your forgiveness, Your Supreme Majesty.

145
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:17,650
If it's not enough, I'll go to the Heavenly Gallows to receive punishment when I return.

146
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,520
Thank you for allowing it, Your Supreme Majesty.

147
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:18,640
<i>Yan Dan, I will never allow you to return alive.</i>

148
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,799
I wonder if my petition was received by someone from the Heavenly Realm.

149
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,040
Will Yan Dan really perish into ash?

150
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,460
Your Majesty, why are you here again?

151
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,610
Are you here to rescue Yan Dan?

152
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,560
<i>How much have you suffered...</i>

153
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,080
<i>to end up in such a state?</i>

154
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,420
<i>Hundreds of years have passed.</i>

155
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:52,200
<i>Are you... still willing to see me?</i>

156
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,020
Yi Cang.

157
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:13,810
I'm so sorry. I still couldn't let go of the past today, nor cross the Night Forgetting River.

158
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,560
I've delayed your mission again.

159
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:23,600
Yan Dan, we've known each other for many years.

160
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,680
There's no need to speak as if you were a stranger.

161
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,460
I'll help you cross Night Forgetting River.

162
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,440
You'll definitely be safe.

163
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,440
It's been almost nine hundred years. Yet I've failed to let go.

164
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,480
There are only two days left before the deadline.

165
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,719
I still can't forget the past.

166
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:48,300
And now, my sense of sight, pain,

167
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:52,580
and taste is all disappearing.

168
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:58,200
Meanwhile, my memories won't fade, even a little.

169
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,880
I would rather be dead.

170
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,320
I'm sorry.

171
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,880
You don't have to feel bad for me.

172
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:13,340
In two days, I'll be free.

173
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,080
I'm not going back to the inn today.

174
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,780
I'm just going to sit by Night Forgetting River and wait for it quietly.

175
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,800
Yan Dan.

176
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,700
Another day you live through is another day to hope.

177
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,940
I'll take you back to the inn now.

178
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,080
Let's go.

179
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,330
I've taken a liking to burning incense lately.

180
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,480
But I have no one to share it with.

181
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:27,620
Why don't you smell this fragrance and let me know what you think?

182
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,100
<i>Her sense of smell still exists.</i>

183
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,000
Don't be afraid.

184
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:07,040
You've been in the water the entire day. Your body must be cold.

185
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,200
Hold onto this hand warmer for now.

186
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:15,430
♫ <i> My most bewildering memory is the moonlight falling like frost on the ground full of fallen leaves </i> ♫

187
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,600
♫ <i> For a single teardrop,</i> ♫

188
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,980
Do you feel warmer now?

189
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,410
♫ <i> I'm drowning myself in sorrow, obsessing with forgetting you </i> ♫

190
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,760
<i> She still has the sense of touch.</i>

191
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,180
♫ <i> If we'd have to walk till we separate, </i> ♫

192
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,540
Don't worry.

193
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:32,580
♫ <i> Turn around and become </i> ♫

194
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,860
Get some good rest tonight.

195
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,660
Tomorrow, let's cross the river together.

196
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:43,640
In the past nine hundred years, I have never slept soundly.

197
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:49,669
♫ <i> My loneliness and longing for you leaves a mark like fragments of the moon </i> ♫

198
00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:55,060
Today is New Year's Eve for Night Forgetting River. They'll play a soulful song.

199
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,779
It will help calm you.

200
00:23:57,779 --> 00:24:02,650
Tonight, you'll definitely have good dreams.

201
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:11,829
♫ <i> You are the breeze of a fallen flower in the world of flowers adding to the mound of fallen flowers </i> ♫

202
00:24:11,829 --> 00:24:18,129
♫ <i> Will you shed tears over the truth of the mortal world? </i> ♫

203
00:24:18,129 --> 00:24:25,969
♫ <i> You're like the unattainable Autumn Moon in the vast sky, don't dare to shine bright yet not hesitate to shine </i> ♫

204
00:24:25,969 --> 00:24:32,509
♫ <i> In my dream, the one I loved is with me </i> ♫

205
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:54,219
♫ <i> The mortal life is short yet we suffered for love with lovers not living up to expectations </i> ♫

206
00:24:54,219 --> 00:25:01,119
♫ <i> A beautiful night can be barren but yet it sees my hatred is full to the brim </i> ♫

207
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:08,420
♫ <i> As the wind blows and flowers bloom, I could not forget what I'm supposed to </i> ♫

208
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:14,590
♫ <i> Those who found each other should not be forced to separate </i> ♫

209
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:18,829
♫ <i> A lifetime of heartfelt feelings is mistakenly turned into a lies like a cloak in winter </i> ♫

210
00:25:18,829 --> 00:25:26,670
<i>You've always kept the hairpin.</i>

211
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:33,030
<i>Yan Dan. I won't let you die.</i>

212
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:37,700
<i>The benevolence of the Heavenly Realm is too great to be repaid.</i>

213
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:42,675
<i>Fortunately, this time, I have the chance...</i>

214
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:44,815
<i>to protect you.</i>

215
00:25:56,735 --> 00:26:04,674
♫ <i> After bidding farewell, when Spring becomes Autumn, where can I find my heart in this world? </i> ♫

216
00:26:04,674 --> 00:26:11,014
♫ <i> Several lifetimes will not be enough for our parting </i> ♫

217
00:26:11,014 --> 00:26:18,675
♫ <i> As I watch lovers enjoying fireworks on the riverbanks, my love and longing for you makes my pain unbearable </i>♫

218
00:26:18,675 --> 00:26:25,974
♫ <i> There will be a time when the world is beautiful </i> ♫

219
00:26:25,974 --> 00:26:33,874
♫ <i> When the lotus blossoms again, you and I will be together </i> ♫

220
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,220
Your Highness, I've checked the entire dowry.

221
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:05,680
Do you think she will like all this?

222
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,679
Your Highness, you've almost moved all of the treasures from the Four Seas to here.

223
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:11,720
How could Princess Zhao Lan not like it?

224
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:25,699
Back then, she fell sick after returning from the Heavenly Realm.

225
00:27:25,699 --> 00:27:30,019
For eight hundred years, I've been sending people to check on her secretly.

226
00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:32,740
I heard that she's gotten better recently.

227
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:36,999
A few days ago, she even went to visit the Clam Clan and asked for a few bottles of clam pearl dew.

228
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:39,540
I guess she's fond of its lustre.

229
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:45,080
So I bought all the pearl dew for her. It's all here.

230
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:54,180
Your Highness, Her Highness suffers from a recurring illness. She can barely rise from her bed.

231
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,480
Her Highness really can't welcome you by herself.

232
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,020
Your Highness, please come another day to discuss the proposal.

233
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:17,379
Princess, this clam pearl dew is so precious.

234
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,000
Even in the South Sea it is hard to gather a few bottles.

235
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,439
Other princesses use it to maintain their beauty, but you use it on that scale.

236
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:26,419
What exactly is the story behind this scale?

237
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,739
Is it really that precious?

238
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,040
Yes, it is.

239
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,560
It's the most precious thing to me.

240
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,640
<i>Your Highness, you can't go in!</i>

241
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,619
Your Highness! Your Highness! You can't go in.

242
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,480
Princess.

243
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,819
Your maidservant said you're too sick to get out of bed.

244
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:50,019
But looking at your fine complexion and high spirits, you don't look frail at all.

245
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:54,060
I think you're pretending to be sick to delay our marriage.

246
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:58,059
With this trick, you've been deceiving me for over eight hundred years!

247
00:28:58,059 --> 00:29:01,140
What do you take the East Sea for?!

248
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,200
You may all leave.

249
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,820
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

250
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,239
Whether I'm sick or not, the imperial physician will decide.

251
00:29:14,239 --> 00:29:17,439
But we're not married yet, and you entered my room without permission.

252
00:29:17,439 --> 00:29:19,540
How is that appropriate?

253
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:27,320
In the Four Seas, the East Sea sets the rules!

254
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:33,439
Ao Xuan, you oppress and harm aquatic clans rampantly in your own waters. I can't say much about it.

255
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:38,600
But this is the South Sea. If you dare make trouble here, I'll report it to my Royal Father and have him cancel the marriage.

256
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:45,730
All right. I'll take you to see your father and talk about canceling the marriage right now.

257
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:48,859
What are you doing? What are you up to? Let go of me!

258
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,539
What's this?

259
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,240
Give it back to me!

260
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,420
Let go of me!

261
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:12,660
It's rare to see you so flustered. Looks like this does have some value.

262
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:18,520
Very good. I'll return it to you on the day you accept my proposal.

263
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,899
Ao Xuan! You're shameless!

264
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,100
You just enjoy the feeling of coercing others. Have you ever really loved me?

265
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,799
True. I don't have feelings for you.

266
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:37,320
I'm only marrying you for the South Sea's influence and power.

267
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,619
Even if you know the truth, do you think you can do anything to me?

268
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,839
Ao Xuan. Ao Xuan!

269
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,760
Greetings, Royal Father.

270
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,480
Royal Father!

271
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,420
I'm fine.

272
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,759
The subordinates of the East Sea hunt a clan down every year to refine them into spiritual power and help enhance your health.

273
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:56,040
But why are you still not getting better?

274
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:01,299
I'm getting old. Sooner or later, I'll leave this world.

275
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:05,459
Even if more spiritual power is obtained, it's futile.

276
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:09,959
Instead, I hope you can make achievements and ascend to the throne as soon as possible.

277
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:17,340
How did your marriage proposal go at the South Sea?

278
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,800
They keep delaying us.

279
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,880
However, I did get ahold of something today.

280
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,520
It may help in speeding up my marriage.

281
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,740
The Nine Fins?

282
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:55,120
I thought the clan was wiped out during the War of Genesis.

283
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,800
How could there be a remnant?

284
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,300
Royal Father, what are the "Nine Fins"?

285
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:05,220
It's an ancient bloodline that possesses both water and fire powers.

286
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,340
They were once the rulers of the Four Seas.

287
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:12,139
But... Isn't the Dragon Clan the ruler of the Aquatic Clans?

288
00:33:12,139 --> 00:33:20,599
Our Dragon Clan, could only rule the others after the demise of the Nine Fins Clan, when the Four Seas lost their ruler.

289
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:28,120
But now that the Nine Fins Clan has surfaced, the other Dragon and Aquatic Clans will definitely follow them.

290
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:33,280
If that time comes, forget a marriage with the South Sea...

291
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:39,560
I'm afraid also our status and lives would be at risk.

292
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:47,280
Why would the Nine Fins Clan suddenly appear?

293
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:53,160
Where has he been hiding all these years?

294
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:59,420
Ao Xuan. How did you get this?

295
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:08,080
When Zhao Lan and I were at Xuanxin Cliff in the Heavenly Realm, she got along well with a black fish.

296
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,700
That black fish was very strange.

297
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:18,640
<i>Instead of sleeping, what are you doing here at this late hour?</i>

298
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:28,399
He originates from the Aquatic Clans, but he could go through fire.

299
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,710
His spiritual power was strong enough to shatter the soul-returning spell.

300
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,600
At the time, I thought his power was strange.

301
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,280
Could he be from the Nine Fins Clan...

302
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:43,000
Immortal Lord Bei Ming had always been close to the Nine Fins Clan.

303
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,340
To have secretly rescued one of them at the time...

304
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,740
It is possible.

305
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,800
<i>Turns out this is the real reason why Zhao Lan refuses to marry me.</i>

306
00:34:59,439 --> 00:35:02,460
<i>Then I definitely can't allow you to live.</i>

307
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,220
Royal Father.

308
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:14,479
Since the Nine Fins Clan is a threat to our clan, we can never let the other Aquatic Clans discover that they still exist.

309
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:18,919
In the Heavenly Realm, I saw the Nine Fins clan member enter the Mortal Realm by breaking a hole in the sky.

310
00:35:18,919 --> 00:35:24,360
If he's in the mortal world now, then I'm sure I can kill him.

311
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,139
Royal Father, please grant me a small squadron.

312
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:31,200
I will eliminate him personally, to spare us any future trouble.

313
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,480
Very good.

314
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,720
As expected of you, my son.

315
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:43,700
In that case, I'll give you the secret weapon which we used to eliminate the Nine Fins Clan, the soul-crushing hook.

316
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,940
I'm approaching the end of my life now.

317
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:56,580
Only by having this man killed will I be able to pass the sovereignty of the Four Seas to you without worrying.

318
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,580
<i>Old man, you're losing control of me.</i>

319
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,819
<i>Back then, when you requested the underworld power,</i>

320
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:35,279
<i>did you ever think that you'd surrender yourself to me one day?</i>

321
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:50,479
<i>It turns out Underworld King can only conquer millions of spirits of the dead in Night Forgetting River</i>

322
00:36:50,479 --> 00:36:53,700
<i>because you drew underworld power from the Evil Spirits Diagram.</i>

323
00:36:53,700 --> 00:37:00,599
<i>Though the underworld power is powerful, if the host is weak and vulnerable, he'll suffer from heavy backlash.</i>

324
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,040
What kind of demon are you?

325
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,820
<i>Your Majesty, don't be angry.</i>

326
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:18,810
<i>If you hurt me, you won't have access to the antidote that can heal your wounds anymore.</i>

327
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,840
Tell me.

328
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,379
<i>There's a divine medicine in the Heavenly Realm, called the Four-Leaf Lotus.</i>

329
00:37:24,379 --> 00:37:27,979
<i>By refining this medicine, you can bring the dead back to life and cure all illnesses.</i>

330
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:30,419
<i>You will be healed if you get one.</i>

331
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:35,330
How do I get this divine medicine?

332
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:39,579
<i>This Four-Leaf Lotus has transformed into a human form, called Yan Dan.</i>

333
00:37:39,579 --> 00:37:42,139
<i>She violated the Heavenly Rules by trying to escape from Heavenly Realm.</i>

334
00:37:42,139 --> 00:37:45,500
<i>She is currently hiding in Night Forgetting River.</i>

335
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:50,360
<i>Don't miss such a precious opportunity, Your Majesty.</i>

336
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:02,860
What's your motive for telling me all this?

337
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:11,140
<i>You need this medicine to cure your illness, while I want it to disappear forever.</i>

338
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:16,020
<i>We're just helping each other for mutual benefit.</i>

339
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,480
Yi Cang, what is this place?

340
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,240
Why does it feel different from the water I usually cross?

341
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:54,150
The water is fast here, and river crossers rarely pass by.

342
00:38:55,220 --> 00:39:00,400
Miss, you've been here for almost nine hundred years.

343
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:09,240
Before leaving here, I'd like to have you experience the most beautiful place at Night Forgetting River.

344
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,260
There's no need.

345
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:15,640
Wading through the river, I've already lost my eyesight.

346
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:21,600
Now I can only sense some light. How could I see any scenery?

347
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,680
Do you smell the fragrance of flowers?

348
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:56,560
This way... it's as good as seeing it.

349
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:04,160
<i>And I've made good on our promise to watch the flowers bloom together.</i>

350
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,960
This is... a butterfly flapping its wings.

351
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,919
Night Forgetting River is an extremely cold place. How could a butterfly be born here?

352
00:40:29,919 --> 00:40:31,820
It's only rare...

353
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:37,000
to see living creatures here.

354
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:43,900
However, in the mortal world, there aren't only flying butterflies.

355
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,860
You can also see rain, snow, and the four seasons.

356
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:57,280
I think it's better than Night Forgetting River and Heavenly Realm.

357
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,420
Once you leave here...

358
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,960
you may start anew.

359
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:13,200
I can't let go of the past, nor can I cross the river.

360
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,120
Even if the mortal world is a wonderful place, it has nothing to do with me.

361
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:25,680
Miss, as long as you're willing to go...

362
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,860
I can help you.

363
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,080
I...

364
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:48,700
I've only worked here for a few months. It wasn't easy to finally have some time to taste some wine.

365
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:54,580
Who was so cruel that he even had to break my bottle?

366
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,860
Who's this?

367
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:00,120
Don't be afraid. It's just a drunk guard.

368
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:12,180
- Butterfly of Lucid Dreaming?
- "Butterfly of Lucid Dreaming"?

369
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,360
Wasn't its cocoon already destroyed?

370
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:19,600
How did it break free from the cocoon and then appear in the Night Forgetting River?

371
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,580
I've read about it in the scriptures...

372
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:29,420
It's said that the Butterfly of Lucid Dreaming is an ancient creature...

373
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:33,660
and its reincarnation is caused by love.

374
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,780
Only...

375
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,580
Today, the Underworld King gathered the troops for training.

376
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:44,899
All of the guards have gone to the main hall. Why are you still here?

377
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,220
You better leave now.

378
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,040
