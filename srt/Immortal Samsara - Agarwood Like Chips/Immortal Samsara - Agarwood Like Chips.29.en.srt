15
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,200
Young Master Tang.

16
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,500
I'm sure you're exhausted from your travels.

17
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,600
I made some tea for you.

18
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,000
You may sit and take a break first.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,200
No need.

20
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,600
I have a mission to finish, so I won't trouble you, Side Consort.

21
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,800
<i>The Side Consort is offering you tea.</i>

22
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,400
<i>You'll be disrespecting her if you don't accept it.</i>

23
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,300
<i>You should act casually so that we can get some intel out of her.</i>

24
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,300
Stop messing around.

25
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,200
Young Master Tang, there is no need to be anxious.

26
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,800
Please enjoy your tea.

27
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,600
I will tell you about the situation within the palace.

28
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,200
Thank you, Side Consort.

29
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:25,600
By the way, Side Consort, who wields the divine tools for cultivation in the palace?

30
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,000
His Majesty loves the art of cultivation.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,600
He got to know me during his journey.

32
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,000
He forced me to become his side consort.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Since then, he made me create some divine tools, charms, and talismans for his cultivation.

34
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,400
Young Master, the cleansing talisman you saw was one of them.

35
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,000
However, as to why His Majesty needed them, and what he uses them for...

36
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,000
I have no idea.

37
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,600
This Pei Luo may seem devoted to Jiang Chen on the surface.

38
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Behind the scenes, he forces other maidens to be his concubines.

39
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,700
Looks like we were right about him. He was just pretending.

40
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,400
There is surely more to it than meets the eye.

41
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,800
If so, may I have a look at the cleansing talisman he used?

42
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,800
Both of us are cultivators.

43
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,000
We should help each other out.

44
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,200
I smell alcohol.

45
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,400
This item needs to be replaced every day.

46
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,000
This talisman was just replaced.

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,700
If it reeks of alcohol...

48
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,000
Then it must have been kept within the wine cellar.

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Thank you for clearing up my confusion.

50
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
I shall take my leave for now.

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,700
It does not matter.

52
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,200
Your Majesty...

53
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,800
Yan Dan...

54
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,200
We have plenty of time.

55
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,300
Your Majesty.

56
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,000
Your Majesty, what is that ornament you are wearing?

57
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,000
This?

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,400
The demon catcher who came to exorcise the palace before

59
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,600
gave me this Millennium Peach Wood as he was afraid that there might still be other demons around.

60
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,800
It can ward off evil and protect me.

61
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,400
Millennium Peach Wood is great for warding off evil.

62
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,000
But it has a fierce nature to it.

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It is hard to adjust to.

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,300
If it encounters a clashing object... it will backfire on you.

65
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,000
Your Majesty, why don't you let me take a look?

66
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Taoist Master, you do not need to worry about that.

67
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,800
I have mixed it with tortoiseshell, qilin's horn, and the soil of Huan, to boost its power.

68
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,600
I am making the best use of it.

69
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,800
<i>These are very specific materials.</i>

70
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,200
<i>Only cultivators would be familiar with them.</i>

71
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,800
<i>There's no way for him to be so familiar with such materials...</i>

72
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,600
<i>unless he's a cultivator himself.</i>

73
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,100
Your Majesty.

74
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,400
A Taoist Master visited the Side Consort's palace today.

75
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,000
I have some state affairs to attend to.

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,100
Taoist Master, please enjoy your drink.

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Your Majesty, please take your time.

78
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,500
<i>All the other candlesticks have wax on them.</i>

79
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,400
<i>Why is this candlestick so clean?</i>

80
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,200
<i>Could it be... that it is not used to light lamps?</i>

81
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,400
<i>I can detect divine power here.</i>

82
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,700
<i>This must be where Pei Luo practices his arts.</i>

83
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,800
<i>It's a shame that the demon-subduing talisman is here.</i>

84
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,600
<i>Only Tang Zhou can get rid of it.</i>

85
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,800
<i>Lucky man.</i>

86
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:39,500
<i>This liquor not only smells like plants and grains, but it also has a faint smell of blood</i>

87
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,300
I sent out the signal right before I entered the palace.

88
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,200
You came pretty quickly.

89
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,200
I was worried that your mediocre power might drag Yan Dan and me down.

90
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,000
<i>Hurry, come look!</i>

91
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,800
<i>They're the women who went missing before!</i>

92
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,400
All these women... died from their throats being cut.

93
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:52,300
Looks like their deaths were not caused by evil demons... but by humans.

94
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,800
No wonder that brat ran so fast.

95
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,500
Do not worry. I've already attached a tracking talisman to him.

96
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,500
<i>Then we should go after him!</i>

97
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,000
Over here!

98
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,700
The tracking talisman was destroyed.

99
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,600
Looks like he has found out.

100
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,800
<i>Guards! There's an assassin here!</i>

101
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,100
There was an assassin! The assassin ran that way!

102
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,800
Go after him!

103
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,400
Your Majesty, there is no need to worry.

104
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,800
The tracking talisman is filled with phosphorus powder.

105
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,300
Once the lights go out and the phosphorus powder shines... his tracks will be revealed.

106
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,580
You really were training in secret.

107
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,900
How dare you trick me!

108
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,000
As a human, you have caused much more terror than demons.

109
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,940
And you even dare to protect yourself with Millennium Peach Wood!

110
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,020
How ironic.

111
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,840
Even the King of All Demons still requires the help of a mere mortal. Just you wait.

112
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,120
Stop talking. Hurry and get to it.

113
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,920
Thanks.

114
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,360
Sacrificial blood marks?

115
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,900
All arts that require blood are evil.

116
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,160
You killed your people to satisfy your selfish desires.

117
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,520
You have no right to rule over the people.

118
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,000
If I'm around, it doesn't matter what happens to the world!

119
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,340
This world would not exist without me!

120
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,620
<i>For your own selfish desires, you slaughtered innocent beings and framed your beloved!</i>

121
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,400
<i>Now you even want to blame this on us demons?</i>

122
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,060
As Taoist Masters, you actually have a demon as your partner?

123
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,520
- How dare you criticize me when you yourselves are hypocrites!
- Excuse me.

124
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,220
You're the one who started all this.

125
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,460
Don't act as if you're innocent, when you were the one who changed her to her real form.

126
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,080
What does that flower have to do with me?

127
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,000
Talk is useless!

128
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,020
Looks like you'll be adding more sacrificial blood marks to my body!

129
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,340
My Pill of Immortality will be completed soon!

130
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,240
You won't be able to stop me!

131
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,660
Tang Zhou, does your Distance Keeping Lock work on flowers, too?

132
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:26,040
Since it's my spell, I can summon you irrespective of your form.

133
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,100
What are you up to?

134
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,000
I have an idea!

135
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,340
Yan Dan! Run!

136
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,680
One step!

137
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,080
Yan Dan?

138
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,860
Who told you to be so reckless?

139
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,360
I should've locked you in the jade calabash!

140
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,320
<i>Losing some petals does not matter, as long as I get to avenge Jiang Chen.</i>

141
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,560
You concocted the elixir with blood and a huge amount of yin energy.

142
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,880
Your inner organs are burning up.

143
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:50,850
You shifted the blame for the bloody river, the crow phenomenon, and murders on Jiang Chen.

144
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,580
How dare you say you love her?

145
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,640
Do you even understand the meaning of love?

146
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,560
It was her!

147
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,600
She was the one who let me down first!

148
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,350
<i>Consort Jiang Chen hasn't appeared in a long time.</i>

149
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,900
<i>Your Majesty has only just recovered from a serious illness too.</i>

150
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,870
<i>All the parties are getting restless.</i>

151
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:12,360
<i>We are very worried about the situation.</i>

152
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,000
<i>Your Majesty, please get a new concubine as soon as possible.</i>

153
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,220
<i>Have descendants to win the people's hearts.</i>

154
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:25,030
<i>I already made a promise to Consort Jiang Chen to spend our lives together, and take no others.</i>

155
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,330
<i>It's impossible for me to get a new concubine.</i>

156
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:30,680
<i>Moreover, I recovered a long time ago.</i>

157
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,220
<i>Do not try to persuade me again.</i>

158
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,060
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

159
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,500
<i>Your Majesty?</i>

160
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,780
<i>- Are you suffering a relapse? Hurry! Summon the physician!
- Yes, Sir!</i>

161
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,460
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

162

<i>Pei Luo, the physician said you were anxious. So there was phlegm in your throat.</i>

163
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,080
<i>You already recovered from your illness a long time ago.</i>

<i>There is no need to worry.</i>

<i>Even after I recovered, I am no different from ordinary people.</i>

<i>I am the ruler of the world.</i>

167

<i>I need to live hundreds of years, have the lifespan of an immortal.</i>

168
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,160
<i>Why are you still obsessed with longevity?</i>

169
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,320
<i>I was once plagued by an illness before.</i>

170
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,000
<i>And I was almost separated from you forever.</i>

171
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,920
<i>How could I not be afraid?</i>

172
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,340
<i>If I can't live forever,</i>

173
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:52,940
<i>I'll still have to offer my position to someone else when I lose the people's hearts.</i>

174
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:57,700
<i>I wasn't willing to take another concubine, even though I was pressured by my subjects,</i>

175
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,810
<i>because you and I promised to spend our lives together forever.</i>

176
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:08,390
<i>How can we fulfill that promise if you don't help me to achieve immortality?</i>

177
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,940
<i>Jiang Chen, give me another divine pill.</i>

178
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,200
<i>Back then, you were on the verge of death.</i>

179
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,260
<i>You only wanted to live for a few more days.</i>

180
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,380
<i>Thus, I helped you recover your health.</i>

181
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,620
<i>Now, you can grow old peacefully.</i>

182

<i>Although I have recovered from my illness, I can only live for several decades.</i>

186
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,960
<i>It's easy for you to help me attain immortality.</i>

187
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,320
<i>Why are you being so selfish?</i>

188

<i>Why won't you help me?</i>

<i>If so, I'll make you serve me well as compensation.</i>

313
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,160
Just now, I tested Pei Luo.

314
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:05,400
There is no way he could cast a spell to trap Yan Dan, with his level of cultivation.

315
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,460
He looked like he had no idea what a four-leaf lotus was when he looked at her.

316
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:15,140
If that's true, the person who hurt Yan Dan has nothing to do with this case.

317
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,620
The King of Andu is dead. The capital will surely be in turmoil.

318
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,540
We must leave this place.

319
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,040
Wait a moment.

320
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,620
I've retrieved my Extraordinary Eye now.

321
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:27,940
I can use my demonic power to give Yan Dan her body back.

322
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,480
Didn't we discuss this already?

323
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,500
It's too risky to give her back her body now.

324
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,220
Moreover, there were only two of us initially.

325
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:39,540
Don't you think people will be suspicious if they see an extra person?

326
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,860
We can talk about it after we leave this place.

327
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,980
<i>Wait!</i>

328
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:46,140
<i>I thought something was off when I was in the secret chamber.</i>

329
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:51,000
<i>Although the wind had stopped, my petals still flew to the top of the cauldron.</i>

330
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,240
<i>The cauldron is magical.</i>

331
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,530
<i>Could it be hiding some powerful divine tools?</i>

332
00:32:55,530 --> 00:33:02,340
The Truth Duster is a divine divine tool that will suck up all things and suspend all smoke when it appears.

333
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,720
<i>Maybe the cauldron is hiding the Truth Duster!</i>

334
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,020
<i>Let's quickly go back and check it out!</i>

335
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,560
Side Consort?

336
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:57,360
How dare you two commit such an evil act?

337
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,880
Speak. Why did you try to harm her?

338
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,560
Taoist Master, please spare us! W-We tried to use the divine tool in her palace, but she saw us.

339
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,560
That's... That's why we tried to harm her.

340
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,320
Thank you, Young Master.

341
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,960
Young Master, you've saved my life.

342
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,420
I have no way to repay the favor.

343
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:32,280
I'm willing to give you the Truth Duster, the treasure of our sect, to repay you for saving my life.

344
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:44,080
Your Highness, I was looking for that divine tool as well.

345
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,250
Thank you.

346
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,480
The King of Andu forced me to be his consort.

347
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:12,260
He also wiped out my entire sect to get his hands on the Truth Duster.

348
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,240
This divine tool contains immense divine power.

349
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,560
The wind will be sucked in and smoke will stop in motion when you use it.

350
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,660
It can cleanse all things.

351
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,520
This divine tool has never shown any affinity toward anyone.

352
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,880
As a cultivator, I know that all divine tools are alive.

353
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,020
Since the divine tool has recognized you as its master, then you are destined to have it.

354
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,980
Young Master, please accept the divine tool.

355
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,960
<i>It's all thanks to me that you found the divine tool.</i>

356
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,600
<i>You better prepare some amazing delicacies and legendary stories </i>

357
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,920
<i>to thank me when we get out of the palace.</i>

358
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,640
Brother Tang, I heard that you were honest, upright, and untainted by greed.

359
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,540
But it seems to me that it is not the case here.

360
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,640
Senior Brother Yu, seems like you don't know me at all.

361
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,740
You see, I am greedy and petty.

362
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,400
Forget about divine tools.

363
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,180
Even if it's a flower, I'll take it as my own.

364
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,640
I would never let someone else have it.

365
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:05,320
You can only wield this divine tool if you know the secrets of it.

366
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,620
Otherwise, it is just a normal duster.

367
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,840
The King of Andu stole it from me in a hurry.

368
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,300
The formula should still be within my sect.

369
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,560
I wonder if you two would be willing to make the extra trip?

370
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,880
Side Consort, do you mean that if we escort you back to your sect,

371
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,260
you will share the secret technique with us?

372
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,780
The King of Andu is already dead.

373
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,880
There is no one here to restrict my freedom anymore.

374
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,640
I wish to return to my sect and watch over my master's grave.

375
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,580
However, my sect is far away and the journey is difficult.

376
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:43,540
I'm scared of making the trip alone.

377
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,740
This divine tool can save my life.

378
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,760
Thank you for giving it to me, Your Highness.

379
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,260
I'll definitely escort you back to your sect.

380
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:59,600
<i>[Binhong Inn]</i>

381
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:07,020
Since Sheng De isn't around, I have something to tell you.

382
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,980
The palace case is closed.

383
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,420
I'm going to take Yan Dan home.

384
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,920
She is still very stubborn.

385
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,120
She still needs me to teach her.

386
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,080
She is a member of Yelan Mountain.

387
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,060
She does not need you to tell her what to do.

388
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,340
The Distance Keeping Lock proves that she is my demon now.

389
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,000
Dispel it immediately.

390
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,580
Or else, I will kill you.

391
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:39,060
Are you trying to tell me that you also want to be captured?

392
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,080
You can give it a try.

393
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,880
<i>They're at it again.</i>

394
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,000
<i>I really don't dare offend any one of them.</i>

395
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,480
<i>When kings fight, inferior demons like me really do suffer.</i>

396
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:54,360
Have you ever thought of listening to her opinion before taking her away?

397
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,580
Fine.

398
00:38:55,580 --> 00:39:00,280
I'll let you hear exactly what she's thinking right now.

399
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,720
<i>No hiding! Show yourself and speak.</i>

400
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,420
I'm finally back!

401
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,600
I was in my real form for way too long.

402
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,040
Let me see... Am I okay?

403
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,680
Why is this stupid bracelet still here?

404
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,320
Fine, then. It can stay there.

405
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:31,240
Don't worry. Advisor Lotus, you still look as beautiful as always.

406
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,060
I need to see whether I have any power left.

407
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,760
Demonic power?

408
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,840
Who are you? Why are you here?

409
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,460
- I...
- She is a demon I captured.

410
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:57,680
She was hiding in my sleeves before.

411
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,500
She got to know who you were after hearing about the palace case.

412
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,100
However, she has a kind nature.

413
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,320
She'll never harm anyone. There's no need to worry.

414
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:13,620
Since Young Master Tang speaks for her, I won't worry.

415
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,300
Miss, what's your name?

416
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,700
I am Yan Dan.

417
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,000
Thank you for the clues you gave us.

418
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,340
That is how we were able to reveal the King of Andu's true colors.

419
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,360
You are too kind.

420
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,620
I still have to thank you all for saving me.

421
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:30,500
Don't mention it. It's our duty!

422
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,480
Yan Dan, Tang Zhou has agreed to take Sheng De back to her sect.

423
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,020
Sheng De has been serving and taking care of him along the journey.

424
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,120
They are getting along well.

425
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:45,340
We shouldn't interrupt them. Let's bid farewell to them.

426
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:48,180
Sheng De is a guest. There is no need to trouble her.

427
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,300
Yan Dan has always served me.

428
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,960
That is why she must stay.

429
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,160
Tang Zhou, did you forget about your mission?

430
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,960
You have an important mission to fulfill.

431
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,480
Also, humans and demons are different.

432
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,040
No matter how reluctant you are, you have to part ways with her eventually.

433
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,740
I believe you understand what I mean.

434
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,920
You do not get to decide whether she stays or goes.

435
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,420
She has to decide that herself.

436
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,700
What about this? What about this?

437
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,780
Let me say something.

438
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:25,580
Actually, after visiting the Shen's Residence, Lingxiao Sect, and the palace,

439
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:30,980
I understand how painful it is to lose a good friend, and the satisfaction of avenging a loved one.

440
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:36,960
However, even after all that, I still have so many questions about the people and the world itself.

441
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,640
I wish to explore the world more, so I can fulfill the promise I made to Jiang Chen.

442
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,500
I will write a play that will be known throughout the world.

443
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,640
You mean... You don't wish to return to Yelan Mountain?

444
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,780
Of course, I want to go back. It is my home.

445
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,300
Just not right now.

446
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,020
We left the mountain so we could do a kind deed every day, didn't we?

447
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:57,840
Besides, Tang Zhou has already promised Sheng De that he'll escort her back.

448
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,300
It is inconvenient for a man and a woman to travel alone.

449
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:05,480
Why don't we join them and travel together to... gain new experiences and also watch each other's back.

450
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,460
What do you think?

451
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:16,000
Didn't you just say that you would respect her decision?

452
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:22,100
Yan Dan, then let's do it.

00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:28,850
♫ <i> You're like the unattainable Autumn Moon in the vast sky, don't dare to shine bright yet not hesitate to shine </i>♫

465
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:37,330
♫ <i> In my dream, the one I loved is with me </i> ♫

466
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:57,050
♫ <i> After bidding farewell, when Spring becomes Autumn, where can I find my heart in this world? </i> ♫

467
00:44:57,050 --> 00:45:03,280
♫ <i> Several lifetimes will not be enough for our parting </i> ♫

468
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:11,100
♫ <i> As I watch lovers enjoying fireworks on the riverbanks, my love and longing for you makes my pain unbearable </i>♫

469
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:18,300
♫ <i> There will be a time when the world is beautiful </i> ♫

470
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:26,720
♫ <i> When the lotus blossoms again, you and I will be together </i> ♫
