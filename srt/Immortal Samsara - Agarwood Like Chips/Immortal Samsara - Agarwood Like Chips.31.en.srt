15
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:36,553
A mere mortal like you... dare make such presumptuous remarks to me!

16
00:01:37,773 --> 00:01:40,793
Hey! Your Highness! Your Highness! Calm down.

17
00:01:40,793 --> 00:01:42,333
It's just a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding.

18
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:47,093
We're here for the marriage between you and Princess Zhao Lan.

19
00:01:47,093 --> 00:01:50,313
We're not here to take your fiancée away. We're here to reconcile.

20
00:01:50,313 --> 00:01:52,873
How about this? Why don't you put Dragon King Zhao Yan down first?

21
00:01:52,873 --> 00:01:56,273
Then we'll talk about what's going on. Okay?

22
00:01:58,113 --> 00:01:59,393
You again?

23
00:01:59,393 --> 00:02:01,273
You have no honor.

24
00:02:02,573 --> 00:02:04,753
I am the one you want dead.

25
00:02:04,753 --> 00:02:06,213
It has nothing to do with anyone else.

26
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:08,533
Brother Yu Mo...

27
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:10,003
Sure.

28
00:02:10,003 --> 00:02:15,933
As long as you destroy your own spiritual body and beg on your knees, I will set them free.

29
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:24,453
No, no.

30
00:02:24,453 --> 00:02:26,993
No.

31
00:02:26,993 --> 00:02:29,473
This is between the East Sea and the South Sea.

32
00:02:29,473 --> 00:02:31,313
I never wanted to meddle in it.

33
00:02:31,313 --> 00:02:33,013
But Zhao Lan once saved me.

34
00:02:33,013 --> 00:02:37,433
You slaughtered the South Sea guards.

35
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:40,793
You hurt Zhao Lan's father.

36
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:44,253
Do not force my hand.

37
00:02:44,253 --> 00:02:48,053
In my eyes you all must die.

38
00:02:48,053 --> 00:02:50,253
Why bother reciting this list of accusations?

39
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:54,273
I am not one who usually... meddles in affairs.

40
00:02:54,273 --> 00:02:58,033
But now, you are the one who's forcing me to act.

41
00:02:58,033 --> 00:03:00,053
Take him down!

42
00:03:19,393 --> 00:03:21,053
Careful.

43
00:03:38,253 --> 00:03:40,613
Protect yourself. I will go save Dragon King Zhao Yan.

44
00:03:40,613 --> 00:03:41,553
Okay.

45
00:03:41,553 --> 00:03:43,373
Young Master Tang be careful!

46
00:03:57,993 --> 00:03:59,813
Royal Father.

47
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,353
Let me do it.

48
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:26,313
When did you get your dragon core back?

49
00:04:26,313 --> 00:04:28,133
Wielder of Fire and Water.

50
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:31,713
The Lord of the Four Seas. He is a Nine Fins?

51
00:04:31,713 --> 00:04:35,173
The Nine Fins' bloodline still exists in this world.

52
00:04:35,173 --> 00:04:37,693
<i>He is a descendant of the Nine Fins Clan?</i>

53
00:04:44,713 --> 00:04:46,673
Zhao Lan!

54
00:04:49,653 --> 00:04:53,233
Zhao Yan, this is your last chance.

55
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:57,053
In three days, Zhao Lan and I will get married in the East Sea.

56
00:04:57,053 --> 00:05:02,073
When that time comes, you'll only need to bring Yu Mo's head as a wedding gift.

57
00:05:02,073 --> 00:05:04,253
Then your position as the Dragon King of the South Sea will be safe.

58
00:05:04,253 --> 00:05:09,633
Without this wedding gift, my army will invade after the ceremony.

59
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:14,273
The South Sea Dragon Clan will disappear from this world!

60
00:05:15,593 --> 00:05:17,213
Zhao Lan!

61
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:22,093
My daughter...

62
00:05:28,613 --> 00:05:30,633
The Dragon King has been in discussions with his advisers for four hours.

63
00:05:30,633 --> 00:05:32,893
Is there any news?

64
00:05:40,013 --> 00:05:44,773
The Dragon King won't really listen to Ao Xuan and use our heads as gifts, will he?

65
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:49,533
And you, Yu Mo.

66
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:52,733
Why didn't you tell me that you were from the Nine Fins Clan?

67
00:05:55,113 --> 00:05:58,933
I just didn't know how to start that conversation.

68
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:01,393
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

69
00:06:01,393 --> 00:06:03,233
I'm not mad about that.

70
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:08,693
I'm just mad. If I had known earlier that you weren't a black fish, I would have cooked fish soup every day.

71
00:06:08,693 --> 00:06:12,833
If I really do die here this time, all my work would have been for nothing.

72
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,673
I wouldn't even get to smell any cooked fish.

73
00:06:14,673 --> 00:06:16,833
It would be one of my regrets.

74
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:22,413
If Dragon King Zhao Yan truly wants Yu Mo's head, do you think we would still be sitting here?

75
00:06:23,713 --> 00:06:26,933
Ao Xuan is willing to kill to force the wedding to happen.

76
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:29,793
He treats the Dragon King of the South Sea like a commoner.

77
00:06:29,793 --> 00:06:32,153
He is ruthless and violent.

78
00:06:32,153 --> 00:06:35,173
If he were to ever become a leader,

79
00:06:35,173 --> 00:06:39,753
the Four Seas would have a tyrant.

80
00:06:41,073 --> 00:06:43,333
But he still has Princess Zhao Lan in his hands.

81
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:46,313
We are in a tricky situation now.

82
00:06:46,313 --> 00:06:50,273
It's hard to tell what Dragon King Zhao Yan will do.

83
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:56,353
Ao Xuan might be a Dragon King, but he's still young.

84
00:06:56,353 --> 00:06:59,633
His Soul-crushing hook injures Yu Mo.

85
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:00,893
It won't be hard to kill him.

86
00:07:00,893 --> 00:07:03,293
However, he is holding Zhao Lan hostage right now.

87
00:07:03,293 --> 00:07:08,113
If we kill him, the Four Seas will be in turmoil.

88
00:07:08,113 --> 00:07:09,953
You're right, Young Master Tang.

89
00:07:09,953 --> 00:07:13,793
Now that the power of the Nine Fins Clan was revealed, the Four Seas are astonished.

90
00:07:13,793 --> 00:07:16,713
People in the West Sea and in the North Sea will be on guard.

91
00:07:16,713 --> 00:07:21,019
This marital affair might turn into more uprisings.

92
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:23,153
Young Master Tang, you are of noble status.

93
00:07:23,153 --> 00:07:27,753
You should prioritize passing your trial and avoid getting involved in this.

94
00:07:27,753 --> 00:07:31,833
Miss Sheng De, you claimed to be a Taoist Master from a small sect.

95
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:36,913
But now you have knowledge of the Heavenly Realm and the changes happening in the Four Seas.

96
00:07:36,913 --> 00:07:39,093
You're even offering your guidance.

97
00:07:39,093 --> 00:07:44,313
Miss, I can't help but wonder about your power and your sect.

98
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,753
Young Master Yu, His Majesty urgently summons you.

99
00:07:54,153 --> 00:07:55,773
Don't worry, Young Master Yu.

100
00:07:55,773 --> 00:08:00,093
Once this is over and you send me back to my sect,

101
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:04,373
everything will become clear.

102
00:08:04,373 --> 00:08:06,753
I can't wait.

103
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,233
All right, all right.

104
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:11,513
Miss Sheng De is just worried about Tang Zhou. She means well.

105
00:08:11,513 --> 00:08:13,393
The Dragon King is waiting for us.

106
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:15,713
Let's hurry over there.

107
00:08:15,713 --> 00:08:20,093
His Majesty said that only Young Master Yu Mo is allowed in for confidentiality's sake.

108
00:08:22,313 --> 00:08:23,893
It's okay.

109
00:08:32,163 --> 00:08:37,223
<i>In order to get the heart of the four leaf lotus, I have to get rid of him first.</i>

110
00:08:37,223 --> 00:08:39,523
<i>With my power that's not possible.</i>

111
00:08:39,523 --> 00:08:42,663
<i>I need to find help.</i>

112
00:08:42,663 --> 00:08:48,473
You want me to replace Ao Xuan, Your Highness?

113
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:56,773
Ao Xuan might be the leader of the Four Dragon Kings.

114
00:08:56,773 --> 00:09:01,773
But ever since he started ruling in his father's stead, he refuses to listen and rules with an iron fist.

115
00:09:01,773 --> 00:09:04,973
This problem has intensified after he took over his father's position.

116
00:09:04,973 --> 00:09:07,773
If his rage to continues after today,

117
00:09:07,773 --> 00:09:15,033
the South Sea and the Princess will suffer great disasters.

118
00:09:16,093 --> 00:09:20,233
I am more than willing to rescue Zhao Lan.

119
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:25,193
However, leading an army to revolt as a Nine Fins Clan member is impossible.

120
00:09:26,713 --> 00:09:28,713
The East Sea has a powerful military.

121
00:09:28,713 --> 00:09:33,173
However, the White Dragon Clan is not fit to lead.

122
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,593
But now, a Nine Fins Clan member is here.

123
00:09:35,593 --> 00:09:43,013
He only has to give a command and the three seas will reunite to overthrow Ao Xuan's tyranny.

124
00:09:43,013 --> 00:09:44,293
Indeed.

125
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:47,833
The Nine Fins Clan members are heroes in the hearts of the Aquatic Clan?

126
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,113
Yes.

127
00:09:49,113 --> 00:09:54,093
Only someone from the Nine Fins Clan can lead the other Dragon Clans?

128
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,953
Exactly.

129
00:10:05,893 --> 00:10:10,433
I have a question for you, Your Highness.

130
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:15,750
During the War of Genesis, the entire Nine Fins Clan was killed.

131
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,900
Then you turned to the White Dragon Clan of the East Sea and elevated their status,

132
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,593
abandoning the Nine Fins Clan.

133
00:10:22,593 --> 00:10:27,813
But now that your power is waning, you seek my help.

134
00:10:27,813 --> 00:10:33,873
Are you not worried that everyone would laugh at your brazenness?

135
00:10:51,593 --> 00:10:53,113
Your Majesty.

136
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:56,513
There's no need for this, Your Majesty.

137
00:10:56,513 --> 00:11:00,293
I do not like power nor trust power.

138
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:05,993
My biggest wish is to have a peaceful corner where I can protect my loved one forever.

139
00:11:05,993 --> 00:11:08,613
Other than that, I want nothing else.

140
00:11:08,613 --> 00:11:15,233
Your Majesty, even if you refuse to get up, I will not be persuaded otherwise.

141
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:17,153
Your Majesty.

142
00:11:17,153 --> 00:11:21,333
I am not kneeling to beg... but to repent.

143
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:25,720
Bad karma always catches up to you.

144
00:11:26,613 --> 00:11:30,533
Yu Mo. What if I told you

145
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:34,993
that the destruction of the Nine Fins Clan was caused by someone else.

146
00:11:34,993 --> 00:11:36,993
You were supposed to be the Lord of the Four Seas.

147
00:11:36,993 --> 00:11:39,313
They are supposed to be your subjects.

148
00:11:39,313 --> 00:11:43,153
Do you want to protect this land?

149
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:52,540
<i>The support army of the Dragon Clans was led by the previous Dragon King of the East Sea.</i>

150
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,670
<i>Not only didn't he send in support troops, </i>

151
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:59,293
<i>he took advantage of the battle when the Nine Fins were exhausted.</i>

152
00:11:59,293 --> 00:12:05,453
<i>The Nine Fins Clan fell into the Asura Clan's trap and was completely destroyed.</i>

153
00:12:06,013 --> 00:12:09,540
<i>Then he presented a memorial to the Heavenly Realm</i>

154
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,250
<i>and became the ruler of the Aquatic Clan.</i>

155
00:12:13,853 --> 00:12:16,993
<i>The evidence should be within the East Sea Dragon Palace.</i>

156
00:12:17,553 --> 00:12:20,753
<i>If we overthrow Ao Xuan and get the evidence,</i>

157
00:12:20,753 --> 00:12:24,593
<i>you shall find the truth behind the genocide of the Nine Fins Clan.</i>

158
00:12:24,593 --> 00:12:30,013
<i>You... are also the rightful Lord of the Four Seas.</i>

159
00:12:33,113 --> 00:12:35,793
Yu Mo. You're back.

160
00:12:35,793 --> 00:12:37,813
What took you so long?

161
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,253
Your head is still there.

162
00:12:40,253 --> 00:12:44,393
Does the Dragon King want you to become his son-in-law?

163
00:12:45,173 --> 00:12:46,753
What's going on?

164
00:12:47,213 --> 00:12:48,973
Are you okay?

165
00:12:52,533 --> 00:12:55,013
To have Advisor Lotus by my side

166
00:12:56,273 --> 00:12:58,473
is truly my blessing.

167
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:07,033
Just now, Dragon King Zhao Yan invited me, alongside

168
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:12,753
the West Sea and the North Sea to overthrow Ao Xuan and rescue Zhao Lan.

169
00:13:12,753 --> 00:13:16,053
I'm about to head to the West Sea.

170
00:13:16,053 --> 00:13:18,193
I'll come with you.

171
00:13:18,193 --> 00:13:19,453
No.

172
00:13:19,453 --> 00:13:22,093
We still don't know if the West Sea and the North Sea will help.

173
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,553
Besides, the three of you aren't from the Aquatic Clan.

174
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:29,133
It's best if you stay here. Dragon King Zhao Yan agreed as well.

175
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:34,913
I appreciate the loyalty you have for me, Advisor Lotus.

176
00:13:34,913 --> 00:13:38,213
Don't worry. I will definitely come back safe and sound.

177
00:13:38,213 --> 00:13:42,893
Tang Zhou. Take good care of Yan Dan.

178
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:46,873
I caught her. I will naturally take responsibility.

179
00:13:46,873 --> 00:13:48,633
No need, no need.

180
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:52,873
Don't put me in your jade calabash again. I can take care of myself.

181
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:56,193
Don't worry. I'll return soon.

182
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:09,593
Do you think Yu Mo will come back with the Princess of the West Sea?

183
00:14:09,593 --> 00:14:12,233
What? Are you jealous now?

184
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:14,713
What nonsense are you saying?

185
00:14:14,713 --> 00:14:18,653
Everyone on Yelan Mountain wants our mountain chief to move on from his past.

186
00:14:18,653 --> 00:14:22,273
We're expecting a madam, so I have to pay close attention to him.

187
00:14:22,273 --> 00:14:27,313
If it really is happening, I have to head back and inform Bai Ling to have her prepare the dowry.

188
00:14:46,713 --> 00:14:48,853
This dish is called Moon View Cake.

189
00:14:48,853 --> 00:14:53,790
It's made from rare ingredients in the South Sea, perfect for revitalizing and enhancing the primordial spirit.

190
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:58,593
If Young Master Tang can eat some every day it should stabilize his power quite a bit.

191
00:14:58,593 --> 00:15:01,653
He'll suffer less from the dissipation.

192
00:15:01,653 --> 00:15:04,073
A mortal doesn't live over one hundred years old.

193
00:15:04,073 --> 00:15:10,490
You put ten years of your cultivation into the dish to ease the pain of Tang Zhou's cracked soul.

194
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:14,353
You take repaying him for saving your life too seriously, aren't you?

195
00:15:16,053 --> 00:15:19,533
It's... not just that.

196
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:24,833
Yan Dan. I like him.

197
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,513
He is the only light in my world.

198
00:15:27,513 --> 00:15:32,273
I believe every word he says.

199
00:15:43,453 --> 00:15:45,373
Why are you so upset?

200
00:15:45,373 --> 00:15:49,613
Are... you in love with him too?

201
00:15:50,373 --> 00:15:52,733
Impossible.

202
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:58,253
I don't even know what human desires are.

203
00:16:00,713 --> 00:16:04,693
But didn't you two just meet?

204
00:16:04,693 --> 00:16:09,433
Didn't I say before that I can look into someone's past?

205
00:16:09,433 --> 00:16:15,733
When he and I were immortals in the Heavenly Realm, I kept him company for a long time.

206
00:16:15,733 --> 00:16:19,653
We were destined to be together.

207
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:27,553
Is love... truly decided by fate?

208
00:16:37,213 --> 00:16:41,273
<i>Back in Yelan Mountain, there was always a group of demons getting together.</i>

209
00:16:41,273 --> 00:16:45,053
<i>Everyone talking, joking around, and having a good time.</i>

210
00:16:45,053 --> 00:16:47,553
<i>But it's different with Tang Zhou.</i>

211
00:16:47,553 --> 00:16:49,333
<i>Sometimes, I feel happy.</i>

212
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:53,833
<i>At times, I don't know why, it hurts and there's heartbreak.</i>

213
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:29,473
Thank you.

214
00:17:29,473 --> 00:17:34,053
No worries. I'm willing to always light the lanterns for you if you want.

215
00:17:36,293 --> 00:17:38,113
I made these myself.

216
00:17:38,113 --> 00:17:42,413
After you have them, your dissipating immortal power will be less severe.

217
00:17:42,413 --> 00:17:44,253
I'm used to it already.

218
00:17:44,253 --> 00:17:46,573
No need to worry about it, Miss Sheng De.

219
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,293
I will definitely cure you.

220
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:54,233
I've already made them. Try one.

221
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:55,853
No thanks.

222
00:17:57,113 --> 00:17:58,553
Where is Yan Dan?

223
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,500
She learned the recipe for Moon View Cake

224
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,650
and is now collecting herbs by the canyon outside the Dragon Palace.

225
00:18:03,653 --> 00:18:07,353
Perhaps she wants to make some for Young Master Yu.

226
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:10,053
The canyon is a dark place. It is dangerous.

227
00:18:10,053 --> 00:18:14,593
I will go look for her right now. I'll have these cakes after I return.

228
00:18:31,273 --> 00:18:34,773
Why is it still the same?

229
00:18:36,473 --> 00:18:39,093
As long as she's around...

230
00:18:40,373 --> 00:18:43,273
no matter how hard I try...

231
00:18:46,773 --> 00:18:50,173
you never even look at me.

232
00:18:54,313 --> 00:18:55,773
So deep.

233
00:18:55,773 --> 00:18:58,953
I wonder if my spiritual body can take this or not.

234
00:19:05,073 --> 00:19:06,573
Yan Dan!

235
00:19:14,933 --> 00:19:18,073
Why are you standing there? Pull me up.

236
00:19:27,293 --> 00:19:30,813
<i>Why does my heart hurt this much?</i>

237
00:19:30,813 --> 00:19:32,653
Tang Zhou!

238
00:19:36,173 --> 00:19:37,893
Tang Zhou!

239
00:19:39,713 --> 00:19:41,373
Yan Dan!

240
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,453
You vile person.

241
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:07,333
I was doing just fine up there. You had to yell at me.

242
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,173
Not only did you yell at me, you let go!

243
00:20:09,173 --> 00:20:10,153
Just how evil are you?

244
00:20:10,153 --> 00:20:12,253
I didn't mean to let you go.

245
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:15,793
That scene just now, I’ve dreamt it many times.

246
00:20:16,613 --> 00:20:19,613
Impossible. You're a demon catcher.

247
00:20:19,613 --> 00:20:22,333
Why would you dream of a lotus spirit?

248
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:25,813
Don't give yourself too much credit. It's not you.

249
00:20:25,813 --> 00:20:30,453
I don't know who she is either. Maybe I owed her in my past life.

250
00:20:30,453 --> 00:20:32,450
I've seen it too many times.

251
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,610
I saw her jump off a bridge with a broken heart.

252
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,030
Yet I never see her face.

253
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:42,433
She's probably someone you loved.

254
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:48,760
I often read in novels that the love you owe someone from your past life will be renewed in this life.

255
00:20:49,393 --> 00:20:55,053
You claim to reject love, yet you cannot get over her.

256
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:58,573
I don't think you'll be able to be the sect master of the Lingxiao Sect.

257
00:20:59,573 --> 00:21:04,873
Maybe the woman in your dream is Sheng De.

258
00:21:04,873 --> 00:21:06,913
Impossible!

259
00:21:06,913 --> 00:21:08,353
Why not?

260
00:21:08,353 --> 00:21:12,013
Sheng De told me you two were with each other for a long time.

261
00:21:12,013 --> 00:21:14,613
I know my feelings the best.

262
00:21:14,613 --> 00:21:17,593
Are you done collecting herbs? If you're done, we'll go back up.

263
00:21:18,553 --> 00:21:21,320
The luminous threads from the jellyfish are the herbs.

264
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,790
But there isn't a lot here.

265
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:30,793
Hold on tight.

266
00:21:30,793 --> 00:21:38,270
♫ <i> I blame time for the mortal world's woe is on your shoulder </i> ♫

267
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:45,390
♫ <i> Like the surging tides of stars, I continuously ask where the origin of love comes from </i> ♫

268
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:52,660
♫ <i> I'm afraid the tears brimming in the corner of my eyes will fall and blur your silhouette</i> ♫

269
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,530
♫ <i> In my momentary childishness, </i> ♫

270
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,290
Childish.

271
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:02,630
♫ <i> Even after all that, my path all leans towards you </i> ♫

272
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:12,310
♫ <i> Counting the passing of the seasons, no matter which directions, everything moves towards you </i> ♫

273
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:19,110
♫ <i> The beauty is in the burning agarwood incense, there's still hope when the ashes settled </i> ♫

274
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:26,550
♫ <i> Hear the beautiful prose with a fine beauty and a picturesque view, they pair well together </i> ♫

275
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:30,300
♫ <i> Sew two hearts together and a stem sprouts forth </i> ♫

276
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:36,160
♫ <i> Understand the wind, think about the rain, and do not awaken from the dream </i> ♫

277
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:44,250
♫ <i> Just let me linger all day and night </i> ♫

278
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,250
Do we have enough now?

279
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,073
It's enough.

280
00:22:48,073 --> 00:22:51,993
You're working this hard just to make some snacks for Yu Mo?

281
00:22:53,653 --> 00:22:57,773
You underestimate me. I improved the Moon View's recipe.

282
00:22:57,773 --> 00:23:02,273
Not only can it stabilize your power, it can also boost it.

283
00:23:02,273 --> 00:23:05,793
If there's war, handing them out to the South Sea's soldiers will help them.

284
00:23:05,793 --> 00:23:08,413
Quite thoughtful of you.

285
00:23:09,453 --> 00:23:10,753
What now?

286
00:23:10,753 --> 00:23:14,913
Didn't Sheng De make a bunch for you? Are you hungry now?

287
00:23:16,053 --> 00:23:19,313
I can tell Sheng De is very fond of you.

288
00:23:19,313 --> 00:23:23,453
She talks to me a lot about what you like, and she's worried about your illness.

289
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:28,733
She even infused the cakes with her own power to enhance its medicinal effect.

290
00:23:28,733 --> 00:23:32,633
Had I know she held such an obsession I would have clarified things earlier.

291
00:23:34,573 --> 00:23:39,873
Someone cares a lot about you. You don't feel moved or happy?

292
00:23:41,893 --> 00:23:47,613
If she's someone I like, it wouldn't matter what she did, I would naturally feel moved.

293
00:23:47,613 --> 00:23:53,773
If she isn't someone I like, then no matter how much she does, it'll only feel like a burden.

294
00:23:53,773 --> 00:23:56,493
You sound so matter-of-fact.

295
00:23:56,973 --> 00:23:59,953
Could it be you've fallen in love before?

296
00:24:00,653 --> 00:24:03,753
What does it feel like to love someone?

297
00:24:03,753 --> 00:24:06,573
Was it sweet or bitter?

298
00:24:10,453 --> 00:24:12,573
Why do you c-care?

299
00:24:13,193 --> 00:24:15,320
Whether it's sweet or bitter,

300
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,673
a cultivator like me can never experience it.

301
00:24:19,773 --> 00:24:20,913
Forget it then.

302
00:24:20,913 --> 00:24:22,593
I'm going back to sword training.

303
00:24:22,593 --> 00:24:23,993
Oh right.

304
00:24:24,553 --> 00:24:30,393
If you go wandering around randomly again, you'll be inside this jade calabash.

305
00:24:31,853 --> 00:24:33,173
What a despicable person.

306
00:24:33,173 --> 00:24:40,713
He claims to practice abstinence, but when I reveal his true face, he denies everything.

307
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:42,633
How despicable.

308
00:24:55,273 --> 00:24:57,510
In terms of power, the South Sea is only second to the East Sea.

309
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:02,010
Knowing Ao Xuan's ruthlessness, if the South Sea falls,

310
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,553
this position as Dragon Queen of the West Sea won't last for long either.

311
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:10,913
However, if a Nine Fins Clan descendant takes the lead, it can work.

312
00:25:12,253 --> 00:25:15,333
So you're saying... you agree?

313
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:20,853
Only the North Sea is left then.

314
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:23,973
The Black Dragon Clan of the North Sea doesn't have any descendants.

315
00:25:23,973 --> 00:25:26,293
After the previous leader died a few years ago, no one filled the position.

316
00:25:26,293 --> 00:25:29,453
The smaller clans picked a new leader.

317
00:25:29,453 --> 00:25:34,473
If you want their military aid, you have to get the North Sea's approval too.

318
00:25:34,473 --> 00:25:38,653
This newly-chosen leader of the North Sea has always served in the Heavenly Realm.

319
00:25:38,653 --> 00:25:42,510
He rarely returns here and has a strange temperament.

320
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:45,670
He's not interested in fame or military affairs.

321
00:25:45,673 --> 00:25:50,053
The war is close. What should we do?

322
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,290
<i>[Leader of the South Sea]</i>

323
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:03,140
If I'm not mistaken, the leader of the North Sea... should be the one under the black veil, correct?

324
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:06,833
Yes.

325
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:09,833
But I didn't cover his face because he isn't a dragon.

326
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:14,213
It's just that his eccentricity was on public display even when he was being drawn.

327
00:26:14,213 --> 00:26:18,053
I didn't want to show his insolence to everyone in case of potential mockery.

328
00:26:18,053 --> 00:26:21,833
I don't mind. Can you show me?

329
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,900
<i>[Leader of the North Sea, Head of Merfolk, Lu Ming]</i>

330
00:26:36,113 --> 00:26:39,473
Young man. You...

331
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:42,173
Can I ask for some brush, ink, and paper?

332
00:26:42,173 --> 00:26:47,033
Once he receives my letter, he'll definitely come to help.

333
00:27:03,733 --> 00:27:06,213
Her Highness still refuses to drink.

334
00:27:09,853 --> 00:27:13,733
If the Princess refuses to drink, that's because you're useless.

335
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:16,473
Useless people have no place here!

336
00:27:18,133 --> 00:27:21,813
Stop! Even though she's your servant, she is still a citizen of the East Sea.

337
00:27:21,813 --> 00:27:24,253
Do you treat your subjects with cruelty?

338
00:27:24,253 --> 00:27:26,733
So what if I do?

339
00:27:26,733 --> 00:27:28,933
You are the one who has been bewitched.

340
00:27:28,933 --> 00:27:31,413
All you can think of is Yu Mo.

341
00:27:31,413 --> 00:27:35,993
Whatever I do for you, it will never be good enough for you!

342
00:27:35,993 --> 00:27:37,813
Ao Xuan.

343
00:27:39,673 --> 00:27:43,833
I truly wanted to marry you before.

344
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:46,593
But you never believed me.

345
00:27:46,593 --> 00:27:49,853
You said you loved me.

346
00:27:49,853 --> 00:27:54,833
Then you chopped my father's arm off and killed the people of the South Sea.

347
00:27:56,033 --> 00:28:00,313
If this is your love, then I don't want it!

348
00:28:00,313 --> 00:28:03,853
Zhao Lan. I will be good to you.

349
00:28:04,513 --> 00:28:08,793
Since we were young, I saved the best, the most tender, the most precious love for you.

350
00:28:10,553 --> 00:28:15,540
As long as your father is willing to obey me, then I'll give him glory.

351
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,433
I'll give the South Sea glory.

352
00:28:17,433 --> 00:28:20,893
And if my father refuses to kill Brother Yu Mo?

353
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,913
Yu Mo is just a descendant of a sinful clan.

354
00:28:27,913 --> 00:28:31,253
Zhao Yan shouldn't put his whole clan at risk for him!

355
00:28:36,573 --> 00:28:39,153
If I knew earlier...

356
00:28:39,853 --> 00:28:46,413
that you were this paranoid and cruel, I would have stayed a dragon forever.

357
00:28:46,413 --> 00:28:49,033
It would've been much better than now.

358
00:28:49,033 --> 00:28:56,290
For the sake of a marriage contract, the safety of Brother Yu Mo's life and the entire South Sea is at risk.

359
00:28:57,973 --> 00:29:01,473
Ao Xuan. I can't stop you.

360
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:07,553
But if you hurt a single hair on my loved ones, I will kill myself!

361
00:29:07,553 --> 00:29:09,293
You!

362
00:29:23,233 --> 00:29:24,593
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

363
00:29:24,593 --> 00:29:26,293
Do you have a death wish?

364
00:29:26,293 --> 00:29:30,153
Your Majesty. Someone from the South Sea is here.

365
00:29:50,633 --> 00:29:52,213
Zhao Lan.

366
00:29:52,913 --> 00:29:57,393
You are destined to be my consort, the queen of the East Sea.

367
00:29:57,393 --> 00:30:00,333
You don't get to decide if you live or die.

368
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:05,213
However, you can decide the fate of the South Sea.

369
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:13,013
I can't have your heart. I will never let you leave the East Sea by even a half step.

370
00:30:14,153 --> 00:30:17,013
Don't force my hand.

371
00:30:25,233 --> 00:30:30,033
<i>Brother Yu Mo. Hurry and go back to Yelan Mountain.</i>

372
00:30:30,693 --> 00:30:36,253
<i>Only when you're safe... will I have the courage to face all this.</i>

373
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,870
<i>[Yu Mo has the Princess' inverted scale.]</i>

374
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,020
<i>[The Soul-Crushing Hook cannot hurt him.]</i>

375
00:31:08,713 --> 00:31:15,033
Judging from Your Highness' look, it seems like I am right.

376
00:31:16,173 --> 00:31:19,693
No wonder the Soul-Crushing Hook failed to hurt him.

377
00:31:19,693 --> 00:31:22,853
Zhao Lan even gave him her inverted scale.

378
00:31:23,473 --> 00:31:27,533
I have to kill him. I cannot live with this humiliation.

379
00:31:39,613 --> 00:31:44,293
Aren't you his friend? Why are you here telling me all this?

380
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:48,720
What do you want? Tell me.

381
00:31:50,733 --> 00:31:55,193
You can't give me what I want.

382
00:31:55,193 --> 00:31:58,933
However, Your Highness and I share the same goal.

383
00:31:59,913 --> 00:32:02,753
We want Yu Mo dead.

384
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:07,159
Do you know...

385
00:32:07,953 --> 00:32:11,533
Zhao Yan has already taken Yu Mo to the West Sea?

386
00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:16,353
He wants to persuade the three seas to attack the East Sea.

387
00:32:16,353 --> 00:32:18,533
He's delusional!

388
00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:21,193
The Four Seas already have a new ruler.

389
00:32:21,193 --> 00:32:25,133
If the uprising fails, then this would be a delusional attempt.

390
00:32:25,133 --> 00:32:30,413
But your Soul-Crushing Hook can't harm Yu Mo in the slightest.

391
00:32:30,413 --> 00:32:36,013
The Nine Fins Clan are a ferocious bunch and they have a reputation among the Aquatic Clan.

392
00:32:36,013 --> 00:32:37,653
I know!

393
00:32:40,253 --> 00:32:44,713
But for you to risk coming here is because you have a solution.

394
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:50,050
Tell me. I can give you whatever you want.

395
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:56,110
The key to your victory and the reward I want are the same person.

396
00:32:56,110 --> 00:33:00,253
And that person is also Yu Mo's only weakness.

397
00:33:00,713 --> 00:33:07,113
She's the woman Yu Mo was trying to protect that day, Yan Dan.

398
00:33:07,113 --> 00:33:12,893
As long as Your Highness takes her down, even if Yu Mo had thousands of troops,

399
00:33:12,893 --> 00:33:17,173
he would still willingly admit defeat and die.

400
00:33:17,173 --> 00:33:19,953
So she's the one that Yu Mo holds dearly.

401
00:33:20,853 --> 00:33:24,753
However, why is she your target?

402
00:33:28,053 --> 00:33:30,673
Alas, it is my fate.

403
00:33:31,153 --> 00:33:35,513
The man I love was taken by this woman,

404
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:41,133
yet she had to be the person who can save my love one's life.

405
00:33:44,353 --> 00:33:50,440
Just promise me that once this is done, you'll give me Yan Dan's body.

406
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:57,470
I will give you all information about Yu Mo's military plans.

407
00:33:58,713 --> 00:34:01,673
Okay. You have my word.

408
00:34:07,373 --> 00:34:11,233
This is our family heirloom, a spirit beast, called the Phantom Griffin.

409
00:34:11,233 --> 00:34:15,073
You can use it to send any message or image to me.

410
00:34:15,073 --> 00:34:20,283
No need to travel between the East and the South Sea to avoid suspicion.

411
00:34:47,053 --> 00:34:48,973
Eight hundred years.

412
00:34:50,683 --> 00:34:53,953
Yan Dan spent eight hundred years in the Night Forgetting River.

413
00:34:56,723 --> 00:35:02,753
Meanwhile, I searched for her in the Three Realms for eight hundred years.

414
00:35:02,753 --> 00:35:05,393
I just never thought...

415
00:35:06,693 --> 00:35:09,853
that she was stuck in the Night Forgetting River.

416
00:35:17,053 --> 00:35:19,453
Don't blame yourself too much.

417
00:35:20,373 --> 00:35:24,253
Encounters are all decided by fate.

418
00:35:24,253 --> 00:35:25,933
Fortunately, Emperor Lord Ying Yuan—

419
00:35:25,933 --> 00:35:28,833
I don't want to hear what happened between the two of them.

420
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,000
Whatever it was...

421
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:37,033
he can never make up for the pain he inflicted on Yan Dan.

422
00:35:42,973 --> 00:35:45,193
Lu Ming.

423
00:35:45,193 --> 00:35:49,253
Since Yan Dan traversed the Night Forgetting River,

424
00:35:49,253 --> 00:35:54,093
it means she doesn't want to remember her past.

425
00:35:55,433 --> 00:35:59,153
When you see her later, don't mention anything.

426
00:36:04,093 --> 00:36:11,613
At the moment... she is carefree... doing a good deed every day.

427
00:36:11,613 --> 00:36:16,753
I hope she can spend the rest of her life like this.

428
00:36:27,473 --> 00:36:31,413
No wonder Jiang Chen said humans are complicated and love is difficult to understand.

429
00:36:32,253 --> 00:36:37,313
Tang Zhou and Sheng De have different definitions of love.

430
00:36:37,313 --> 00:36:41,313
Maybe love is different for everyone.

431
00:36:43,933 --> 00:36:48,433
I've recorded other people's love stories in "Dairy of the Mortal World".

432
00:36:48,433 --> 00:36:49,653
But what about mine?

433
00:36:49,653 --> 00:36:51,713
Yan Dan.

434
00:36:51,713 --> 00:36:54,633
Yu Mo, you're back!

435
00:36:55,693 --> 00:36:58,193
Yan Dan, I... have missed you so much.

436
00:36:58,193 --> 00:37:00,153
Hold on.

437
00:37:01,073 --> 00:37:03,553
Who are you?

438
00:37:03,553 --> 00:37:05,873
Who is he?

439
00:37:05,873 --> 00:37:07,553
You like finding people to fall back on, don't you?

440
00:37:07,553 --> 00:37:10,213
I found you a very powerful and reliable person.

441
00:37:10,213 --> 00:37:14,013
He is the Dragon King of the North Sea and the leader of the merfolk, Lu Ming.

442
00:37:14,013 --> 00:37:16,133
A deity?

443
00:37:18,053 --> 00:37:22,333
Wait. Just tell us if you're upset. Why are you crying?

444
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:26,273
Sir Deity, how did you know my name was Yan Dan?

445
00:37:26,273 --> 00:37:29,553
Well I've read "Rendezvous by Pear Garden" written by you.

446
00:37:29,553 --> 00:37:33,653
It really was amazing and incredibly moving.

447
00:37:33,653 --> 00:37:35,373
I have always adored it.

448
00:37:35,373 --> 00:37:38,453
Now, I can finally meet its author.

449
00:37:38,453 --> 00:37:40,553
"Rendezvous by Pear Garden." I wrote it several decades ago.

450
00:37:40,553 --> 00:37:44,213
I never expected it to reach the ears of deities! I'm so good.

451
00:37:44,213 --> 00:37:49,133
You see. I've recently been traveling in the Mortal Realm trying to find more inspiration.

452
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:52,053
My next work will be even better than "Rendezvous by Pear Garden".

453
00:37:52,053 --> 00:37:53,353
Remember to look forward to it!

454
00:37:53,353 --> 00:37:55,813
And help spread the word in the Heavenly Realm too.

455
00:37:55,813 --> 00:37:59,573
Sure. When it premiers, I'll definitely come and watch it.

456
00:37:59,573 --> 00:38:03,793
Oh, right. I came to the Mortal Realm bearing gifts.

457
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,953
This is my first time seeing a deity and I'm already receiving a gift.

458
00:38:06,953 --> 00:38:09,953
This is too much. What is it?

459
00:38:23,893 --> 00:38:28,033
I didn't know the watermelon up there was this good.

460
00:38:30,293 --> 00:38:32,613
We're for sure buddies now!

461
00:38:32,613 --> 00:38:36,513
When you come and visit us on Yelan Mountain, can you bring some extra watermelons with you?

462
00:38:36,513 --> 00:38:37,733
No problem!

463
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:41,313
If there's one thing I have in abundance, it's watermelon.

464
00:38:43,353 --> 00:38:45,153
I'll give you all the watermelon seeds then.

465
00:38:45,153 --> 00:38:47,973
You can have watermelons every season now.

466
00:38:47,973 --> 00:38:53,173
I am usually busy working, but if I have the time, I'll definitely come visit Yelan Mountain.

467
00:38:53,173 --> 00:38:56,213
I expect you to spend time with me every day.

468
00:38:56,213 --> 00:38:58,253
No problem.

469
00:38:59,213 --> 00:39:04,033
Yu Mo, Let's find a plot to plant them in the mountain.

470
00:39:04,033 --> 00:39:08,333
If you want, we can tear down all of Yelan Mountain and make it a watermelon field.

471
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:10,033
How about it?

472
00:39:14,413 --> 00:39:16,793
Yan Dan, have another slice.

473
00:39:16,793 --> 00:39:18,593
Thank you.

474
00:39:25,213 --> 00:39:32,393
So, after you kill Ao Xuan, not only are you the King of All Demons, but you'll also be the Lord of the Four Seas.

475
00:39:32,393 --> 00:39:35,053
I knew it. I bring good fortune.

476
00:39:35,053 --> 00:39:38,693
The backer I found was a sparrow and now the sparrow is becoming a phoenix!

477
00:39:38,693 --> 00:39:40,133
Indeed.

478
00:39:40,133 --> 00:39:47,273
Perhaps, if it weren't for you, I would still be a little black fish, instead of a Nine Fins Clan member.

479
00:39:48,493 --> 00:39:52,373
Tell me honestly. Do you want me to become the Lord of the Four Seas?

480
00:39:52,373 --> 00:39:56,453
Did you know? The art of finding someone to rely on isn't finding someone who is very powerful.

481
00:39:56,453 --> 00:39:58,613
Tell me then. What kind of backer should one look for?

482
00:39:58,613 --> 00:40:01,513
Of course, it should be someone that makes you happy.

483
00:40:01,513 --> 00:40:06,433
If you're not happy when you become the Lord of the Four Seas, I won't be happy either.

484
00:40:06,433 --> 00:40:07,613
If you're happy, I'll be happy.

485
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,613
If you're not, I won't ever be happy.

486
00:40:09,613 --> 00:40:12,933
Don't worry. I'll make sure you are happy.

487
00:40:12,933 --> 00:40:16,213
Have you seen those protagonists in the stories?

488
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:18,933
They have to be tried mentally and physically.

489
00:40:18,933 --> 00:40:23,233
They have to go through this and that while still caring about the world.

490
00:40:23,233 --> 00:40:28,793
If it were me, it would be hard enough for me to be concerned about one thing,

491
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:30,753
not to mention the entire world.

492
00:40:30,753 --> 00:40:35,213
I can't force you to do something you don't like just because it makes me look good, can I?

493
00:40:35,213 --> 00:40:36,733
Right.

494
00:40:36,733 --> 00:40:39,633
I do not have the heart to think about the entire world.

495
00:40:41,133 --> 00:40:43,793
My heart already belongs to someone else.

496
00:40:43,793 --> 00:40:46,933
For me, this world is—

497
00:40:46,933 --> 00:40:48,333
Commander.

498
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:51,093
Commander, we're headed to training now.

499
00:40:52,853 --> 00:40:56,153
Carry on. You were saying you had someone in your heart? Who is it?

500
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:57,753
I was saying...

501
00:40:59,413 --> 00:41:04,473
with Advisor Lotus by my side, all realms and all seas become trivial.

502
00:41:05,393 --> 00:41:07,873
As if I would believe you.

503
00:41:13,893 --> 00:41:15,513
The war is tomorrow.

504
00:41:15,513 --> 00:41:19,433
Why are they training instead of resting?

505
00:41:19,433 --> 00:41:20,753
I know why.

506
00:41:20,753 --> 00:41:22,613
It's for Princess Zhao Lan.

507
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:26,693
I heard about it when I was handing out cakes to the soldiers.

508
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:31,273
Although Princess Zhao Lan is a woman, she has what it takes to be a ruler.

509
00:41:31,273 --> 00:41:36,493
While after Ao Xuan claimed the throne, he started the war and increased the taxes on all Four Seas.

510
00:41:36,493 --> 00:41:38,853
Those who fail to pay up will be killed.

511
00:41:38,853 --> 00:41:43,173
But Zhao Lan enlisted strong men who couldn't pay taxes.

512
00:41:43,173 --> 00:41:45,753
Every month, she ensures they're paid.

513
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:50,313
By doing so, she can avoid crossing Ao Xuan while also allowing them to earn their livelihoods.

514
00:41:50,313 --> 00:41:54,133
You could say Princess Zhao Lan is their savior.

515
00:41:54,133 --> 00:41:55,513
Indeed.

516
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,493
I hope she can return safely.

517
00:41:58,493 --> 00:42:02,753
The service of these loyal men deserve it.

518
00:42:06,293 --> 00:42:09,353
If the three other seas ally to attack the East Sea,

519
00:42:09,353 --> 00:42:14,253
I wonder if these brave men can live to see their princess' return.

520
00:42:15,193 --> 00:42:19,373
I have a way to reduce the casualties. Do you want to hear it?

521
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:21,073
Go ahead.

522
00:42:22,233 --> 00:42:24,013
How are the soldiers in the Western and Eastern Battalions?

523
00:42:24,013 --> 00:42:24,953
They are settling in.

524
00:42:24,953 --> 00:42:26,633
We also have another newly-enlisted five thousand men.

525
00:42:26,633 --> 00:42:27,853
Should they be accounted for too?

526
00:42:27,853 --> 00:42:29,053
This troops were assembled in a rush.

527
00:42:29,053 --> 00:42:30,433
We only have fifty thousand people right now.

528
00:42:30,433 --> 00:42:33,473
The West Sea and the North Sea are assembling their reinforcements too.

529
00:42:40,373 --> 00:42:42,033
No. It's too risky.

530
00:42:42,033 --> 00:42:44,073
It's about your life, we can't mess around.

531
00:42:44,073 --> 00:42:47,153
The method might be risky, but if it works,

532
00:42:47,153 --> 00:42:50,353
one hundred thousand people from the Aquatic Clan will stop fighting.

533
00:42:50,353 --> 00:42:55,333
Even though my power is weak, I can still protect myself. Just trust me.

534
