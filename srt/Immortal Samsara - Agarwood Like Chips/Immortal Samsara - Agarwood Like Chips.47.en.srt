<i>(T/N: Qi is vital energy of an object)</i>

It has the hot springs which can heal everything.

Yan Dan. Yan Dan!

24

Your lotus heart is connected to seven affections and six desires.

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,600
It's your spiritual root and immortal consciousness.

26
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,820
If you rip out your entire heart, you'll go back to your original form.

You can never turn into human form again!

110
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,160
She's lost her entire lotus heart.

111
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,320
Her spiritual root was completely drained.

112
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:46,660
She can no longer take any divine arts or magical spells.

113
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,720

Back then...

115
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,640

118
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,520
I used the other half...

119
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,600
to end the love and hatred between us.

120

Yan Dan. I'll take you away.

I'm sure I can find a way to save you.

It won't work.

128
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,560
Even if there was an entire piece of agarwood,

129
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:02,180
only a little spark would be required for it to burn completely.

130
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,520
It won't stop before it's burnt into ash.

131
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,340
But when the agarwood turns into ash,

132
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:15,920
it'll be useless no matter how big the fire is.

133

The relationship between us

134

135
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,920

00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,720
I don't want to see you anymore.

149
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:15,860
♫ <i> I still have an image of you imprinted in my mind even after washing away the fine dust </i> ♫

150
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:22,080
♫ <i> Life after life, this is the longing I missed the most</i> ♫

151
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,440
♫ <i> You are the breeze of a fallen flower</i> ♫

152
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,080
Yan Dan!

153
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:35,060
♫ <i> Will you shed tears over the truth of the mortal world? </i> ♫

154
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,700
Yan Dan...

155
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:43,480
♫ <i> You're like the unattainable Autumn Moon in the vast sky, don't dare to shine bright yet not hesitate to shine </i>

156
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,240
Yan Dan.

157
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,220
Yan Dan!

158
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,100
Your Majesty, what are you trying to do?

159
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,920
I can't watch her die.

160
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,660
I want to give this whole heart back to her.

161
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,320
You can't! You'll die if you do that!

162
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,880
I don't care!

163
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,040
She suffered the pain of gouging out her heart twice for you.

164
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,180
Just to save you!

165
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,920
If you do this, can you be worthy of what she sacrificed?

166
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,720
Yan Dan and I are the same, we're both Four-Leaf Lotuses.

167
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,280
Our spiritual roots are connected.

168
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,380
I can save her.

169
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,420
Your Majesty, don't do anything rash.

170
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,440
Keep your immortal body.

171
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,520
So that you could give me a hand.

172
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,340
Help!

173
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,840
- Are you all right?
- Thank you, Mountain Chief.

174
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,340
Hurry, go!

175
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,580
Watch out!

176
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,320
Help! Help!

177
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,560
Go!

178
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,480
Get up, go. Go!

179
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,960
Zhi Xi, what are you doing?

180
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,940
Losing the heart shatters the soul.

181
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,260
No medicine can cure it.

182
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:55,980
Only by giving her half of my heart, can we bring her back to life.

183
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:07,360
If you rip out your heart, you'll lose half of your immortal power.

184
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,540
It'll also ruin your spiritual practice.

185
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,960
Are you sure you want to do this?

186
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,900
After she jumped off the bridge, all of my spiritual practice has been for her sake.

187
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,540
With my power, I'm not able to save her.

188
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,840
All I can do is...

189
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:30,380
to use my immortal power to keep you two safe.

190
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,840
Yan Dan, you collected so much divine dust for me.

191
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:05,400
This time, let me shower you with stars.

192
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:55,800
I... will always protect Yan Dan.

193
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,360
I won't break my word again.

194
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:08,920
<i>Yan Dan, your sister, who used to prioritize her future as a deity, has changed.</i>

195
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,420
It hasn't been seven days yet. Why are you back early?

196
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,080
I saw that Ying Yuan was badly injured.

197
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,640
I was worried that it would hurt your body if he died before the time limit.

198
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,940
So I cast a spell to check on his soul.

199
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:24,620
I didn't expect that on his forehead was an Asura Totem.

200
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,080
I knew about this a long time ago.

201
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,160
You ordered me to kill one of our own clan?

202
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,780
Clan?

203
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:44,440
Do you think he's our clan just because he has the Asura Totem like you do?

204
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,100
He has long been tamed by the Heavenly Emperor and sided with the Immortals.

205
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:53,040
If he were to encounter a member of the Asura Clan, he would definitely eliminate them.

206
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,340
Don't forget.

207
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:58,720
In the War of Genesis back then, Ying Yuan achieved brilliant accomplishments.

208
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,880
He will only hurt our plan. He must not be spared.

209
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,440
Just stick to our plan.

210
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:28,040
Welcome back, Emperor Qingli, Ying Yuan.

211
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,260
You're back.

212
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,280
Your Supreme Majesty.

213
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:45,080
Emperor Qingli of East Land, Ying Yuan survived through the hardships and came back alive.

214
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,920
I'm pleased.

215
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,700
This is the blessing of the Three Realms.

216
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,100
Spread the stardust. Ring the Heavenly Bell.

217
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,660
Celebrate with three days off.

218
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:57,800
My fellow deities, let's celebrate it together!

219
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:03,400
<i>Thanks for your great kindness, Your Supreme Majesty. Thanks for your blessing, Your Majesty.</i>

220
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:21,440
Previously, when I heard you had died in the Mortal Realm, I was deeply anguished.

221
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,700
Now that you're back safe and sound.

222
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,480
I'm finally relieved.

223
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,060
But Emperor,

224
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:34,460
I clearly remember there were Daylight Shooting Stars in Nine Heavens that day.

225
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,180
It was a phenomenon that indicated the death of an emperor.

226
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,500
But now, you're alive and well.

227
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,160
What happened exactly?

228
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,200
<i> Lu Ming secretly used a divine tool and changed the records in order to save me.</i>

229
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,960
<i>This is a serious crime in the Heavenly Realm.</i>

230
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,840
<i> If this gets out, I'm afraid he'll be punished for it.</i>

231
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,100
Your Supreme Majesty, I deliberately created the Daylight Shooting Stars.

232
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,820
I was attacked in the Mortal Realm and my celestial vest was damaged.

233
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:08,360
I was worried that the person would come back for me, so I faked my death to hide my trail.

234
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,880
I can't believe someone would dare lay a hand on you.

235
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,960
It was not only that.

236
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,220
I went there to investigate the Divine-Devil War.

237
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,040
I should've had my immortal memory.

238
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,500
Yet, it was tampered with by someone.

239
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:28,540
Apparently, the one who erased my immortal memory and attacked me, must be related to the war.

240
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:35,500
His ability to erase your immortal memory and know your identity to be able to attack you

241
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,360
means it should be a superior deity from the Heavenly Realm.

242
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,960
You've fought with him before. Can you remember who he was?

243
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,940
He was powerful.

244
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,740
The divine arts he used are rarely seen.

245
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:53,020
It's just that I have no idea where he was from.

246
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:58,620
Moreover, that person knew the secret method of the Devil Realm, the Puppet Spell.

247
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,540
Puppet Spell?

248
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:13,680
Could it be... a mole that the Devil Clan hid in the Heavenly Realm?

249
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,020
Is it that we haven't wiped them out entirely yet?

250
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:21,960
Since the previous Divine-Devil War, it has already been 900 years.

251
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,140
I'm thinking it could cause a big disaster.

252
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,520
Please calm down, Your Supreme Majesty.

253
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,340
I fought him several times. He left me some clues.

254
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:42,580
Since I came back, I'll find out who he is and establish the truth.

255
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,700
By the way, your celestial vest was damaged,

256
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:50,660
as a mortal going through your trials this could have been a catastrophe. It would be extremely dangerous

257
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:55,280
if no one was there to adjust your immortal power.

258
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,820
Did someone help you in the Mortal Realm?

259
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:02,180
According to the Heavenly Rules, the person who helped you will be promoted to a deity

260
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,900
and be granted a thousand years of cultivation base.

261
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:08,980
After Zhi Xi descended to the Mortal Realm, she opened this road to Heaven for you to come back.

262
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,540
I'll grant her a reward.

263
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:14,320
If there was someone else who helped you, you can also give me their names.

264
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,560
Right now, we haven't eliminated the mole.

265
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:24,580
If this gets out, it could cause trouble to them instead.

266
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:27,060
Also, this person doesn't care about the titles of the Heavenly Realm.

267
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,440
All they want is freedom.

268
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,020
Who is it that is so carefree?

269
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:40,000
Zhi Xi's sister of the same blood, Yan Dan used half of her lotus heart

270
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,040
to help me break through the test of life and death.

271
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,420
Yan Dan?

272
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:47,900
That Yan Dan who staged an opera during the Jade Pool Festival?

273
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,000
Then one who later jumped off the Bridge of Emptiness.

274
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,420
Yan Dan, for whom you'd rather break your immortal spirit than forget?

275
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,200
She loves you so much.

276
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,210
Then, you...

277
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,760
I've been deeply in love

278
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,920
with her this whole time.

279
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,920
In the past, I wasn't willing to admit it.

280
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:17,640
But now... I just want to be true to myself.

281
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,760
Ying Yuan.

282
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,760
Ying Yuan.

283
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,540
You're such a fool.

284
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:28,080
Though the prohibitions in the Heavenly Realm have been eased slightly,

285
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,040
the first rule of the Heavenly Rules remains the same, love is forbidden.

286
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,660
Your Supreme Majesty,

287
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,380
I owe her this.

288
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:43,300
I'm back in the Heavenly Realm to fulfill my duty as the emperor.

289
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,820
However, after I finish what I need to do,

290
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:50,840
I only want to be dismissed from my role and return to the Mortal Realm, to be Tang Zhou.

291
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,620
The million years of cultivation base and the honor of the Heavenly Emperor,

292
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,960
are you going to leave all that behind?

293
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:06,720
I've been Emperor Qingli in the Three Realms for millions of years.

294
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,300
There's no happiness and sorrow, no sadness or fear.

295
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:14,900
I only want to live as myself for once.

296
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:19,440
Though it's impossible to recover what has been lost.

297
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,820
I hope you can fulfill my wish, Your Supreme Majesty.

298
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,080
Your Supreme Majesty,

299
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:39,600
I took the diving tool, Ground Block away, causing Yelan Mountain to split apart.

300
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,980
The homeland of the demons was ruined.

301
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:47,540
I hope you can grant them a favor to make Yelan Mountain the way it used to be.

302
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,700
Yelan Mountain has always been a deserted mountain with bad water.

303
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,500
It became a treasured land because of the Ground Block.

304
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,800
Now that it was returned, everything goes on as before. This is reasonable.

305
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:05,200
If I intervene, that would be going against the Law of Heaven.

306
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,260
- But—
- Enough.

307
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,920
Say no more.

308
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,820
Nothing is more important than your life.

309
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,220
Even if you've made up your mind to be dismissed from your role and return to the Mortal Realm,

310
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,120
you should also wait until your body recovers.

311
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:22,560
I'll order someone to continue investigating the previous war.

312
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,000
You don't need to worry about it anymore.

313
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,100
Be careful. His Supreme Majesty personally carved it.

314
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,320
It's very precious. We must avoid knocking into it.

315
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,800
My fellow immortal craftsmen, what are you doing here?

316
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,680
This monument...

317
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,960
Your Majesty, you're not aware of this as you were in the Mortal Realm going through trials.

318
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,640
This is the Monument of Glory.

319
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,300
As the deities in the Heavenly Realm languished after the Divine-Devil War,

320
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,000
His Supreme Majesty became sentimental about it.

321
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,040
This monument records the achievements of his life.

322
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,120
The embedded gemstones on the monument were less than satisfactory.

323
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,020
We came to change them as commanded.

324
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,540
It cost manpower and materials to build this monument.

325
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,760
Which celestial deity suggested this?

326
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,520
It wasn't suggested by a celestial deity. It was His Supreme Deity's idea.

327
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,620
<i>His Supreme Majesty didn't like to be extravagant before.</i>

328
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,880
<i> He always keeps things simple.</i>

329
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,080
<i>And he's not someone who craves greatness.</i>

330
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,160
<i>Why would he build a monument for his achievements?</i>

331
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,300
<i>"I am the emperor of Heaven and Earth, the leader of all spiritual beings."</i>

332
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:52,240
<i>"I put all efforts towards saving the world. It's my duty as the Supreme Deity".</i>

333
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,420
Why is that?

334
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,860
Your Majesty.

335
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,700
I've missed you lately.

336
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,980
I wonder if you're doing well.

337
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,560
I am well.

338
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,800
Lu Ming!

339
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,420
Greetings, Your Majesty.

340
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,800
You're here.

341
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,680
His Supreme Majesty wants you to look for a scroll.

342
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,460
Did I interrupt your conversation?

343
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,580
It's all right.

344
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:51,920
His Majesty was in the Mortal Realm for several years. He missed the flowers at the Jade Pool.

345
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,100
He was just asking me about the flowering period.

346
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:03,960
Your Majesty, in five days, there'll be a lunar eclipse.

347
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,960
The epiphyllum in Jade Pool will bloom at night. It'll be a breathtaking view.

348
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,800
As you just returned from the trials, you can meditate while enjoying the flowers.

349
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,280
All right.

350
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,420
Then, I'll get back to work.

351
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,260
I'll excuse myself.

352
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,420
<i>Lunar eclipse?</i>

353
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:30,220
<i>The night-blooming epiphyllum?</i>

354
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,240
<i>House of Rascal?</i>

355
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,000
<i>Lu Ming was implying something.</i>

356
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,920
<i>The real place to meet up with him is the cottage in the Land Under the Horizon.</i>

357
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,800
<i>He managed to help me when I was in distress back then.</i>

358
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,440
<i>Now that he's eager to meet with me.</i>

359
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,180
<i>He must've discovered a trace of the culprit.</i>

360
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:53,100
<i>In five days, it will be Yan Dan's birthday.</i>

361
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,640
Yan Dan.

362
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,820
Whether it's Ying Yuan or Tang Zhou, he has never not recognized us.

363
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:23,620
When we were in the Heavenly Realm, His Supreme Majesty ordered me and His Majesty

364
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:28,160
to tie each other up with the Uncoupling Cord to see if we were in love.

365
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,840
The Red String was attached. It broke immediately.

366
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:37,980
That was when I knew that he had never been confused.

367
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,580
Later, he violated the rules.

368
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,680
He was willing to accept the punishment for falling in love to save you.

369
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,720
His Supreme Majesty wanted to erase his memory about you.

370
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,620
He'd rather break his immortal spirit than forget about you.

371
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:56,800
After you jumped off the bridge, he hasn't played GO with others.

372
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,200
He left Yanxu Heavenly Palace and stayed at the cottage in the Land Under the Horizon day and night.

373
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:06,740
To numb the pain of losing you, he gave himself a heavy load of duties.

374
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,240
The love between you two wasn't a mistake.

375
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:17,380
Just that it's a twist of fate that makes it hard for you to be together.

376
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,920
If you could wake up, maybe you two...

377
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,640
What's wrong?

378
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,260
A glorious light crossed the sky. It's a decree from the Heavenly Court.

379
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,340
I should head back now.

380
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,680
Since the emperor has returned, there'll be a lot of work to do.

381
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,360
You're the curator of the Magical Pavilion.

382
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,880
If you're late, I'm afraid people will make it hard on you.

383
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:46,040
What about Yan Dan?

384
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,000
I'll take care of her.

385
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,820
Okay.

386
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:55,820
When I finish my work in the Heavenly Realm, I'll come back to see her.

387
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,040
About Ying Yuan's injury, it was the doing of someone from the Heavenly Realm.

388
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,400
The entire incident is suspicious. The plot has yet to be unraveled.

389
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,500
On your way back to the Heavenly Realm, please be sure to stay safe.

390
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:10,380
If you discover anything, please feel free to inform me.

391
