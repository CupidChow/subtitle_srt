15
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,300
You're awake.

16
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,000
How come you are here?

17
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,360
You've just soaked in the hot spring.

18
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,820
So I came to check your injury.

19
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,660
Do you feel better?

20
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,910
Where is Yu Mo?

21
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:14,380
Due to the heavenly soldiers' siege, the demons were wounded and terrified.

22
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,300
Yu Mo is comforting the young demons.

23
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,920
He'll come and join us after dealing with it.

24
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,100
I've implicated Yelan Mountain.

25
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,780
Don't say that.

26
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,580
Yu Mo considers you a friend.

27
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,540
No one implicates the other in such an important matter.

28
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,460
Besides, you destroyed your divine power for the sake of the mountain.

29
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,380
The demons were deeply touched when they heard of this.

30
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,140
This is freshly brewed.

31
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,300
Drink it while it's hot.

32
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,720
Is it made with your petals?

33
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,780
Yes. I've already cooked it.

34
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,600
It'll be a waste if you don't drink it.

35
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:19,880
Yan Dan. No matter how much you denied it that day, I already know what's on your mind.

36
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,920
- If—
- Ying Yuan.

37
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:31,540
Both of us know that what stands between us isn't a matter of love.

38
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,720
Now that His Supreme Majesty is no longer around,

39
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,040
you're the only Greater God in the Heaven Realm.

40
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,460
You're an emperor.

41
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,980
You have to assume the responsibility of the Heavenly Court.

42
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,040
The Heavenly Rules are above you.

43
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,540
I don't wish to see you choose between all beings and me.

44
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,640
And... I also have someone I want to protect.

45
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,680
I understand.

46
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,920
The pain of the past cannot be easily healed.

47
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,640
That's why you're scared... and want an escape.

48
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,440
But Yan Dan...

49
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,860
we can't go back to the past.

50
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:26,640
After we've eliminated the evil and everything has settled,

51
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,220
I'll give up on being the emperor.

52
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:40,760
My past experiences tell me there won't be any disappointment if we expect nothing.

53
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,980
It'd be great if we could be together.

54
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:50,600
If we can't... you don't have to blame yourself.

55
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,940
Although agarwood has turned into ashes,

56
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,740
its fragrance still lingers.

57
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,240
I'll never regret knowing you.

58
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,860
All right.

59
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,920
Drink this now, or it'll get cold.

60
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:36,860
Although I've lost most of my divine power,

61
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,340
I used Ground Block to protect my heart meridian.

62
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:46,900
In half a day, I'll regain my spiritual essence and stop it from overflowing.

63
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,780
I've been pressed for time lately.

64
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,580
I didn't have time to deal with many matters.

65
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,460
Huan Qin suffered a huge loss this time.

66
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,060
He won't give up that easily.

67
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,520
From now on, we need to be more cautious.

68
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:12,840
Huan Qin is stubborn and paranoid, but cares about his pride the most.

69
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,900
Now, as Heavenly Emperor, he has decreed to not interfere with the demons of Yelan Mountain.

70
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,120
I don't think he'll go back on his word anytime soon.

71
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,280
Now, everyone is treading on the surface.

72
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,400
We must take off his mask before he plays dirty.

73
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,520
From what I know about him,

74
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,260
he'll surely order a strict inspection of the major pavilions in the Heavenly Court.

75
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:41,020
But even if we did find Liu Weiyang, we're still unable to expose his Puppet Spell.

76
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,660
I have an old acquaintance at one of the divine pavilions.

77
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,860
No one pays attention to this pavilion,

78
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,780
but he's still able to meet with the deities.

79
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,460
Let's wait until everyone's wounds heal, and you've cultivated your spiritual essence before taking action.

80
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,880
Okay.

81
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,360
None of them can get away.

82
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,180
Sister Tao, are you deeply disappointed seeing that I'm safe and sound?

83
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,420
Will you finally tell us what you are hiding?

84
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,840
Or what kind of difficulties you have been facing?

85
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,300
We can't accept every affection and repay every kindness.

86
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,080
Desires of the heart will always lead to regret and grudges.

87
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yan Dan... I'm sorry.

88
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,940
Why does she seek death as soon as Yan Dan returns?

89
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:29,240
Yan Dan's safe return shows that Huan Qin's plan failed.

90
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,360
Maybe she thought Huan Qin had killed Liu Weiyang.

91
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,920
That's why she feels disheartened.

92
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:47,280
Even if it's for the sake of Liu Weiyang, it's still not worth sacrificing her own life like this.

93
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,660
There's a new scar on the back of her neck.

94
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,340
It looks like someone is trying to erase it.

95
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,040
This is the Devil's Location Spell that they plant on people.

96
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,120
Even if they're far from each other, one will be able to locate the other.

97
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,040
The caster is pretty affectionate.

98
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,540
It's imprinted deep into the bone.

99
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,700
The surface may be destroyed, but it can't be totally eliminated.

100
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:39,180
No one except Liu Weiyang knows this spell and can cast it on her.

101
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,620
It seems Liu Weiyang doesn't want to lose her again.

102
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,720
Can we use this Location Spell to locate the caster, too?

103
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,040
Follow it, and we'll find Liu Weiyang.

104
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,500
If Huan Qin knew about this mark and tried to stop us from finding Liu Weiyang,

105
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,560
why didn't Tao Ziqi mention anything about it?

106
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,360
She kept saying she wanted to save him.

107
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,440
She focused all her longing on this hairpin.

108
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,600
But what if this hairpin isn't related to Liu Weiyang?

109
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,540
This hairpin is pretty solid.

110
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:38,060
So it was her who kept us from finding Liu Weiyang?

111
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,560
Thank you for saving me.

112
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,600
Ziqi?

113
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,440
You saved Ziqi, too?

114
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,740
I can't repay your kindness.

115
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,940
If you need my help in the future, I'll be greatly obliged.

116
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,620
Ziqi.

117
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,000
Ziqi.

118
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,240
- Xuan Xiang.
- This is great.

119
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,700
I thought I'd never see you again.

120
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,440
Would you like us to tell Liu Weiyang the truth?

121
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,580
Or you'd like to do it yourself?

122
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,720
Xuan Xiang, I made a big mistake.

123
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,320
Heavenly Emperor threatened me with your life.

124
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,920
I dared not say no.

125
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,540
Ziqi.

126
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,420
Don't blame yourself.

127
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,480
It's not your fault.

128
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,540
You did it for my sake.

129
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,100
I'm sorry.

130
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,720
Ziqi is my wife.

131
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,100
I'll bear the consequences of her mistake.

132
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,840
You can kill me at your discretion.

133
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,340
That wasn't the only thing she did.

134
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,620
She also put Yan Dan's life in danger.

135
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:02,680
She even tried to destroy the mark of the Location Spell.

136
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,500
Xuan Xiang, Heavenly Emperor said

137
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:17,420
if I disobeyed him and let them find you, you'd be killed.

138
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,480
I had no choice.

139
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,120
I could only obey him.

140
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:30,080
At Shenxiao Palace back then, Yu Mo and I saw you sending a letter to the outside world.

141
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,480
You fooled us with the excuse of offering sacrifices.

142
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,760
Then, everyone in the Heavenly Court thought Emperor Ying Yuan had passed away.

143
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,140
But not long after, someone came to steal the divine tool.

144
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,340
Besides us, the only other person who knew of Emperor Ying Yuan's true identity

145
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,860
and the divine tool...

146
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,220
was you.

147
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,200
With just one wrong step,

148
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,880
even my love for you has been questioned.

149
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:05,960
After returning to the Mortal World, I struggled with regret day and night.

150
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,580
In the end, I decided to let go of everything and marry you.

151
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,160
It turns out I made the wrong decision.

152
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,620
In the Heaven Realm, I'm a sinner.

153
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,880
To my friends, I'm a traitor.

154
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,200
No one trusts me anymore.

155
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,240
Xuan Xiang, are you doubting me, too?

156
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,580
Ziqi!

157
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,840
Why did you save me?

158
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,540
Since none of you trust me, why not just let me repay everything with my death?

159
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,960
Ziqi, I trust you.

160
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,800
It was Heavenly Emperor who forced you to do it.

161
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,400
Don't worry.

162
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,020
I'll kill him personally.

163
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:14,300
This way, no one will dare to threaten you anymore.

164
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,600
Liu Weiyang, she has taken refuge with Heavenly Emperor.

165
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,660
How can you still trust her?

166
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,780
What she cherishes the most is the Ziyan Hairpin bestowed by the Heavenly Court.

167
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,880
Have you never doubted her sincerity?

168
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,600
I will believe everything Ziqi says.

169
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,440
I'll give my full cooperation to all your plans.

170
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,140
But I hope you will trust my wife.

171
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:42,400
I'll prove to you all that Ziqi is innocent.

172
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,300
Zhao Lan was placed under house arrest after we left South Sea.

173
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,060
Huan Qin deprived her of the right to rule Four Seas.

174
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:07,300
Fortunately, we found Liu Weiyang in time and could take action before Huan Qin exterminated everyone.

175
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,400
But Huan Qin has absorbed a lot of divine power and gained unfathomable strength.

176
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,240
And he's good at disguising himself.

177
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,860
We still don't know what his true nature is.

178
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,000
There's no way to predict how he'll retaliate.

179
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,600
I wonder if we can hit the bull's eye with our plan.

180
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:30,220
I used to admire him for how he had everything under control and loyal subordinates.

181
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:35,440
It turns out he's very good at disguising himself.

182
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,280
He always manages to gain precise support.

183
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:43,680
Tao Ziqi used to work at Tianji Pavilion, which was under his command.

184
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,420
So now, she might still be loyal to him.

185
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:54,680
No matter what happens tomorrow, we have to plan for the worst.

186
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,980
<i>Yan Dan.</i>

187
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,130
You go first.

188
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,940
Yan Dan...

189
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,900
are you hungry?

190
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:24,330
I knew my master wouldn't let me go hungry.

191
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:27,270
What we'll be doing tomorrow is dangerous.

192
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,240
I've prepared some As Desired Wine.

193
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,560
Let's drink up tonight.

194
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,220
Come on. Come on.

195
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:49,080
I handmade this amulet.

196
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,440
I carried this and fought for millenniums without any worries on the battlefield.

197
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,260
Take it.

198
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,660
The three of us will come home safely tomorrow.

199
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,840
Are you still the lofty emperor I knew?

200
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,660
You have such a human touch and prepared gifts in advance.

201
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,180
But this looks like a petty gift for me.

202
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,520
It's only a piece of rotten wood.

203
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,280
It can neither be eaten nor drunk.

204
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,860
It's meaningless.

205
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,060
You're wrong.

206
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,880
This is no ordinary rotten wood.

207
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,480
This is made with the Shorea Robusta under the ancient God's throne.

208
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,140
This piece of wood is akin to the divine tools in Nine Heavens.

209
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:30,380
How can I accept such a precious gift?

210
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,600
You can't accept it?

211
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,200
I saw you accepted it promptly.

212
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,060
This is called courtesy.

213
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,080
I have a gift for you, too.

214
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,420
I've been making supper for years.

215
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,580
These are the secret recipes I've put together.

216
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,620
Don't underestimate it.

217
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:53,880
These are all Yan Dan's favorite foods.

218
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,460
This is the only copy in the Three Realms.

219
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,260
It's comparable to your gift, isn't it?

220
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,880
Give it to me.

221
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,920
Yu Mo...

222
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,140
no one can act recklessly tomorrow.

223
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,720
The three of us must stay well.

224
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,380
Come on.

225
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,980
This banquet is to relieve your worries.

226
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:55,640
I know rumors have been spreading around Nine Heavens lately.

227
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:01,260
You've been feeling afflicted by the traitor Ying Yuan.

228
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:05,780
Your Supreme Majesty, Emperor Ying Yuan's crimes have not been investigated thoroughly.

229
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,560
What if he is innocent?

230
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:14,200
Ying Yuan was so audacious that he tried to assassinate His Supreme Majesty.

231
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,260
How could he be innocent?

232
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:24,980
I understand many of you have been misled by Ying Yuan's false face, just like Huo De and Yue Yao.

233
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:32,300
I promise I'll hunt him down with all my might and return peace to Nine Heavens.

234
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,820
Didn't you want to unveil the truth?

235
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,960
Why don't you dare to show your true face?

236
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,900
The thieves walked into the lion's den and saved me the trouble.

237
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,560
Xuan Xiang?

238
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,560
You deceived the Three Realms with Puppet Spell.

239
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,300
We can also use this spell to expose your false face.

240
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,380
<i>Star Deity Ji Du?</i>

241
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,300
<i>Star Deity Ji Du?</i>

242
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,200
Calm down.

243
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,080
The devils are tricky.

244
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,880
Xuan Xiang turned me into Huan Qin

245
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,560
and colluded with Ying Yuan to disunite us all.

246
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,280
Is that a trick of yours, too?

247
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,180
It's Star Deity Ji Du's Waist Sword. Is he indeed Huan Qin?

248
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,960
What's going on?

249
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,940
Where is the real heavenly emperor?

250
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:09,400
Everyone, His Supreme Majesty was killed by Huan Qin.

251
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,720
You may find his immortal body in the Divine Cemetery Forest.

252
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,380
If you don't believe me, you can check it yourself.

253
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:22,500
All of you know that His Supreme Majesty

254
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,140
used to cut his flesh to feed the eagle, leaving behind a crescent scar.

255
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,240
Huan Qin, do you dare to undress and show it to us?

256
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,880
You dare not undress because you have something to hide.

257
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,000
I can't believe that we've been deceived by an impostor for years.

258
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:01,760
You did all this because His Supreme Majesty did not appoint you as Emperor.

259
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,680
You held grudges.

260
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,800
I risked my life for the Heavenly Court.

261
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:10,140
But he brushed me off with a mere Refined Steel.

262
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,980
So I turned the Refined Steel into a Waist Sword and hid it on my waist

263
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:18,680
to remind myself at all times not to forget the humiliation I'd endured.

264
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:24,020
The High Priest of Asura Clan, Ling Jiang, revealed everything you have done.

265
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:28,280
As a spy, he has treated you the right way.

266
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,100
So he's indeed Star Deity Ji Du.

267
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,700
I can't believe that we've been deceived for years.

268
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:42,760
Xuan Ye had exuberant divine power but was willing to die for a woman.

269
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,260
Why should I pledge my loyalty to such a useless person?

270
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,700
I helped Heavenly Emperor wipe out my clan.

271
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:59,260
But Heavenly Emperor appointed someone with Xuan Ye's bloodline as Emperor instead

272
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:02,940
and failed to see me, who had purified my bloodline.

273
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:07,160
Purity doesn't lie in the bloodline, but in the heart.

274
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:13,220
Back then, I didn't know you were the son of Xuan Ye and Ran Qing.

275
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:19,160
It turns out that my allegiance had been helping you fight the world.

276
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,220
I only gained a chance after going all out.

277
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:28,520
But you'd be respected so long as you reveal you're an emperor.

278
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,060
How ridiculous. How unfair it is.

279
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:35,920
The duty of an emperor is to protect the peace in the Three Realms.

280
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,160
But you only think about power.

281
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,720
What's wrong with seeking power?

282
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,120
The world is like a game, and all beings are GO pieces.

283
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,980
I don't want to be a pawn anymore.

284
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,080
I want to stand at the top and be in control.

285
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,240
I want to use my hands, which were once broken by the Heaven Realm,

286
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,140
to build a fair and open Law of Heaven.

287
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:00,820
A fair Law of Heaven is never built on deception and crimes.

288
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:05,440
Was our brotherhood when we fought side by side for real or a deception?

289
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,340
Although I hated Heavenly Emperor for his injustice, I have never hated you.

290
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,120
Otherwise, in the Divine-Devil War, I wouldn't have let your divine power off easily,

291
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,700
deliberately made you blind, and sent you away from the battlefield.

292
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,600
I didn't want to cause any disputes to obtain Heavenly Emperor's throne.

293
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,280
If not for your insistence to investigate the suspicious causes of the Divine-Devil War which forced me to take action...

294
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:34,640
I wouldn't have hurt you even a little bit.

295
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,800
Even if Huan Qin was very ambitious, how could he have killed

296
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,320
the three emperors and Heavenly Emperor on his own?

297
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,280
Because he has a few good helpers.

298
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,920
First, the envoy to the Devil Realm, Tao Ziqi.

299
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,300
The Devil King never liked fighting.

300
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:53,800
It was precisely her presence that made the Divine-Devil War possible.

301
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:01,960
The Divine-Devil War was provoked by Shuo Hua, who impersonated me by using Puppet Spell.

302
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,460
The one who colluded with him was you!

303
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,300
He also taught you the Puppet Spell.

304
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:12,800
It was a pity he ended up being used by you and died on the battlefield in my identity.

305
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,920
The former East Sea Dragon King was also your man.

306
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:23,940
To help him ascend Dragon King's throne, you didn't hesitate to annihilate the Nine Fins Clan.

307
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:29,280
The Nine Fins Clan had always been loyal to you and was never involved in disputes.

308
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:33,860
My master, Immortal Lord Bei Ming, was a recluse,

309
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:38,880
but you used his loyalty as your pawn.

310
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,720
That's right.

311
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,600
Given my identity, it was inconvenient for me to attend to many matters in person.

312
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,300
The Nine Fins Clan was loyal to Heavenly Emperor.

313
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:55,100
And all I needed was an obedient leader of the Aquatic Clans.

314
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,580
Yu Mo...

315
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:03,040
do you know how the Nine Fins Clan died tragically?

316
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:13,520
I dispatched them to fight the Asura army and wage an arduous campaign in the battle for days.

317
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:20,020
Then I dispatched the Dragon Clan to pretend to fall into an ambush and ask Nine Fins Clan for assistance.

318
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:24,580
When they entered the valley, they were wiped out.

319
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:30,000
They believed in your small tricks not because you'd planned thoroughly,

320
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,700
but because they were kind-hearted, courageous, and reckless.

321
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,740
Huan Qin, don't be so conceited.

322
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,960
I will kill you sooner or later.

323
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,300
Those who were soft-hearted and gullible did not deserve to survive on this battlefield.

324
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:56,880
It applied to the Nine Fins Clan and the three emperors.

325
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:05,580
I didn't expect to take their lives so easily.

326
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,280
But there was one person who caused me significant trouble.

327
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:14,800
Heavenly Emperor was the only one who saw through my disguise beforehand.

328
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:23,480
Unfortunately, I'd absorbed the divine power of all three emperors before meeting him.

329
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,060
<i>Huan Qin?</i>

330
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,740
<i>It's you, Huan Qin.</i>

331
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:53,080
<i>Why can't I destroy his immortal body?</i>

332
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,840
<i>Since your immortal body can't be destroyed,</i>

333
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:42,920
<i>you'll lie in the Divine Cemetery Forest with my identity for eternity instead.</i>

334
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:48,580
It felt so good stomping on those who'd trampled on me.

335
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:52,420
<i>- Kill Huan Qin!
- Kill him! </i>

336
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:59,160
Today, we'll seek justice for all innocent victims.

337
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,280
Killing me with your current ability?

338
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,840
You're overconfident.

339
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:13,360
Ying Yuan, I'll get someone to make you an exquisite coffin.

340
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,160
You're overconfident and arrogant.

341
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,920
Do you think you have everything under control?

342
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,160
Marshal Huo De?

343
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,540
You were grounded for conspiring and dispatching the army without consent.

344
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:50,980
You better get out of my way to avoid harming these innocent heavenly soldiers.

345
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,500
With me around, stop dreaming of getting into Jade Pool!

346
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,560
I came from the Divine Cemetery Forest.

347
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,800
Huan Qin's crimes of assassinating the monarch and usurping the throne have been exposed.

348
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:08,540
Tai You, are you still going to help him to do evil?

349
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:13,820
Ever since I decided on this, I've never thought of turning back.

350
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:20,100
Huo De, since you're seeking death today, I'll grant you your wish.

351
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:59,620
Emperor Ying Yuan, I'll leave the rest to you!

352
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,720
Good will always prevail over evil.

353
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,720
Marshal Huo De is still very capable.

354
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,240
He has taken down Tai You and your personal army.

355
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:21,420
Even without them, I won't lose.

356
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:57,440
Thank you for the hearty meal.

357
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:01,740
It's time for me to return it to you.

358
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:14,680
A day as Heavenly Emperor, a lifetime as the lord of the Three Realms.

359
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:20,920
After I've eliminated Ying Yuan and his accomplices, I'll undo the Universe Enchantment.

360
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,520
By then, those who submit shall ascend in divinity and be bestowed with divine power.

361
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,460
Those who oppose me shall die immediately.

362
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:35,180
Please think about it carefully.

363
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,760
Generals, listen up!

364
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,020
Defend but don't attack. Gather the soldiers and protect the deities.

365
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,830
Yes, Your Majesty!

366
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,100
Huan Qin, the Heaven Realm doesn't belong to you.

367
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,060
The Law of Heaven lies in our hearts.

368
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,900
Is that so?

369
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:53,680
Huan Qin, did you feel Sanchi's, Fengzhu's, and Chengguang's acupoints getting cold at the same time?

370
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:01,340
Yan Dan suggested injecting the Icy Soul Chilling Toad into our immortal spirits.

371
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:04,080
We paid such a price just because of you.

372
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,580
We didn't listen to your past story patinetly for nothing.

373
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,300
Never take what isn't yours.

374
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,280
You thought you were absorbing divine power.

375
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,160
In fact, you were absorbing the chill venom.

376
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,000
Do you think you can harm me with a mere chill venom?

377
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,980
Huan Qin, you annihilated the Nine Fins Clan.

378
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:24,560
You killed my master and destroyed the South Sea.

379
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,560
Your life alone isn't enough to pay for it. Today is your day of death!

380
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,120
How could this happen?

381
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,160
Even a weak lotus can fight back.

382
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,520
Stop engaging the cover up from the public.

383
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:29,360
Ziqi consumed the Soul-Shattering Elixir?

384
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,720
Xiao Qi.

385
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,580
Ziqi!

386
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,000
The Soul-Shattering Elixir is extremely cold in nature.

387
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,980
It can only be dissipated by the Earthly Fire of Illusion of Devils.

388
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:32,820
<i>Xuan Xiang, are you doubting me, too?</i>

389
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,840
So you knew he took the Soul-Shattering Elixir.

390
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,160
You faked your suicide.

391
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,670
You used your divine power to ignite the Earthly Fire,

392
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:16,960
so you could detoxify the Soul-Shattering Elixir poison in his body.

393
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,320
So, you've never loved...

394
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,280
Liu Weiyang.

395
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,380
It was always Huan Qin in your heart.

396
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,540
Ziqi...

397
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:37,420
how could you go to such an extent just for him?

398
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:43,320
Was our meeting and acquaintance...

399
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,820
part of your plot?

400
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,120
Impossible.

401
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:55,580
I don't believe it. I don't believe it!

402
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:12,840
After the War of Genesis, you placed her in Tianji Pavilion.

403
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,200
You had everything laid out earlier on.

404
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,220
With no desire, there's no ambition.

405
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:23,320
How can someone without desires protect the sentient beings in the Three Realms?

406
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:29,160
Xiao Qi and I want to create the best Heaven Realm.

407
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:13,200
