1
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,040
You're foolish.

2
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:16,800
Your Highness,

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,720
I'll be back late.

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,760
And you come to look for death.

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,440
Your Highness.

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,040
Guess what I have for you.

7
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,360
Second brother, you came to me late at night.

8
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,880
What's important?

9
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,440
Second brother, you are...

10
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,440
Third Brother.

11
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,120
Hand over the soul of Master Bai Zaizai.

12
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,040
Take the Tiger Tally.

13
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,320
Second brother,

14
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,200
If you and me join hands,

15
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,680
we can take down the nation.

16
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,760
At that time, you will be your Carefree King.

17
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,760
Won't you be happy?

18
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,360
Third brother.

19
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,280
I hope you won't forget

20
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,680
when I was in the military power,

21
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,160
I didn't kill them.

22
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,560
Because I don't want to see you and me fighting each other.

23
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,160
Your Highness,

24
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,440
I am going to escort Liu Chang Ge.

25
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,160
Shen Yi,

26
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,280
are you really going to die with me?

27
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,240
Five years ago, Xing Yue died and

28
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,320
we can only stop if we don't die.

29
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,760
Master.

30
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,600
It's here.

31
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,720
You've been through a lot.

32
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,760
Master,

33
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,760
tell me how to save you.

34
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,560
I have already died.

35
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,360
And I'm powerless.

36
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,680
When you help me out of the cage,

37
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,760
that's to help me get free.

38
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,400
It's here.

39
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,120
I've turned you into a human.

40
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,760
We've only been together for a few years.

41
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,640
Know a lot of things.

42
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,800
To teach you these things.

43
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,760
♪ You should remember ♪

44
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,400
Don't be blinded by hatred.

45
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,720
Your Uncle has gone astray.

46
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,840
He will reap what he sow.

47
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,600
Don't avenge me.

48
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,360
Can you promise me that?

49
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,280
Good child,

50
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,760
In the future,

51
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,560
you have to go by yourself.

52
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,200
Just do whatever

53
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,880
whatever you want.

54
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,120
Don't leave yourself regrets.

55
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,640
And don't disappoint yourself.

56
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,480
Such a difficult world.

57
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,040
It's

58
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,480
see yourself,

59
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,560
and see the world.

60
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,680
And see all living beings.

61
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,680
Master.

62
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,040
Master.

63
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,440
Master.

64
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,080
Master.

65
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,200
Master.

66
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,320
What should I do?

67
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,160
I don't have any teacher.

68
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,200
I don't have any teacher.

69
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,320
I don't have a teacher.

70
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,080
Who would use the folding fan?

71
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,400
I smile and ask who owns the folding fan.

72
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,880

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,120

00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,520

melt with this love

80
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:16,280
If wind into the sky,

81
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,800
looking for the deep night light

82
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,960
a dazed and confused sleep. I can't feel the chill.

83
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,760
Why would I fear the pain? I'm not afraid of this calm.

84
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,240
I told Zicheng that I would live and die to make a fortune

85
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,280
