1
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,960
We love each other.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,440
Who is qualified to gossip?

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,200
Miss Gongsun,

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,520
I'd like to make you some tea.

5
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,040
Send her back to the mansion to change.

6
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,560
Don't thank me.

7
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,520
I just don't like her.

8
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,600
It seems like we're going to end this quickly.

9
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,680
Turn.

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,880
And then

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,040
and then like this.

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,880
Your Highness.

13
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,000
Here is the jade soup.

14
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,280
It's here.

15
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,200
It's yours.

16
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,760
Steward Wang's sincerity.

17
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,000
Please drink it yourself.

18
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,200
Steward Wang,

19
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,480
remember to prepare two servings next time.

20
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,520
Ah

21
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,000
yes, Your Majesty.

22
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,880
I'm going back now.

23
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,520
Yes, Your Highness.

24
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,200
Yes, there.

25
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,120
Come on.

26
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,520
Who gives her the right to do that?

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,160
You should take a rest.

28
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,720
I will guard the door for a quarter of an hour.

29
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,760
The other guards will replace me later.

30
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,240
Are you alright?

31
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,160
You

32
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,160
hey!

33
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,880
What are you doing?

34
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,440
Who is it?

35
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,200
Sir, it is me.

36
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,400
It's late. Why aren't you resting?

37
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,400
I brought you some pastries.

38
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,440
I don't need any.

39
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,360
Miss Gongsun, please go back.

40
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,000
Your Highness.

41
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,520
Actually,

42
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,720
I want to discuss with you

43
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,360
the implementation plan of horse-drawn carriage.

44
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,280
I'm not very well today.

45
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,160
We will discuss another day.

46
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,440
Your Highness.

47
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,040
Are you not feeling well?

48
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,720
I'm coming in to show you.

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,200
I'm not married.

50
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,640
We are now single,

51
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,920
Is not appropriate now.

52
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,200
Your Highness,

53
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,160
you have affection and I have righteousness.

54
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,960
What's wrong with that?

55
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,400
Don't put up with it if you can't.

56
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,600
Let me say one more thing.

57
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,440
No need.

58
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,400
Please go back.

59
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,040
When the poison works,

60
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,600
I'll see how you can bear it.

61
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,960
Your Highness.

62
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,200
I will come back later.

63
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,120
You're poisoned with an aphrodisiac.

64
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,600
There's nothing serious.

65
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,000
I'll find the cure for you now.

66
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,200
No antidote is needed.

67
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,520
Who would use the folding fan?

68
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,840
I smile and ask who owns the folding fan.

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,320
After several years of reunion,

70
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,560
♪ I ask if this hatred is strong ♪

71
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,960

melt with this love

77
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,720
If wind into the sky,

78
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,240
looking for the deep night light

79
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,400
a dazed and confused sleep. I can't feel the chill.

80
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,200
Why would I fear the pain? I'm not afraid of this calm.

81
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,680
I told Zicheng that I would live and die to make a fortune

82
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,720
but those are ancient legends.
