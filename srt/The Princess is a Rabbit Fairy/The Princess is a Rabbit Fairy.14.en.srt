1
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,440
Gong Sun Qing, the younger sister of Gongsun Zan,

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,440
was killed by Bai Zaizai outside the city.

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,240
Currently,

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,440
gong Sun Zan has broken up with Liu Chang Ge.

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,600
Hehe.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,000
Without Gongsun Zan,

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,160
liu Chang Ge, only the Imperial Guards Tiger Tally is left.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,720
Grand Preceptor, I wish you every success.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,480
You've done very well.

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,400
Grand Preceptor, please give me the antidote.

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,960
Thank you, Grand Preceptor.

12
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,400
Why are you here?

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,040
What are you doing?

14
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,520
It hurts.

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,640
Gently.

16
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,920
I'm afraid that you'll be tired.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'll help you relax.

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,960
I'm not tired.

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,880
Then I'll get you some water.

20
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm not thirsty.

21
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,760
You must be hungry.

22
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,320
I'll make you some nice food.

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,000
Bunny is abnormal today.

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,200
It's not your style.

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,520
I want to apologize to you.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I know

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,920
you offended Gong Sunzan because of me

28
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,080
and lost your importance in the court.

29
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,320
You must be mad at me.

30
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm just acting like Gongsun Zan.

31
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,520
Why have you ignored me?

32
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,440
Why were you hiding in the pavilion?

33
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,040
I'm thinking

34
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,000
when I want to marry you as my queen.

35
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,720
Will you

36
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,240
sister,

37
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,480
are these fabrics from Nichang House?

38
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,560
That's right.

39
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,080
Is a really good fabric.

40
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,160
That's great.

41
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,040
This matter can't be delayed.

42
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,640
This is the prince's wedding. Who dare to neglected it?

43
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,280
We didn't neglect it last time.

44
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,960
That's right.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,720
For the first time in the history.

46
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,320
The wedding will not change.

47
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,800
The queen swapped the positions.

48
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,440
Guard Bai is more capable

49
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,600
mesmerize the prince and become the queen.

50
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,880
But that's good.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,680
This way,

52
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,080
our chance to become second wives will be better.

53
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,240
Hey!

54
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,640
Your Highness,

55
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,520
these gifts were neglected.

56
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,800
It can be arranged.

57
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,600
Yes

58
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,440
prepare the carriage.

59
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,320
Your Majesty.

60
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,760
I want to ask my second brother

61
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,200
what my Second Brother is thinking.

62
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,000
Marry a demon.

63
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,600
What brings you here, Princess Consort?

64
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,880
Follow me.

65
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,080
Who would use the folding fan?

66
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,400
I smile and ask who owns the folding fan.

67
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,880

00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,120

00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,520

melt with this love

75

If wind into the sky,

76
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,800
looking for the deep night light

77
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,960
a dazed and confused sleep. I can't feel the chill.

78
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,760
Why would I fear the pain? I'm not afraid of this calm.

79
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,240
I told Zicheng that I would live and die to make a fortune

80
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,280
