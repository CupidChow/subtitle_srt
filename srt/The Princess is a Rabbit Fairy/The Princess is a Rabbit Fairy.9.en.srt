1
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,600
You are poisoned by an aphrodisiac.

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,080
There's nothing serious.

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,480
I'll find the cure for you now.

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,680
You don't need the antidote.

5
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,720
Hey!

6
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,640
She ruined my plan again.

7
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,720
It seems that

8
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,640
seducing Fox Clan

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,080
Is that all.

10
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,360
Who are you?

11
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,600
Don't mind who I am.

12
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,360
You only need to know that we have similar purposes.

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,440
I can provide you with some information.

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,920
What information?

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,480
Tell me about it.

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,920
Bai Zaizai is just like you,

17
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,480
she's also a demon.

18
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,680
Master said that

19
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,920
human monsters will be hunted down by the Demon Hunters when they love each other.

20
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,000
It won't end well.

21
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,480
Your Highness, take your time.

22
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,920
I will leave now.

23
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,600
Good morning.

24
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,680
Good morning.

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,920
Why don't you wear guard armor?

26
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,280
My salary will be deducted.

27
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,680
I... I'm leaving now.

28
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,720
Come on.

29
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,880
Where are you going?

30
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,120
I have things to do.

31
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,960
I want to look for Bai Yu.

32
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,840
Are you really leaving?

33
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,440
Leave now,

34
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,920
I'm afraid we'll fall for it.

35
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,360
I can't.

36
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,440
Really?

37
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,080
What Bai Zaizai

38
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,720
you are the prince's guard.

39
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,200
You leave without your permission.

40
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,120
You will not get paid.

41
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,680
You

42
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,640
It's unreasonable!

43
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,480
That's enough.

44
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,760
Steward Wang,

45
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,840
please settle the account with Guard Bai.

46
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,680
Yes

47
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,760
take care.

48
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,120
Your Highness.

49
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,680
You said you were sick yesterday,

50
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,360
I was so worried.

51
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,360
I brought

52
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,480
so I brought you snacks.

53
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,920
How about you take a seat?

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,880
It must be embarrassing.

55
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,080
Is that all?

56
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,760
That's all?

57
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,240
Remember to close the door.

58
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,680
Your Highness.

59
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,400
Guard Bai left the palace.

60
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,920
And went to the west.

61
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,120
Your Highness.

62
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,960
If you can't bear to part with Guard Bai,

63
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,400
why don't you personally bring her back?

64
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,280
Steward Wang.

65
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,680
I will leave the mansion recently.

66
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,000
You will decide the matters

67
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,920
you figure it out.

68
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,760
Please rest assured.

69
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,120
Help me pack up.

70
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,160
Yes

71
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,280
white Zaizai.

72
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,880
Guard Bai.

73
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,640
Going somewhere far?

74
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,160
You talk in an enigmatic manner.

75
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,080
Aren't you afraid that I'll let you show your true self?

76
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,600
Qing'er, you seem to have a lot of free time.

77
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,400
Discuss your marriage with your fiance instead?

78
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,600
I don't need to worry about my business.

79
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,440
Mind your own business first.

80
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,960
Miss Qing'er is the same.

81
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,880
Be careful not to show your tail.

82
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,520
How dare you laugh at me?

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,920
Let me see what you are.

84
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,600
She's really a demon.

85
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,520
Who would use the folding fan?

86
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,840
I smile and ask who owns the folding fan.

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,320
After several years of reunion,

88
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,560
♪ I ask if this hatred is strong ♪

89
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,960

90

00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,960
melt with this love

95
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:39,720
If wind into the sky,

96
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,240
looking for the deep night light

97
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,400
a dazed and confused sleep. I can't feel the chill.

98
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,200
Why would I fear the pain? I'm not afraid of this calm.

99
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,680
I told Zicheng that I would live and die to make a fortune

100
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,720
but those are ancient legends.

101
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,320
