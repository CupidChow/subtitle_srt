1
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,000
A virtuous bird chooses a tree to perch.

2
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,760
A virtuous man chooses a master to serve.

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,320
Sorry, Your Highness.

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,320
Be careful

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,520
don't hurt the bride.

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,240
Second Brother.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,800
It seems that

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,920
you care about her, right?

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,240
Wang Xia, how dare you betray me?

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,920
Aren't you afraid of being poisoned and dying?

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,840
Grand Preceptor.

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,320
I was money-hungry.

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,760
Can you bribe me

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,320
only 1000 taels of gold?

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,640
That's ridiculous.

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,040
Dream on!

17
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,840
The Second Prince treated me like family.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,760
I'm not only dead from the poison,

19
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,760
even if we are doomed,

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,200
I will never betray the Second Prince.

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,800
Brother.

22
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,840
It is all up with

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,640
It is all up with

24
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,520
I think you have misjudged the situation.

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,720
It won't take long for the imperial guards

26
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,400
the Imperial Guards will kill every one of your guards.

27
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,320
You can escape then.

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,600
You won't know that

29
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,120
all the imperial guards outside will be destroyed.

30
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,000
Liu Chang Ge.

31
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,600
Are you dreaming when you are dying?

32
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,760
Master,

33
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,520
gong Sun Zan has brought a troop of Xuanjun with him.

34
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,320
Collaborate from within with forces from outside

35
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,040
our people can't resist them.

36
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,120
What?

37
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,200
Gong Sun Zan,

38
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,120
and Li Jian.

39
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,440
As the Commander of the Imperial Guards,

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,880
you have become a traitor as your teacher.

41
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,680
You will die today.

42
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,840
Liu Changhe,

43
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,720
In order to deal with the Second Prince,

44
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,760
to pretend to be Qing'er.

45
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,480
And almost killed Qing'er.

46
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,640
Fortunately, Princess Bai saved Qing'er,

47
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,680
so that we could be reunited.

48
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,920
Brother.

49
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,520
I am Alive

50
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,160
a monster pretended to be me before.

51
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,160
Brother!

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,320
All this is the conspiracy of Shen Yi and Liu Changhe.

53
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,120
I wouldn't have entered the palace

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,920
I will...

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,320
Thank you, Miss Bai.

56
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,960
General Gongsun.

57
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,520
Shen Yi is about to rebel.

58
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,200
I hope you can forgive and forget

59
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,400
to help the prince.

60
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,800
After I've settled my sister in,

61
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,640
mobilize Xuan Army in Heavy Armour

62
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,600
and fight with Shen Yi.

63
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,120
Please wait for a while.

64
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,120
Thank you, General.

65
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,760
Are you all right?

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,120
Second Brother.

67
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,240
I lost.

68
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,440
Take me to see my father.

69
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,840
Grand Preceptor.

70
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,920
Do you still want to resist?

71
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,640
Give me the antidote!

72
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,840
To remove the poison.

73
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,640
I can plead with His Majesty.

74
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,720
Grand Preceptor,

75
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,760
It is all up with

76
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,440
surrender.

77
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,440
Surrender!

78
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,600
You're the prince.

79
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,480
Maybe she can spare him the death penalty.

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,200
What about us?

81
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,120
Surrender.

82
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,360
You'll have to die.

83
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,360
Mother.

84
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm not a filial son.

85
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,480
I'll leave now.

86
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,720
Formation!

87
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,040
Release the arrows.

88
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,440
No magic array, two instruments, four figures.

89
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Eliminate the evil!

90
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,800
Stay here!

91
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,800
The hairpin.

92
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,600
Shen Yi,

93
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,800
to keep the antidote.

94
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,720
To my surprise,

95
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,320
I've planned for so many years

96
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,000
and still falls short of success.

97
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,640
Brat.

98
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,720
Even if I can't succeed,

99
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,920
to take your life today

100
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,160
to avenge my dear Apricot.

101
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,040
Is just your obsession.

102
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,040
If you really care about Shen Xing,

103
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,320
why would you let her enter the mansion

104
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,160
and steal the Tiger Tally by risking her life?

105
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,840
Why would he hit her seriously

106
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,120
after she returned the Tiger Tally?

107
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,200
Yes

108
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,280
I was extremely ambitious back then.

109
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,400
When I saw Xing'er risking her life to steal the Tiger Tally for you,

110
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,920
I will release her to your side.

111
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,440
I wanted to assist you.

112
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,840
But I never thought

113
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,680
you forced Xing to die.

114
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,800
The only purpose of my life

115
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,360
Is to take revenge.

116
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,720
That's right.

117
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,320
I want all of you

118
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,240
to die with you.

119
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,640
For the sake of Shen Yi,

120
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,240
I won't kill you

121
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,320
I won't kill you.

122
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,680
Then don't avenge me.

123
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,520
Can you promise me that?

124
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,240
Please remember that

125
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,040
father was defeated.

126
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,720
I'm sorry.

127
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,360
Who would use the folding fan?

128
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,680
I smile and ask who owns the folding fan.

129
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,160

looking for the deep night light

139
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,240
a dazed and confused sleep. I can't feel the chill.

140
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,040
Why would I fear the pain? I'm not afraid of this calm.

141
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,520
I told Zicheng that I would live and die to make a fortune

142
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,560
