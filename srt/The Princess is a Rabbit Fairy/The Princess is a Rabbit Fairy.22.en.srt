1
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,800
Your Majesty.

2
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,680
Hurry!

3
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,280
Summon the doctor!

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,680
Summon the Second Prince.

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,600
Summon Second Prince.

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,240
Your Majesty.

7
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,040
News comes from the imperial palace hospital.

8
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,600
The emperor is dying.

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,920
Ask Liu Chang Ge to get married early

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,240
to bring good luck to the emperor.

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,440
It's said that Princess Consort was turned into a monster.

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,240
The whole court was against this marriage.

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,680
That kid, Liu Chang Ge,

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,880
he decided to keep his marriage simple.

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,000
He only invited 12 relatives and friends.

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,000
None of the officials attended.

17
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,480
It's a good time for us to do it.

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,320
You've done very well.

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,720
It seems we're going to move up as planned.

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,000
You can go back.

21
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,720
Yes

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,240
grand Preceptor, please give me celestial medicine.

23
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,520
Thank you, Grand Preceptor.

24
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,920
Supervisor Wang,

25
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,120
the Eldest Prince has agreed to let you return

26
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,720
to return to the palace.

27
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,760
As the Palace Steward.

28
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,760
I will

29
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,880
thank you, Your Highness.

30
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,120
When the old emperor punished you for greed for money,

31
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,560
and expelled you from the palace.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,760
His son refused to invite you back after he ascended the throne.

33
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,120
And Liu Chang Ge

34
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,040
and dare not make a promise to you.

35
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,880
The only wise choice

36
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,720
with Eldest Prince.

37
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,520
When it's done,

38
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,120
I will reward you with another thousand taels of gold.

39
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,320
I won't

40
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,040
I sacrificed myself for the Imperial Tutor

41
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,760
shrink from no sacrifice

42
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,880
liu Chang Ge.

43
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,600
As the saying goes, valleys are different.

44
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,120
If they die, they share the same den.

45
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,720
Disbelieve

46
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,680
as if by daylight.

47
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,880
Here comes the bride,

48
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,480
second Brother.

49
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,200
You'd better not get married.

50
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,200
Brother.

51
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,600
If you give this up today,

52
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,040
I might be able to offer you a toast.

53
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,160
You don't know when you are going to die.

54
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,200
Today, let's settle the scores of old and new.

55
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,160
If you don't want them to be buried with you,

56
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,400
before you die.

57
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,520
Just like my daughter.

58
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,760
Taoist priest.

59
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,400
No need to say another word.

60
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,240
After we killed his mother back then,

61
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,120
and today,

62
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,640
I can also kill him.

63
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,600
Your Highness.

64
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,120
Your Highness.

65
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,160
The imperial guards have entered.

66
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,000
The First Prince threatened them with the Tiger Tally and imperial edict

67
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,640
with the Tiger Tally and edict.

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,640
Yet you still refuse to give up.

69
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,760
It seems that we two brothers can't be good today.

70
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,200
In that case,

71
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,280
dear guests,

72
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,600
please leave first.

73
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,960
Or you might get hurt

74
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,320
and hurt you.

75
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,400
It's still a while before the Imperial Guards can attack.

76
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,800
Now that you're here,

77
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,120
don't leave.

78
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,480
Use your hands.

79
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,200
You have Zhang Liangji?

80
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,560
I had a ladder.

81
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,200
Today I'll be executed!

82
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,600
We'll surrender the imperial guards.

83
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,880
Liu Chang Ge!

84
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,480
If you shoot an arrow,

85
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,120
your bride will be beheaded.

86
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,080
That's here.

87
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,080
Steward Wang, what are you doing?

88
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,080
Who would use the folding fan?

89
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,400
I smile and ask who owns the folding fan.

90
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,880

melt with this love

98

If wind into the sky,

99
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,800
looking for the deep night light

100
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,960
a dazed and confused sleep. I can't feel the chill.

101
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,760
Why would I fear the pain? I'm not afraid of this calm.

102
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,240
I told Zicheng that I would live and die to make a fortune

103
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,280
