1
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,200
You're alive again.

2
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,360
How should you thank me?

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,480
No matter how Third Prince

4
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,360
what a big yard this is!

5
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,800
This guy is really extravagant.

6
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,800
I guess the Second Prince took her home alone.

7
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,520
The Second Prince specially ordered us

8
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,720
we must bring all her food to the room.

9
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,320
It seems that she is the lover of the Second Prince.

10
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,320
Hey!

11
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,440
I believe that

12
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,640
the day will come

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,480
the Second Prince's lover one day.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,040
My first kiss!

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,160
My first kiss?

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,200
I kept it for Second Prince.

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,200
Black chicken trying to be phoenix?

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,160
How can you be qualified?

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,440
Leave now! Go now!

20
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,480
Beyond one's ability

21
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,560
hey.

22
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,840
Why did you call me here?

23
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,280
Standing outside the door,

24
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,240
what?

25
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,560
Why is there so much nonsense?

26
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,560
Hey!

27
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,560
I promised you to be a guard.

28
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,000
But I didn't promise you to stand guard.

29
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,560
I need to pay for the guard.

30
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,720
You are my guard.

31
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,960
A guard has to stand guard.

32
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,400
If you don't, I'll deduct your wages.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,720
I knew you were not that kind.

34
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,440
You're a bad guy.

35
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,040
You jerk.

36
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,760
Shit!

37
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,160
If it's not because I'm poor,

38
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,040
that's not right.

39
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,600
If I hadn't caught the traitor Bai Yuyu,

40
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,040
I wouldn't have been wronged here.

41
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,600
Chief Wang,

42
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,400
this is a portrait of myself.

43
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,600
Please give this to the prince for me.

44
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,920
Is there anything on my face?

45
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,840
As if I were a child.

46
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,840
Are you going to repeat the same mistake?

47
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,960
Your Highness.

48
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,080
Please enjoy yourself.

49
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,160
I'll leave now.

50
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,360
Be rather baffling

51
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,040
guard Bai.

52
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,480
Eat first.

53
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,160
Please.

54
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,960
Do we have carrots?

55
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Carrot?

56
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,960
That's not in the recipe

57
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,280
we didn't have them.

58
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,840
Raw?

59
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,480
Do you have raw carrots?

60
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,720
Raw?

61
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,520
Well

62
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,280
I think so.

63
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,800
But why do you need that thing?

64
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,480
Change these vegetables into carrots.

65
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,080
But I think

66
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,800
come on.

67
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,040
Come on.

68
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,040
Look at yourself.

69
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,400
The attractive and popular,

70
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,160
his heart is surely the best.

71
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,040
Just help me out.

72
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,600
You have good taste.

73
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,800
Alright, wait here.

74
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,600
Let me do it for you.

75
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,280
Alright.

76
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,080
Thank you.

77
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,480
Guard Bai.

78
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,600
Guard Bai,

79
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,160
you're new here,

80
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,720
you're new to the mansion.

81
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,600
I came to set some rules for you.

82
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,240
Alright.

83
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,400
Come in.

84
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,120
What are you doing?

85
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,840
Guard Bai.

86
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,240
The royal mansion

87
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,520
have no bottom

88
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,800
that you can come to.

89
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,720
How about

90
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,360
take the money and leave.

91
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,360
To the outside.

92
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,600
To see and walk around.

93
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
What do you think?

94
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,160
You want to drive me out.

95
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,080
Who do you think you are?

96
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,960
No need, Steward Wang.

97
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,480
The mansion is so huge.

98
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,480
My legs are short.

99
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,720
It's enough for me to walk.

100
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,680
I heard that a girl like you

101
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,160
disappeared

102
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,480
without a reason.

103
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,080
Who would use the folding fan?

104
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,400
I smile and ask who owns the folding fan.

105
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,880
After several years of reunion,

106
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,120
♪ I ask if this hatred is strong ♪

107
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,520

melt with this love

113
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,280
If wind into the sky,

114
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,800
looking for the deep night light

115
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,960
a dazed and confused sleep. I can't feel the chill.

116
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,760
Why would I fear the pain? I'm not afraid of this calm.

117
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,240
I told Zicheng that I would live and die to make a fortune

118
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,280
but those are ancient legends.

119
