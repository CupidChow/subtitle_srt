1
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,560
Silly girl.

2
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,600
Don't pretend to be strong.

3
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,080
What can you do?

4
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,400
What can I do?

5
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,720
Come.

6
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,080
Bind up my wounds.

7
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,680
Bad guy.

8
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,720
I...

9
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,040
You know what?

10
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,800
When I bandaged your wounds,

11
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,440
I closed my eyes.

12
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,840
I don't see anything.

13
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,800
I don't believe you.

14
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,720
You know what?

15
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,200
If it wasn't for the fact that you tried so hard to save me,

16
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,320
I won't do such rough work.

17
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,720
Who cares?

18
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,720
What are you waiting for?

19
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,920
Now that you're healed,

20
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,400
quickly bandage it up

21
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,920
then we can leave this place.

22
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,800
What if she comes back?

23
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,560
No one is here.

24
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,560
Ah

25
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,360
this is my house.

26
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,120
Your home?

27
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,160
What a coincidence.

28
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,400
Where's your family?

29
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,640
My teacher is dead.

30
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,560
My Junior Sister defected.

31
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,040
I'm the only one left.

32
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,920
It's fine.

33
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,040
What about yourself?

34
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,560
Where is your family?

35
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,840
Oh,

36
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,840
what's your relationship with Chen Xiaoxiao?

37
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,040
I have...

38
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,080
When I was eight years old,

39
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,200
my mother was killed by a group of Taoist priests.

40
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,160
Father, bring me back to the mansion,

41
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,200
even fewer people can accompany me.

42
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,320
Only Chief Wang

43
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,800
and Prime Minister Chen's daughter Chen Xiaoxiao

44
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,280
and then

45
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,560
father mutinied and ascended the throne.

46
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,320
And I moved into the palace.

47
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,960
People in the palace are scheming against each other.

48
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,200
I don't want Xiaoxiao to accept these things.

49
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,680
I slowly alienated her.

50
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,640
But I didn't expect that

51
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,440
my father betrothed her to my brother five years ago.

52
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,960
Then she

53
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,400
she should like you.

54
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,160
When Father mutinied,

55
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,040
shed blood like water

56
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,920
Is a ruthless emperor.

57
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,400
I've watched too many brotherly fighting and sibling rivalry.

58
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:28,920
So,

59
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,040
I really don't want her to marry into the royal family.

60
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,440
However,

61
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,080
since Father Emperor has given the order,

62
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,280
I have no chance to do that.

63
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,960
She is poor.

64
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
If I didn't probe your memory,

65
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,640
I wouldn't know that you came from another world.

66
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,400
Interesting.

67
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,200
Come, eat.

68
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,200
Who are you?

69
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,800
Where is this?

70
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,920
Do you know who I am?

71
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,680
Let me out of here!

72
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,400
Come. Ignore her.

73
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,840
Brother, where are you?

74
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,320
Please help me!

75
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,080
Who can use the folding fan?

76
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,400
I smile and ask who owns the folding fan.

77
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,880

melt with this love

If wind into the sky,

looking for the deep night light

87
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,960
a dazed and confused sleep. I can't feel the chill.

88
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,760
Why would I fear the pain? I'm not afraid of this calm.

89
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,240
I told Zicheng that I would live and die to make a fortune

90
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,280
