1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:11,800
Hey!

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,880
Have you heard that

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,440
the princess the Second Prince sought

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,720
Is a monster.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,880
Then Prince has a very good character.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,080
He's ruined.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,320
He's still a noble official no matter how good he is.

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,040
I heard they like girls who turn into monsters.

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,640
Ah

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,120
well

11
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,480
your Highness.

12
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,440
Let me introduce them to you.

13
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,640
This is my teacher,

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,000
the honorable Lu Li.

15
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,240
Your Highness.

16
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,760
Yesterday, we were meditating in the hall.

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,080
Uncle suddenly appeared

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,840
he told me that when he observed the sky at night,

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,080
and found that Kui Xing is dim

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,480
what celestial phenomenon is...

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,240
The Second Prince Liu Chang Ge violated heaven's right

22
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,800
and married a monster,

23
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,360
before she was born.

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,560
Before he became an immortal,

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,000
before he became an immortal.

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,480
Human and demon love each other,

27
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,440
the Three Realms will be in chaos.

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,440
When the six realms become unstable,

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,240
and all living beings will be annihilated.

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,720
But don't worry, Your Highness.

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,240
The Demon Hunters Alliance will not stand by.

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,400
This has nothing to do with me.

33
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,280
Your Highness.

34
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,000
Your Prince

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,600
Is extraordinary.

36
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,640
His biological mother

37
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,080
Is the Serpent I killed 15 years ago.

38
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,480
Lu Sha,

39
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,560
he's a mixed-blood.

40
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,720
So he is extremely talented.

41
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,520
With incredible demon power.

42
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,200
A hybrid between human and demon.

43
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,480
Well

44
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,760
your Highness,

45
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,920
commander Shen Yi and Third Prince are here to see you.

46
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,080
What do you want

47
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,920
come here today?

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,640
Grand Preceptor said

49
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,600
they knew Taoist Priest Li and Minister Lu are here to see the First Prince.

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,120
They are also old friends.

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,960
We can talk things over together.

52
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,520
Please come in.

53
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,360
Yes

54
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,520
long time no see

55
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,360
the Eldest Prince,

56
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,720
third Brother, this is...

57
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,880
Your Highness, do you recognize this?

58
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,920
The Tiger Tally?

59
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,920
State Preceptor, after you.

60
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,480
Why is the Tiger Tally with Grand Preceptor?

61
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,680
What's wrong with Third Brother?

62
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,760
His Highness wasn't obedient.

63
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,760
I just asked him to be quiet for a while.

64
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,440
What brings you here?

65
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,680
I'm here

66
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,400
to negotiate an alliance with the eldest prince.

67
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,680
Why did Grand Preceptor abandon my brother?

68
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,240
And ally with me?

69
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,920
Liu Changjie,

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,640
don't try to help.

71
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,400
I'm aligning myself with the Eldest Prince

72
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,080
Is because

73
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,760
he has an irreconcilable feud with me,

74
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,720
all right.

75
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,000
With the help of Grand Preceptor and Taoist priest of the Demon Hunters League,

76
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,760
I'll surely achieve great things.

77
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,200
His Majesty intends to support Liu Chang Ge to ascend the throne.

78
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,880
So we must get rid of him as soon as possible.

79
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,680
Gong Sun Zan has always been hostile to us.

80
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,600
As early as possible.

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,480
Gongsun Zan is nothing to be afraid of.

82
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,680
Besides, his sister is still in my prison.

83
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,280
That's great.

84
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,400
However,

85
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,360
the Eldest Prince has someone to watch out for.

86
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,880
Who is it?

87
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,160
The Princess Consort.

88
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,240
She has an affair with Liu Chang Ge.

89
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,440
So the First Prince

90
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,520
why are you like this?

91
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,440
Our destiny has ended.

92
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,640
The Eldest Prince,

93
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,520
great things don't stick to trifles.

94
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,360
Who's there?

95
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,200
I'm the Princess Consort.

96
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,000
I want to see the Second Prince!

97
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,240
Steward Wang!

98
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,960
I want to see Chang Ge.

99
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,200
Slowly.

100
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,160
Slowly.

101
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,320
Your Highness!

102
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
Your Highness!

103
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,480
Hurry!

104
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,560
Come on!

105
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,560
Hurry!

106
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,520
Hold on!

107
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,760
Hold on!

108
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,680
Chang Ge.

109
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,240
Liu Changhe,

110
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,000
form an alliance with Grand Preceptor.

111
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,960
They want to take your life.

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,440
Xiaoxiao, don't talk first.

113
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,160
I've called for the imperial doctor.

114
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
I was wounded by the Grand Preceptor.

115
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,480
No one can save him.

116
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,720
The Emperor intends to abolish the elder and replace the younger.

117
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,880
You'll be the Crown Prince soon.

118
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,640
However,

119
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,080
liu Changhe and Shen Yi are going to mutiny.

120
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,520
You need to make preparations early.

121
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,440
To save Gong Sun Qing from Liu Changhe.

122
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,080
Okay. Get him to be praised.

123
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,080
Small.

124
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,240
I know.

125
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,080
Stop talking.

126
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,680
Chang Ge.

127
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,200
I still remember

128
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,680
when you were little,

129
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,920
you didn't talk much.

130
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,160
I was the only one we talked.

131
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,200
When other kids bullied me,

132
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,880
only you stood up for me.

133
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,560
That's what

134
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,440
It was the happiest time

135
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,000
In my life.

136
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,120
If there's another life,

137
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,080
I hope

138
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,840
small.

139
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,240
Who would use the folding fan?

140
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,560
I smile and ask who owns the folding fan.

141
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,040
After several years of reunion,

00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,280

melt with this love

149

If wind into the sky,

150
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,960
looking for the deep night light

151
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,120
a dazed and confused sleep. I can't feel the chill.

152
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,920
Why would I fear the pain? I'm not afraid of this calm.

153
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,400
I told Zicheng that I would live and die to make a fortune

154
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,440
