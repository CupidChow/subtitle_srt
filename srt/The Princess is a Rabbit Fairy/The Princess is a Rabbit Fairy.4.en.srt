1
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,760
Steward Wang.

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,120
My Lady Yuzhan,

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,240
you are the prince's most trusted person.

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,480
Then please

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,000
give this document

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,880
to the prince.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,120
The document.

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,880
Don't bother.

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,320
Lady Yuzhan's business is my business.

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,080
Share a carriage.

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,320
Fancy!

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,360
Ideas?

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,960
Gong Sun Qing is really clever and extraordinary.

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,400
Eh, Chief Wang.

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,760
I'd like to see this outstanding talent.

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,000
Gong Sun Qing.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yes, Your Highness.

18
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,600
I'll make the arrangements for you now.

19
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,720
Last night the stars went by last night.

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,240
East of Gui Hall by the side of Painting Tower.

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,320
Without wings of colorful phoenixes,

22
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,760
mind acts upon mind

23
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,480
that's great.

24
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,120
You are indeed the most talented girl of the dynasty.

25
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,840
She was quick-witted and outspoken.

26
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,720
Once this poem spreads,

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,640
It'll become a famous poem forever.

28
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,080
That's too kind of you.

29
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,360
Although I'm the daughter of a general,

30
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,240
I like to write poems as my enemy.

31
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,120
And even a little fascinated.

32
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,400
So she focuses more on these things.

33
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,240
It's like some foodies

34
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,120
If they like turnips, they think only of turnip all day long.

35
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,360
My white sister,

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,120
am I right?

37
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,720
Just show off

38
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,000
just show off your stuff.

39
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,000
Why did you call me a foodie?

40
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,640
Your Majesty.

41
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,760
I didn't call your name.

42
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,600
That you are a foodie.

43
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,120
You

44
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,640
If you're so great,

45
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,880
let me test you.

46
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,240
Don't be presumptuous.

47
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,480
Your Highness.

48
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,480
It's fine now.

49
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,160
Alright.

50
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,320
Make a poem out of radish then.

51
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,520
I'm screwed.

52
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,040
You've never memorized this before.

53
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,040
Furthermore,

54
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,680
who could be so bored and write poetry to carrot?

55
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,800
You don't look so confident anymore?

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,040
So talented girl can't do anything.

57
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,320
You don't have the right

58
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,040
how I am.

59
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,400
Don't be anxious.

60
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,040
Since composing poem is not good,

61
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,400
let's sing a song then.

62
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,160
It's also about turnips.

63
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,640
You

64
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,680
what?

65
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,040
Don't tell me you can't even sing the song.

66
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,800
What do you know?

67
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,160
Your Highness.

68
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,200
I'm not feeling well today.

69
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,080
I will discuss the implementation plan of horse-drawn carriage with you the other day.

70
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,040
Alright.

71
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,280
You two.

72
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,520
Sister. Sister.

73
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,920
What's wrong? Why are you so angry?

74
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,000
The guards at Second Prince's Mansion bullied me.

75
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,640
Will you care about them?

76
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,320
What?

77
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,160
Have some water.

78
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,800
Cool down.

79
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
I won't drink.

80
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,680
Don't worry.

81
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,640
He'll get the justice back for you.

82
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,760
I won't cheat you

83
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,320
how would I lie to you?

84
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,040
Brother.

85
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,400
You are the best!

86
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,680
Now, calm down.

87
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,400
Alright?

88
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,680
Alright?

89
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,200
Sit down.

90
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,160
She's Shen Xing.

91
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,040
She is not

92
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,240
who would use the folding fan?

93
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,560
I smile and ask who owns the folding fan.

94
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,040
After several years of reunion,

95
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,280
♪ I ask if this hatred is strong ♪

96
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,680

97

melt with this love

102
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,440
If wind into the sky,

103
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,960
looking for the deep night light

104
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,120
a dazed and confused sleep. I can't feel the chill.

105
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,920
Why would I fear the pain? I'm not afraid of this calm.

106
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,400
I told Zicheng that I would live and die to make a fortune

107
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,440
but those are ancient legends.

108
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,040
