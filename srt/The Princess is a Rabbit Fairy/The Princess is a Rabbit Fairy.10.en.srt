1
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,640
How dare you laugh at me?

2
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,040
Let me see what you are.

3
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,720
She's really a demon.

4
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,040
My morals are shallow.

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,560
I will consult with Eldest Prince.

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,160
It turns out that you are fellow cultivators.

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,040
Guard Bai,

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,240
I'll leave now.

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,240
She's a fox demon.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,920
Should I tell him?

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,000
Whatever.

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,680
The fox demon can't hurt him.

13
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,720
Your Highness.

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,760
Guard Bai beside Liu Chang Ge?

15
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,560
Is also a demon.

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,320
And sabotaged my plan repeatedly.

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,040
If this goes on,

18
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,000
It may not be good for us.

19
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,920
She could kill her.

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,240
But we have no idea the power behind her.

21
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,560
And someone is watching Third Prince too.

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,160
If we help him,

23
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,400
I'm afraid that...

24
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,800
Li Youdao of the Demon Hunters Alliance

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,280
and I happen to be on good terms.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,880
Master,

27
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,080
I'm back

28
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,520
I went to the mortal world.

29
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,000
To realize that it's not easy to be a man.

30
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,200
There are so many red tapes in the mortal world.

31
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,480
I can handle it.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,200
But I can't handle love in the world.

33
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,240
Master,

34
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,320
my heart is in a mess right now.

35
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,080
What should I do?

36
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,000
Utterly bewitching.

37
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,480
Don't show yourself.

38
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,000
You and I have no grudge against each other.

39
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,720
Why are you taking me in?

40
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,400
Stop!

41
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,680
Demons are cholera in the world.

42
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,960
Catching you is the duty of the Demon Hunters.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And die.

44
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,200
Demon Mirror.

45
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,720
Demon-detector.

46
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,760
Immortals can help me.

47
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,760
Sun and moon assist me in shaping.

48
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,240
The 28th Palace merged with me.

49
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,120
Numerous evils surround it.

50
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,080
And be clear from the water.

51
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,360
Obey at once.

52
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,040
Who are you?

53
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,040
Scram!

54
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,880
This monster has indeed bewitched people.

55
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,920
The world is getting into chaos.

56
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,680
What's wrong?

57
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,320
Thank you for saving me.

58
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,960
Humans and monsters are so different,

59
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,720
let's not meet

60
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,720
In the future.

61
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,160
So what if you are a demon?

62
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,000
People are filled with demons and spirits.

63
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,200
I investigated you before.

64
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,520
I knew long ago that you're a spirit.

65
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,040
But I don't care if you are a spirit.

66
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,040
That's because

67
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,040
I just want to protect you.

68
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,240
Who would use the folding fan?

69
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,560
I smile and ask who owns the folding fan.

70
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,040
After several years of reunion,

71
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,280
♪ I ask if this hatred is strong ♪

72
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,680

73

melt with this love

78
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:54,440
If wind into the sky,

79
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,960
looking for the deep night light

80
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,120
a dazed and confused sleep. I can't feel the chill.

81
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,920
Why would I fear the pain? I'm not afraid of this calm.

82
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,400
I told Zicheng that I would live and die to make a fortune

83
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,440
but those are ancient legends.

84
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,040
♪ Hold your hand and grow old with you ♪

85
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,200
