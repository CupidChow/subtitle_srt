1
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,400
White Zaizai.

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,520
I don't want your master to be destroyed.

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,880
Within half a month,

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,760
give me the Tiger Tally

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,480
and the head of Liu Chang Ge.

6
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,480
Your Highness.

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,120
The queen is back.

8
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,120
I am tired.

9
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,040
Your Highness.

10
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,960
The queen is back.

11
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,880
She hasn't gone out for three days.

12
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,600
Would you like to talk to her?

13
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,480
Let her be alone again?

14
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,680
Yes

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,800
It's here.

16
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,480
Come in.

17
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,800
You don't need the antidote.

18
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,520
It's a deal

19
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,480
It's here.

20
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,960
Are you going to kill me?

21
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,080
You fool.

22
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,920
You don't want your sword anymore.

23
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,480
Your Highness.

24
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,960
It has been three days.

25
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,960
At least have a bite.

26
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,280
His Highness is really stuck in love.

27
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,560
Steward Wang, wait a second.

28
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,680
I have something to tell you.

29
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,560
Well

30
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,280
guard Bai.

31
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,440
Guard Bai.

32
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,600
The prince risked his life

33
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,040
and risked his life.

34
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,640
What did you say

35
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,000
he took the Tiger Tally

36
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,560
and went to Third Prince's Mansion.

37
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,000
When did he go there?

38
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,560
Two hours ago,

39
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,800
he said

40
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,480
he went to get back your most important thing.

41
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,360
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

42
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,640
You forced me to swear a serious oath.

43
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,400
Say it after two hours.

44
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,560
He said he couldn't return for two hours,

45
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,760
he would leave with Guard Bai.

46
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,840
And never return to the capital.

47
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,560
The prince has never loved someone so before.

48
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,560
Shen Xing loved you at that time.

49
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,800
He just treats her like his sister.

50
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,040
I can see that.

51
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,600
The prince is only truly happy

52
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,080
Is he really happy?

53
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,960
Now, for you,

54
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,040
the Tiger Tally is abandoned.

55
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,680
You don't want the throne?

56
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,400
And now I don't want to die.

57
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,600
Guard Bai, where are you going?

58
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,880
It's my fault.

59
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm going to find him.

60
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,920
Silly girl.

61
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,120
Who would use the folding fan?

62
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,440
I smile and ask who owns the folding fan.

63
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,920

64
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,160

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,560

melt with this love

71
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:26,320
If wind into the sky,

72
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,840
looking for the deep night light

73
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,000
a dazed and confused sleep. I can't feel the chill.

74
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,800
Why would I fear the pain? I'm not afraid of this calm.

75
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,280
I told Zicheng that I would live and die to make a fortune

76
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,320
but those are ancient legends.

77
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,920
