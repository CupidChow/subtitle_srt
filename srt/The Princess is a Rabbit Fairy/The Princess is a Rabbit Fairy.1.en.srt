1
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,400
Miss Dove, Bai Yu!

2
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,000
Senior Sister.

3
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,080
Why are you here again?

4
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,280
White Feather!

5
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,240
You traitor!

6
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,000
This time!

7
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,680
No need to chase them.

8
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,240
You won't be able to catch up.

9
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,800
Wow!

10
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,480
He has such a nice figure.

11
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,760
Enough!

12
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,240
Who? Who is looking at you?

13
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,400
Hold on.

14
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,840
Be my guard, please.

15
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,480
This is the second time you saved me.

16
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,960
Last time was in the forest.

17
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,480
You're perfect to be my guard.

18
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,120
I've checked your background.

19
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,120
He's very clean now.

20
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,600
I'm here to hunt Bai Yuyu.

21
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,320
It's easy to save you.

22
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,320
In addition,

23
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,760
you haven't done me any good.

24
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,320
Why should I be your guard?

25
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,240
I can help you find Bai Yuyu.

26
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,680
He has a good reputation.

27
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,680
And I'm too poor recently.

28
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,240
Alright. Deal is done.

29
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,960
But you have to promise me one condition.

30
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,960
What is it?

31
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,840
Miss Dove, Bai Yu,

32
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,480
this is bad!

33
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,880
The Second Prince is in danger.

34
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,200
There is an assassin!

35
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,600
Protect the prince.

36
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,240
I'm screwed.

37
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,760
We won't be clear if they see this.

38
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,480
Second Prince,

39
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,480
your Highness.

40
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,880
Your Highness.

41
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,880
Steward Wang is so flustered.

42
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,960
It must disturb my mood.

43
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,400
And disturb the prince.

44
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,760
Please forgive me.

45
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,680
Because the assassin was found in your mansion,

46
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,040
I am worried about your safety.

47
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,960
Your Highness, it's good that you're fine.

48
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,320
You scared me to death.

49
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,200
Leave now.

50
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,320
Understood.

51
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,600
He didn't prepare water for taking a shower.

52
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,960
Did he find me hiding here long ago?

53
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,120
It's been five years.

54
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,840
You are finally back.

55
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,600
Hey!

56
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,200
Why did you get in here?

57
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,840
If I didn't come in,

58
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,680
steward Wang will know you're here.

59
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,360
Oh, right.

60
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,080
What are your requirements?

61
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,760
Thirty taels of silver per month.

62
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,000
I guarantee food and lodging.

63
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,080
That's good.

64
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,960
Really?

65
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,640
It's a deal

66
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,320
It's a deal

67
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,520
It's my negligence.

68
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,800
The assassination failed again.

69
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,360
It was because

70
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,040
trash!

71
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,920
After repeated failures, she still comes back.

72
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,880
You can't get the antidote next month.

73
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,520
You will be dead.

74
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,920
I know I was wrong.

75
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,520
For now.

76
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,400
Stand up.

77
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,080
Thank you, Third Prince.

78
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,800
He was the eldest son,

79
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,480
but his mother is sinful,

80
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,120
pose no threat to me.

81
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,680
Second brother has the biggest hope.

82
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,480
With the support of Great General Gong Sunzan,

83
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,800
It was unexpected that

84
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,120
my father actually gave him the Imperial Tiger Tally.

85
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,640
Grand Preceptor,

86
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,520
should I prepare a gift to congratulate my second brother on his coronation?

87
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,160
Oh,

88
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,360
your Highness, don't worry.

89
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,640
His Majesty hasn't made anyone the Crown Prince yet.

90
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,960
We still have time.

91
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,120
Grand Preceptor.

92
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,680
What if you personally go to kill my second brother?

93
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,600
After I ascend the throne,

94
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,520
you'll be the Prime Minister.

95
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,960
Grand Preceptor.

96
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,200
I'm tired today.

97
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,600
So much for this game.

98
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,120
Your Highness,

99
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,200
I want to see

100
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,880
how much you've improved in the past five years.

101
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,960
Who would use the folding fan?

102
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,280
I smile and ask who owns the folding fan.

103
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,760

104
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,000

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,400

melt with this love

111
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:30,160
If wind into the sky,

112
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,680
looking for the deep night light

113
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,840
a dazed and confused sleep. I can't feel the chill.

114
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,640
Why would I fear the pain? I'm not afraid of this calm.

115
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,120
I told Zicheng that I would live and die to make a fortune

116
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,160
