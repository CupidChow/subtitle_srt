1
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,040
If I were not a demon.

2
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:33,920
What a waste.

3
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,240
You don't go to protect the prince,

4
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,160
sitting here, what are you doing?

5
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,240
Your prince doesn't need my protection.

6
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,120
What?

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,920
How dare you sabotage your work?

8
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,560
You will lose your pay.

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:52,640
Alright.

10
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,560
I'll go right now.

11
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,040
There you go.

12
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,400
Come on.

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,040
Come on.

14
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,560
Is something bothering you?

15
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,920
I want to ask

16
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,280
you're better than me.

17
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,400
Why do you ask me to be your guard?

18
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,760
What do you want?

19
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,440
To deal with the nobody,

20
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,640
does the Second Prince really want to kill them?

21
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,360
Then do you think

22
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,400
help me find Bai Yuyu.

23
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,280
Why is there no other news?

24
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,000
I also know where Bai Yu Yu is.

25
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,960
But you didn't find her.

26
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,200
Where is she?

27
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,440
At my third brother's place.

28
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,720
If she leaves him,

29
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,040
my spy will notice

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,040
and I will tell you

31
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,400
to avenge your death.

32
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,560
Alright.

33
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,480
It's fine.

34
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,480
It's here.

35
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,800
If you don't like to stand outside the door,

36
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,400
you can sit here in the future.

37
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,520
You should have told me earlier.

38
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,760
I'm already tired.

39
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,960
What do you need me for?

40
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,480
Would you like to fan me?

41
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,280
Alright.

42
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:27,960
Hold on.

43
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,680
Stop that.

44
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,000
It makes it impossible for me to get married if you play it dumb.

45
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,000
Don't come near me.

46
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,240
Stop!

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,920
Stop!

48
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,280
Where are you going?

49
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:40,960
How dare you hit me?

50
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
Did you do it on purpose?

51
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,160
Yes, I am.

52
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,000
Right?

53
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,960
Sorry, not like that.

54
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,880
Your Highness has not been so happy for a long time.

55
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,920
Beat me.

56
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,000
You should hit me.

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,480
Run.

58
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,360
Your Highness.

59
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,920
General Gongsun has arrived.

60
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,960
Please.

61
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,920
Your Highness.

62
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,160
I'm here today for two things.

63
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,520
Please go ahead, General.

64
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,520
I heard from Qing'er

65
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,640
that she had a quarrel with Guard Bai.

66
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,720
I apologize to the prince for her.

67
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,240
This matter should pass.

68
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,040
Qing'er is my only sister.

69
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,720
She falls in love with you,

70
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,000
I wonder what you think.

71
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,760
General.

72
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,960
This kind of thing requires two people to love each other.

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,240
I have other plans.

74
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,200
I just feel sorry for my sister.

75
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,280
You can't marry an excellent person like him.

76
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,200
But also between you and me.

77
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,760
It's a pity.

78
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,040
General.

79
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,280
Miss Gongsun was stunning

80
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,040
well, it's possible that

81
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,200
like this.

82
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,640
Two months later,

83
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,200
I'll marry Miss Gongsun in two months.

84
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,960
It's a deal

85
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,280
take care.

86
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,480
Bewitching energy?

87
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,360
Your Highness.

88
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,720
What do you think of the carriage sharing plan?

89
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,400
It's brilliant.

90
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,440
In this way,

91
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,920
the human and financial resources of Zhao Dynasty can be fully utilized.

92
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,480
I'm going to stay here

93
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,560
I'll stay in the Sovereign Prince Yu's Mansion

94
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,880
so that we can discuss the carriage sharing plan.

95
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,280
Your Highness

96
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,200
miss Gongsun.

97
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,960
Although we're engaged,

98
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,680
we are not married yet.

99
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,440
So it's better not to interact so frequently.

100
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,480
To avoid other people's criticism.

101
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,360
Your Highness,

102
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,920
we love each other.

103
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,400
Who is qualified to gossip?

104
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,160
Miss Gongsun,

105
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,480
I'd like to make you some tea.

106
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,840
Who would use the folding fan?

107
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,160
I smile and ask who owns the folding fan.

108
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,640
After several years of reunion,

109
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,880

110
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,280

melt with this love

116
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:24,040
If wind into the sky,

117
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,560
looking for the deep night light

118
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,720
a dazed and confused sleep. I can't feel the chill.

119
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,520
Why would I fear the pain? I'm not afraid of this calm.

120
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,000
I told Zicheng that I would live and die to make a fortune

121
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,040
but those are ancient legends.

122
