1
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,400
You must have wondered about it.

2
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,760
From today,

3
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,920
I'll tell you everything.

4
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,480
Her name is Shen Xing.

5
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,000
She came to my mansion five years ago.

6
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,200
I didn't know her identity at that time.

7
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,360
And treated her as my bosom friend.

8
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,960
We had a good chat.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,080
Then,

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,800
I accidentally learned that she's the daughter

11
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,520
the daughter of State Preceptor Shen Yi.

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,760
Not long after that,

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,760
the Tiger Tally was stolen.

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,000
She left the mansion.

15
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,600
She is nowhere to be found.

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,000
Your Highness.

17
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,640
What about

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,640
you found the Tiger Tally.

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,600
Where's Xing Yue?

20
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,360
They found her in the eastern suburb.

21
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,480
She was already unconscious at the time.

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,520
The Tiger Tally

23
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,360
was found on her body.

24
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,320
Your Highness.

25
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,440
Your Highness.

26
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,440
Chang Ge.

27
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,200
Chang Ge.

28
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,160
Shen Xing,

29
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,840
ever since you entered the mansion,

30
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,480
I've always treated you as my own sister.

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,080
Even if you conceal your true identity,

32
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,920
your real identity.

33
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,040
But you still disappointed me in the end.

34
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,000
Father forced me

35
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,440
you also took precautions

36
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,040
I'm pathetic or pathetic.

37
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,480
For the sake of our acquaintance,

38
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,280
for the sake of our friendship.

39
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,360
After you recover,

40
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,320
go back to your father.

41
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,040
Chang Ge.

42
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,080
This is goodbye.

43
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,440
Chang Ge.

44
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,560
Chang Ge.

45
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,960
Chang Ge.

46
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:45,840
Don't come any closer.

47
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,760
What are you doing?

48
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,040
If I tell you that

49
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,600
my father stole the Tiger Tally.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,400
Uncle persuaded me to give it up.

51
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,160
It's me who took back the Tiger Tally.

52
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,960
Will you believe it?

53
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,120
Put down the sword.

54
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,960
Chang Ge.

55
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,480
I can't go back.

56
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,760
Sorry.

57
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,960
Please.

58
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,600
Shen Xing is a kind person.

59
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,680
But got into the chaos of fighting for the crown prince for no reason.

60
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,120
In the end, we got into trouble

61
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,280
shen Yi and I were forced to die.

62
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,480
Since then,

63
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,000
I could barely feel the guilt.

64
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,280
Then you came.

65
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,520
To be

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,400
someone must have told you

67
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,680
I like you

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,840
because you're similar to Shen Xing,

69
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,080
you're her substitute, right?

70
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,080
She was the one

71
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,480
I blamed myself for many years.

72
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,440
So I kept her painting

73
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,320
as a memento.

74
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,120
Certainly.

75
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,200
If you mind.

76
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,840
What are you doing?

77
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,440
If it will affect our relationship,

78
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,760
I shouldn't keep it.

79
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,560
Don't be like this.

80
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,160
I don't mind.

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,800
By the way,

82
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,840
the stolen Tiger Tally is fake.

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,800
The theft of the Tiger Tally is serious.

84
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,000
It's a capital crime.

85
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,440
But I wasn't that careless.

86
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,160
To get the Tiger Tally.

87
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,200
So is the one

88
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,040
Is it real?

89
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,480
Fool.

90
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,520
For your sake,

91
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,480
I won't risk the fake Tiger Tally.

92
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,600
What should we do then?

93
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,520
Will His Majesty punish you?

94
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,880
Now I can only turn to Father

95
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,120
and ask for forgiveness.

96
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,000
Those who have achieved greatness must avoid being impetuous.

97
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,520
Ge'er.

98
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,960
It seems that your temperament still needs to be trained.

99
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,560
And for a woman,

100
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,280
for the sake of a woman.

101
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,400
Please forgive me, Father.

102
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,600
When I rose to the throne after mutiny,

103
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,320
among your three brothers,

104
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,680
you've contributed the most

105
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,000
and contributed the most.

106
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,320
I place great hopes on you.

107
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,600
Is it

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
worth it?

109
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,400
I'm incompetent.

110
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,760
Please punish me.

111
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,280
Whatever.

112
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,360
That's because

113
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,080
I let your mother down.

114
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,960
I'll think of a way.

115
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,120
Thank you, father.

116
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,200
Who would use the folding fan?

117
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,520
I smile and ask who owns the folding fan.

118
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,000

melt with this love

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,920
looking for the deep night light

128
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,080
a dazed and confused sleep. I can't feel the chill.

129
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,880
Why would I fear the pain? I'm not afraid of this calm.

130
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,360
I told Zicheng that I would live and die to make a fortune

131
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,400
