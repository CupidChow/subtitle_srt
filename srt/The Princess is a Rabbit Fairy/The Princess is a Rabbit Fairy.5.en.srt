1
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,640
Chang Ge.

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,600
Chang Ge.

3
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,000
She is

4
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,720
chang Ge.

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,080
You know each other?

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:28,920
It's here.

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,120
This is Xiaoyi.

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:30,760
She is my sister-in-law.

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,200
This is Bai Zaizai.

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,400
My personal bodyguard?

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,040
Why did you ask me to come?

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,720
I need to talk to you in private.

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,560
She's not an outsider.

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,680
Go ahead and tell her.

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,160
Lessons drawn from others' mistakes

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,040
I hope you won't repeat the same mistake.

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,040
Are you tired of

18
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,320
you worry too much.

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,200
I know who is who.

20
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,720
Thank you

21
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,040
If Eldest Brother is nearby,

22
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,320
I can't stay for long.

23
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,280
Alright.

24
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,640
I'll make the long story short.

25
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,320
You have to be careful of Liu Changhe.

26
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,440
In order to ascend the throne and save my mother,

27
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,440
In order to ascend the throne and save my mother.

28
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,040
She may kill you.

29
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,520
I will be careful.

30
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,040
Please leave now.

31
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,880
In case Lixing would suspect.

32
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:18,920
Alright.

33
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,720
It's here.

34
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,840
We should leave too.

35
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,160
Who is it?

36
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,640
Just leave now!

37
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,520
If you're so awesome,

38
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,840
why do you need an escort?

39
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,200
Cut the crap!

40
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,240
After eating so many carrots,

41
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,840
I couldn't bear for you to die like this.

42
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,200
Grand Preceptor.

43
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,600
We can't beat him.

44
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,240
Then don't force yourself.

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,720
Do you want me to chase her for you?

46
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,080
I don't need a pigeon fancier to teach me how to do things.

47
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,840
Don't think I won't kill you

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,320
even by lying to Liu Changjie.

49
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,120
Don't forget that

50
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,360
I have your destiny in my hands.

51
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,560
Who would use the folding fan?

52
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,880
I smile and ask who owns the folding fan.

53
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,360

melt with this love

61
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,760
If wind into the sky,

62
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,280
looking for the deep night light

63
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,440
a dazed and confused sleep. I can't feel the chill.

64
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,240
Why would I fear the pain? I'm not afraid of this calm.

65
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,720
I told Zicheng that I would live and die to make a fortune

66
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,760
but those are ancient legends.
