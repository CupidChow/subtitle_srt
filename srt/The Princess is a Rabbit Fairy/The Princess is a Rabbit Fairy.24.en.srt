1
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,080
Obey god's will

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,280
and the emperor's command:

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,440
The Demon Hunters are destroying lives.

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,440
His party was put on death row.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,560
And the eldest prince, Changhe, rebelled.

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,400
Now he is dead.

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,560
Let bygones be bygones

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,120
your Highness,

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,760
you can't tell right from wrong.

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,760
And lost his popularity.

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,680
To abolish the Duke from now on

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,960
that's all.

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,120
I hope you'll remember that lesson today.

14
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,440
It's the talent I gave you that

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,760
you can't steal it.

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,040
If the next time,

17
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,600
will be killed without amnesty.

18
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,400
Yes

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,720
I accept the imperial edict.

20
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,880
Brother.

21
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,760
I've told you that

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,800
I came from another world.

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,200
I know that.

24
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,400
You said that

25
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,160
It seems that

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,160
not all time travel

27
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,600
can be the protagonist.

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,280
I'm not capable.

29
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,120
Maybe I can only be an extra.

30
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,760
Need some soy sauce.

31
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,760
Qing'er, I thought you have me.

32
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,560
Brother.

33
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,280
As long as you're here,

34
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,560
that's why I don't feel like the most miserable person.

35
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,440
Qing'er,

36
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,960
don't think too much.

37
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,760
Now the northern barbarians are ready to attack.

38
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,360
It's time for us to accomplish great things.

39
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,800
Alright.

40
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,320
We will get ready

41
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,920
set out to the border.

42
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,320
Come on.

43
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,440
Come on.

44
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,440
Please.

45
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,320
Greetings, Father.

46
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,120
Ge'er.

47
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,640
Don't be so formal.

48
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,360
The antidote to Shen Yi.

49
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,920
The Imperial Hospital has studied it for days.

50
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,280
To find out the ingredients.

51
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,760
Will be produced in batches in a few days.

52
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,640
Wang Xia and his officials

53
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,080
and other officials.

54
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,760
I didn't expect Shen Yi

55
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,560
would do such vicious things.

56
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,240
Luckily, I've been on guard.

57
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,480
Jie'er brought back the fake Tiger Tally last time.

58
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,880
You said we went along with his trick.

59
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,400
Just let them use the real Tiger Tally to rebel.

60
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,600
To find out the spy in the imperial guards.

61
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,760
Now it seems

62
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,800
you were right.

63
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,760
I'd like to thank you for pretending to be ill.

64
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,200
To force Shen Yi and the others to rebel.

65
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,280
Ge'er!

66
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,680
Your clever tricks

67
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,040
so that Shen Yi walked into your trap.

68
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,200
Your achievement is no less than

69
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,160
Is no less than when you helped me ascend the throne a few years ago.

70
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,480
I dare not take any great achievements for myself.

71
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,360
I only hope that you will

72
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,360
promise me two things.

73
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,040
What you promised me.

74
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,880
First, Wang Xia is free

75
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,320
he was greedy,

76
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,240
he's loyal to the Liu family.

77
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,480
Father, please take back the late emperor's order

78
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,760
summon him back to the Imperial Palace.

79
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,200
As the Palace Steward.

80
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
Got it.

81
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,320
The second is

82
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,640
I hope you can let me and Bai Zaizai

83
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,560
to live in seclusion in the mountains.

84
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,360
Ge'er,

85
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,360
the investigation shows

86
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,840
bai Zaizai is indeed a demon.

87
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,200
You'll be the emperor in the future.

88
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,760
When two human beings and monsters fall in love,

89
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,720
how will the people

90
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,920
think of you?

91
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,560
Father,

92
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,480
the moment I handed over the Tiger Tally,

93
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,120
I knew I'm not fit to be an emperor.

94
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,040
I can't take on such an important position.

95
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,720
Enough.

96
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,840
You can leave now.

97
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,880
Your Majesty.

98
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,360
That's a yes?

99
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,280
I don't want to

100
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,760
I don't want to be bothered by you.

101
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,560
Exactly.

102
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,760
Thank you, Father Emperor.

103
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,480
Go on.

104
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,680
What is it?

105
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,240
My life is short.

106
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,720
Will have no joy without you.

107
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,240
You are the only person I ever met.

108
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,360
I was born with no joy.

109
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,680
Come on.

110
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,080
Mind your words.

111
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,840
From today on,

112
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,400
you own me?

113
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,360
Your Highness,

114
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,680
do you want to?

115
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,880
I have a request.

116
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,960
You can only eat carrots with me.

117
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,200
Will you

118
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,440
It's a deal

119
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,680
stop!

120
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,760
Stop!

121
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,920
Let's see where you run to.

122
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,440
Got you, right?

123
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,320
Liu Chang Ge.

124
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,840
Put me down.

125
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,040
Put me down.

126
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,320
Who would use the folding fan?

127
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,640
I smile and ask who owns the folding fan.

128
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,120
After several years of reunion,

129
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,360

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,760

melt with this love

136
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,520
If wind into the sky,

137
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,040
looking for the deep night light

138
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,200
a dazed and confused sleep. I can't feel the chill.

139
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,000
Why would I fear the pain? I'm not afraid of this calm.

140
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,480
I told Zicheng that I would live and die to make a fortune

141
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,520

Your Majesty.

150
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,440
What caused you to panic?

151
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,080
Your Majesty.

152
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,960
Something's wrong.

153
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,360
The northern barbarians have invaded our borders.

154
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,960
Our army has captured 11 cities of Zhao.

155
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,640
Our army suffered heavy casualties.

156
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,760
Zhao has been at war with the barbarians for a long time.

157
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,960
It won't be a big deal as long as we don't attack Yongcheng.

158
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,880
Your Majesty.

159
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,040
Yongcheng reported that

160
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,000
after Queen Jing heard that the eldest prince had died,

161
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,840
her sanity was approaching insanity.

162
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,760
And escaped from the prison.

163
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,240
Three thousand iron armors couldn't stop her.

164
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,600
What?

165
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,440
Hurry.

166
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,080
Summon Sixth Prince immediately.

167
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,160
Yes, Your Highness.
