1
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,440
Bunny,

2
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,960
come back with me.

3
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,720
Back to the mansion.

4
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,720
What on earth do you want?

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,720
You'll find out very soon.

6
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,280
Keep this in mind.

7
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,200
She'll be your wife in the future.

8
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,720
I understand.

9
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,600
Your Highness.

10
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,720
Guard Bai,

11
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,200
all of you...

12
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,040
Welcome, the prince.

13
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,760
Welcome back to your house.

14
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,040
Hey!

15
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,760
Have you heard?

16
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,720
The current Second Prince, the Carefree King,

17
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,360
has an affair with his personal bodyguard.

18
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,480
Oh, I heard that

19
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,440
he wants to take that woman as his wife.

20
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,920
I also heard that

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,720
a nurse who's pregnant for six months

22
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,240
and she has a twin pregnancy.

23
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,600
I've also heard that

24
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,400
I heard Doctor Zhang from the north of the city said

25
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,600
who checked her pulse.

26
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,160
Among twins, the man is like mother,

27
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,600
and the woman looks like father.

28
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,200
What are you doing?

29
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,400
This is so novel.

30
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,000
Who is it?

31
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:40,960
What?

32
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,800
I heard that it is becoming a scandal.

33
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,720
Guard Bai is alive and well.

34
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,320
I'm not that prettier than Guard White.

35
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,840
We can also become phoenix.

36
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,600
Your Highness,

37
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,040
you're going to be the queen

38
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,600
since your mind has been made up,

39
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,240
as servants, we can't talk about it.

40
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,880
But what happened five years ago

41
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,800
I'd like to ask your highness not to forget

42
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,720
that happened five years ago.

43
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,960
It's not what you think.

44
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,000
Your Highness.

45
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,880
If Shen Xing hadn't bewitched you,

46
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,480
you wouldn't have

47
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,280
alright.

48
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,280
You all think that's why I fell for Shen Xing back then.

49
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,080
Little did you know that was just a rumor.

50
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,960
From the very beginning,

51
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,560
I've never had any feelings for her.

52
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,600
As for Bai Zaizai,

53
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,560
she is not what you think.

54
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,200
She is very innocent.

55
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,280
She and Shen Xing share the same face.

56
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,480
It's purely coincidental.

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,440
I really hope you can

58
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,800
you can put down your prejudices

59
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,280
and understand her attentively.

60
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,560
Since the prince said so,

61
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,880
I want to

62
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,080
so I tried to know her better.

63
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,000
I'll leave now.

64
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,160
Ah

65
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,280
sorry. Sorry.

66
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,040
I didn't mean to do it.

67
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,560
I didn't know there was someone at the door.

68
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,640
Sorry.

69
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,000
It's nothing.

70
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,520
Be careful next time.

71
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,600
This is strange.

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,040
Why is Manager Wang suddenly so good-tempered today?

73
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,800
What do you want?

74
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,800
The outside is full.

75
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,000
In broad daylight,

76
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,480
I hugged my queen.

77
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,880
Do you want to avoid people?

78
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,840
Let me tell you something.

79
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,280
That Gong Sun Qing isn't the real one.

80
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,000
She was morphed into a demon.

81
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,320
You must be careful.

82
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,360
Demons.

83
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,320
Well

84
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,760
you should be careful of Liu Changhe.

85
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,800
In order to ascend the throne and save my mother,

86
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,760
In order to ascend the throne and save my mother.

87
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,240
She might harm you.

88
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,480
That day I explored her bewitching energy.

89
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,200
She might be a fox demon.

90
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,240
Then General Gongsun will be in danger?

91
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,040
It seems that we can't keep the fox spirit.

92
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,720
Why not

93
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,560
let's go to Li Youdao of the Demon Hunters?

94
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,280
Ah

95
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,040
don't hit me.

96
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,280
You fool.

97
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,880
How could you think of that?

98
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,880
What?

99
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,000
Bai Zaizai, who made a fuss with his second brother,

100
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,240
he is a demon.

101
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,960
As sure as a gun

102
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,520
she's my senior.

103
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,040
Great.

104
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,320
Great.

105
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,360
If father knows his most precious son

106
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,800
and do such an unnatural act.

107
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,480
That scene will be wonderful.

108
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,800
That

109
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,200
when you get the throne,

110
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,760
we can be together openly.

111
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,000
Right?

112
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,560
No one has gone back on his word.

113
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,320
Don't you trust me?

114
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,560
If I don't trust you,

115
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,320
I don't believe you.

116
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,760
Go inform Grand Preceptor

117
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,800
to spread the news that Bai Zaizai is a monster

118
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,880
make it known by everyone.

119
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,240
Alright.

120
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,480
Love between human beings and monsters is a secret.

121
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,280
I will ruin Liu Chang Ge's reputation.

122
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,600
Then

123
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,840
we're also human beings in love.

124
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,280
Can we see light?

125
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,600
We're not the same.

126
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,760
No one dares to call you a demon.

127
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,240
Whoever I slay,

128
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,400
who would do the folding fan?

129
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,720
I smile and ask who owns the folding fan.

130
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,200

00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,440

melt with this love

138
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:37,600
If wind into the sky,

139
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,120
looking for the deep night light

140
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,280
a dazed and confused sleep. I can't feel the chill.

141
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,080
Why would I fear the pain? I'm not afraid of this calm.

142
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,560
I told Zicheng that I would live and die to make a fortune

143
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,600
