1
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,600
I heard that a girl like you

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,080
disappeared

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,400
without a reason.

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,720
Even her corpse hasn't been found yet.

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,440
This is pitiful.

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,400
Guard Bai.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,080
You have to be more careful.

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,640
This evil eunuch

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,200
dare to threaten me?

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,000
Thank you for your concern.

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,600
The person who reminded me of that is still in bed.

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,080
May I know

13
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,160
how are you doing these days?

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,080
You

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,520
one day you will know

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,360
you shouldn't come to the mansion.

17
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,840
Give me that!

18
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,640
What a cheapskate!

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,520
Who gave me the right to eat pig's head?

20
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,960
Ask him to see me.

21
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,440
Guard Bai.

22
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,400
Rule in the mansion.

23
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,960
No waste.

24
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,640
Otherwise,

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,960
family law.

26
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,640
Of course,

27
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,320
and you can choose

28
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,960
no food.

29
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,080
I'm not eating.

30
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,200
I want to lose weight.

31
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,000
I can't treat you anymore.

32
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,400
Let's see how many days you can last.

33
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,960
I'm starving.

34
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,840
I can't.

35
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,160
I want dry rice.

36
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,320
Carrot?

37
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,520
I'm here.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,320
If someone is stealing,

39
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,080
arrest this person.

40
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,960
Yes

41
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,640
don't you have guts?

42
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,640
Wait a second.

43
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,320
Your Highness.

44
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,320
Bai Zaizai is having an inappropriate behavior.

45
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,720
But will

46
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,400
Is my word no longer useful?

47
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,880
Go back to your room and sleep after eating.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,080
Stop embarrassing yourself.

49
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,400
I shouldn't be embarrassed eating carrots.

50
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,400
There are so many

51
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,080
In the world.

52
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,200
Why do you like to eat carrots?

53
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,880
It was a severe drought that year.

54
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,720
No kernels or seeds are gathered , as in a year of scarcity

55
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,520
In order to support me,

56
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,000
he replaced everything

57
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,760
for carrots.

58
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,400
Since then,

59
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,080
I've always loved to eat carrots.

60
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,880
No matter how full the meal is,

61
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,320
I can still eat.

62
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,520
Is it that good?

63
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,760
Well

64
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,440
try it.

65
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,840
It's sweet, right?

66
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,400
Since you like turnips so much,

67
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,640
I'll arrange a royal chef

68
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,160
to choose the best carrots for you

69
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,000
for you to enjoy.

70
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,960
Really?

71
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,400
It's a deal

72
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,520
It's a deal

73
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,640
a small fry.

74
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,520
Why do you knock me?

75
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,080
Knock if you become silly or no one will want you.

76
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,960
Didn't you hear what I said?

77
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,960
Steward Wang.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,400
It's all arranged by the superior.

79
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,640
I have no choice.

80
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,440
Chief Wang.

81
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,520
The prince will come here to eat later.

82
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,600
What?

83
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,080
What?

84
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,520
Can't I come over?

85
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,080
Your Highness.

86
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
Alright, Steward Wang.

87
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,520
Please leave.

88
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,400
Yes

89
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,760
I don't believe I can't cure you.

90
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,400
Watch out.

91
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,080
Steward Wang.

92
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,840
Miss Gongsun asked to see you.

93
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,480
I know.

94
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,960
What about

95
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,720
the cooking skills are good, right?

96
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,240
Delicious.

97
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,640
You're a foodie.

98
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,120
I'm not a foodie.

99
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,480
The peach leaves are so sharp.

100
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,240
♫ Willow ♫

101
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,880
Come on.

102
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,320
Steward Wang.

103
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
Your Ladyship,

104
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,880
this dessert is specially made in the mansion.

105
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,760
Please enjoy them.

106
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Steward Wang,

107
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,760
that's very kind of you.

108
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,360
Hey!

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,080
What a pity!

110
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,120
I'm afraid I won't be able to entertain her in the future.

111
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,120
I hope you can understand me.

112
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,240
Oh,

113
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,840
lady Yuzhan, don't get the wrong idea.

114
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,880
Because there might be a wedding in the mansion.

115
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,360
So it will be busy.

116
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,720
It's a happy occasion.

117
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,600
Well

118
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,600
what good news?

119
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,600
My lady, haven't you heard that

120
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,880
there is a girl from our mansion.

121
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,600
Her name is Bai Zaizai.

122
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,240
The prince falls in love with her,

123
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,760
It seems that a good thing is coming.

124
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,400
What?

125
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,120
What gives her the right?

126
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,640
We servants can't

127
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,200
It's hard for us to say such things.

128
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,480
His Majesty once said

129
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,360
the choice of the queen must be for talents.

130
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,640
As for what ability Bai Zaizai has,

131
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,720
I don't know.

132
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,000
I only know that she is a glutton for fun.

133
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,240
In one day,

134
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,880
on radishes.

135
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,080
Is it so curly?

136
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,240
You want to lose weight like that?

137
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,840
Manager Wang.

138
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,600
Hey!

139
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:54,960
Come on!

140
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,120
Young lady,

141
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,240
you are the prince's most trusted person.

142
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,480
Then please

143
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,000
give this document

144
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,880
to the prince.

145
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,120
The document.

146
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,040
Who would use the folding fan?

147
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,360
I smile and ask who owns the folding fan.

148
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,840

looking for the deep night light

158
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,920
a dazed and confused sleep. I can't feel the chill.

159
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,720
Why would I fear the pain? I'm not afraid of this calm.

160
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,200
I told Zicheng that I would live and die to make a fortune

161
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,240
