1
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,760
Do you want to rebel?

2
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,600
Your brothers

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,560
to me.

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,960
Have you forgotten

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,360
and uncles in the Temple?

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,360
What's wrong with father?

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,040
Seventh Brother.

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,080
Kneel down.

9
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:32,760
Recalling the past,

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,560
kneel down.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,960
I am achieving great success every day.

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,440
That older brother of mine

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,000
wanted to unite my three brothers

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,720
to frame me.

15
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,920
To protect myself,

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,520
I have no choice but to launch a mutiny.

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,480
I personally killed my eldest brother

18
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,560
I personally killed my brother.

19
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,360
That's how I gained my empire.

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,760
But I often ask myself

21
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,480
for the throne,

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,280
for the throne.

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,160
Is it worth it?

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,760
No good?

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,200
I have no interest in the throne.

26
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,440
I only want you to release my mother.

27
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,160
That's impossible.

28
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,520
And my third brother.

29
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,280
Poisoned me.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,440
I remember that

31
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,120
when I cut him into pieces,

32
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,000
I felt like a knife cut into my heart.

33
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,480
All brothers must remember

34
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,040
never kill each other.

35
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,600
If not,

36
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,640
just like me,

37
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,200
and live with guilt.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,200
Yes

39
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,960
your Highness.

40
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,920
You are too sensitive.

41
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,520
The winner can't stand such a small occasion?

42
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,560
Small scenes?

43
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,080
Grand Preceptor, don't you know Father's thunder technique?

44
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,600
During the mutiny back then,

45
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,640
he killed six of his brothers.

46
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,560
What?

47
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,960
You're scared?

48
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,480
The opportunity is right in front of you.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,760
Are you going to hold back?

50
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,480
Stop the sarcasm.

51
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,360
In short,

52
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,640
we can't keep the Tiger Tally.

53
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,760
Can't be retained.

54
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,920
Really?

55
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,760
Do you think Liu Chang Ge will let you go?

56
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,600
Don't bother with it.

57
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,040
I've made up my mind.

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,440
I'm done with this.

59
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,280
Wait a second.

60
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,840
In that case,

61
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,600
I won't go easy on you.

62
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,440
What are you doing?

63
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,840
Hand in the fake Tiger Tally.

64
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,120
To observe Liu Chang Ge's movements secretly.

65
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,800
Yes

66
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,680
you think I assisted you

67
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,480
or just for glory?

68
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,680
Five years ago,

69
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,680
liu Chang Ge forced Xing'er to die,

70
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,640
I swore back then

71
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,720
that I would make the Liu family pay with blood.

72
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,760
The Liu family

73
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,240
kill them all!

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,200
Lu Sha,

75
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,000
you've been dead for more than ten years.

76
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,680
As the emperor,

77
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,480
I can't help you eliminate the Demon Hunters.

78
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,920
I feel sorry for that.

79
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,160
It's time to return

80
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,160
to return it to Ge'er.

81
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,680
I'll leave now.

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,840
Mother left this for me.

83
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,440
It's a talisman which is absorbed by the powers of past demons.

84
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
It can restrain the Demon Suppression Formation of the Spirit Catching League.

85
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,560
Therefore,

86
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,680
mom is feared by the Demon Hunters,

87
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,040
and she died because of this.

88
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,800
Mother,

89
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,360
ge'er.

90
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,320
I will now pass the Millennium Spirit Pearl to you.

91
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,800
To find your father.

92
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,840
And survive.

93
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,120
Mother.

94
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,800
Mother.

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,120
Who would use the folding fan?

96
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,440
I smile and ask who owns the folding fan.

97
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,920
After several years of reunion,

98
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,160

99
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,560

melt with this love

105
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:36,320
If wind into the sky,

106
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,840
looking for the deep night light

107
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,000
a dazed and confused sleep. I can't feel the chill.

108
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,800
Why would I fear the pain? I'm not afraid of this calm.

109
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,280
I told Zicheng that I would live and die to make a fortune

110
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,320
