1
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:56,717
Are you ready?

2
00:01:59,326 --> 00:02:01,019
What are you going to do to me?

3
00:02:01,738 --> 00:02:03,031
Just wait.

4
00:02:14,776 --> 00:02:15,965
Where are we?

5
00:02:18,858 --> 00:02:21,035
You can't get away from me.

6
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:30,534
Surprise!

7
00:02:34,457 --> 00:02:37,597
Martin! Is this place ours?

8
00:02:38,717 --> 00:02:40,928
Well, it's rent to own.

9
00:02:47,976 --> 00:02:49,394
I love it!

10
00:02:50,812 --> 00:02:52,689
I love it, I love it!

11
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:02,199
I love you.

12
00:03:04,326 --> 00:03:05,994
And I love you more.

13
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:09,039
I love you more than your more.

14
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:18,799
Sweetie...

15
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,636
Won't you let me go?

16
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:26,390
Never.

17
00:03:28,016 --> 00:03:30,102
You're gonna be my
love slave forever.

18
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:48,370
Cheers to the new "live-in" couple!

19
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,964
Cheers!

20
00:03:51,915 --> 00:03:53,630
Thank you, thank you guys.

21
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:56,036
Thank you so much for being here.

22
00:03:56,311 --> 00:03:58,505
Especially you, bro.
Thank you, I seriously owe you one.

23
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,949
Oh, come on.
I wouldn't miss this for anything.

24
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:03,802
My big brother,
finally getting a girl to say yes?

25
00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:05,304
This one is for the books, man.

26
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:07,681
That's why I came here
directly from the airport.

27
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,300
I told myself...
This I got to see.

28
00:04:10,496 --> 00:04:13,123
I'm eager to meet the girl
my big brother managed to sway.

29
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,275
Seriously, guys.
This means so much to us

30
00:04:18,275 --> 00:04:20,569
because we chose both of you

31
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,846
as witnesses to these transactions.

32
00:04:22,907 --> 00:04:23,913
And Anj,

33
00:04:23,938 --> 00:04:25,898
because you're my cousin and BFF.

34
00:04:25,923 --> 00:04:27,936
Aw, I'm so touched!

35
00:04:27,961 --> 00:04:31,131
And also Leo, because
you're Martin's favorite brother.

36
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:33,751
He has no choice.
I'm his only brother.

37
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:37,644
So, as witnesses
to this transaction

38
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:39,720
Martin and I have agreed on,

39
00:04:40,424 --> 00:04:46,126
please affix your signatures
to these two pages I've made.

40
00:04:47,179 --> 00:04:48,179
What?

41
00:04:49,564 --> 00:04:52,426
Wow! This is like super official!

42
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:54,870
Why not just make it
a marriage certificate?

43
00:04:54,988 --> 00:04:57,978
Exactly! It's the first time
I've heard of anyone doing this.

44
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,984
It's Mel's idea, trust me.

45
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:01,234
I already proposed.

46
00:05:01,374 --> 00:05:03,270
Got down on one knee and everything.

47
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,005
Really? Did she reject you?

48
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,860
She suddenly put on socks.

49
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,423
Socks?

50
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,064
Bro, she suddenly got cold feet!

51
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:21,963
But this time, Mel,

52
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:25,020
would you live in with me?

53
00:05:27,383 --> 00:05:28,842
Yes, yes!

54
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,428
Thank you for waiting.

55
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,490
I'll settle for this, for now.

56
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,873
As long as I have you with me

57
00:05:40,357 --> 00:05:41,655
in this house...

58
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:43,567
For now.

59
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,787
Aw...

60
00:05:51,944 --> 00:05:53,862
Cheers!

61
00:05:55,403 --> 00:05:57,071
Kiss! Give each other a kiss!

62
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:01,712
- Now, hug! Hug each other!
- Like this?

63
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:05,658
- There you go...
- Embrace each other this way!

64
00:06:05,683 --> 00:06:08,894
Hold it, hold it!
One, two, three, smile!

65
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:10,546
Smile! There.

66
00:06:10,634 --> 00:06:12,681
Your turn, your turn.

67
00:06:13,612 --> 00:06:16,298
One, two, three, smile!

68
00:06:16,827 --> 00:06:17,953
This is fun!

69
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,501
Okay, last one.

70
00:06:19,526 --> 00:06:20,845
No, it's fine!

71
00:06:22,732 --> 00:06:25,444
Game. One, two, three, smile!

72
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,237
I'll join you guys.

73
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:31,025
- Let's all take a photo!
- Alright. One, two, three...

74
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,167
Thank you for everything, sweetie...

75
00:08:49,045 --> 00:08:51,590
You don't know how much
this means to me.

76
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:58,096
You planned everything
down to the last detail.

77
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:10,400
And I didn't expect that
you would give me a ring.

78
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:14,124
A live-in ring?

79
00:09:17,127 --> 00:09:19,139
And that's what I love about you.

80
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,121
You're full of surprises.

81
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,853
Oh, what a nice sofa!

82
00:10:32,878 --> 00:10:34,839
Sir, please place it here
beside the window.

83
00:10:34,864 --> 00:10:36,240
No need, that's fine where it is.

84
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:40,261
Huh? That's not ideal!

85
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,300
It's too tight in that spot!

86
00:10:42,325 --> 00:10:44,327
Babe! It's actually
better by the door.

87
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,792
That way, when guests arrive,
they can just sit right away.

88
00:10:49,087 --> 00:10:50,628
Sweetheart,

89
00:10:51,501 --> 00:10:54,183
who's the interior decorator here?

90
00:10:54,881 --> 00:10:56,729
Me, right?

91
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,663
Alright, alright!

92
00:10:59,688 --> 00:11:01,769
We'll go with what the princess likes.

93
00:11:02,714 --> 00:11:04,086
Thank you, sweetheart.

94
00:11:04,232 --> 00:11:05,232
Of course.

95
00:11:08,685 --> 00:11:10,237
There, it looks fantastic!

96
00:11:10,262 --> 00:11:12,389
Well, your wish is my command!

97
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:13,772
Love you!

98
00:11:16,025 --> 00:11:18,350
- Is it nice if we put the—
- Ma'am, where should I put this?

99
00:11:18,807 --> 00:11:21,226
Ah! Where should I...

100
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,041
Over here, Sir.
Place it here... right here.

101
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:28,614
Let's see what's in here...

102
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:29,998
Put that back there.

103
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,841
There's...

104
00:11:41,276 --> 00:11:42,527
You're kinda far.

105
00:11:42,552 --> 00:11:43,678
Let's get a bit closer, Sir.

106
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,839
Yes! Okay, chest out!

107
00:11:47,025 --> 00:11:49,200
Okay, great.

108
00:11:49,225 --> 00:11:50,244
Am I doing this right, Coach?

109
00:11:50,268 --> 00:11:51,811
You're doing good, yes.
Good job.

110
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:52,836
Hold on, chin up!

111
00:11:53,104 --> 00:11:54,189
Good job.

112
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:55,458
Alright.

113
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:56,511
Okay.

114
00:11:56,975 --> 00:11:58,628
You're doing good, really good work.

115
00:11:59,527 --> 00:12:00,695
Don't forget to breathe, okay?

116
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,538
You still have two sets left. Hold on.

117
00:12:02,563 --> 00:12:05,511
- Okay, Coach.
- Bro! Good thing you dropped by.

118
00:12:05,695 --> 00:12:07,800
Of course! I wanted
to check out our gym.

119
00:12:07,887 --> 00:12:09,597
Check? Or investigate?

120
00:12:09,968 --> 00:12:12,964
Bro, I just want to see the expansions
you made recently.

121
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:17,895
Oh, well. We bought
some new machines.

122
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,198
Good enough for you?

123
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,534
- Can we recoup the expenses?
- I'm sorry?

124
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:22,785
Bro!

125
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,479
You think the gym's gonna
make it big overnight?

126
00:12:26,216 --> 00:12:28,468
Bro, you're way too impatient.

127
00:12:28,493 --> 00:12:31,206
Things take time.
We can't rush business.

128
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:33,878
So, you have any more questions?

129
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,652
I was just curious, bro.
That's all.

130
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,467
You know I'm clueless
about these things.

131
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:40,919
You're the businessman.

132
00:12:40,944 --> 00:12:42,691
That's why when it comes
to money matters,

133
00:12:42,716 --> 00:12:43,917
I trust you.

134
00:12:45,782 --> 00:12:47,691
What's money matters between brothers.

135
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:50,238
We're the only family we've got left.

136
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:55,198
But when it comes to women,
now that's a different story.

137
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:58,072
Good thing we have
different tastes in women.

138
00:12:58,097 --> 00:12:59,870
Alright, I'll just go back
to my client real quick.

139
00:12:59,941 --> 00:13:00,995
Alright, bro.

140
00:13:01,813 --> 00:13:04,232
Oh my god, Mel!

141
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:08,063
This is so huge! So firm!

142
00:13:08,137 --> 00:13:11,253
I bet tumbling around
here is pure bliss!

143
00:13:11,641 --> 00:13:12,964
This feels amazing!

144
00:13:13,518 --> 00:13:15,210
Hey, move it!

145
00:13:15,235 --> 00:13:17,195
Martin and I haven't
broken in that bed yet!

146
00:13:19,808 --> 00:13:21,310
This is heaven!

147
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:23,587
You've got someone to
cuddle with in bed every night.

148
00:13:23,783 --> 00:13:25,292
No need for bar
meet-ups anymore.

149
00:13:25,317 --> 00:13:28,112
Hold on. I'm not the one
making the first move... It's the guys.

150
00:13:28,157 --> 00:13:29,816
They're the ones giving me free drinks.

151
00:13:30,293 --> 00:13:31,777
And free sex!

152
00:13:33,173 --> 00:13:34,764
Shut your mouth,

153
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:38,073
Martin might overhear you
because of that loose tongue.

154
00:13:38,407 --> 00:13:40,242
He doesn't know that part of my life.

155
00:13:42,318 --> 00:13:44,236
It's not just my tongue that's loose.

156
00:13:44,674 --> 00:13:45,674
Weirdo!

157
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:50,029
Don't push me! Don't you dare!

158
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:55,630
I mean.. Martin, he's a good guy.

159
00:13:55,781 --> 00:13:59,576
And now that I've found
a good guy in my life,

160
00:13:59,898 --> 00:14:02,255
I want to change for him too.

161
00:14:02,563 --> 00:14:05,232
What? Did I hear that right?

162
00:14:05,964 --> 00:14:07,007
You're gonna change?

163
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,790
Well, here's the thing.

164
00:14:09,886 --> 00:14:12,107
To start on a clean sheet of paper,

165
00:14:12,697 --> 00:14:14,279
let's remove the past.

166
00:14:14,412 --> 00:14:15,662
As for the present,

167
00:14:16,253 --> 00:14:18,172
we need to create good memories

168
00:14:18,197 --> 00:14:21,677
so our future would
be happy and bright.

169
00:14:22,618 --> 00:14:24,974
Hey, cousin?
Is that really you?

170
00:14:25,368 --> 00:14:27,453
I might not recognize you
in that holy veil of yours.

171
00:14:27,844 --> 00:14:29,771
You're not gonna flirt
with guys anymore?

172
00:14:30,008 --> 00:14:32,209
You better not be a bad influence.

173
00:14:32,987 --> 00:14:34,405
I know you.

174
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:39,062
Yes, Sister.

175
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,840
I will not lead you into temptation.

176
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:44,474
So? You happy now?

177
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:48,550
See, you're blushing!

178
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,073
Whatever...

179
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,200
Ouch...

180
00:16:42,828 --> 00:16:45,539
Mel... My breakfast.

181
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:50,318
What time is it?

182
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:52,194
It's 6 AM.

183
00:16:52,516 --> 00:16:54,351
I'm supposed to be
at the gym by 7.

184
00:16:54,376 --> 00:16:55,376
Come on, wake up!

185
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,750
Mel, wake up!

186
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,416
- Why aren't you done yet?
- It's ready.

187
00:17:25,385 --> 00:17:26,412
Give that to me.

188
00:17:26,437 --> 00:17:28,635
- I'm gonna put that in a...
- Don't even bother. I'm late.

189
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,370
Next time, do it
three minutes earlier, okay?

190
00:17:36,525 --> 00:17:37,525
Martin!

191
00:17:43,214 --> 00:17:45,589
Yes, Ma'am! Most definitely.

192
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:49,417
The delivery of the throw pillows
is scheduled for Wednesday.

193
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:56,776
Yes, I have secured two yards
of the fabric you selected.

194
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,040
So that makes, all in all...

195
00:17:59,065 --> 00:18:00,573
eight throw pillows.

196
00:18:04,206 --> 00:18:06,518
Blue and gold! Yes, blue and gold.

197
00:18:07,657 --> 00:18:08,956
Thank you, Ma'am.

198
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,280
Donna!

199
00:18:18,481 --> 00:18:20,524
- Yes, Ma'am?
- That lamp looks nice.

200
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:22,496
I'll take that.
It'll match our bed.

201
00:18:22,521 --> 00:18:24,638
Sure thing, Ma'am.
I'll have it wrapped for you.

202
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,660
Hi, Melanie.

203
00:19:13,773 --> 00:19:14,857
Remember me?

204
00:19:15,994 --> 00:19:17,762
I'm sorry, no.

205
00:19:20,176 --> 00:19:21,611
That's the problem with you.

206
00:19:21,636 --> 00:19:22,887
You're a user!

207
00:19:23,471 --> 00:19:26,403
Huh? Who the hell are you?

208
00:19:27,318 --> 00:19:28,694
I don't even know you!

209
00:19:33,314 --> 00:19:35,864
This. Do you remember this?

210
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:39,191
Cock-teasing bitch.

211
00:19:40,608 --> 00:19:42,360
Guard! Help!

212
00:19:42,385 --> 00:19:45,179
What's going on here!
Get him, quick!

213
00:19:45,658 --> 00:19:47,619
Ma'am! Are you okay?

214
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:50,271
I'm okay.

215
00:20:08,766 --> 00:20:10,434
9:00. Time for bed.

216
00:20:10,815 --> 00:20:13,329
Aren't you gonna finish watching?

217
00:20:13,471 --> 00:20:15,348
Early to bed, early to rise.

218
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,309
Do you remember this?

219
00:20:51,642 --> 00:20:53,159
Cock-teasing bitch.

220
00:20:55,502 --> 00:20:57,045
Help!

221
00:20:57,444 --> 00:20:58,908
Guard!

222
00:23:06,596 --> 00:23:08,473
So, my takeaway from the movie is...

223
00:23:08,498 --> 00:23:10,458
the punishment should fit the crime.

224
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,802
Well, I think it's a knee-jerk
reaction of someone

225
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:16,912
who wants retribution as revenge.

226
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,398
Well, what about
the criminal's side?

227
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,318
The court should take
underlying issues into account.

228
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,612
Ones that led him to commit
the crime in the first place, right?

229
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:26,722
The situation's not
always black and white.

230
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,072
Right!

231
00:23:28,097 --> 00:23:29,890
The world is filled with gray.

232
00:23:30,222 --> 00:23:33,183
That's what you get when
you combine black and white.

233
00:23:35,254 --> 00:23:39,008
For me, crime is crime.
No ifs, no buts.

234
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,229
I think that argument's too simplistic.

235
00:23:42,328 --> 00:23:45,232
There has to be a distinction
between retribution as revenge,

236
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,676
or the offender
compensating the victim.

237
00:23:47,701 --> 00:23:50,037
That's how we can
restore justice, right?

238
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,449
What about heinous crimes?

239
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:55,392
Take murder for example.

240
00:23:55,743 --> 00:23:58,704
How can a murderer compensate
the family of their victim,

241
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,339
when the victim is already dead?

242
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,567
Doesn't it say in the Bible,
"an eye for an eye"?

243
00:24:05,155 --> 00:24:07,659
Scripture should never
be interpreted literally.

244
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,865
Throughout the centuries,
laws have evolved.

245
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,892
The culture of each
country also matters.

246
00:24:12,056 --> 00:24:13,135
Exactly!

247
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,996
Just like in Japan.
Suicide is not considered a crime.

248
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,457
But in the eyes of God...

249
00:24:18,534 --> 00:24:20,167
You know how much
I hate religious fanatics.

250
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:21,402
Are you calling me one?

251
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,713
Excuse me, guys.

252
00:24:26,738 --> 00:24:28,323
Ladies room break?

253
00:24:28,803 --> 00:24:29,803
Me too.

254
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,190
Girl, what's going on with you?

255
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:45,400
You've been acting weird
since we got here.

256
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,463
And your hands were as cold
as ice when I touched them.

257
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,322
Are you sick?

258
00:24:50,347 --> 00:24:52,283
Did you get into a fight
with Martin? Tell me.

259
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:00,248
Cuz...

260
00:25:02,191 --> 00:25:03,818
I have a stalker.

261
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,337
What?

262
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,030
Mel?

263
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:34,825
Sweetie...

264
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,661
Make love to me, please.

265
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:07,125
Happy birthday, happy birthday...

266
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:12,548
Happy birthday to you.

267
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,925
Thank you, guys!
Thank you so much!

268
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:16,593
Go, make a wish!

269
00:27:18,376 --> 00:27:20,086
Yay!

270
00:27:20,111 --> 00:27:21,723
Happy birthday, love of my life.

271
00:27:21,748 --> 00:27:23,709
Thank you, I love you.

272
00:27:27,755 --> 00:27:31,050
Come, let's eat! Let's go!

273
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,710
Here are the shots!

274
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,046
Let's go.

275
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,673
Cheers!

276
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:55,841
Happy Birthday, Mel!

277
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,259
Thank you, guys!

278
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:02,848
I'm gonna get a refill.

279
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:03,848
Yeah, sure.

280
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,436
Come on, Leo!
Let's dance!

281
00:28:07,461 --> 00:28:10,047
No, it's okay.
I'm fine here...

282
00:28:59,354 --> 00:29:02,366
Mel. Enough, you're drunk.

283
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:14,378
Ugh, this guy is so lame.
He's already tired!

284
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:16,605
You know I'm not
really into dancing.

285
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:19,177
Hello? Yes, Sir Vincent.

286
00:29:19,202 --> 00:29:20,620
I've got to take this call.

287
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:25,263
Leo, go dance with Mel!
It's her birthday!

288
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:28,617
So what's the deal? Did you
come here just to sulk or something?

289
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:30,018
Fine.

290
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:34,138
Hold on. I might fall.

291
00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:35,440
Just hold on to me.

292
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,525
Excuse me guys.

293
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,364
You better not let go of me.

294
00:29:38,389 --> 00:29:39,557
Never.

295
00:31:04,141 --> 00:31:06,935
Cuz, do you know this guy?

296
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,284
Nope, never saw him before.

297
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:12,788
Right? What was
he doing at my party?

298
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:15,874
Obviously, he's a gatecrasher.

299
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:19,836
Are you sure that's the stalker
in the basement parking?

300
00:31:20,766 --> 00:31:21,766
Ugh...

301
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,883
I will never forget the
way he looked at me.

302
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,761
It's like he's looking
straight into my soul.

303
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:29,513
Creepy.

304
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,793
I'm getting goosebumps, Mel.

305
00:31:33,464 --> 00:31:34,799
Who is he?

306
00:31:35,021 --> 00:31:36,564
Why does he seem mad at you?

307
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:39,523
Didn't you have a
one-night stand with him?

308
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:44,753
I remember being
slightly drunk that night.

309
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,196
I don't know what exactly happened,

310
00:31:46,221 --> 00:31:50,767
but I found myself fooling around
with this guy by the restroom.

311
00:31:51,123 --> 00:31:53,751
And when I wanted to stop,
he refused to let go.

312
00:31:53,776 --> 00:31:57,738
So I slapped him.
Then, I left him.

313
00:31:59,214 --> 00:32:02,087
And I never saw
him again after that.

314
00:32:03,031 --> 00:32:07,050
No! I definitely didn't have a
one night stand with that asshole!

315
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:10,734
I'm sure I would remember if
I had a one-night stand, right?

316
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:16,143
Unless you were really drunk,
and didn't know what you were doing!

317
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,379
Or, he drugged you.

318
00:32:20,786 --> 00:32:23,121
I swear, cuz. It's sex.

319
00:32:23,146 --> 00:32:26,566
Drugged or not, good or bad,
I would surely remember.

320
00:32:26,942 --> 00:32:28,069
What about you?

321
00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:29,795
Of course, I do!

322
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,847
If the sex was unforgettable.

323
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,245
Nothing happened to us that time.

324
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,831
It was just a one-time thing, cuz.

325
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,419
You know, this always happens
during our drinking sessions.

326
00:32:45,162 --> 00:32:47,289
Why does he seem
so affected by it?

327
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:52,120
Maybe he feels like you led him
on and then left him hanging.

328
00:32:52,865 --> 00:32:56,035
Oh my God. You know men.

329
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,300
They have so much pride.

330
00:32:57,325 --> 00:32:59,035
They can't lose face.

331
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,854
Well, that was two years ago.

332
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,481
Can't he just forget it
and move on?

333
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,676
Maybe he just found you
on Facebook recently.

334
00:33:08,017 --> 00:33:09,050
Probably.

335
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,542
Hello, Ma?

336
00:36:10,322 --> 00:36:12,741
Why'd you call?

337
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:19,366
Of course, I know it's
Papa's birthday on Sunday.

338
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,710
There's a party?

339
00:36:24,258 --> 00:36:27,077
I'm not sure I want to attend though.

340
00:36:29,202 --> 00:36:31,162
I'll just send him a cake.

341
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:42,741
You know if I go there,
I'd have to wear a veil.

342
00:36:45,073 --> 00:36:48,951
I might get a sermon from Papa.

343
00:36:52,112 --> 00:36:56,699
You know how he is,
he's very conservative.

344
00:36:57,919 --> 00:37:00,838
He says that living together
is a sin in the eyes of God.

345
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,725
There's a gathering on
Sunday for my father.

346
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,921
It's his birthday.

347
00:37:10,306 --> 00:37:12,530
Oh, Sweetie!

348
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:14,916
You could've waited for me to eat!

349
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,335
You took a long time
on the phone.

350
00:37:18,247 --> 00:37:20,882
Well, Mom had a lot
of stories to share.

351
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:26,774
Babe, you know I need
to eat by 7:30 on the dot,

352
00:37:26,939 --> 00:37:28,788
to catch my show.

353
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:36,838
Hey. Please join me for dinner.

354
00:37:37,278 --> 00:37:39,280
Why, can't you eat by yourself?

355
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,936
What happened to your stalker,
by the way? Is he still around?

356
00:37:51,961 --> 00:37:55,006
I was just about to tell you!

357
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,774
I saw him again at the bar!

358
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,861
I'm not really sure if I was just
imagining things at that time.

359
00:37:59,886 --> 00:38:01,763
I was really tipsy.

360
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:04,032
Then, he just disappeared
out of thin air.

361
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,784
Maybe you're just being paranoid.

362
00:38:13,404 --> 00:38:14,556
Yuck.

363
00:38:15,569 --> 00:38:17,946
That guy's cologne
is so overpowering.

364
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,339
It's nauseating.

365
00:38:23,955 --> 00:38:25,748
Can you smell it?

366
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,903
Yes.

367
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:37,440
Did you drench yourself in cologne?

368
00:38:37,918 --> 00:38:40,794
- You like it?
- What cologne are you wearing?

369
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,426
Why, don't you like it?

370
00:38:43,232 --> 00:38:44,395
I like it.

371
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:46,449
I like it.

372
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,286
Does this turn you on?

373
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:55,041
Stop it! I'm a bit ticklish
in that spot.

374
00:38:58,149 --> 00:38:59,957
You have very lovely eyes.

375
00:39:01,704 --> 00:39:03,442
Let me stare at those eyes.

376
00:39:20,587 --> 00:39:22,502
What are you doing?

377
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:25,154
- Shhh. Just relax and enjoy.
- Did I tell you to do that?

378
00:39:25,179 --> 00:39:27,323
Just relax and enjoy.

379
00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:01,082
I have an appointment
with my dermatologist.

380
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,734
Let's meet on the
sixth floor in ten minutes.

381
00:40:02,759 --> 00:40:03,759
Anj!

382
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:40,938
Bye.

383
00:41:02,233 --> 00:41:03,233
Leo?

384
00:41:03,791 --> 00:41:07,044
Hi, Mel. Good morning.

385
00:41:08,193 --> 00:41:09,659
Good morning.

386
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:14,186
Oh, I just wanted to give you this.

387
00:41:18,584 --> 00:41:20,069
Creampuffs?

388
00:41:20,918 --> 00:41:24,088
Aw. Thank you.

389
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:27,026
How'd you know
these are my favorite?

390
00:41:27,243 --> 00:41:28,373
For real?

391
00:41:28,751 --> 00:41:30,003
Are you stalking me?

392
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:32,382
No, I swear...

393
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:33,658
You did some research on me?

394
00:41:33,683 --> 00:41:35,217
No, I know.

395
00:41:35,538 --> 00:41:37,373
You have a crush on me, don't you?

396
00:41:38,968 --> 00:41:41,319
Actually, I already
bought that last night.

397
00:41:41,344 --> 00:41:44,097
I wasn't even sure
if you'd like it.

398
00:41:45,318 --> 00:41:47,570
It's the thought that counts.

399
00:41:48,681 --> 00:41:50,433
Come in.

400
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,689
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

401
00:42:04,806 --> 00:42:07,256
Perfect timing. I haven't
had breakfast yet.

402
00:42:07,281 --> 00:42:09,559
- How about you?
- I only had coffee.

403
00:42:10,186 --> 00:42:12,230
I see. Just a sec.

404
00:42:31,346 --> 00:42:33,306
- My brother-
- Martin-

405
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:38,498
He went out early this morning.

406
00:42:38,738 --> 00:42:41,115
He wants to be the
first one at the gym.

407
00:42:41,496 --> 00:42:44,374
He insists on being there
at 7 AM, on the dot.

408
00:42:45,543 --> 00:42:47,128
Well that's my brother, alright.

409
00:42:47,215 --> 00:42:48,675
Disciplined to a fault.

410
00:42:53,264 --> 00:42:54,931
Perfect. I think it's ready.

411
00:43:50,492 --> 00:43:53,359
Mmm! Delicious!

412
00:43:54,927 --> 00:43:55,927
Try it.

413
00:43:56,001 --> 00:43:57,294
Alright, thank you.

414
00:44:01,707 --> 00:44:02,762
Cheers!

415
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Cheers.

416
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,275
Babe, do we have any fruits?

417
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,494
We have mangoes,
as well as some grapes.

418
00:46:54,797 --> 00:46:56,906
Creampuffs?
Where'd this come from?

419
00:47:00,292 --> 00:47:03,003
Oh, those are from Leo.

420
00:47:03,632 --> 00:47:04,922
He passed by here yesterday.

421
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,224
You didn't tell me about that.

422
00:47:07,202 --> 00:47:09,423
He just dropped them off.
He knows you like them.

423
00:47:09,448 --> 00:47:11,199
Try it! It's good.

424
00:47:16,941 --> 00:47:17,968
Pass.

425
00:47:18,437 --> 00:47:20,154
I'm cutting back on sweets.

426
00:47:24,464 --> 00:47:25,522
You should as well.

427
00:47:28,032 --> 00:47:29,241
You're getting fat.

428
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:31,288
Skip the desserts from now on.

429
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,225
Try to lose some weight.
You better hit the gym.

430
00:47:40,993 --> 00:47:42,453
Martin, wait!

431
00:48:07,178 --> 00:48:08,245
Sign here.

432
00:48:09,363 --> 00:48:10,786
Over here, yes...

433
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:12,565
There you go, thank you.

434
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:18,254
Why didn't you remember
him right away?

435
00:48:18,789 --> 00:48:21,364
Because I was wasted that night.

436
00:48:21,738 --> 00:48:24,240
I lost control of my body.

437
00:48:24,481 --> 00:48:27,234
That's why I couldn't remember
what I was doing.

438
00:48:27,659 --> 00:48:30,801
And I can't even recall his face anymore.

439
00:48:30,826 --> 00:48:32,598
But his eyes...

440
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:37,905
Cuz, it's really his cologne
that triggers my memories.

441
00:48:39,442 --> 00:48:42,351
So what happened next?

442
00:48:43,772 --> 00:48:46,532
I think I passed out.

443
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,922
I just woke up,
and I was already inside the bathroom.

444
00:48:50,317 --> 00:48:51,694
You remember that?

445
00:48:51,735 --> 00:48:54,989
Someone even told you
I was inside, throwing up.

446
00:48:57,489 --> 00:49:01,535
Maybe he felt unsatisfied with you,
so now he's giving you a hard time.

447
00:49:02,366 --> 00:49:03,422
Probably.

448
00:49:04,062 --> 00:49:07,055
- I'm not really-
- Hey, look who's here!

449
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,102
Hi.

450
00:49:08,127 --> 00:49:10,521
Hi, handsome.
Are you here to work out?

451
00:49:10,546 --> 00:49:12,298
Well actually, I'm looking
for my brother.

452
00:49:12,323 --> 00:49:13,658
Have you guys seen him?

453
00:49:13,683 --> 00:49:17,437
I was planning to invite him for a meal.
I have some good news for him.

454
00:49:17,682 --> 00:49:19,893
Why don't you join us?
It's my treat.

455
00:49:19,918 --> 00:49:22,337
Sure! How can we say no to you?

456
00:49:25,352 --> 00:49:26,896
Oh, Martin?

457
00:49:27,093 --> 00:49:30,374
He’s at the office.
He said he’ll just take a quick shower.

458
00:49:30,399 --> 00:49:31,922
Alright. I can wait.

459
00:49:38,066 --> 00:49:39,318
Sir?

460
00:49:40,259 --> 00:49:44,132
Mr. Go is asking for your signature.
He says it's urgent.

461
00:49:44,157 --> 00:49:47,536
The messenger has been waiting outside
for some time now.

462
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,907
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

463
00:49:53,735 --> 00:49:54,815
Wait, hang on.

464
00:49:56,638 --> 00:49:57,931
Let me see that again.

465
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,174
Sir, wait.

466
00:50:09,266 --> 00:50:10,682
What are you doing, Sir?

467
00:50:11,137 --> 00:50:13,806
Sir, your girlfriend might
see us from outside.

468
00:51:31,907 --> 00:51:33,867
Guys, we're here to celebrate, okay?

469
00:51:33,892 --> 00:51:35,236
I have a new project.

470
00:51:35,491 --> 00:51:36,617
What project is this?

471
00:51:36,792 --> 00:51:40,171
My college batchmate decided that
I should do a docu-series with him.

472
00:51:40,346 --> 00:51:42,424
And our proposal just got approved.

473
00:51:42,449 --> 00:51:43,575
Guess what?

474
00:51:43,925 --> 00:51:45,719
We were given a huge budget for this.

475
00:51:45,959 --> 00:51:48,087
So that's the good news!

476
00:51:48,112 --> 00:51:50,260
You're really amazing, Leo.

477
00:51:52,421 --> 00:51:53,509
Toast.

478
00:51:54,885 --> 00:51:56,970
To my little brother.

479
00:51:57,046 --> 00:51:58,361
Best friend.

480
00:51:58,931 --> 00:52:01,767
The best graphic designer in the world...

481
00:52:02,008 --> 00:52:03,392
can do no wrong.

482
00:52:04,853 --> 00:52:05,908
Cheers.

483
00:52:06,313 --> 00:52:08,273
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

484
00:52:12,277 --> 00:52:14,497
Try the fried chicken, Leo.

485
00:52:14,667 --> 00:52:16,185
It's to die for.

486
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:19,093
Really? I'm too young to die.

487
00:52:19,118 --> 00:52:22,454
And besides, I just finished
a million peso contract.

488
00:52:23,038 --> 00:52:24,998
So, how much longer
will this project go on?

489
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:27,137
Maybe a couple of months, I think?

490
00:52:27,234 --> 00:52:29,794
So, I guess I'll have
to extend my stay here.

491
00:52:31,338 --> 00:52:34,341
So while you're still here,
let's go out of town.

492
00:52:34,708 --> 00:52:37,878
Better yet, while you're still here,
let's get you a fitness program, man.

493
00:52:37,903 --> 00:52:39,071
Seriously.

494
00:52:39,096 --> 00:52:41,140
Let's work on those abs.
It's embarrassing.

495
00:52:41,165 --> 00:52:43,041
How else would
you get a girlfriend?

496
00:52:43,066 --> 00:52:45,736
Sure, bro. No harm
in a little stretching.

497
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:49,489
But I'm really looking for a girl
who'll fall in love with my mind.

498
00:52:50,153 --> 00:52:51,738
Not with my six-pack.

499
00:52:52,054 --> 00:52:53,514
Mind over matter.

500
00:52:54,097 --> 00:52:56,370
Brawn over brain, Leo.

501
00:52:57,083 --> 00:52:58,668
That's just a first impression, bro.

502
00:52:58,693 --> 00:53:00,070
That's merely physical.

503
00:53:00,284 --> 00:53:03,579
You fall in love with your brain.
Not with your heart.

504
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:05,956
When you're attracted to someone,

505
00:53:06,088 --> 00:53:10,259
your neurotransmitters and
your hormones are acting up in your brain.

506
00:53:10,544 --> 00:53:12,206
They release dopamine and other chemicals-

507
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:13,941
Bro, you know what?

508
00:53:14,631 --> 00:53:16,216
You know what else you are?

509
00:53:16,717 --> 00:53:18,385
You're a smart ass, bro.

510
00:53:18,804 --> 00:53:20,323
Hey bro, come on!

511
00:53:20,429 --> 00:53:21,805
Guys.

512
00:53:22,264 --> 00:53:26,829
You know, maybe Martin's
just tired from work.

513
00:53:26,854 --> 00:53:28,395
That's why he's in a bad mood.

514
00:53:28,645 --> 00:53:30,774
He just needs a breather.

515
00:53:31,176 --> 00:53:33,470
He usually calms down pretty quickly.

516
00:53:33,734 --> 00:53:35,152
So, let's cheers!

517
00:53:35,177 --> 00:53:36,177
Uh-huh!

518
00:53:36,403 --> 00:53:39,114
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

519
00:53:39,324 --> 00:53:41,076
Thanks for coming, guys.

520
00:53:42,307 --> 00:53:43,690
So how's the chicken?

521
00:53:44,003 --> 00:53:46,832
I don't want to die, you know.
So I haven't tried it yet.

522
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:50,213
Try it already...

523
00:54:07,496 --> 00:54:08,664
Martin.

524
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:11,659
Can we do this tomorrow?

525
00:54:12,397 --> 00:54:14,191
I'm really sleepy.

526
00:54:15,192 --> 00:54:16,360
Damn it.

527
00:54:17,027 --> 00:54:19,571
Just when I adjusted
my sleep schedule?

528
00:54:19,706 --> 00:54:22,584
I still have 15 minutes of
extra energy for some reason

529
00:54:23,661 --> 00:54:24,829
I’m sorry.

530
00:54:24,854 --> 00:54:26,357
Let’s just cuddle, okay?

531
00:54:33,474 --> 00:54:35,506
Do you think my brother is attractive?

532
00:54:40,175 --> 00:54:41,385
You mean, Leo?

533
00:54:41,635 --> 00:54:44,155
What I'm saying is, for example,
you just laid your eyes on him.

534
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:48,742
Does your brain get flooded with
"love hormones" when you see him?

535
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:52,690
I mean, he's not ugly.

536
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:57,776
Look me in the eyes
and tell me the truth.

537
00:54:59,278 --> 00:55:01,196
Who's more handsome?
Me or him?

538
00:55:01,789 --> 00:55:03,957
Sweetie, are you serious?

539
00:55:03,982 --> 00:55:05,592
Of course, I choose you!

540
00:55:06,388 --> 00:55:07,631
- Good answer.
- Silly.

541
00:55:07,843 --> 00:55:09,469
Good answer.

542
00:55:13,458 --> 00:55:15,502
Why would you even think of that?

543
00:55:16,003 --> 00:55:17,074
Nothing.

544
00:55:17,626 --> 00:55:19,961
I was just wondering
if he's your cousin's type.

545
00:55:20,481 --> 00:55:21,488
Anj?

546
00:55:21,513 --> 00:55:22,680
Yeah.

547
00:55:22,705 --> 00:55:26,417
Also, I'm just gauging
if Leo likes her too.

548
00:55:28,583 --> 00:55:30,418
Why are you asking?

549
00:55:31,092 --> 00:55:33,595
Wouldn't it be perfect
if we match them together?

550
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,647
Your cousin. My brother.

551
00:55:37,774 --> 00:55:40,902
Sweetie, they're adults.

552
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:44,340
If they do like each other,
just let them be.

553
00:55:45,215 --> 00:55:49,598
Why? Are you worried that your brother
might become an old bachelor?

554
00:55:49,623 --> 00:55:50,707
No way.

555
00:55:50,784 --> 00:55:52,828
I just want him to leave me be.

556
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:58,922
Even when we were kids,
Leo has always been a pain in the ass.

557
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:02,224
He's always competing
with me for something.

558
00:56:03,638 --> 00:56:06,598
I wish he would just go back
to Australia for good.

559
00:56:07,892 --> 00:56:11,813
Come on now. You're much older than him.
His big brother.

560
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:14,805
You're supposed to sort things out
between the two of you.

561
00:56:14,841 --> 00:56:17,926
After all, you guys
only got each other.

562
00:56:30,827 --> 00:56:33,749
Don't worry about it.
They're adults.

563
00:57:55,662 --> 00:57:59,126
[screaming]

564
00:58:16,641 --> 00:58:18,187
Are you hot?

565
00:58:21,688 --> 00:58:23,775
Is it okay if I wipe your face?

566
00:58:34,019 --> 00:58:35,312
Of course!

567
00:58:35,911 --> 00:58:37,829
No problem.

568
00:58:37,829 --> 00:58:40,290
I'm sweating hard
as well, like you.

569
00:58:46,505 --> 00:58:48,006
You good?

570
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:49,608
Let have some shots!

571
00:58:49,633 --> 00:58:52,177
- Is there tequila?
- Let me have some! Let's go!

572
00:58:53,345 --> 00:58:54,429
Hey!

573
00:58:55,363 --> 00:58:57,365
What the hell are you wearing, Mel?
Wear something else.

574
00:58:57,390 --> 00:58:58,892
I don't like it.

575
00:59:14,741 --> 00:59:16,741
I couldn't find some tequila,
let's just have this.

576
01:00:08,427 --> 01:00:09,749
Hello?

577
01:00:21,176 --> 01:00:22,511
Hello?

578
01:00:34,979 --> 01:00:36,814
Mel, where's my protein shake?

579
01:00:37,351 --> 01:00:39,645
Hold on, I'm still cleaning this.

580
01:00:39,828 --> 01:00:41,455
Why didn't you clean it last night?

581
01:00:41,733 --> 01:00:43,853
I fell asleep early last night.

582
01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:45,432
Just relax and let me finish this.

583
01:00:45,457 --> 01:00:48,503
Forget it. I can't rely on you,
even for the simplest things.

584
01:00:50,962 --> 01:00:53,590
You know what, Martin?
Why don't we just hire a maid?

585
01:00:53,615 --> 01:00:57,619
I don't want random strangers
moving around in our house.

586
01:00:59,019 --> 01:01:02,017
Martin, the whole day
I've been tired from work.

587
01:01:02,164 --> 01:01:03,825
I've been working at the shop non-stop.

588
01:01:03,850 --> 01:01:06,603
When I get home, you still expect me
to do all this? I can't anymore.

589
01:01:06,628 --> 01:01:10,192
- I'm so exhausted.
- Mel, that's a woman's job. Suck it up.

590
01:01:10,738 --> 01:01:12,811
You're seriously lacking discipline.

591
01:01:14,282 --> 01:01:15,364
Martin!

592
01:01:28,133 --> 01:01:30,344
- Hey, bro!
- Bro!

593
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,815
I see you bought flowers! For whom?

594
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:36,081
Oh, for Mom. I'll visit her
in Heritage Park.

595
01:01:36,106 --> 01:01:37,107
What?

596
01:01:37,135 --> 01:01:40,764
Why? Is it her death anniversary today?

597
01:01:41,045 --> 01:01:42,182
Or her birthday?

598
01:01:43,083 --> 01:01:45,714
No. But the last time
I was there was three years ago,

599
01:01:45,739 --> 01:01:47,437
during my last visit home.

600
01:01:48,133 --> 01:01:49,175
Wow.

601
01:01:49,775 --> 01:01:51,378
So much effort from you.

602
01:01:51,861 --> 01:01:52,901
Well...

603
01:01:53,805 --> 01:01:55,932
you always were her favorite, momma's boy.

604
01:01:56,162 --> 01:01:59,332
You, what are you doing here?
Are you also gonna get flowers?

605
01:01:59,357 --> 01:02:00,714
Of course, for Mel.

606
01:02:00,969 --> 01:02:02,804
Why, what's the occasion?

607
01:02:02,868 --> 01:02:03,995
Nothing.

608
01:02:04,251 --> 01:02:06,587
Bro, you don't need
a special occasion to do this.

609
01:02:06,709 --> 01:02:08,544
It's all part of wooing the girl.

610
01:02:08,828 --> 01:02:10,705
Keep things hot in the
bedroom, you know.

611
01:02:10,875 --> 01:02:14,211
Dude, women are
so damn easy to please.

612
01:02:15,825 --> 01:02:18,703
Wait, why don't you
buy Angie flowers?

613
01:02:18,757 --> 01:02:19,800
What?

614
01:02:19,882 --> 01:02:21,509
Don't you want to date her?

615
01:02:21,594 --> 01:02:23,053
But why?

616
01:02:23,078 --> 01:02:27,875
I don’t know. Maybe because
she's funny, smart, sexy, hot?

617
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:32,205
And, bro! She's totally into you!
You won't find anyone else like her.

618
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:33,573
Bro, where is this coming from?

619
01:02:33,598 --> 01:02:36,120
Don't you want us
to be a foursome with Angie?

620
01:02:36,292 --> 01:02:38,461
Dude, you get along so well
when you're together.

621
01:02:38,486 --> 01:02:40,245
You'd make a good-looking couple.

622
01:02:40,555 --> 01:02:43,198
I don't think so, bro.
Anyway, I'll go ahead.

623
01:02:43,223 --> 01:02:44,284
Take care.

624
01:02:44,309 --> 01:02:48,855
Think about it. You never know.
Your brain might release lots of dopamine.

625
01:02:49,025 --> 01:02:50,402
Bye, bro!

626
01:03:02,137 --> 01:03:03,229
Mel?

627
01:03:05,379 --> 01:03:06,486
I love you.

628
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:18,760
Babe?

629
01:04:18,962 --> 01:04:20,745
Oh, Martin.

630
01:04:21,466 --> 01:04:22,884
You're home early.

631
01:04:22,955 --> 01:04:24,026
Flowers for you.

632
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:29,260
Thank you.

633
01:04:29,956 --> 01:04:32,500
But, what's this for?

634
01:04:33,157 --> 01:04:34,713
I just want to make you happy.

635
01:04:35,715 --> 01:04:37,706
I make you happy, right, Babe?

636
01:04:38,464 --> 01:04:39,799
Of course!

637
01:04:41,645 --> 01:04:43,897
My ingrown nail hurts.

638
01:04:45,171 --> 01:04:48,675
Babe, can you get me a basin with water?
I'll just soak my feet in epsom salt-

639
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:49,776
Hold on!

640
01:04:49,914 --> 01:04:51,888
Let me do it. I'll handle it.

641
01:04:53,198 --> 01:04:54,825
But, you know what?

642
01:04:55,008 --> 01:04:56,710
I have a better idea.

643
01:08:41,904 --> 01:08:42,993
Leo?

644
01:08:45,563 --> 01:08:48,166
Hi. You left the gate open.

645
01:08:49,004 --> 01:08:50,095
Oh!

646
01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:53,041
Your brother just left.

647
01:08:53,066 --> 01:08:54,197
I know.

648
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:57,920
By the way, I hope you like chocolates.

649
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:05,867
You really want to fatten me up, huh?

650
01:09:05,931 --> 01:09:07,433
You're perfect.

651
01:09:07,458 --> 01:09:09,312
Just as you are.

652
01:09:09,364 --> 01:09:11,632
Thank you for these,

653
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:14,781
the roses and the cream puffs.

654
01:09:16,555 --> 01:09:17,851
The pleasure's all mine.

655
01:09:26,997 --> 01:09:30,316
You might get bored.
I'm still doing a painting.

656
01:09:30,952 --> 01:09:32,068
That's okay.

657
01:09:32,972 --> 01:09:34,654
I can watch you all day.

658
01:09:38,468 --> 01:09:41,137
I feel uncomfortable when...

659
01:09:41,564 --> 01:09:43,733
Uncomfortable? How?

660
01:09:44,252 --> 01:09:49,841
When someone's watching me
while I'm painting.

661
01:09:50,109 --> 01:09:53,237
How about, with someone
watching over you?

662
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,422
That's different.

663
01:10:51,618 --> 01:10:52,718
Martin?

664
01:10:55,337 --> 01:10:57,366
Oh, right!

665
01:10:57,493 --> 01:10:59,116
Sorry, it slipped my mind.

666
01:10:59,256 --> 01:11:00,657
I'll be on my way now.

667
01:11:04,303 --> 01:11:05,602
I'm sorry, Leo.

668
01:11:05,838 --> 01:11:09,675
Martin and I have
a dentist appointment at 11.

669
01:11:09,991 --> 01:11:13,226
Alright, I understand.
I'll take care of cleaning up.

670
01:11:13,462 --> 01:11:17,838
Really? Oh, thank you so much.
You're a lifesaver.

671
01:11:18,032 --> 01:11:21,010
He gets really mad
when the house is messy.

672
01:11:21,453 --> 01:11:22,597
Alright then.

673
01:11:28,975 --> 01:11:31,604
- I'm going to take a shower now.
- Okay.

674
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:40,808
Leo!

675
01:12:41,651 --> 01:12:43,259
You scared me.

676
01:12:43,407 --> 01:12:45,576
I thought you were...

677
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:46,779
Who?

678
01:12:47,219 --> 01:12:49,971
Well, what do you need?

679
01:12:49,996 --> 01:12:51,434
Can we talk?

680
01:13:04,447 --> 01:13:05,531
Hold up.

681
01:13:06,684 --> 01:13:07,855
Wait, wait.

682
01:13:09,337 --> 01:13:10,912
First, the flowers.

683
01:13:12,301 --> 01:13:13,748
Then, the chocolates.

684
01:13:15,653 --> 01:13:17,251
Now you tried to kiss me?

685
01:13:22,579 --> 01:13:24,154
What do you want to happen?

686
01:13:25,815 --> 01:13:28,387
Leo, what do you want from me?

687
01:13:29,125 --> 01:13:30,201
Mel...

688
01:13:30,793 --> 01:13:33,671
I think you know by now,
that I like you.

689
01:13:33,835 --> 01:13:37,005
No, wait. I love you!

690
01:13:37,138 --> 01:13:38,207
So what?

691
01:13:39,454 --> 01:13:41,831
What's different about
our situation now?

692
01:13:42,578 --> 01:13:43,986
Nothing, right?

693
01:13:45,006 --> 01:13:49,969
And, Leo. I'm in a commited relationship
with your brother.

694
01:13:51,881 --> 01:13:53,949
For the first time in my life,

695
01:13:55,062 --> 01:13:58,269
I want to stand by
my choices and decisions.

696
01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:03,790
But Mel, being commited to someone doesn't
mean that you're in love with that person.

697
01:14:03,815 --> 01:14:06,761
So, okay. You made
a promise to each other.

698
01:14:06,786 --> 01:14:09,470
That you'll live together.
That you'll be partners.

699
01:14:10,098 --> 01:14:12,223
But that doesn't mean
that you love each other.

700
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:14,752
And that's the most important ingredient.

701
01:14:14,777 --> 01:14:16,035
If there's no love...

702
01:14:21,107 --> 01:14:23,025
Who said there's no love?

703
01:14:24,050 --> 01:14:26,320
No one has to tell me.

704
01:14:27,316 --> 01:14:29,654
I see and feel it, Mel.

705
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:36,414
You don't know what
your brother and I have.

706
01:14:36,967 --> 01:14:39,273
Especially when
it's just the two of us.

707
01:14:40,901 --> 01:14:43,921
So do not be quick to judge.

708
01:14:44,865 --> 01:14:46,433
But are you happy?

709
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:48,980
Do you feel loved?

710
01:14:50,964 --> 01:14:52,317
Come on Mel, tell me.

711
01:14:53,716 --> 01:14:54,900
Are you happy?

712
01:14:56,144 --> 01:14:57,208
Tell me!

713
01:14:59,109 --> 01:15:01,272
Leo, please.

714
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:07,080
Let's not ruin my relationship
with your brother.

715
01:15:07,105 --> 01:15:09,572
All the more, your relationship
as siblings.

716
01:15:49,497 --> 01:15:50,694
Leo, didn't I tell you-

717
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:52,949
Mel, I won't bother you anymore.
I promise.

718
01:15:53,668 --> 01:15:57,005
I just wanted to...
I hope you don't mind.

719
01:15:58,156 --> 01:16:00,498
I just wanted to document
the mural you're working on.

720
01:16:00,693 --> 01:16:02,541
I can use it for my project.

721
01:16:06,206 --> 01:16:07,353
Would that be fine?

722
01:16:12,546 --> 01:16:13,844
Come in.

723
01:21:01,196 --> 01:21:02,196
Look up.

724
01:21:02,564 --> 01:21:13,063
[chattering]

725
01:21:23,284 --> 01:21:24,313
Mel?

726
01:21:25,870 --> 01:21:27,622
Mel, where are you?

727
01:21:29,438 --> 01:21:31,381
- Mel!
- Martin?

728
01:21:32,106 --> 01:21:33,106
Mel?

729
01:21:33,232 --> 01:21:34,650
Martin!

730
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:37,650
Mel?

731
01:21:37,691 --> 01:21:39,735
You're home early!

732
01:21:43,267 --> 01:21:44,267
Oh!

733
01:21:45,942 --> 01:21:47,360
Why did you take
a shower there?

734
01:21:47,539 --> 01:21:52,220
Because I'm covered in paint, and
I don't want our bathroom to be dirty.

735
01:21:53,641 --> 01:21:56,774
When you're done, make me
some hot tea with ginger please.

736
01:21:56,799 --> 01:21:57,845
I'm not feeling well.

737
01:21:58,725 --> 01:21:59,732
Sure.

738
01:22:08,655 --> 01:22:09,823
Later.

739
01:22:29,782 --> 01:22:33,618
Come on, guys!
Let's finish these bottles!

740
01:22:33,851 --> 01:22:35,032
Here, Melanie!

741
01:22:35,057 --> 01:22:38,018
Angie, Angie... That's enough,
Melanie can't drink anymore.

742
01:22:38,043 --> 01:22:39,540
Are you kidding me?

743
01:22:39,565 --> 01:22:41,900
Haven't you seen
my cousin wasted?

744
01:22:41,925 --> 01:22:43,149
Shut up, Anj...

745
01:22:43,585 --> 01:22:47,829
Come on! Leo!
Let's take a shot!

746
01:22:47,891 --> 01:22:50,970
- Come on! Let's get wasted!
- Cheers!

747
01:22:51,303 --> 01:22:53,597
Leo, come on!

748
01:22:53,945 --> 01:22:57,706
- Cheers!
- Happy birthday!

749
01:23:02,768 --> 01:23:06,605
This hits the spot! The longer it takes,
the more bitter this gets.

750
01:23:08,511 --> 01:23:09,889
Are you okay?

751
01:23:13,658 --> 01:23:15,600
I'm gonna take another shot.

752
01:23:22,147 --> 01:23:25,234
Well, anyway. That's it for me.

753
01:23:25,598 --> 01:23:27,976
I have an early day tomorrow.
Happy birthday, Anj.

754
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:29,154
Thank you.

755
01:23:29,179 --> 01:23:31,790
- I'll drive, okay.
- You better do.

756
01:23:33,831 --> 01:23:36,167
Whoa, whoa. What are you
reaching for down there?

757
01:23:36,347 --> 01:23:38,057
I'm trying to get the keys.

758
01:23:38,103 --> 01:23:40,439
It's been a while since you
went reaching down there.

759
01:23:40,752 --> 01:23:42,670
Oh Martin, you really talk
nonsense when you're drunk.

760
01:23:42,695 --> 01:23:44,114
No, I'm serious.

761
01:23:44,336 --> 01:23:46,839
When was the last time
we had mind-blowing sex?

762
01:23:46,950 --> 01:23:49,202
When I make an attempt,
you're always tired.

763
01:23:49,378 --> 01:23:51,338
When you're not tired,
you have a headache.

764
01:23:51,363 --> 01:23:53,772
If not a headache,
you say you're sleepy.

765
01:23:55,398 --> 01:23:56,525
Happy birthday, cuz!

766
01:23:56,550 --> 01:24:01,179
Aw, thank you Mel
and Martin for coming.

767
01:24:01,204 --> 01:24:02,851
Thank you for coming.

768
01:24:02,876 --> 01:24:04,030
How about Leo?

769
01:24:06,582 --> 01:24:08,913
Leo? Let's go.

770
01:24:09,945 --> 01:24:12,522
My little brother could
never hold his liquor.

771
01:24:14,104 --> 01:24:15,563
He's all yours.

772
01:24:15,617 --> 01:24:18,120
Don't worry.
He's in good hands.

773
01:24:18,198 --> 01:24:21,493
Mel. Leave him be,
he's a big boy. Let's go.

774
01:24:22,995 --> 01:24:24,788
Take care, guys!

775
01:24:26,644 --> 01:24:30,038
Take a step. Careful.

776
01:24:32,390 --> 01:24:35,686
Come here. Here, Leo.

777
01:24:44,977 --> 01:24:47,814
You're crazy drunk.

778
01:24:48,484 --> 01:24:49,484
Wait.

779
01:25:07,983 --> 01:25:10,610
I'll just get some coffee.
Wait for me.

780
01:25:37,608 --> 01:25:40,527
Have some coffee first.
You want coffee?

781
01:25:40,910 --> 01:25:42,371
Come on.

782
01:25:47,344 --> 01:25:48,710
Are you awake now?

783
01:25:51,702 --> 01:25:53,757
Good boy.

784
01:27:48,995 --> 01:27:51,373
Melanie...

785
01:27:57,738 --> 01:28:00,008
Get your ass off my bed!

786
01:28:07,759 --> 01:28:08,760
Shit.

787
01:28:10,686 --> 01:28:13,522
- Is this all of your stuff, Ma'am?
- Yes. Thank you.

788
01:28:13,547 --> 01:28:15,090
You're welcome, Ma'am.

789
01:28:15,349 --> 01:28:17,560
Donna, go ahead
and get back upstairs.

790
01:28:17,585 --> 01:28:18,872
A client might be waiting.

791
01:28:18,897 --> 01:28:20,671
Got it, Ma'am.
I'll handle things at the shop.

792
01:28:20,696 --> 01:28:22,573
- Alright then, take care.
- Thank you.

793
01:28:24,483 --> 01:28:26,735
I'll be fine, guys.

794
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:28,436
Promise, don't worry about me.

795
01:28:28,461 --> 01:28:29,504
You go ahead.

796
01:28:29,529 --> 01:28:31,364
- Are you sure?
- Yes, yes.

797
01:28:31,514 --> 01:28:32,928
Take care, Ma'am!

798
01:28:41,207 --> 01:28:42,208
Mel?

799
01:28:43,206 --> 01:28:44,916
Oh, Leo.

800
01:28:46,614 --> 01:28:47,920
Did you just get here?

801
01:28:48,049 --> 01:28:49,801
Oh, I'm about to leave.

802
01:28:49,828 --> 01:28:51,454
Do you need anything?

803
01:28:51,696 --> 01:28:54,699
I would like to talk about
what happened between us.

804
01:28:55,473 --> 01:28:58,768
I'm sorry, I'm in
a hurry right now.

805
01:28:58,793 --> 01:29:00,169
Can we talk some other time?

806
01:29:00,194 --> 01:29:01,921
I also left my cellphone at the shop.

807
01:29:01,946 --> 01:29:03,989
Let me. Let me get it for you.

808
01:29:04,690 --> 01:29:06,405
No, it's fine. I'll do it.

809
01:29:06,430 --> 01:29:08,624
Please, let me do it.
Just stay here.

810
01:29:19,242 --> 01:29:20,452
Come here.

811
01:29:20,477 --> 01:29:22,187
You come with me right now.

812
01:29:22,524 --> 01:29:25,152
Come with me!

813
01:29:27,405 --> 01:29:29,156
- Get in!
- Hey!

814
01:29:29,365 --> 01:29:30,866
You asshole!

815
01:29:35,387 --> 01:29:36,513
Screw off!

816
01:29:36,538 --> 01:29:39,667
Guard! Help!

817
01:29:39,692 --> 01:29:40,751
Who are you?

818
01:29:40,776 --> 01:29:42,486
Why are you doing this?

819
01:29:42,711 --> 01:29:44,505
Hey! You!

820
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:46,983
Still haven't learned your lesson, huh?

821
01:29:50,052 --> 01:29:52,514
- Let me go!
- Come with me!

822
01:29:53,108 --> 01:29:54,318
Asshole!

823
01:29:56,180 --> 01:29:57,806
Are you okay?

824
01:29:58,014 --> 01:29:59,224
Slowly...

825
01:30:07,444 --> 01:30:08,484
Are you okay?

826
01:30:09,190 --> 01:30:10,650
I'm sorry for not being there.

827
01:30:10,675 --> 01:30:11,848
Thank you.

828
01:30:15,369 --> 01:30:16,478
I’m sorry.

829
01:30:20,292 --> 01:30:24,366
It's just a contusion,
but we still need to observe it.

830
01:30:24,391 --> 01:30:28,249
If you experience
dizziness or fainting,

831
01:30:28,415 --> 01:30:30,364
you might need
to be admitted, okay?

832
01:30:30,691 --> 01:30:32,276
- I understand.
- Okay.

833
01:30:32,301 --> 01:30:34,303
- Thank you, Doc.
- Alright.

834
01:30:34,484 --> 01:30:35,777
Thank you, Doc.

835
01:30:40,744 --> 01:30:42,337
How are you feeling?

836
01:30:42,788 --> 01:30:45,069
I don't feel dizzy anymore.

837
01:30:45,094 --> 01:30:46,475
I'm feeling better.

838
01:30:47,306 --> 01:30:48,933
Who was that guy?

839
01:30:49,155 --> 01:30:50,332
Do you know him?

840
01:30:56,490 --> 01:30:57,545
Not really.

841
01:30:58,534 --> 01:31:03,066
You know, I don't know what to do
if something bad happened to you.

842
01:31:15,872 --> 01:31:17,790
Thank you, Leo.

843
01:31:19,164 --> 01:31:22,542
I wouldn't know what to do
if you weren't there.

844
01:31:23,129 --> 01:31:24,880
You saved me.

845
01:32:45,047 --> 01:32:46,461
What's this about, Mel?

846
01:32:47,353 --> 01:32:50,378
I was in a meeting with my partners.
You called me here, for what?

847
01:32:53,936 --> 01:32:57,347
- I want to get this over with, Martin.
- What do you mean?

848
01:33:00,554 --> 01:33:02,431
I'm pregnant.

849
01:33:08,946 --> 01:33:10,819
And you're not the father.

850
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:19,386
I'm sorry, but I took a DNA test.

851
01:33:19,411 --> 01:33:20,495
And what?

852
01:33:20,851 --> 01:33:22,330
Leo pulled a fast one on me?

853
01:33:24,931 --> 01:33:26,543
Ironic, isn't it?

854
01:33:27,172 --> 01:33:28,962
You just went from
one brother to another?

855
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:39,624
But I'm not surprised.

856
01:33:41,193 --> 01:33:45,281
It's just another addition
to my collection of failures.

857
01:33:45,917 --> 01:33:48,336
Another trophy for Leo.

858
01:33:51,470 --> 01:33:53,570
Why is it all about you, Martin?

859
01:33:56,440 --> 01:34:00,944
Both of us have problems here, but you're
acting like you're the only one hurt!

860
01:34:00,969 --> 01:34:02,829
Why? Are you actually hurt, Mel?

861
01:34:04,056 --> 01:34:06,850
It seems like you and Leo
were enjoying your time together.

862
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:17,354
I'm sorry.

863
01:34:17,379 --> 01:34:19,465
I really thought you've changed.

864
01:34:21,026 --> 01:34:22,736
What was I thinking?

865
01:34:23,092 --> 01:34:24,768
A girl like you?

866
01:34:27,548 --> 01:34:29,397
Old habits die hard.

867
01:34:30,378 --> 01:34:32,400
I have to go back to my meeting.

868
01:35:45,215 --> 01:35:47,926
- Goodbye.
- Bye. Take care!

869
01:35:47,951 --> 01:35:49,105
Bye, dada!

870
01:35:49,163 --> 01:35:50,914
- Bye, baby!
- Bye, dada!

871
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,169
Bye!

872
01:35:55,156 --> 01:35:57,527
Daddy is off to work.

873
01:35:57,648 --> 01:35:59,817
Goodbye!

874
01:35:59,980 --> 01:36:02,441
Bye! See you later!

875
01:36:02,466 --> 01:36:03,964
- Say bye-bye!
- Bye love!

876
01:36:04,298 --> 01:36:05,910
Bye, take care!

877
01:36:10,486 --> 01:36:13,489
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

878
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:18,590
No more daddy!
He already left...

879
01:37:59,558 --> 01:38:00,642
Hello?

880
01:38:00,667 --> 01:38:02,419
Hi, honey bunny!

881
01:38:02,444 --> 01:38:05,530
Am I calling my
sugarpie honey bunch?

882
01:38:05,951 --> 01:38:09,246
Wait, I think I'm getting diabetes
from all the sweetness.

883
01:38:10,536 --> 01:38:12,075
What time will you be home?

884
01:38:13,847 --> 01:38:15,640
Around 6?

885
01:38:15,791 --> 01:38:17,460
Why? What's up?

886
01:38:17,558 --> 01:38:20,060
Nothing much. I just prepared
a candle light dinner.

887
01:38:21,119 --> 01:38:22,672
You cooked?

888
01:38:23,409 --> 01:38:25,286
Why, what's the occasion?

889
01:38:25,770 --> 01:38:28,136
Tonight, I celebrate
my love for you.

890
01:38:30,024 --> 01:38:33,558
My sugar level is spiking,
wait a minute!

891
01:38:34,092 --> 01:38:36,894
That’s good.
Don’t be late, okay?

892
01:38:36,925 --> 01:38:39,094
Or else, you know what happens.

893
01:38:40,916 --> 01:38:43,485
Is that a threat, or a promise?

894
01:38:43,564 --> 01:38:44,790
Love you!

895
01:38:44,815 --> 01:38:46,942
Love you too, honey bunny!

896
01:38:54,486 --> 01:38:58,198
Oh, are you smiling?
Do you miss your daddy?

897
01:39:02,078 --> 01:39:04,247
Yes, honey bunny?
We're almost ready.

898
01:39:04,272 --> 01:39:05,993
I'll just prepare for
myself and the baby.

899
01:39:06,145 --> 01:39:09,189
Seems like she heard your voice,
look at her smile-

900
01:39:10,841 --> 01:39:11,932
Hello?

901
01:39:17,323 --> 01:39:18,324
Hello?

902
01:39:18,479 --> 01:39:21,190
Let's finish what we started...

903
01:39:21,576 --> 01:39:24,400
If you don't want anything bad to
happen to your husband and child.

904
01:41:28,121 --> 01:41:29,156
Hello?

905
01:41:32,632 --> 01:41:34,447
Let's see each other tomorrow.

906
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:38,159
Same place.

907
01:42:44,843 --> 01:42:46,727
You're actually quite handsome.

908
01:42:47,039 --> 01:42:49,875
Why hide your face
behind a mask?

909
01:42:50,712 --> 01:42:52,942
I've been longing for this
to happen again.

910
01:43:03,060 --> 01:43:04,787
Are you extremely horny?

911
01:43:15,457 --> 01:43:18,676
Didn't you say we should
continue what we started?

912
01:43:18,964 --> 01:43:20,803
You like this, don't you?

913
01:43:28,620 --> 01:43:33,482
I want... to finish
what we started.

914
01:44:14,007 --> 01:44:17,761
Happy birthday, Jasmine!

915
01:44:17,786 --> 01:44:20,872
Yay!

916
01:44:22,436 --> 01:44:29,860
Okay, then! Come sit,
go ahead and eat!

917
01:44:30,114 --> 01:44:31,449
Please feel at home.

918
01:44:31,474 --> 01:44:35,144
- Happy Birthday!
- Thank you, Auntie!

919
01:44:35,937 --> 01:44:40,567
- Dude, let's eat!
- There's food, and a lot more! Eat!

920
01:44:40,592 --> 01:44:43,011
There are more chairs over there.

921
01:44:50,743 --> 01:44:53,043
Happy birthday, my child!

922
01:44:55,665 --> 01:44:58,167
Wow!

923
01:44:58,167 --> 01:44:59,419
Look at that!

924
01:44:59,419 --> 01:45:01,629
Please help yourselves!
