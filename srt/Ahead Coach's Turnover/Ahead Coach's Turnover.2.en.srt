1
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,112
(All settings are entirely fictional.)

2
00:00:13,112 --> 00:00:15,114
(All child actors were accompanied
by guardians to ensure safety.)

3
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:22,188
Now tell me.
What's your secret strategy?

4
00:00:23,122 --> 00:00:25,758
In this game,
put Kim Min Woo and Yoo Jin Ki...

5
00:00:25,758 --> 00:00:27,693
instead of
Kang Woo Seung and Park Joon Hyuk.

6
00:00:27,693 --> 00:00:30,129
Kim Min Woo and Yoo Jin Ki are backups.

7
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:31,163
Bench players.

8
00:00:31,163 --> 00:00:34,000
That's the secret strategy,
starting with Kim Min Woo and Yoo Jin Ki.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,268
How does it make sense?

10
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,837
Explain it in a way
I can actually believe.

11
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,106
Isn't winning the best explanation?

12
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,843
If you're joking again, you're done.

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,611
I'm not joking.

14
00:00:46,178 --> 00:00:47,580
It's really the right move, I swear.

15
00:00:49,415 --> 00:00:50,283
Wait!

16
00:00:51,917 --> 00:00:53,419
You can just figure it out yourself.

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,021
What?

18
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:58,724
Find the reason
it has to be those two players.

19
00:00:58,724 --> 00:01:00,159
What do you mean?

20
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,994
You wouldn't believe me
no matter what I say.

21
00:01:02,928 --> 00:01:03,763
Forget it.

22
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,198
Why am I even dealing with you?

23
00:01:06,198 --> 00:01:07,967
I'll give you a hint.

24
00:01:08,634 --> 00:01:09,602
What kind of hint?

25
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:12,805
The reason isn't on the court.

26
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:14,674
Look outside the court.

27
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:17,877
Outside?

28
00:01:29,108 --> 00:01:33,213
(A Head Coach's Turnover)

29
00:01:36,295 --> 00:01:37,236
More, more, more!

30
00:01:37,238 --> 00:01:39,774
(Episode 2)

31
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,000
Endure it.

32
00:01:41,467 --> 00:01:42,435
Maeng Gong, you're here.

33
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:57,383
I'll report the lineup to central.

34
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:58,751
Same as always today?

35
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:02,254
You say that like it's a given?

36
00:02:02,254 --> 00:02:03,189
Sorry?

37
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,691
We've never switched things up.

38
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:20,773
- Kang Woo Seung
- Yes, coach.

39
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:22,275
- Park Joon Hyuk
- Yes, coach.

40
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,945
Do you think it's a given
that you'll always start?

41
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:26,879
Sorry?

42
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,648
Of course not.

43
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,152
Kim Min Woo and Yoo Jin Ki.

44
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:34,186
- Yes, coach.
- Yes, coach.

45
00:02:35,554 --> 00:02:36,622
You two are in the starting lineup.

46
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:40,359
Me?

47
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:41,861
Thanks, coach.

48
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,763
I'll do my best.

49
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:46,098
Now hurry up and get ready!

50
00:02:54,206 --> 00:02:55,641
(Yoo Jin Ki, Kim Min Woo)

51
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:07,420
The game between Big Pandas and Eight
starts with the tip-off.

52
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:09,544
Good one! Now defense.

53
00:03:09,546 --> 00:03:11,414
(Coach Woo Ji Won)

54
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:17,063
Kim Min Woo is pressing Lee Seung Ho
right from the start.

55
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:20,833
Offense foul on Lee Seung Ho.

56
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:24,170
Kim Min Woo is performing
solid defense today.

57
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,772
He's been known for defense
since his college days.

58
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:30,009
Kim Min Woo!

59
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,910
(Big Pandas vs Eight)
(1st quarter)

60
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:46,926
Offense two.

61
00:03:50,796 --> 00:03:52,498
Left side.

62
00:04:00,339 --> 00:04:03,242
Rebound!

63
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:04,944
Hey, nice!

64
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,648
Yoo Jin Ki grabs the rebound.

65
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:11,117
He fights hard.

66
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:14,654
Yoo Jin Ki!

67
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,692
(4th quarter)

68
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:34,473
Blocked by Yoo Jin Ki.

69
00:04:34,473 --> 00:04:35,942
What a clean block!

70
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:39,278
Since when was he this good?

71
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:40,413
Awesome!

72
00:04:43,462 --> 00:04:45,898
(Big Pandas vs Eight)

73
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,804
Wow, Maeng Gong.

74
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,839
What happened to always starting
the same five players?

75
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,609
Kim Min Woo and Yoo Jin Ki.
They're good today.

76
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,310
They've always been good.

77
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,179
Let's have a fun fight in the playoffs.

78
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:14,880
Alright, you come up and meet us.

79
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,516
I don't want Just
to make the playoffs either.

80
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:18,884
Pulling in the same direction.

81
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,386
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

82
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,790
Hey,

83
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,993
Look at Kim Min Woo's defense!

84
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,594
I really like this player, you know.

85
00:05:28,794 --> 00:05:31,697
I love the way Yoo Jin Ki blocks balls.

86
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:34,667
Um, hey...

87
00:05:35,701 --> 00:05:36,736
I'm here.

88
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:39,538
Why're you standing like that?

89
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,040
True that.

90
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:44,577
Are you a backup now?
Why're you waiting like that?

91
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,813
I didn't want to interrupt you.

92
00:05:58,457 --> 00:06:00,993
Maeng Jae Hee, can I take a seat?

93
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,462
Sit if you want.

94
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,270
You guys won today, right?

95
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:14,407
Yes, we did win.

96
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:18,844
You should've seen
how happy she was earlier.

97
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,446
Really?

98
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:21,614
Mom, please!

99
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,883
Why? You were so happy...

100
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,017
about your dad's team won!

101
00:06:26,485 --> 00:06:27,486
That's just...

102
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:31,290
because it was the first win
against Eight all season.

103
00:06:31,857 --> 00:06:33,726
I was hoping you'd finally win today.

104
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,429
I'm glad your team won.

105
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,330
You are?

106
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,130
Yes.

107
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,600
People yell at you less when you win.

108
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:44,370
Honestly, I'm really happy.

109
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,038
My sweetheart,

110
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:47,640
you really like it?

111
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:48,774
Yes!

112
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:52,445
I feel the same.

113
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,318
Chess scores...

114
00:07:02,154 --> 00:07:03,389
Your strategy's pretty good.

115
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:06,859
If this keeps up,
you'll take down Bluebee.

116
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,895
I've shown all my cards now.

117
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,897
Let's see your cards now.

118
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,500
What's your plan to beat the top team?

119
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,569
Hey, about Chess...

120
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:17,536
Chess?

121
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,208
Oh, Chess!

122
00:07:22,808 --> 00:07:24,343
- Hey, coach.
- Hi.

123
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:27,747
You look good today.

124
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,582
I just got a call from my family.

125
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,751
They just arrived at the airport.

126
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:33,653
Really?

127
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,489
Then you'd go.

128
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:37,556
- Really?
- Sure.

129
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:40,192
You're off training today, specially.

130
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:43,195
Go and have a happy time with family.

131
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:44,764
For real?

132
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,732
I'm gonna head out right now then.

133
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:47,733
Okay.

134
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,969
Good luck, Chess!

135
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,405
- Coach.
- Huh?

136
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:54,140
Is that your son?

137
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:56,208
Him?

138
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:59,245
Hey, why do you look so annoyed?

139
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,213
Being told I look like you
isn't a compliment.

140
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:03,783
Do you know how pretty my daughter is?

141
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,117
Isn't she more like her mom?

142
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:06,218
No, she totally looks like me!

143
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:07,853
Hey, whatever.

144
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:09,522
Take a seat and show me your secret.

145
00:08:12,858 --> 00:08:13,993
- Hey, Maeng Gong.
- Yeah?

146
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:15,561
Isn't Chess...

147
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,596
dealing with homesickness?

148
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:20,232
How did you know that?

149
00:08:20,232 --> 00:08:22,068
Chess posted about it on social media.

150
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:24,837
- Said he wanted to go home.
- What?

151
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:28,107
So I thought boosting Chess's morale
was the key strategy.

152
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:30,443
Wow, everyone knew except me.

153
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,614
You should've paid more attention
to your players.

154
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:36,916
Stop dodging the real issue.

155
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,118
You mean Kang Woo Seung
and Park Joon Hyuk?

156
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,454
If you'd figured out what was going on
between them earlier...

157
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,023
you could've stopped them
from fighting on the court.

158
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:44,857
So...

159
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,327
- I need your help.
- For what?

160
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:52,198
I need to get them to make up.

161
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,132
How should I handle them?

162
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,168
No way. Just don't let them play together.

163
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:57,236
Hey!

164
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,905
They're both starters.
What nonsense is that?

165
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:01,641
They should make up.

166
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,809
They fight during games.
How's it even possible?

167
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:04,744
Well...

168
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:08,381
You said you found out
Chess's situation from social media.

169
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,216
Then check out
Park Joon Hyuk's account too.

170
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,651
There might be something in there.

171
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,185
Why should I care his posts?

172
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:15,588
Why're you reacting like that?

173
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,657
You ignore me and just say what you want!

174
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:18,557
I don't do that!

175
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:19,425
Anyway, I don't want to do that.

176
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,527
If you want them to make up,
do it yourself.

177
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:23,029
Hey!

178
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:23,963
Where're you going?

179
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,865
Hey, Go Hwa Jin.

180
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:26,799
Go Hwa Jin!

181
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,168
Hey, Go Hwa Jin!

182
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:30,436
Wait, I just...

183
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:31,470
Why're you following me?

184
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,239
I wasn't...

185
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,542
ignoring you.

186
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,345
Like you said,
if they don't like playing together,

187
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:43,316
I'll adjust their playing time...

188
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:44,884
and split them up in the lineup.

189
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,253
But that's a worst-case option.

190
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,489
The priority is
fixing their relationship, right?

191
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,125
- Not sure.
- If they don't make up...

192
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:56,162
Chess won't be able to score
reliably either.

193
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:57,330
Maybe.

194
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,865
You can make an effort first.

195
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,635
If it doesn't work out,

196
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,706
then you'll do what you said.

197
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,575
- Separately?
- Yeah, just like you said.

198
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:10,376
Separately.

199
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,848
But I don't think there's anything
I can help with.

200
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,751
There's something you can do.

201
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:20,152
Teach...

202
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,490
me how to do that.

203
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,791
- You mean what?
- Umm...

204
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,626
What?

205
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,461
S...ocial media.

206
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,067
This is my account.

207
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,503
Why do you keep liking random posts?

208
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,639
My players are not just anyone!

209
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:41,741
Okay, stop liking.

210
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,777
Do you really think
this'll tell you why they fought?

211
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,013
Why're you acting like that? Still upset?

212
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,547
I'm not upset.

213
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:51,417
Alright, no more liking.

214
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,553
I should've paid more attention
to the players.

215
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,355
Now everything's blowing up.

216
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:01,827
You can't do it all yourself.

217
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,864
Just coming up with strategies
is hard enough.

218
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:07,366
Look at you.

219
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,303
Are you really the same Go Hwa Jin
who posted hate comments?

220
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:11,971
Huh?

221
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:16,609
Why won't the kids say anything?

222
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,478
When Mom asks me
why I fought with my brother...

223
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,113
I don't answer sometimes.

224
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,482
- Why not?
- I just don't want to say.

225
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:24,717
Why don't you want to?

226
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:28,220
There are lots of reasons.

227
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,956
Like, when I know I was wrong
but don't want to admit it.

228
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:33,726
So how did you make up
with your brother then?

229
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,127
- Make up?
- Yes.

230
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,096
My brother usually says sorry first.

231
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,200
Just like I expected.

232
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,136
You're so stubborn!

233
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:46,606
Big Pandas has two of those.

234
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:47,974
Can you really get them to make up?

235
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,009
Well...

236
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,846
I've got to get them to make up
before the next match.

237
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,715
Isn't it up...

238
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,783
to their mind?

239
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:00,853
Yeah, but I can't just sit back
and do nothing.

240
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,388
I've got to try, at least.

241
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,056
The thing you really worried about is...

242
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,659
whether it's okay to put them
on the court together.

243
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:07,627
Right?

244
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:09,028
Exactly.

245
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,664
Only if they get along on the court...

246
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,666
then we can win the next game.

247
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,935
How about asking them something
to check that?

248
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,939
If the answer's positive,
they play together.

249
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,675
If not, they'll play separately.

250
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:27,613
Ask a question?

251
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:29,682
Yes.

252
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:39,992
Whether you make up or keep fighting,
that's on you.

253
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,494
But,

254
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,063
not on the court.

255
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:46,999
I won't let you guys play for a while.

256
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:47,900
Maeng Gong.

257
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,235
I really want to be on the court.

258
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:50,970
Hey, do you even know
how important the next game is?

259
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,606
I can't take that risk.

260
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,807
I can't let you both play.

261
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,377
What if we don't fight?

262
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:00,079
We promise.

263
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,014
We'll make sure you
have nothing to worry about.

264
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,350
Can I trust you two?

265
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,885
I'm still uneasy.

266
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,656
I have just three questions
for both of you.

267
00:13:16,102 --> 00:13:17,536
(1 Best game, 2 Worst game)

268
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:18,539
(3 This season's goal)

269
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,537
I'll give you ten minutes from now.

270
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:26,973
Answer these questions.

271
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,177
If we just write them down,
we can play the next game?

272
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:32,111
That's right.

273
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,279
But,

274
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,014
This isn't about your own answers.

275
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,716
Park Joon Hyuk'll write
Kang Woo Seung's answer.

276
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:38,918
And Kang Woo Seung'll write
Park Joon Hyuk's answer.

277
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:40,453
What?

278
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:42,755
Coach.

279
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,890
Whether you play or not...

280
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,726
depends on your understanding
of each other.

281
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,422
(1 Best game)

282
00:14:16,424 --> 00:14:18,726
(A game against Bluebee, last Christmas)

283
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,693
How did he know that?

284
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,897
Why? Was it wrong?

285
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:26,866
Nope.

286
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,136
How could you...

287
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:31,671
On this day...

288
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:33,873
you said it was the first time scoring
over 20 in the pro league.

289
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,831
Yours is the same day, right?

290
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:01,100
Because it was the day
you had the most assists.

291
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,036
Now that I think about it,

292
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,939
I owe that record to you.

293
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:07,940
Me?

294
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,443
You turned all my passes
into goals that day.

295
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:18,150
The worst game is...

296
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:31,397
(Round 6 Flash)

297
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:34,900
Park Joon Hyuk.

298
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:39,071
You think I'm skipping you on purpose?

299
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,478
Honestly, I'm lost too.

300
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,613
How things got this bad between us?

301
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,455
From day one on the Big Pandas,

302
00:15:57,857 --> 00:15:59,792
I wanted to work well with you.

303
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:05,264
I believed that syncing with a skilled PG

304
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,168
would make me a better player.

305
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,574
I didn't mean to freeze you out.

306
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,677
I couldn't.

307
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:21,280
I kept messing up in the 4th
with those crucial turnovers,

308
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,381
and we kept losing.

309
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,051
Now every time I'm on the court,

310
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:27,186
all I can think is 'Don't turn it over.'

311
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,222
I can't even see
the wide-open chances, neither.

312
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:37,129
Park Joon Hyuk.

313
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,633
Whatever I did to you
let's just leave it behind.

314
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,302
I'll do the same.

315
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,246
Stop it!
Don't get all weird on me now.

316
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:56,048
Yeah, so...
Well, you know.

317
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:58,351
We've got one goal this season.

318
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,035
Let's hit the court.

319
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:18,104
Alright.

320
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:19,438
Let't hit it.

321
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:32,704
(Goal of the Season)
(Championship)

322
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:38,391
Big Pandas takes it 91

323
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,626
to 89 over Bluebee!

324
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,561
They've always struggled

325
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,330
with turnovers in tight matchups,

326
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,566
but they had just one
in the entire fourth quarter today.

327
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,902
Absolutely.
This was a win built on teamwork.

328
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,571
They're turning into one
seriously tight-knit squad.

329
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,347
Big Pandas and Just are now tied
in the standings.

330
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:03,049
Yep, that means

331
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:06,185
the Big Pandas absolutely has to win
their final regular season game.

332
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:09,322
Now's the time for that glue-like bond
—just like we saw earlier.

333
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,123
That's right.
As you mentioned,

334
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,526
Just and Big Pandas,

335
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:17,029
they are set to face off in the final game
of the regular season.

336
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,965
Only one team can win the game,

337
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:21,601
and that team punches their ticket
to the playoffs.

338
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,813
You're here!

339
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:34,714
You're early!

340
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:37,516
Ribeye?

341
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:40,453
Didn't know what you'd like,
so I grabbed a mix.

342
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,387
Eat up!

343
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,562
You've got a stalker, don't you?

344
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:53,566
A stalker?

345
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:58,137
You?

346
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:02,908
It's here. Let's go.

347
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,723
Damn, this meat looks legit!

348
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:20,393
Hey, hey, here it is.

349
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:25,097
You're always sucking on candy,
no wonder you look like a twig!

350
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,033
Eat up, you should!

351
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:29,168
Ugh, why'd you invite me over?
We could've just eaten out.

352
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,938
We've only got one game left,

353
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:34,573
so let's be real for a sec.

354
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:36,242
For what?

355
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,213
You.

356
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:45,484
Do your parents even know?

357
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,053
That you're chasing after me
instead of hitting the books?

358
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:50,423
I'm keeping up with my studies,

359
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,392
and my parents are out in the other city
for their business.

360
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,528
Wow, senior year and
you're still chill as ever?

361
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:57,229
By the way,

362
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,034
what's up with the hospital visits?
Is someone not well?

363
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:04,870
It's my brother.

364
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:07,340
How bad?

365
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:11,277
He's mostly recovered physically,
but he just won't say a word.

366
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:14,413
Look at you, handling senior year and
nursing your brother?

367
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:16,682
That's pretty impressive.

368
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,755
Having someone sick in the family,

369
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,056
it is hard.

370
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:25,992
It hurts.

371
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:29,595
I know.

372
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:32,898
Have some.

373
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,106
What makes basketball special to you?

374
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:41,507
Basketball?

375
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,278
Cause I'm good at it.

376
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:47,146
Ugh, don't start showing off or anything.

377
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:48,347
Jeez!

378
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:53,319
Do I need a reason to like it?

379
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:55,388
I

380
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:58,724
started playing back in

381
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:01,193
fourth grade, so

382
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:05,097
Including my years as a coach,
it's been almost...

383
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,001
35 years.

384
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:14,607
Basketball's been by my side
the whole way.

385
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,710
He, I wouldn't have gone all the way
if I didn't like it.

386
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,345
If you didn't,
I would've quit a long time ago.

387
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,015
Okay, what makes you love the game?

388
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:23,849
Me?

389
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:27,453
I don't like basketball.

390
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,889
You don't?
But you're way too invested for that.

391
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:31,424
Ahh, I'm full.

392
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:34,460
Already?

393
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,928
You, wait.

394
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,831
Hang on, I'll wrap this up for you.

395
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:40,466
Take it home and eat it, got it?

396
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,301
I'm keeping it warm in this thermos,

397
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,502
so you better eat it right away.

398
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:50,343
Karina, a Jung Hyup's ideal type?

399
00:21:50,343 --> 00:21:51,243
Is she a foreigner?

400
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,779
Ugh, this is giving me a headache.

401
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,281
The basketball shoes
Woo Seung has been wearing

402
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:57,016
since middle school got discontinued.

403
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:58,484
Where can I find a pair?

404
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:00,319
Min Woo's dream car is a Porsche.

405
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,221
Too bad
his salary doesn't even come close.

406
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,256
Well, dream big.

407
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:08,327
Man, he's such a picky eater.

408
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:10,262
So much work.

409
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,000
This stuff wasn't cheap, he'll never know.

410
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:20,106
(Player of the Year)
(Maeng Gong)

411
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:25,645
Hey, look at this.
Here goes the king piece.

412
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,115
Whoa, didn't think it'd fit!

413
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,718
I loaded it up,

414
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,720
so make sure you eat well, okay?

415
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:40,126
- That was great, thanks.
- Hey, take this with you.

416
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:44,330
Strawberry?

417
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,331
Yeah.

418
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:47,433
Don't you like it?

419
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:48,467
Huh?

420
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:51,337
I've seen you with
those strawberry candies all the time.

421
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:53,806
You said I never pay attention, right?

422
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:55,908
Ugh, who said I wanted you to care?

423
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,811
These are high-end,
from the department store.

424
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:00,546
Don't waste a single one—eat them all.

425
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:02,782
I'm heading out.

426
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:05,351
Yeah, take care.
And...

427
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:07,987
let's talk things over at the team
tomorrow.

428
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:10,756
- Got it.
- Alright.

429
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:15,661
Take care.

430
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,489
Having someone sick in the family,

431
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:44,757
it is hard.

432
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:46,926
It hurts.

433
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:50,329
I know.

434
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:05,978
You were here!

435
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,114
Why are you still awake?

436
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:14,787
Here... want to try some strawberries?

437
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:18,591
I was at Coach Maeng Gong's place earlier.

438
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:24,363
He gave me some ribeye and stuffs
and told me to eat it with you.

439
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:37,176
What am I doing?

440
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,247
I don't even know what I want.

441
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:45,217
When I first found out
what Park Joon Hyuk did to you,

442
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:48,087
I wanted to give it back.

443
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:52,358
I sent Maeng Gong an email
told him not to pick that jerk,

444
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:54,660
but he didn't even respond.

445
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,332
Park Joon Hyuk never even said
sorry to you.

446
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:03,703
He's just out there like he did nothing.
I blamed Maeng Gong for that.

447
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,875
It felt like Maeng Gong erased
what Park Joon Hyuk did

448
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,111
on his own.

449
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:17,617
That's why I got close to him.

450
00:25:19,986 --> 00:25:20,920
While I stayed close,

451
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,222
I made it look like he was fixing games.

452
00:25:24,724 --> 00:25:26,959
I planned to use it to threaten
him and ark Joon Hyuk

453
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,097
I really wanted to give it back.

454
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,736
If I just left some hating comments,

455
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,805
I thought it may make me feel better.

456
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,045
Maeng Gong, that guy, right?

457
00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:53,052
He always yells and swears at the players.

458
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:57,123
but when talking to me, he always says,
'my kids this, my kids that.'

459
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,094
You know, Maeng Gong,

460
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:06,098
He's more dedicated than I thought.

461
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:09,268
And a good dad.

462
00:26:10,703 --> 00:26:11,871
And he means every word.

463
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:16,108
Almost stupidly so.

464
00:26:17,677 --> 00:26:19,712
Even though I was just some online hater

465
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:22,782
He kept treating me kindly.

466
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,689
I thought I had it all figured out,

467
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:33,326
but turns out I didn't know anything.

468
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:36,762
Woo Jin.

469
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:39,432
What should I do now?

470
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:50,943
Hwa Jin.

471
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:54,947
Woo Jin.

472
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:02,054
You don't have to carry that for me.

473
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:08,227
Woo Jin.

474
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:16,402
Woo Jin.

475
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:20,206
Woo Jin, I am sorry.

476
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,009
I am sorry, it is all because of me.

477
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:41,594
Huh, Jung Hyup.

478
00:27:41,594 --> 00:27:44,297
Didn't you say you're on a diet?
And now you're eating late-night pizza?

479
00:27:45,765 --> 00:27:47,366
Where's it from though?

480
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:48,334
Looks damn good.

481
00:27:49,568 --> 00:27:51,270
Jae Hee likes pizza, too.

482
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:55,107
Hey. You're here.

483
00:27:56,242 --> 00:27:57,743
The strawberries were so sweet.

484
00:27:57,743 --> 00:27:58,978
I had them with my brother.

485
00:27:58,978 --> 00:28:01,414
You did? Nice.

486
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:05,184
Hey, you little bastard!

487
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,452
Jeez, jeez! You scared me!

488
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:08,521
What the heck?

489
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:09,922
Well,

490
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:13,559
there's a channel that just edits together
every time you flip out on the court.

491
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:16,128
It's called 'Angry Maeng.'

492
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:17,663
Angry Maeng?

493
00:28:19,265 --> 00:28:21,334
You're the final secret weapon
for the win.

494
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:24,136
Two wins in a row,
and now we've got home-court advantage.

495
00:28:24,971 --> 00:28:25,972
This is ours to take.

496
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,641
As long as
you don't lose your temper like this...

497
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,817
Do you think Jae Hee saw this?

498
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,486
Probably, right?

499
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,655
One million views?

500
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:49,261
People really love watching
someone mess up, huh.

501
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:50,496
Damn...

502
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,264
Then stop messing up.

503
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:56,802
You said your daughter smiled
when you won, right?

504
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,472
Man, stay sharp.

505
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:02,408
You remember how it always goes with Just?

506
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:07,680
Kang Woo Seung, check the damn clock!

507
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,781
What are you doing out there?

508
00:29:17,023 --> 00:29:18,424
Hey, you idiot!

509
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:20,793
An airball in the 4th?
That's not how pros play!

510
00:29:23,796 --> 00:29:24,930
Looks like I'm the problem.

511
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:26,899
I am.

512
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,880
I've been thinking why you're always mad.

513
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:44,817
And I realized that
you're always on the court.

514
00:29:45,184 --> 00:29:46,185
Not outside of it.

515
00:29:48,354 --> 00:29:49,689
Maybe that's the issue.

516
00:29:49,689 --> 00:29:51,691
You, as a coach, don't focus on coaching,

517
00:29:53,993 --> 00:29:56,295
but you are emotionally too tied
to the players on the court,

518
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,265
which ends up
dragging the whole team down.

519
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,868
After that ridiculous airball
in the Red Z match,

520
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:04,503
Kang Woo Seung totally lost his mind.

521
00:30:06,072 --> 00:30:08,574
I thought he needed to be benched.

522
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,180
Coach Maeng.

523
00:30:17,617 --> 00:30:19,852
When you said you knew what it's like

524
00:30:21,287 --> 00:30:23,055
to have someone sick in the family,

525
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:26,626
that meant a lot to me.

526
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:37,336
Just like you got what I was feeling,

527
00:30:38,704 --> 00:30:41,040
I think you can do the same
for your players.

528
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:44,844
A coach who takes time to think about

529
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:46,979
what a player really needs out there

530
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:55,588
That's what I think a good coach is.

531
00:30:57,223 --> 00:30:59,892
A coach thinks with the player...

532
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:09,101
What did Woo Seung need the most
back then?

533
00:31:10,503 --> 00:31:11,704
To be benched?

534
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:14,206
It was my conclusion.

535
00:31:17,944 --> 00:31:19,612
You find your own conclusion.

536
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:07,259
Hey.

537
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,761
Are you?

538
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,901
Damn, I knew it!

539
00:32:16,636 --> 00:32:17,703
A brother of Go Woo Jin.

540
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:22,275
What now, huh?

541
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:24,176
Back to screw me over again, huh?

542
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:28,648
That's what you're afraid of?

543
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:30,616
Noted.

544
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:33,686
Look.

545
00:32:33,686 --> 00:32:34,687
Do you have any idea

546
00:32:34,687 --> 00:32:37,556
how much trouble I had to deal with
because you,

547
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,159
ran around talking shits
to teams and coaches before the draft?

548
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:41,661
Talking shits?

549
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:45,164
Woo Jin was doing knee rehab
for six months because of you.

550
00:32:45,164 --> 00:32:46,599
Is it because of me?

551
00:32:47,934 --> 00:32:50,102
He got on my nerves.
He tried to teach his senior basketball.

552
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:54,707
So I shut him up. Got a problem?

553
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:01,714
That's it, alright?

554
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:06,585
We're done here!

555
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,824
Ugh, damn it.

556
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:16,562
You!

557
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:34,480
We'll take our leave.

558
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:37,650
We ask that this doesn't happen again.

559
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:38,951
Sure, we apologize.

560
00:33:43,055 --> 00:33:44,256
What, again?

561
00:33:44,991 --> 00:33:46,726
- Hit me again, now?
- This jerk is...

562
00:33:46,726 --> 00:33:48,094
No, no, no.

563
00:33:48,094 --> 00:33:49,895
Park Joon Hyuk, stop it.

564
00:33:49,895 --> 00:33:51,197
You, too, kid.

565
00:33:51,197 --> 00:33:53,766
Yeah, please stop it from now on!

566
00:33:53,766 --> 00:33:54,767
This jerk is...

567
00:33:56,002 --> 00:33:58,804
You really have no idea what you did, huh?

568
00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:00,473
Ugh, it hurts, shit!

569
00:34:01,073 --> 00:34:02,208
Look.

570
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:03,209
You little shit!

571
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:04,310
No, don't.

572
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,112
How long do I have to take this from you?

573
00:34:06,112 --> 00:34:07,079
Woo Jin!

574
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,683
He was traumatized and
couldn't speak a single word for a year.

575
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:14,687
What? Any single word?

576
00:34:15,855 --> 00:34:17,423
I don't know how long it takes.

577
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:19,725
So you're not done yet.

578
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,961
Just like my brother did.

579
00:34:31,304 --> 00:34:32,605
Hey,

580
00:34:32,605 --> 00:34:33,806
come on.

581
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,653
Is that why your brother's like that?
Because of Park Joon Hyuk?

582
00:34:49,555 --> 00:34:50,923
Kick him off the team.

583
00:34:51,724 --> 00:34:52,758
Kicking him off?

584
00:34:55,628 --> 00:34:57,797
Think about
why I've always stuck around you.

585
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:02,068
Wasn't it because
you wanted to give him a break?

586
00:35:05,171 --> 00:35:07,173
Because it was him
who ruined my brother's life.

587
00:35:08,074 --> 00:35:10,776
He couldn't talk,
just laid up in a hospital bed

588
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:12,612
while Park Joon Hyuk kept playing
like nothing happened.

589
00:35:14,146 --> 00:35:15,548
You chose him.

590
00:35:16,549 --> 00:35:18,417
Even though I told you
exactly what kind of person he was.

591
00:35:21,354 --> 00:35:22,355
You...

592
00:35:22,355 --> 00:35:23,789
I told the team over and over,

593
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:26,258
that he wasn't right for this team!

594
00:35:29,195 --> 00:35:30,696
And yet, you even did an interview,

595
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:33,733
saying that talent was all that mattered.

596
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,768
Shaping him into a better player?

597
00:35:37,436 --> 00:35:39,171
He's already apologized and
taken responsibility

598
00:35:39,171 --> 00:35:41,474
for what happened in the past.

599
00:35:41,474 --> 00:35:42,808
That wasn't an apology.

600
00:35:45,011 --> 00:35:46,912
Throwing money through someone else?
You call that an apology?

601
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:50,583
Wait, no...

602
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:52,818
Joon Hyuk said he apologized.

603
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,387
If Park Joon Hyuk isn't off the team
by tomorrow,

604
00:35:55,288 --> 00:35:56,756
I expose the match-fixing.

605
00:35:59,058 --> 00:36:02,461
Starting with Kim Min Woo, Yoo Jin Ki,
Kim Min Jae, Choi Jung Hyup, and Chess.

606
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:03,596
No change, right?

607
00:36:03,596 --> 00:36:05,398
Nope. Sticking with the plan.

608
00:36:05,865 --> 00:36:07,033
No one can tell,

609
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:10,102
if those texts were with internet haters

610
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:13,105
or a match-fixing broker.

611
00:36:13,105 --> 00:36:14,273
You...

612
00:36:14,273 --> 00:36:17,276
Benching your starters in a key game and
starting the subs?

613
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:20,479
It could look like you tried to
lose on purpose but failed.

614
00:36:21,547 --> 00:36:22,548
Couldn't it?

615
00:36:26,819 --> 00:36:28,354
Is this why you did all this?

616
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:32,458
Just because I picked Joon Hyuk?

617
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:33,926
Go Woo Jin, that idiot,

618
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,229
dreamed of becoming a player like you.

619
00:36:39,332 --> 00:36:42,034
But you still handed that guy a chance,
knowing what he did.

620
00:36:43,736 --> 00:36:44,804
He...

621
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:08,544
I'd like to let you know about
a school violence from Park Joon Hyuk.

622
00:37:08,546 --> 00:37:11,315
Park Joon Hyuk, a rookie draft candidate,
facing allegations of school violence.

623
00:37:20,506 --> 00:37:21,907
School violence from Tae Gang University.

624
00:37:25,111 --> 00:37:26,345
Was it you, Hwa Jin?

625
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,048
Who sent this article?

626
00:37:54,307 --> 00:37:57,143
Excuse me,
I'm looking for patient Go Woo Jin's room.

627
00:37:57,143 --> 00:37:58,477
- A patient Go Woo Jin?
- Yes.

628
00:38:00,613 --> 00:38:02,148
He's in Room 708, just up ahead.

629
00:38:02,148 --> 00:38:03,649
- In room 708, thank you.
- Sure.

630
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:09,888
(Go Woo Jin)

631
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:58,304
(Hospital)

632
00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:00,573
So close...

633
00:39:01,407 --> 00:39:02,908
We won!

634
00:39:04,543 --> 00:39:05,611
What happened to your hand?

635
00:39:06,612 --> 00:39:09,148
I slipped on the stairs. It's nothing.

636
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:11,584
Who did you fight with?

637
00:39:12,151 --> 00:39:13,419
That's not what happened.

638
00:39:18,658 --> 00:39:19,592
What?

639
00:39:22,061 --> 00:39:23,095
Are you out of your mind?

640
00:39:24,096 --> 00:39:25,264
You brought him here?

641
00:39:27,466 --> 00:39:28,634
I came to apologize.

642
00:39:30,636 --> 00:39:32,271
Is that what an apology is to you?

643
00:39:42,682 --> 00:39:43,616
Park Joon Hyuk.

644
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:06,839
Go Woo Jin

645
00:40:08,608 --> 00:40:09,542
I'm sorry.

646
00:40:14,313 --> 00:40:16,082
I just hated being compared to you.

647
00:40:18,618 --> 00:40:20,286
Every time the coach yelled at me, like,

648
00:40:20,286 --> 00:40:22,455
"Even freshman Go Woo Jin can do it.
Why can't you?"

649
00:40:23,656 --> 00:40:24,724
I was so angry.

650
00:40:27,994 --> 00:40:30,763
I felt like you made my flaws
stand out even more.

651
00:40:43,976 --> 00:40:44,844
Woo Jin.

652
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,686
I took it out on you,

653
00:40:53,686 --> 00:40:54,787
bullied you for no reason.

654
00:40:59,091 --> 00:41:00,359
That was wrong.

655
00:41:00,926 --> 00:41:01,994
I'm really sorry.

656
00:41:23,716 --> 00:41:24,717
Hwa Jin.

657
00:41:29,722 --> 00:41:31,223
Would it be okay if I forgive him?

658
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,294
Hey...

659
00:42:17,203 --> 00:42:18,537
Remember the Flash game?

660
00:42:20,606 --> 00:42:22,475
When I said you weren't playing
like a team...

661
00:42:23,476 --> 00:42:24,577
I was wrong.

662
00:42:25,511 --> 00:42:28,014
You all gave it your best
in your own roles...

663
00:42:28,014 --> 00:42:30,016
but I'm the one who didn't do mine
as your coach.

664
00:42:31,384 --> 00:42:34,387
Today, I'll step up and
do my part out there on the court.

665
00:42:35,755 --> 00:42:36,455
Let's...

666
00:42:37,323 --> 00:42:38,257
fight together.

667
00:42:38,724 --> 00:42:39,959
Let's set this place on fire.

668
00:42:41,527 --> 00:42:42,662
Let's win this!

669
00:42:42,962 --> 00:42:43,896
Yeah.

670
00:42:44,363 --> 00:42:45,631
Let's win.

671
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:48,567
Let's win and make it to the playoffs.

672
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:50,703
Let's go!

673
00:42:50,703 --> 00:42:51,737
We got this!

674
00:42:52,805 --> 00:42:54,206
Alright. One, two, three.

Welcome, ladies and gentlemen
and fans of the Big Pandas!

It's the Big Pandas versus Just!

And right now, here come the star players
of the Big Pandas, taking the court!

682
00:43:23,703 --> 00:43:25,137
And last but not least...

683
00:43:25,137 --> 00:43:29,075
the man leading the charge tonight,
our captain.

684
00:43:29,075 --> 00:43:34,046
The coach of the Big Pandas.
Maeng Gong!

685
00:43:34,046 --> 00:43:35,715
- Big Back Stabbers!
- Get out of here!

686
00:43:35,715 --> 00:43:37,650

Kim Min Woo's relentless defense,

700
00:44:18,891 --> 00:44:21,160
and he forces the turnover!

all the way to the end!

The Big Pandas are showing
great focus tonight.

703
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:12,211
Blocked!

704
00:45:12,211 --> 00:45:13,913
It's a clean rejection.

705
00:45:13,913 --> 00:45:15,581
He got completely stuffed!

706
00:45:15,581 --> 00:45:18,184
When he hesitates to shoot,
the offense loses its rhythm.

that shot just now?

Yeah, he got blocked on
the last possession.

715

Maybe it's still on his mind.

716
00:46:40,132 --> 00:46:41,634

00:47:16,102 --> 00:47:18,471
Do you know
why I keep giving you chances?

724
00:47:21,407 --> 00:47:22,675
Because I love your passes.

725
00:47:24,243 --> 00:47:27,713
Sometimes I wish we were born in the
same era so I could play with you.

726
00:47:29,081 --> 00:47:30,383
Woo Seung, I love your passes.

727
00:47:32,118 --> 00:47:32,952
But...

728
00:47:33,486 --> 00:47:34,887
why play only half a game?

729
00:47:36,722 --> 00:47:39,025
Are you really okay with
being called a guard...

730
00:47:39,025 --> 00:47:40,192
who can't shoot?

731
00:47:41,527 --> 00:47:43,262
If you don't want to be called incomplete,

732
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:46,232
then show them.

733
00:47:48,034 --> 00:47:49,669
Take the shot with confidence.

734
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:51,904
I believe in you.

735
00:47:55,274 --> 00:47:57,043
Yes, Coach.

736
00:47:58,170 --> 00:47:59,905
(Big Pandas vs. Just)
(Fourth Quarter)

737
00:48:16,996 --> 00:48:18,831
Kang Woo Seung is right on target!

738
00:48:18,831 --> 00:48:19,966
Kang Woo Seung...

739
00:48:19,966 --> 00:48:22,568
nails the buzzer-beater
in a clutch moment!

740
00:48:22,568 --> 00:48:25,371
And with that, the Big Pandas defeat Just.

741
00:48:25,371 --> 00:48:27,473
Clinch the 6th seed in the playoffs!

742
00:49:07,914 --> 00:49:13,586
(Big Pandas vs. Just)

743
00:49:15,087 --> 00:49:16,255
Ugh, my back...

744
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:19,292
Congratulations!

745
00:49:20,092 --> 00:49:21,627
What magic did you pull off today?

746
00:49:22,361 --> 00:49:24,130
It was the perfect day to win, right?

747
00:49:24,797 --> 00:49:25,831
Thank you.

748
00:49:25,831 --> 00:49:27,433
Best of luck in the playoffs.

749
00:49:27,433 --> 00:49:28,935
Thanks. You did great too, Coach Eun.

750
00:49:28,935 --> 00:49:29,869
Thanks.

751
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:37,849
(Big Pandas)

752
00:49:37,971 --> 00:49:41,741
(At Cheongdae Hospital)

753
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:48,387
Honey.

754
00:49:48,387 --> 00:49:49,388
Jae Hee!

755
00:49:49,755 --> 00:49:50,990
It's Dad. I'm here.

756
00:49:52,825 --> 00:49:53,893
Where did they go?

757
00:49:55,661 --> 00:49:56,929
Maybe out for treatment?

758
00:50:00,733 --> 00:50:02,234
One, two, three.

759
00:50:02,234 --> 00:50:04,971
Happy victory to you.

760
00:50:04,971 --> 00:50:07,807
Happy victory to you.

761
00:50:07,807 --> 00:50:11,644
Dear Coach Maeng,

762
00:50:11,644 --> 00:50:14,814
Happy victory to you!

763
00:50:17,516 --> 00:50:19,552
Dad, congrats
on making it to the playoffs...

764
00:50:19,552 --> 00:50:21,654
for the first time as Big Pandas' coach!

765
00:50:22,321 --> 00:50:23,456
Coach Maeng,

766
00:50:24,624 --> 00:50:26,092
- I love you.
- We love you.

767
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,028
Honey.

768
00:50:30,296 --> 00:50:31,731
Jae Hee. Thank you.

769
00:50:35,735 --> 00:50:37,169
Wait, are these...electric?

770
00:50:37,637 --> 00:50:39,305
They don't blow out.
Sit down, quick.

771
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:42,041
Sit here.

772
00:50:44,677 --> 00:50:45,811
Even Panda is celebrating me?

773
00:50:49,148 --> 00:50:49,949
Dad...

774
00:50:51,684 --> 00:50:54,120
I'm sorry for telling you to quit before.

775
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:00,293
I thought you left Just...

776
00:51:00,293 --> 00:51:02,161
because of my hospital bills.

777
00:51:02,161 --> 00:51:03,262
It just made me feel awful.

778
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:05,164
Jae Hee.

779
00:51:06,465 --> 00:51:08,801
I didn't leave
because of your hospital bills.

780
00:51:10,036 --> 00:51:11,070
They told me...

781
00:51:12,204 --> 00:51:14,173
not to win.

782
00:51:14,974 --> 00:51:15,875
What?

783
00:51:17,009 --> 00:51:18,010
They wanted me to...

784
00:51:19,412 --> 00:51:22,081
throw the game.
Match-fixing.

785
00:51:22,848 --> 00:51:24,417
So I left.

786
00:51:25,084 --> 00:51:26,218
I didn't want to be a dad...

787
00:51:27,253 --> 00:51:28,921
ashamed in front of you.

788
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:32,591
I'm sorry, Dad.

789
00:51:34,727 --> 00:51:36,295
I didn't know...

790
00:51:37,663 --> 00:51:39,065
Must've been hard
holding that in.

791
00:51:40,433 --> 00:51:43,169
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

792
00:51:43,803 --> 00:51:45,404
See? I told you.

793
00:51:45,404 --> 00:51:47,039
It wasn't because of the hospital bills.

794
00:51:49,008 --> 00:51:51,410
But Dad.

795
00:51:52,979 --> 00:51:55,748
"If you don't want to be called
incomplete, then show them."

796
00:51:57,783 --> 00:51:59,885
It was kinda cringe.

797
00:51:59,885 --> 00:52:01,187
Total coach syndrome!

798
00:52:04,824 --> 00:52:06,158
Too much?

799
00:52:06,826 --> 00:52:08,461
Way too much.

800
00:52:09,128 --> 00:52:10,029
Way too much.

801
00:52:11,063 --> 00:52:12,365
Way too much...

802
00:52:12,365 --> 00:52:13,933
Got it.

803
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,334
Alright then.

804
00:52:16,669 --> 00:52:18,671
How about we just eat some cake?

805
00:52:20,573 --> 00:52:21,507
What's this?

806
00:52:22,074 --> 00:52:23,409
Jae Hee made it.

807
00:52:23,409 --> 00:52:26,779
"To my dearest Dad,
thank you for all your hard work.

808
00:52:26,779 --> 00:52:28,881
I respect you, and I love you."

809
00:52:31,284 --> 00:52:33,252
Are you saying
Coach Maeng Gong of the Big Pandas...

810
00:52:33,252 --> 00:52:35,321
was involved in match-fixing?

811
00:52:35,321 --> 00:52:36,188
Yes.

812
00:52:36,789 --> 00:52:40,226
Haven't there been a number of
ridiculous losses from the Big Pandas?

813
00:52:40,226 --> 00:52:43,296
There's just no other explanation.
It has to be rigged.

814
00:52:43,296 --> 00:52:44,697
I'm confident.

815
00:52:44,697 --> 00:52:47,433
After persistent investigation,

816
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:51,370
I managed to capture
a photo of Coach Maeng...

817
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:52,939
meeting with a match-fixing broker.

818
00:52:53,372 --> 00:52:56,409
Hold on.
Alright, looking at this photo...

819
00:52:56,409 --> 00:52:59,545
this is the studio apartment
where Coach Maeng lives.

820
00:52:59,545 --> 00:53:00,780
That's him.

821
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:04,150
And the man next to him...
is that the broker?

822
00:53:04,617 --> 00:53:06,085
That's right. Exactly.

823
00:53:06,085 --> 00:53:07,420
Now listen carefully.

824
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:10,589
My reasonable deduction is that...

825
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:12,291
Maeng Gong was...

826
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:15,027
basically forced out of Just...

827
00:53:15,027 --> 00:53:16,595
because of this match-fixing issue.

828
00:53:17,897 --> 00:53:19,465
Wow, the pieces fit perfectly.

829
00:53:20,066 --> 00:53:24,370
It definitely seems like
he is involved in something shady.

830
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:26,739
He is, I'm telling you.

831
00:53:27,406 --> 00:53:28,474
Hey, Maeng Gong.

832
00:53:28,975 --> 00:53:31,110
Feels good making easy money?

833
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:33,079
- Huh?
- This is live. We're on air...live!

834
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:35,014
He was kicked from Just
for fixing matches.

835
00:53:35,014 --> 00:53:36,949
No wonder it felt shady from the start.

836
00:53:36,949 --> 00:53:38,150
Now it all makes sense.

837
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:39,986
He's not a traitor, he's a criminal.

838
00:53:39,986 --> 00:53:40,753
What the...

839
00:53:42,254 --> 00:53:44,323
Kicked out for match-fixing?

840
00:53:44,323 --> 00:53:45,157
Seriously?

841
00:53:46,158 --> 00:53:47,259
That's it.

842
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,795
We need to reveal what happened
three years ago.

843
00:53:49,795 --> 00:53:50,796
Manager Choi.

844
00:53:51,464 --> 00:53:52,965
Just Manager...

845
00:53:52,965 --> 00:53:55,368
leaked that fake article saying you...

846
00:53:55,368 --> 00:53:56,669
signed with the Big Pandas.

847
00:53:56,669 --> 00:53:58,738
He stirred up the whole squad on purpose.

848
00:53:58,738 --> 00:53:59,839
Let's tell everyone.

849
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:01,407
No. We can't do that.

850
00:54:01,407 --> 00:54:02,575
What do you mean can't?

851
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:08,314
Look, I still remember
when you came to me back then.

852
00:54:08,314 --> 00:54:11,584
Begging me to turn
that fake article into a real one.

853
00:54:11,584 --> 00:54:14,487
Asking me to appoint you
as the Big Pandas' coach.

854
00:54:15,454 --> 00:54:20,359
I thought,
What the hell is wrong with this guy?

855
00:54:20,826 --> 00:54:22,461
I thought you were out of your mind.

856
00:54:24,864 --> 00:54:28,401
It wasn't easy to
smear the name of the team...

857
00:54:28,401 --> 00:54:29,869
I gave my whole playing career to.

858
00:54:30,136 --> 00:54:31,938
But being called a traitor was easy?

859
00:54:32,939 --> 00:54:34,040
You think it was?

860
00:54:36,142 --> 00:54:37,109
Damn...

861
00:54:40,947 --> 00:54:42,181
Let's make it simple.

862
00:54:43,716 --> 00:54:46,786
Three years ago,
Just made an unjust demand.

863
00:54:46,786 --> 00:54:49,789
You couldn't accept it, so you left.

864
00:54:49,789 --> 00:54:51,223
And that photo?

865
00:54:51,223 --> 00:54:53,359
That guy's not a broker but a hater.

866
00:54:55,761 --> 00:54:56,562
Manager Choi.

867
00:54:58,497 --> 00:55:00,600
Just got taken over by another company,

868
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,201
so this season is their last.

869
00:55:03,202 --> 00:55:06,405
Next season,
Just won't exist in pro basketball.

870
00:55:07,573 --> 00:55:09,942
So what's the point...

871
00:55:09,942 --> 00:55:11,777
of dragging this up now?

872
00:55:13,779 --> 00:55:15,014
I want the fans...

873
00:55:17,149 --> 00:55:18,384
to remember...

874
00:55:19,352 --> 00:55:21,287
Just as something good.

875
00:55:21,921 --> 00:55:23,255
Let's not reveal that...

876
00:55:24,023 --> 00:55:25,791
the man in the photo is just hater either.

877
00:55:25,791 --> 00:55:27,193
Hwa Jin is still a student.

878
00:55:28,127 --> 00:55:29,795
If his info gets out, it's over.

879
00:55:32,765 --> 00:55:35,568
Fine.
Protect the kid. Of course.

880
00:55:36,302 --> 00:55:38,170
But these match-fixing rumors?

881
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:41,540
That's not something we can let slide.

882
00:55:42,642 --> 00:55:45,244
Tell the truth about three years ago.
It's the cleanest way.

883
00:55:46,912 --> 00:55:47,947
I'm sorry.

884
00:55:48,147 --> 00:55:49,215
Hey, Maeng Gong!

885
00:55:49,215 --> 00:55:50,216
I've already...

886
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:52,852
made up my mind.

887
00:55:55,187 --> 00:55:56,122
Thanks.

888
00:55:56,856 --> 00:55:57,857
Take off, man.

889
00:56:28,354 --> 00:56:29,188
What?

890
00:56:29,755 --> 00:56:31,157
You're seeing the coach today.

891
00:56:33,485 --> 00:56:35,020
(Maeng Gong)

892
00:56:35,728 --> 00:56:37,129
Ugh, no.

893
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:39,298
Why would you want his autograph?

894
00:56:39,298 --> 00:56:40,199
Come on, please do it.

895
00:56:50,676 --> 00:56:52,979
It's been ages
since I signed one of these. Here.

896
00:56:54,847 --> 00:56:56,148
Why'd you ask to meet?

897
00:56:56,415 --> 00:56:57,683
Aren't you busy with playoffs?

898
00:56:58,384 --> 00:57:01,354
I was prepping for the game alone
and suddenly thought of you.

899
00:57:01,354 --> 00:57:02,922
I've got questions too.

900
00:57:03,956 --> 00:57:04,690
Like what?

901
00:57:05,725 --> 00:57:08,194
Why do you like basketball?

902
00:57:09,462 --> 00:57:10,463
Basketball...

903
00:57:12,098 --> 00:57:14,267
At first,
it was just because my brother played.

904
00:57:15,434 --> 00:57:17,770
Now, if you ask me why I like it.

905
00:57:18,471 --> 00:57:19,472
I don't have a reason.

906
00:57:20,973 --> 00:57:22,108
Are you copying me or what?

907
00:57:23,342 --> 00:57:24,477
There's just no reason.

908
00:57:25,311 --> 00:57:27,513
And I don't plan on finding one either.
I just like it.

909
00:57:27,947 --> 00:57:29,415
That's fine, liking it just because.

910
00:57:29,415 --> 00:57:31,550
But I still hope
you'll think a bit deeper...

911
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:34,020
about how much you like it.

912
00:57:35,354 --> 00:57:36,255
Why?

913
00:57:36,722 --> 00:57:38,090
I'm going to be a pro or anything.

914
00:57:38,658 --> 00:57:40,559
Well, not everyone who loves basketball...

915
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:43,195
has to be out there on the court, right?

916
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:45,531
Ta-da.

917
00:57:45,531 --> 00:57:46,432
What is it?

918
00:57:50,102 --> 00:57:51,404
You could be here.

919
00:57:52,505 --> 00:57:54,907
Right next to me.

920
00:57:54,907 --> 00:57:56,943
As a performance analyst or something.

921
00:57:57,476 --> 00:57:58,544
Me? Come on.

922
00:58:00,313 --> 00:58:01,814
Hwa Jin.

923
00:58:02,615 --> 00:58:05,618
People usually watch sports
for the game itself.

924
00:58:06,152 --> 00:58:08,321
But you notice more than just the game.

925
00:58:08,788 --> 00:58:10,389
If your eyes go there naturally,

926
00:58:10,389 --> 00:58:12,491
it's more than just casual enjoyment.

927
00:58:13,626 --> 00:58:16,862
Why am I looking beyond the court?

928
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:19,498
Ask yourself this question.

929
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,568
And if I ask and get an answer,
then what?

930
00:58:23,336 --> 00:58:25,438
- What changes?
- A lot.

931
00:58:25,438 --> 00:58:26,839
Like what?

932
00:58:26,839 --> 00:58:27,707
Someday...

933
00:58:28,507 --> 00:58:31,611
you and I might end up on the same team.

934
00:58:31,611 --> 00:58:32,511
Being on the same team

935
00:58:33,412 --> 00:58:34,347
Sounds nice.

936
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:35,715
You like that?

937
00:58:36,602 --> 00:58:38,070
Stop. Seriously.

938
00:58:38,257 --> 00:58:40,259
(Big Pandas)

939
00:58:42,188 --> 00:58:44,023
How are the players doing?
Everything okay?

940
00:58:45,992 --> 00:58:47,259
Any issues?

941
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,261
Nothing major, I think.

942
00:58:49,261 --> 00:58:52,598
Don't jump to conclusions.
What is it?

943
00:58:52,765 --> 00:58:55,201
Woo Seung keeps touching his wrist.

944
00:58:55,201 --> 00:58:57,470
Then he just stares at his hand.

945
00:59:00,339 --> 00:59:01,874
What's so funny?

946
00:59:01,874 --> 00:59:06,579
I told him to practice a victory ceremony.

947
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:10,683
Told him to come up with something cool
to wow the fans.

948
00:59:10,683 --> 00:59:11,717
That's what it was?

949
00:59:13,319 --> 00:59:16,422
Also, Jung Hyup's been walking around
with his head down since yesterday.

950
00:59:16,422 --> 00:59:17,990
Aespa.

951
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:19,925
He failed to get tickets
for their concert.

952
00:59:20,192 --> 00:59:21,260
Excuse me?

953
00:59:21,661 --> 00:59:23,429
I figured that'd happen,

954
00:59:23,429 --> 00:59:25,164
so I asked Hwajin to grab a few. Look.

955
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:28,534
Casually let it slip that...

956
00:59:28,534 --> 00:59:30,102
I might give one to Jung Hyup...

957
00:59:30,102 --> 00:59:32,338
if he plays well today.

958
00:59:33,272 --> 00:59:34,173
Whoa...

959
00:59:34,607 --> 00:59:36,042
Any chance I could get one too?

960
00:59:39,879 --> 00:59:42,415
Go check if all the players are
on the bus.

961
00:59:42,415 --> 00:59:44,417
Now move. Go, go, go!

962
00:59:44,417 --> 00:59:45,351
Coach!

963
00:59:46,118 --> 00:59:47,520
- Did you hear?
- What?

964
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,522
Remember that YouTube channel that...

965
00:59:49,522 --> 00:59:52,058
post clips of you getting mad
during games? Angry Maeng?

966
00:59:52,058 --> 00:59:54,360
All their videos are gone,
and they even changed the name.

967
00:59:55,027 --> 00:59:55,962
Suddenly?

968
00:59:55,962 --> 00:59:59,732
I guess they didn't have anything new to
post since you stopped yelling.

969
01:00:01,367 --> 01:00:03,202
So, what's the new name?

970
01:00:03,202 --> 01:00:04,070

01:01:00,593 --> 01:01:02,795
I'm just about to leave for the stadium.

982
01:01:03,996 --> 01:01:07,066
You've been watching
a lot of YouTube lately, right?

983
01:01:08,401 --> 01:01:10,636
No, no. I'm not nagging.

984
01:01:10,636 --> 01:01:12,305
It's just...a video of me got uploaded.

985
01:01:12,305 --> 01:01:13,673
And I was wondering if you saw it.

986
01:01:14,807 --> 01:01:15,675

991
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:37,496
Woo Jin,
how does it feel to be back on the court?

992
01:01:38,664 --> 01:01:40,099
I was excited...

993
01:01:40,099 --> 01:01:42,234
but also a bit nervous about
whether I can do well.

994
01:01:42,602 --> 01:01:43,536
A bit?

995
01:01:45,004 --> 01:01:46,472
Do you know what he's been like?

996
01:01:46,839 --> 01:01:48,941
When you stressed about
making the playoffs.

997
01:01:48,941 --> 01:01:51,277
The time when you said
your head was going to explode.

998
01:01:51,277 --> 01:01:52,612
He's acting exactly the same now.

999
01:01:52,612 --> 01:01:54,313
What? Woo Jin, really?

1000
01:01:54,914 --> 01:01:57,750
That's exactly
when you need to reassure yourself.

1001
01:01:58,217 --> 01:01:59,251
How?

1002
01:01:59,251 --> 01:02:02,455
Match your training
to your return schedule.

1003
01:02:02,455 --> 01:02:04,991
Plan things out in stages and...

1004
01:02:04,991 --> 01:02:06,993
work on your weaknesses one by one.

1005
01:02:07,727 --> 01:02:09,495
What about going to
a skill training program?

1006
01:02:09,495 --> 01:02:11,731
I looked into it because I wanted to,

1007
01:02:12,632 --> 01:02:14,400
but private lessons are crazy expensive.

1008
01:02:15,701 --> 01:02:17,203
Hold on a sec.

1009
01:02:20,339 --> 01:02:21,340

What's that? Free money?

1015
01:02:32,351 --> 01:02:33,486
Yup.

1017
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:38,391

is below a certain level,

without doing part-time jobs.

1021
01:02:48,701 --> 01:02:50,803

skill training.
