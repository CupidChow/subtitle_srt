1
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,102
(All settings are entirely fictional.)

2
00:00:13,102 --> 00:00:15,104
(All child actors were accompanied
by guardians to ensure safety.)

3
00:00:28,782 --> 00:00:30,086
It's Red Z's turn to attack.

4
00:00:30,088 --> 00:00:32,457
(Red Z vs Big Pandas)
(4th quarter)

5
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:37,893
Inside the paint zone

6
00:00:37,893 --> 00:00:38,928
One-handed dunk!

7
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:41,030
Red Z

8
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,431
Now, it's Big Pandas' attack.

9
00:00:42,431 --> 00:00:44,133
Big Pandas are just one point short.

10
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:45,768
This could be their last shot.

11
00:00:46,736 --> 00:00:49,272
Kang Woo Seung is giving signals
to his teammates.

12
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:54,110
(Park Joon Hyuk)

13
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:55,945
(Chess)

14
00:00:56,912 --> 00:00:57,913
(Choi Jung Hyup)

15
00:00:58,748 --> 00:00:59,749
(Lee Min Jae)

16
00:01:00,216 --> 00:01:01,384
(Yoo Jin Ki, Kim Min Woo)

17
00:01:09,892 --> 00:01:10,726
Choi Jung Hyup

18
00:01:11,661 --> 00:01:12,762
Ball in his hands.

19
00:01:12,762 --> 00:01:13,863
Kang Woo Seung steps out for space.

20
00:01:14,797 --> 00:01:15,631
A screen from Choi Jung Hyup.

21
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:17,934
He's blocking the Red Z defender's path.

22
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:22,104
Kang Woo Seung is locked down
by Red Z's help defense.

23
00:01:23,172 --> 00:01:24,173
Take the ball! Hurry!

24
00:01:24,173 --> 00:01:25,708
He's in hurry to look for someone
to pass to.

25
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,544
Guys, you need to back Kang Woo Seung up.

26
00:01:28,544 --> 00:01:29,712
Move it!

27
00:01:29,712 --> 00:01:30,713
Cover him, man!

28
00:01:38,454 --> 00:01:40,456
The pass goes out of the court.

29
00:01:40,456 --> 00:01:41,290
Out of bounds.

30
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,225
That pass goes to Maeng Gong.

31
00:02:12,421 --> 00:02:16,292
Hey, you idiot!

32
00:02:26,882 --> 00:02:30,185
(Coach Maeng Cancel Club)

33
00:02:30,339 --> 00:02:31,507
White shirt?

34
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,509
Is he insane?

35
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:35,511
Did he take off his jacket
just because he was hot?

36
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,680
Completely unprofessional.

37
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,048
That's why he stays titleless.

38
00:02:42,685 --> 00:02:45,454
Coach Maeng Cancel Club at it again today.

39
00:02:45,454 --> 00:02:48,357
Is Maeng Gong playing now?
Why's he on the court?

40
00:02:48,357 --> 00:02:49,759
If Maeng Gong doesn't step down,

41
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,360
we'll send a protest truck
in front of the club building.

42
00:03:12,515 --> 00:03:13,416
Kang Woo Seung

43
00:03:14,317 --> 00:03:16,352
Who were you passing to?

44
00:03:16,585 --> 00:03:17,353
Sorry, coach.

45
00:03:17,353 --> 00:03:19,588
A point guard with a narrow view? Come on!

46
00:03:19,588 --> 00:03:20,923
How are you supposed to lead like that?

47
00:03:20,923 --> 00:03:23,593
Can't even distinguish the coach
from players?

48
00:03:24,527 --> 00:03:25,394
Coach,

49
00:03:25,861 --> 00:03:26,562
your shirt...

50
00:03:30,032 --> 00:03:30,933
Shirt?

51
00:03:34,704 --> 00:03:35,538
Huh?

52
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:38,007
My shirt?

53
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:39,508
You mean the same color?

54
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:41,377
Okay, man.

55
00:03:41,377 --> 00:03:42,578
Isn't it obvious?

56
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:44,347
Remember it.

57
00:03:44,947 --> 00:03:46,616
When Maeng Gong loses his temper
on the court,

58
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,751
it continues to the locker room too.

59
00:03:49,352 --> 00:03:50,620
As a coach,

60
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,822
I'm sorry for wearing a white shirt...

61
00:03:52,822 --> 00:03:54,657
confusing the players like that.

62
00:03:54,657 --> 00:03:57,093
Would that help if I showed up
with nothing on?

63
00:03:57,093 --> 00:03:58,794
Even my pants and underwear?

64
00:03:58,794 --> 00:03:59,829
Let me go.

65
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:01,998
Let go, I'm fine. I didn't lose my temper.

66
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:05,868
Seriously, how?

67
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:09,238
We lost to the bottom-ranked team
without the main lineup?

68
00:04:09,238 --> 00:04:10,506
How?

69
00:04:10,506 --> 00:04:12,642
Hey, did you all leave your brain
in the locker room?

70
00:04:12,642 --> 00:04:14,410
Then just brought your body
onto the court?

71
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,178
What's with all those turnovers?

72
00:04:16,178 --> 00:04:18,214
Eighteen turnovers!

73
00:04:18,214 --> 00:04:20,116
Absolute madness, all of you!

74
00:04:22,885 --> 00:04:24,253
For real...

75
00:04:24,887 --> 00:04:25,988
ridiculous.

76
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,357
Today...

77
00:04:28,357 --> 00:04:29,792
Right now!

78
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:31,460
You're doing 1,000 passes today, got it?

79
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,930
A thousand shots, everyone!

80
00:04:36,198 --> 00:04:37,833
All of you!

81
00:04:39,068 --> 00:04:40,136
Got it?

82
00:04:41,337 --> 00:04:42,638
I said, got it?

83
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:44,140
Yes, coach.

84
00:04:45,308 --> 00:04:47,443
Day 300 of wishing for Coach Maeng Cancel.

85
00:04:48,858 --> 00:04:52,962
(A Head Coach’s Turnover)

86
00:04:54,617 --> 00:04:57,620
(BIG PANDAS)

87
00:05:00,929 --> 00:05:03,765
(Episode 1)

88
00:05:15,137 --> 00:05:16,105
Maeng Gong,

89
00:05:17,106 --> 00:05:18,507
What was our standing two years ago?

90
00:05:20,476 --> 00:05:21,711
We placed 7th, right?

91
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:24,213
What about last year?

92
00:05:24,213 --> 00:05:25,181
Oh, 7th again.

93
00:05:25,748 --> 00:05:27,183
How about this year?

94
00:05:28,084 --> 00:05:29,418
Another 7th.

95
00:05:29,619 --> 00:05:31,153
Look at this. Same results, again.

96
00:05:31,153 --> 00:05:33,089
Jackpot three years in a row?

97
00:05:34,123 --> 00:05:37,193
Athletes should avoid gambling,

98
00:05:37,727 --> 00:05:39,095
but you're seriously calling that
a jackpot?

99
00:05:39,528 --> 00:05:40,930
Hey, you idiot.

100
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,733
If you end up 7th again this year,
you’ll be out before your term ends.

101
00:05:44,267 --> 00:05:45,801
No one said we'd be 7th!

102
00:05:45,801 --> 00:05:47,903
There are four games to go.

103
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,939
Oh, I see.

104
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:52,141
Four more games, right?

105
00:05:52,141 --> 00:05:54,310
So many games, huh?

106
00:05:54,844 --> 00:05:56,312
Look at this!

107
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,414
Okay then.

108
00:05:58,414 --> 00:06:00,883
To make the playoffs,

109
00:06:00,883 --> 00:06:02,952
we just need to be in top 6
out of these ten teams.

110
00:06:03,686 --> 00:06:04,987
That's amazing, huh?

111
00:06:04,987 --> 00:06:07,857
Even the lottery cuts off at 5th place...

112
00:06:07,857 --> 00:06:09,792
6th place matters so much here.

113
00:06:10,526 --> 00:06:11,560
But you...

114
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,795
you, Maeng Gong!

115
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:14,263
What place are you in?

116
00:06:14,263 --> 00:06:16,132
Right here, 7th place.

117
00:06:16,132 --> 00:06:18,367
For three years.

118
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:22,171
You think any club would just sit back
and watch that?

119
00:06:22,171 --> 00:06:24,006
I'm not stepping down.

120
00:06:24,006 --> 00:06:26,175
That'll be decided
within the next two weeks.

121
00:06:29,812 --> 00:06:31,147
I've already talked about it
to the executives.

122
00:06:31,747 --> 00:06:33,783
Told them to wait and see
until the season's over.

123
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:35,685
Why?

124
00:06:36,085 --> 00:06:37,586
If we switch coach mid-season,

125
00:06:37,586 --> 00:06:39,722
and we failed to make the playoffs
because of it.

126
00:06:39,722 --> 00:06:42,258
And then who's going to deal with that?
Without you?

127
00:06:42,258 --> 00:06:44,393
You want me to take all the blame
instead of you?

128
00:06:44,393 --> 00:06:45,161
You think I'd be that stupid?

129
00:06:45,695 --> 00:06:47,530
That's a long way to say...

130
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,699
I'll be fired
if I can't make the playoffs.

131
00:06:50,299 --> 00:06:53,502
It's up to you to survive.

132
00:06:54,136 --> 00:06:55,771
I can't help you anymore.

133
00:06:55,771 --> 00:06:58,274
I know. Thanks, Manager Choi.

134
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,746
Please, let's make it count this time.

135
00:07:04,246 --> 00:07:08,718
I'm asking not as a manager,
but as a friend, okay?

136
00:07:10,553 --> 00:07:11,487
You'll see.

137
00:07:12,888 --> 00:07:14,657
No matter what it takes,

138
00:07:14,657 --> 00:07:17,360
I'll get our team into the playoffs.

139
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,228
I promise!

140
00:07:20,196 --> 00:07:21,264
I'm going too.

141
00:07:23,366 --> 00:07:24,734
I said I'm going!

142
00:07:26,035 --> 00:07:27,136
Please.

143
00:07:28,037 --> 00:07:29,205
Seriously!

144
00:07:30,172 --> 00:07:31,841
It's been three years that he promised.

145
00:07:35,311 --> 00:07:36,612
That's wild.

146
00:07:36,612 --> 00:07:37,980
What a mess in the comment.

147
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,715
It's hilarious.

148
00:07:43,853 --> 00:07:46,789
Look at the leader.
He's totally out of it.

149
00:07:47,857 --> 00:07:49,225
Hey,

150
00:07:49,225 --> 00:07:50,960
He and I went
to the physical therapy room earlier...

151
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,429
he was looking up "tunnel vision."

152
00:07:55,965 --> 00:07:57,300
Yo, Chess!

153
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,200
Yeah!

154
00:08:00,903 --> 00:08:01,837
What's it this time?

155
00:08:02,571 --> 00:08:04,573
Why're you packed again?

156
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:07,276
He said he's just going home two days
for homemade food.

157
00:08:07,276 --> 00:08:10,246
Wait, isn't Chess from Birmingham?

158
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:12,281
How does he go to the UK
and back in two days?

159
00:08:12,281 --> 00:08:13,249
I don't know.

160
00:08:13,482 --> 00:08:15,184
Kang Woo Seung,
tell it the coach later, please.

161
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:17,920
Did you hear that?

162
00:08:18,421 --> 00:08:19,322
Sorry?

163
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:21,357
Oh, Chess.

164
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,727
Got it. I'll let him know.
Thanks, Choi Jung Hyup.

165
00:08:26,762 --> 00:08:27,730
What's going on there?

166
00:08:28,764 --> 00:08:30,299
I think I'm better-looking.

167
00:08:30,299 --> 00:08:31,200
What're you looking at?

168
00:08:31,434 --> 00:08:33,869
Oh, this? You already know what it is.

169
00:08:33,869 --> 00:08:34,770
Park Joon Hyuk.

170
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,672
When Maeng Gong loses his temper
on the court,

171
00:08:36,672 --> 00:08:38,374
it continues to the locker room too.

172
00:08:39,976 --> 00:08:40,876
Hey,

173
00:08:42,178 --> 00:08:44,747
If you're into hate,
read what's under your name.

174
00:08:44,747 --> 00:08:45,948
Yes, leader.

175
00:08:49,185 --> 00:08:50,386
Look at that move.

176
00:08:50,753 --> 00:08:53,789
The dude who panics in every clutch
is the team leader.

177
00:08:53,789 --> 00:08:55,124
That's why the team's a mess.

178
00:08:57,827 --> 00:09:00,229
Oh, I thought that was my comment.

179
00:09:00,763 --> 00:09:02,632
Are you kidding me?

180
00:09:02,632 --> 00:09:03,566
Get out of the way!

181
00:09:03,566 --> 00:09:05,134
Stop him!

182
00:09:05,568 --> 00:09:07,270
Help hold him back.

183
00:09:09,672 --> 00:09:11,674
Maeng Gong, you need to read
these hate comments.

184
00:09:11,674 --> 00:09:13,476
We don't have time to deal with them.

185
00:09:13,476 --> 00:09:14,877
These are worse than you think.

186
00:09:14,877 --> 00:09:16,412
For now, we need to focus on the next...

187
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,115
What's this?

188
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:21,217
What?

189
00:09:21,984 --> 00:09:24,086
What does he know?

190
00:09:24,086 --> 00:09:26,389
He's not the only one like this.

191
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:28,090
We compiled everything fan reported
and the team monitored.

192
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,726
And filed lawsuits.

193
00:09:30,726 --> 00:09:32,561
Let’s go intimidate them a bit this time.

194
00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:36,532
We don’t have time to waste
on these pathetic people.

195
00:09:36,532 --> 00:09:37,700
Just follow the law.

196
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,536
The problem is they just pay a fine
and do it again.

197
00:09:42,138 --> 00:09:44,040
I mean those commenters...

198
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,442
they wouldn’t dare say a word in person.

199
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:49,245
Especially if the target is you,

200
00:09:49,245 --> 00:09:51,013
wouldn’t that be even more effective?

201
00:09:51,013 --> 00:09:52,915
What do you mean "especially"?

202
00:09:52,915 --> 00:09:55,184
To those pathetic people
writing hate comments,

203
00:09:55,184 --> 00:09:58,421
why should I give them
the honor of facing me?

204
00:09:58,421 --> 00:10:01,657
That only worked back
when you were a player.

205
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,094
Why not now?

206
00:10:05,094 --> 00:10:06,228
Why not?

207
00:10:07,163 --> 00:10:09,098
- You’ve never heard of Angry Maeng.
- Angry what?

208
00:10:09,098 --> 00:10:10,533
Kang Woo Seung, you' re not a coward?

209
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:12,134
Why don’t you play like this
in actual games?

210
00:10:12,134 --> 00:10:14,704
Park Joon Hyuk, are you actually insane?

211
00:10:14,704 --> 00:10:16,539
Just stop, please.

212
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:17,940
Please.

213
00:10:25,481 --> 00:10:26,983
Just give up on basketball...

214
00:10:26,983 --> 00:10:28,818
and switch to martial arts or something.

215
00:10:29,685 --> 00:10:30,820
You’d probably be great at it.

216
00:10:32,488 --> 00:10:35,424
You guys charging the team
for your own fight now?

217
00:10:36,626 --> 00:10:37,660
No shame at all?

218
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:39,528
Also...

219
00:10:43,766 --> 00:10:44,800
Also...

220
00:10:46,469 --> 00:10:49,171
Nice farewell performance, Kang Woo Seung.

221
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:50,473
Don’t show your face again.

222
00:10:50,473 --> 00:10:52,441
That’s a pro? You’re kidding.

223
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:53,676
This is how easy money works.

224
00:10:53,676 --> 00:10:55,411
Kang Woo Seung's turnovers are disgusting.

225
00:10:55,411 --> 00:10:56,746
Get out of the team.

226
00:10:58,347 --> 00:11:00,583
We'll sue over all of them one by one.

227
00:11:02,351 --> 00:11:03,486
Hurry up.

228
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,559
Raise your hand
if your name was in the comments.

229
00:11:11,894 --> 00:11:12,995
Raise your hand.

230
00:11:20,369 --> 00:11:23,205
Anyone whose game is affected
by comments like this?

231
00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:27,843
Is it hurting your performance or not?

232
00:11:27,843 --> 00:11:28,644
Honestly,

233
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:30,112
it does bother me.

234
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,315
I don’t mind if they insult me...

235
00:11:33,349 --> 00:11:35,451
but I can’t stand them
attacking my family.

236
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,187
It’s exhausting.

237
00:11:39,288 --> 00:11:40,623
Isn’t this all because of you?

238
00:11:43,426 --> 00:11:45,194
Half of those haters out there...

239
00:11:45,194 --> 00:11:47,563
they’re fans
who have a grudge against you.

240
00:11:48,664 --> 00:11:50,967
It’s on us to endure this ridicule...

241
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:53,502
even during matches.

242
00:11:54,503 --> 00:11:57,773
Okay, so if this is resolved,

243
00:11:57,773 --> 00:11:59,709
you guys won’t lose any more games?

244
00:12:00,109 --> 00:12:00,977
What?

245
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:03,012
No, that’s not what we meant...

246
00:12:03,012 --> 00:12:03,980
In short,

247
00:12:04,413 --> 00:12:07,416
You’re all mentally broken.

248
00:12:08,584 --> 00:12:11,520
Out of control turnovers
in the 4th quarter,

249
00:12:12,421 --> 00:12:14,590
reckless shooting with ignoring patterns,

250
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,993
missing box-outs with losing focus,

251
00:12:17,927 --> 00:12:18,761
everything.

252
00:12:19,996 --> 00:12:21,364
Everything is because of your mentality.

253
00:12:22,765 --> 00:12:23,599
Huh?

254
00:12:25,701 --> 00:12:28,371
The comments you complain about...

255
00:12:28,371 --> 00:12:30,306
become your reason for failure.

256
00:12:30,306 --> 00:12:33,042
I’ll completely handle these haters.

257
00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:34,610
From the next match,

258
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,879
if you lose your focus, brace yourself.

259
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:40,283
No more excuses for losing.

260
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:41,917
Got it?

261
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:43,986
I said, got it?

262
00:12:43,986 --> 00:12:45,087
Got it.

263
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,958
Coach Bae.

264
00:12:49,425 --> 00:12:51,060
Time to report. Move it.

265
00:12:55,164 --> 00:12:58,401
That’s so typical of Big Back Stabbers.

266
00:12:58,401 --> 00:13:01,203
Last mistake really stabbed the fans
in the back.

267
00:13:01,203 --> 00:13:03,172
What does it mean?

268
00:13:03,172 --> 00:13:05,675
That’s what Just fans call our team.

269
00:13:05,675 --> 00:13:08,978
You used to coach at Just...

270
00:13:08,978 --> 00:13:11,213
and moved to Big Pandas as a coach
by stabbing them in the back.

271
00:13:11,213 --> 00:13:13,015
That’s why they call us
"Big Back Stabbers."

272
00:13:13,015 --> 00:13:15,184
If they want to hate,
they should target me.

273
00:13:15,184 --> 00:13:17,119
Why they drag the team name
through the mud?

274
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,088
What's this?

275
00:13:19,689 --> 00:13:20,823
Look at the player rotation.

276
00:13:20,823 --> 00:13:23,059
Is Maeng Gong getting paid
under the table?

277
00:13:23,993 --> 00:13:26,529
Username "Today Toto." No surprise.

278
00:13:27,163 --> 00:13:29,932
A vile hater spreading
match-fixing rumors.

279
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:32,568
Maeng Gong is just the worst.

280
00:13:33,402 --> 00:13:35,438
He knew about the top scorer
of the opposing team...

281
00:13:35,438 --> 00:13:37,273
has left ankle injury.

282
00:13:37,273 --> 00:13:39,108
So he told the players
to go for his left ankle.

283
00:13:39,108 --> 00:13:41,644
I heard it from behind the bench.

284
00:13:41,644 --> 00:13:42,678
I never said that!

285
00:13:43,346 --> 00:13:44,914
Username "Maeng Gong Dog."

286
00:13:44,914 --> 00:13:47,116
This guy writes full-on fiction
every game.

287
00:13:48,851 --> 00:13:51,253
He says I’m gay,
even though I have a wife and daughter.

288
00:13:51,253 --> 00:13:53,756
Have you ever seen a gay guy
who looks like me?

289
00:13:53,756 --> 00:13:54,957
Username "I Know Everything."

290
00:13:54,957 --> 00:13:57,727
This hater spreads rumors
about favoritism toward certain players.

291
00:13:57,727 --> 00:13:59,695
He says you and Kang Woo Seung are...

292
00:13:59,695 --> 00:14:02,598
in an inappropriate relationship,
that’s why he plays more.

293
00:14:03,499 --> 00:14:05,401
So many people with nothing better to do.

294
00:14:05,401 --> 00:14:06,669
Wait, hold up.

295
00:14:06,669 --> 00:14:09,038
Lastly, username
"Coach Maeng Cancel Club."

296
00:14:09,272 --> 00:14:10,439
Is it about me?

297
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,508
That’s so childish.

298
00:14:13,542 --> 00:14:15,177
But this one’s a little different.

299
00:14:16,145 --> 00:14:17,013
What do you mean?

300
00:14:17,013 --> 00:14:18,914
When he critiques our tactics,

301
00:14:18,914 --> 00:14:21,284
it sounds like
he genuinely wants us to win.

302
00:14:21,284 --> 00:14:23,052
He analyzes every moment in detail.

303
00:14:23,052 --> 00:14:23,953
Wait, no...

304
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,089
can’t you distinguish haters from fans?

305
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:30,459
What kind of fan posts hate like that?

306
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:31,727
It’s weird.

307
00:14:33,062 --> 00:14:34,964
Freaking Maeng Gong...

308
00:14:35,698 --> 00:14:36,999
starting up again.

309
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:38,167
The fast break was going well...

310
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:40,536
but from 7:13 left in 4th quarter,

311
00:14:40,536 --> 00:14:43,306
They started wasting time on offense.

312
00:14:43,306 --> 00:14:45,875
Defense was a total mess
from that point on.

313
00:14:48,711 --> 00:14:50,446
He’s talking about the Red Z's game.

314
00:14:51,213 --> 00:14:52,214
Keep going.

315
00:14:52,548 --> 00:14:55,651
Maeng Gong allowed
the best shooter of the opposing team

316
00:14:55,651 --> 00:14:57,486
the chance to score.

317
00:14:57,486 --> 00:15:00,923
But they locked down the player
who can’t shoot.

318
00:15:00,923 --> 00:15:02,592
What defensive strategy is this?

319
00:15:02,592 --> 00:15:05,528
Did he tell our players to set up
the opposing team's best plays?

320
00:15:05,528 --> 00:15:08,564
Why would I say that, huh?

321
00:15:08,564 --> 00:15:11,200
At the most critical part of the match...

322
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,103
they completely lost focus
and handed over the ball.

323
00:15:14,103 --> 00:15:16,505
That’s my fault?

324
00:15:16,505 --> 00:15:18,040
Wow, that’s scarily accurate.

325
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,342
What now?

326
00:15:19,342 --> 00:15:21,377
If I say like this,
Maeng Gong's saying he’s not at fault.

327
00:15:21,377 --> 00:15:23,779
He’ll just say
the players didn’t follow him, right?

328
00:15:24,213 --> 00:15:26,382
Losing to Red Z wasn’t his fault...

329
00:15:26,382 --> 00:15:28,918
he thinks it was Kang Woo Seung’s fault.

330
00:15:28,918 --> 00:15:30,353
That’s why he's still titleless.

331
00:15:30,353 --> 00:15:33,222
Stop taking down your own team
and wise up.

332
00:15:33,222 --> 00:15:34,757
Titleless Maeng Gong.

333
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,832
Team kill.

334
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,134
Title...

335
00:15:45,768 --> 00:15:47,103
Title...

336
00:15:47,103 --> 00:15:48,404
Titleless?

337
00:15:49,805 --> 00:15:51,974
Sir, hit the gas!

338
00:15:51,974 --> 00:15:53,576
Yeah, sure. I’m titleless.

339
00:15:53,576 --> 00:15:54,977
That doesn’t mean I’m trash, right?

340
00:15:54,977 --> 00:15:56,112
Am I trash?!

341
00:15:58,848 --> 00:16:02,184
(Angry Maeng Gong! About to blow!)

342
00:16:09,304 --> 00:16:13,709
(Angry Maeng Gong! About to blow!)

343
00:16:41,223 --> 00:16:42,458
Thank you for your time.

344
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,260
I swear, this is unfair.

345
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:46,262
I didn’t say anything false.

346
00:16:46,262 --> 00:16:47,396
Yes, thanks again.

347
00:16:50,266 --> 00:16:51,267
Username...

348
00:16:51,701 --> 00:16:52,935
"Today Toto."

349
00:16:52,935 --> 00:16:53,869
Here.

350
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,204
"I Know Everything."

351
00:16:55,438 --> 00:16:56,272
Here.

352
00:16:56,772 --> 00:16:58,774
- "Maeng Gong Dog."
- Here.

353
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,776
"Coach Maeng Cancel Club."

354
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,945
Is "Coach Maeng Cancel Club" here?

355
00:17:10,953 --> 00:17:11,988
Maeng Gong.

356
00:17:11,988 --> 00:17:14,156
Maeng Gong!

357
00:17:14,657 --> 00:17:15,658
Don't do that.

358
00:17:16,325 --> 00:17:17,893
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

359
00:17:17,893 --> 00:17:20,129
Why're you here?

360
00:17:21,197 --> 00:17:22,999
Do you remember me?

361
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:24,834
Wait, you’re a Maeng Gong's fan?

362
00:17:25,768 --> 00:17:28,437
You were the one
who made up that insane story?

363
00:17:28,437 --> 00:17:30,039
Then why did you betray us?

364
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:32,275
Why’d you ditch Just and join Big Pandas?

365
00:17:33,776 --> 00:17:36,279
And that justifies hate comments?

366
00:17:36,479 --> 00:17:38,281
I did it because I felt betrayed.

367
00:17:39,248 --> 00:17:42,184
But I feel happy seeing you.

368
00:17:42,718 --> 00:17:44,253
Maybe I still like you.

369
00:17:45,421 --> 00:17:48,190
Maybe I still like you.

370
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,825
So are you going to show me mercy?

371
00:17:49,825 --> 00:17:51,027
What? Mercy?

372
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,263
Why are you so angry ever
since you joined Big Pandas?

373
00:17:54,263 --> 00:17:56,198
That’s why people call you
Angry Maeng Gong.

374
00:17:56,198 --> 00:17:57,600
Stop it, please.

375
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,568
It’s so embarrassing, you know?

376
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:03,539
It’s my fault.

377
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:04,440
Have a seat.

378
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,274
Okay.

379
00:18:08,678 --> 00:18:10,479
I provide for my family.

380
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:13,649
A whole family relies on me.

381
00:18:13,649 --> 00:18:16,552
I did Sport Toto
as a side hustle but I lost.

382
00:18:17,219 --> 00:18:20,623
I didn’t mean to. I was just upset.

383
00:18:20,623 --> 00:18:22,558
I deleted all the hate comments.

384
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:23,559
We’re not negotiating.

385
00:18:24,293 --> 00:18:25,261
Let the law handle it.

386
00:18:26,362 --> 00:18:27,330
Maeng Gong.

387
00:18:29,365 --> 00:18:31,133
You swear you didn’t do Sport Toto?

388
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:32,868
You’re losing on purpose, right?

389
00:18:37,907 --> 00:18:39,575
I feel bad for your family.

390
00:18:41,777 --> 00:18:42,545
What?

391
00:18:42,912 --> 00:18:45,014
They believe someone like you is a father.

392
00:18:45,848 --> 00:18:47,149
Living together,

393
00:18:48,351 --> 00:18:50,419
called as a family...

394
00:18:51,687 --> 00:18:53,055
under your name on the document.

395
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,725
I feel sorry for them.

396
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,430
At least you can delete
your hate comments.

397
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,565
But your family...

398
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,068
can't just delete you, you know?

399
00:19:09,438 --> 00:19:10,306
Hey you!

400
00:19:11,207 --> 00:19:13,142
I’m suing you.

401
00:19:13,142 --> 00:19:14,610
You heard that?

402
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,512
You heard that, right?
Did you record it?

403
00:19:17,413 --> 00:19:18,881
I’m suing you too!

404
00:19:18,881 --> 00:19:19,749
Sit down.

405
00:19:19,749 --> 00:19:20,583
Alright!

406
00:19:25,221 --> 00:19:26,989
Can I leave now?

407
00:19:28,457 --> 00:19:30,760
(Hanseong Police Station)

408
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:35,064
That’s why I said
I wouldn’t waste time on this.

409
00:19:35,064 --> 00:19:36,933
Just follow the law.

410
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:39,201
The club’s worried about your reputation.

411
00:19:39,201 --> 00:19:40,770
So we'll punish a few as an example...

412
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,838
and the rest will be treated with mercy.

413
00:19:43,306 --> 00:19:45,007
Coach Bae, you saw it too.

414
00:19:45,007 --> 00:19:47,476
They don’t deserve any mercy.

415
00:19:47,476 --> 00:19:50,546
And hey, what's wrong with my reputation?

416
00:19:50,546 --> 00:19:53,316
What're you talking about?

417
00:19:53,316 --> 00:19:54,150
Stagnant water.

418
00:19:54,717 --> 00:19:56,786
Hold up.

419
00:19:58,187 --> 00:19:59,121
Rotten water?

420
00:20:00,389 --> 00:20:01,791
Who’s this punk?

421
00:20:04,193 --> 00:20:05,428
Hey,

422
00:20:05,428 --> 00:20:06,662
show me some mercy.

423
00:20:06,963 --> 00:20:07,897
Oh, it's you.

424
00:20:08,464 --> 00:20:11,534
You're the "Coach Maeng Cancel Club?"

425
00:20:13,536 --> 00:20:16,138
Oh, you're the hater with no morals...

426
00:20:16,138 --> 00:20:18,074
Yes, morality for the meal.

427
00:20:18,074 --> 00:20:19,342
Mmm, it's delicious.

428
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:21,544
Oh, my blood pressure.

429
00:20:21,544 --> 00:20:23,079
- My blood pressure is rising.
- So sweet.

430
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,381
Blood pressure overload.

431
00:20:25,381 --> 00:20:26,916
- Taxi just arrived.
- Oh, man.

432
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:27,516
Right here.

433
00:20:27,516 --> 00:20:29,952
Get him out of here.

434
00:20:29,952 --> 00:20:32,188
Don’t forget to measure
your blood pressure, coach.

435
00:20:32,188 --> 00:20:33,122
Hey, Coach Bae.

436
00:20:33,122 --> 00:20:35,725
We’re missing the next strategy email.
Please check that.

437
00:20:35,725 --> 00:20:36,692
Got it.

438
00:20:36,692 --> 00:20:37,727
- See you tomorrow.
- Alright.

439
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:38,694
Uh-huh.

440
00:20:40,596 --> 00:20:41,764
Driver, please go.

441
00:20:41,764 --> 00:20:42,698
What now?

442
00:20:42,698 --> 00:20:44,667
Hey, you! Coach Bae!

443
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:47,536
Hey, I think I’m being kidnapped...

444
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,745
Go Hwa Jin?

445
00:20:57,346 --> 00:20:58,481
What do you truly want?

446
00:21:01,984 --> 00:21:04,220
Show mercy. I’m a high school senior.

447
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,588
So what if you’re a senior?

448
00:21:06,088 --> 00:21:07,456
Being a minor means you can break the law?

449
00:21:07,456 --> 00:21:08,991
You think you can just post
whatever you want?

450
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,893
My post wasn’t hateful!

451
00:21:10,893 --> 00:21:12,061
I was making a petition.

452
00:21:12,061 --> 00:21:13,596
Don’t twist it like that.

453
00:21:14,664 --> 00:21:15,998
You don’t even know
what a petition is, do you?

454
00:21:15,998 --> 00:21:19,068
I was giving advice
because the coach is incompetent.

455
00:21:19,068 --> 00:21:20,236
So it's a petition, right?

456
00:21:21,604 --> 00:21:22,505
What?

457
00:21:23,306 --> 00:21:24,240
Incompetent?

458
00:21:24,974 --> 00:21:25,975
Incompetent?

459
00:21:26,442 --> 00:21:28,811
Hey, I crushed it during my prime.

460
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:31,314
I hit everything
including 3-pointers and layups.

461
00:21:31,314 --> 00:21:34,083
When I was on fire, I even dunked.

462
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,418
Come on.

463
00:21:35,418 --> 00:21:36,819
You coach the 7th place team.

464
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,488
Do you think you are competent?

465
00:21:40,356 --> 00:21:43,593
If you want to be a competent coach,
read my petition again.

466
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:44,727
It’s a masterpiece.

467
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:49,565
I think you want to teach me
after watching a few games.

468
00:21:49,565 --> 00:21:51,100
Mercy, mercy, mercy.

469
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,268
You little punk.

470
00:21:52,702 --> 00:21:55,571
Who taught you to cut off elders, huh?

471
00:21:56,172 --> 00:21:57,139
Nope.

472
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:01,210
I had no one to teach me, even parents.

473
00:22:09,752 --> 00:22:12,121
Hey, I didn’t mean to do that...

474
00:22:12,121 --> 00:22:13,189
It was a joke.

475
00:22:14,657 --> 00:22:15,858
You again!

476
00:22:15,858 --> 00:22:17,693
Get out of the car, right now!

477
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,662
Alright, shh.

478
00:22:20,229 --> 00:22:21,697
I’ll keep quiet.

479
00:22:21,697 --> 00:22:23,633
You’re headed to the same hospital, right?

480
00:22:24,467 --> 00:22:27,470
How did you know that?

481
00:22:28,304 --> 00:22:30,139
Are you seriously my fan or what?

482
00:22:30,139 --> 00:22:32,108
You left that comment
just for attention?

483
00:22:33,242 --> 00:22:35,111
You’re not even scary, just a mess.

484
00:22:35,711 --> 00:22:38,147
Just stop over there, please.

485
00:22:38,147 --> 00:22:39,482
- No, not yet.
- Just over here, please.

486
00:22:39,482 --> 00:22:41,284
No need to stop. Please keep going.

487
00:22:42,852 --> 00:22:45,288
I’m headed to that hospital too.
Let's share the ride.

488
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,433
Why do you keep following me?

489
00:23:30,433 --> 00:23:31,701
- Show mercy.
- No way.

490
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:32,969
- Please.
- I said no.

491
00:23:32,969 --> 00:23:33,803
Hey,

492
00:23:34,937 --> 00:23:35,972
aren’t you press the button?

493
00:23:36,572 --> 00:23:37,607
Floor 11, right?

494
00:23:38,007 --> 00:23:40,776
How do you know that?

495
00:23:40,776 --> 00:23:42,244
Who are you?

496
00:23:42,244 --> 00:23:43,145
Hey!

497
00:24:08,671 --> 00:24:09,839
What’s wrong with him?

498
00:24:18,266 --> 00:24:20,602
(Go Woo Jin)

499
00:24:20,604 --> 00:24:24,174
(Cheongdae Hospital)

500
00:24:27,023 --> 00:24:28,057
You didn’t sleep?

501
00:24:30,026 --> 00:24:31,260
You’re always just watching.

502
00:24:32,194 --> 00:24:33,195
Why not play basketball again?

503
00:24:47,443 --> 00:24:48,377
Hey.

504
00:24:50,146 --> 00:24:51,047
Go Woo Jin.

505
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,317
I met Maeng Gong today.

506
00:24:59,722 --> 00:25:00,856
He was just a regular old guy.

507
00:25:08,331 --> 00:25:09,665
What do you want me to do?

508
00:25:33,528 --> 00:25:36,998
(Maeng Jae Hee)
(Aged 14)

509
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,666
What're you up to?

510
00:26:18,434 --> 00:26:20,469
Why? What's wrong?

511
00:26:20,469 --> 00:26:22,638
Are you sleeping already?

512
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:24,974
Maeng Jae Hee.

513
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:26,642
Dad's here.

514
00:26:27,343 --> 00:26:29,912
Maeng Jae Hee, I said dad's here.

515
00:26:29,912 --> 00:26:31,380
You haven’t eaten yet, have you?

516
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,348
Me? I already...

517
00:26:32,348 --> 00:26:33,516
- Let's have dinner.
- I already..

518
00:26:33,516 --> 00:26:35,651
Just a minute.
Why is she acting like that?

519
00:26:35,651 --> 00:26:37,019
- Let's go.
- Maeng Jae Hee.

520
00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:38,754
- So hungry.
- Maeng Jae Hee...

521
00:26:40,089 --> 00:26:42,191
- Maeng Jae Hee.
- Come on.

522
00:26:48,931 --> 00:26:50,433
You brat!

523
00:26:50,433 --> 00:26:53,135
Look at him cussing out a player.

524
00:26:53,135 --> 00:26:54,470
It shows what kind of person he is.

525
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:57,940
That temper only seemed like passion
when he was a player.

526
00:26:58,608 --> 00:27:01,210
But at his age, that behavior...

527
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:03,379
is just straight-up madness.

528
00:27:03,379 --> 00:27:05,214
I’ve actually met Maeng Gong...

529
00:27:05,881 --> 00:27:07,416
off the court.

530
00:27:08,451 --> 00:27:09,919
Are you an insider? Tell us more.

531
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,021
He even got his jersey retired at Just.

532
00:27:12,021 --> 00:27:13,189
Why’d he leave?

533
00:27:13,189 --> 00:27:14,890
Probably greed.

534
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:17,593
Feel bad for Just fans.
They cheered for a traitor.

535
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:28,504
(Reflection)

536
00:27:28,971 --> 00:27:30,506
He's not a traitor.

537
00:27:30,506 --> 00:27:32,408
He didn’t switch teams for money.

538
00:27:51,027 --> 00:27:53,129
Why won’t Maeng Jae Hee face me?

539
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:55,364
Huh?

540
00:27:56,832 --> 00:27:58,134
When she was a baby,

541
00:27:59,335 --> 00:28:02,438
she used to freak out at syringe.

542
00:28:02,438 --> 00:28:04,573
So why does she look at me like I’m one?

543
00:28:05,274 --> 00:28:07,276
She's not feeling good today.

544
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,611
Why?

545
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:12,048
Kids have days like that.

546
00:28:12,448 --> 00:28:13,716
Wait, you don't know?

547
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,985
How can I know everything.

548
00:28:16,953 --> 00:28:19,855
You’re with her all the time.
How can't you know?

549
00:28:19,855 --> 00:28:21,924
There you go blaming again.

550
00:28:22,391 --> 00:28:24,126
I'm just sad.

551
00:28:24,126 --> 00:28:27,463
Seeing her face is the only thing
I live for.

552
00:28:27,463 --> 00:28:29,498
Why won’t she show it?

553
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:32,702
So do harder.

554
00:28:33,636 --> 00:28:34,570
Do what?

555
00:28:35,271 --> 00:28:38,407
Stop yelling and try smiling more.

556
00:28:38,407 --> 00:28:40,610
When did I ever yell?

557
00:28:41,043 --> 00:28:43,145
I watched the game
and you were yelling at the players...

558
00:28:43,145 --> 00:28:44,347
Hey, you idiot!

559
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,449
Is your head just for show?

560
00:28:46,449 --> 00:28:47,883
You were shouting like that.

561
00:28:47,883 --> 00:28:51,120
If I don’t do like that,
they won’t focus on it.

562
00:28:52,088 --> 00:28:53,356
In my day,

563
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:55,558
if I did turnover at a crucial moment,

564
00:28:55,558 --> 00:28:58,227
it was more than a scolding.

565
00:28:58,227 --> 00:29:01,464
Fans were upset and blocked the bus.

566
00:29:01,464 --> 00:29:03,432
They’d curse me out to my face.

567
00:29:03,432 --> 00:29:07,069
"You bastard! You piece of trash!"

568
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:09,071
Okay.

569
00:29:09,472 --> 00:29:10,439
That’s how it was.

570
00:29:11,274 --> 00:29:12,174
Yeah.

571
00:29:12,975 --> 00:29:13,943
Have some.

572
00:29:15,244 --> 00:29:16,145
That's true.

573
00:29:19,415 --> 00:29:20,483
I miss Maeng Jae Hee.

574
00:29:26,155 --> 00:29:27,056
Mercy.

575
00:29:32,662 --> 00:29:34,397
You stalker. Still there?

576
00:29:35,831 --> 00:29:37,300
Can’t you really forgive me?

577
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:38,734
Mercy?

578
00:29:39,835 --> 00:29:41,804
I don't have time for you. Beat it.

579
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:44,373
If I leave...

580
00:29:45,174 --> 00:29:46,175
will you forgive me?

581
00:29:46,175 --> 00:29:47,076
Back off.

582
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:47,910
If I back off...

583
00:29:48,477 --> 00:29:49,578
will you forgive me?

584
00:29:52,348 --> 00:29:55,718
Hey, that's for me as an adult.

585
00:29:55,718 --> 00:29:58,387
Last warning. No mercy.

586
00:29:58,921 --> 00:30:01,290
You'd pay the price that you hurt others.

587
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,358
And learn from it.

588
00:30:02,358 --> 00:30:04,226
That’s what responsibility is, you know?

589
00:30:12,702 --> 00:30:15,538
Maeng Gong, you're not the person
to say that.

590
00:30:18,541 --> 00:30:19,709
(Sigh)

591
00:30:23,546 --> 00:30:25,881
You begged Dad for this...

592
00:30:32,655 --> 00:30:33,556
Mom,

593
00:30:35,258 --> 00:30:36,525
Are we having money problems?

594
00:30:37,693 --> 00:30:41,130
Did dad switch teams for money
because of my hospital bills?

595
00:30:46,335 --> 00:30:47,503
No, it's not that.

596
00:30:48,037 --> 00:30:50,172
Your dad’s a capable man.

597
00:30:50,172 --> 00:30:53,109
Whatever the hospital costs,
it won’t shake us.

598
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,544
Then why did he leave Just?

599
00:30:56,679 --> 00:30:59,415
People says it's because of money.

600
00:30:59,749 --> 00:31:01,484
And they’re calling him a traitor.

601
00:31:01,784 --> 00:31:03,286
You read the comments again, didn’t you?

602
00:31:08,057 --> 00:31:08,891
Maeng Jae Hee,

603
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:13,095
your dad loves basketball more than money.

604
00:31:13,829 --> 00:31:15,164
You know that well, don't you?

605
00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:17,366
I know...

606
00:31:18,701 --> 00:31:20,369
but people keep blaming dad.

607
00:31:21,971 --> 00:31:23,906
Do you know why he left?

608
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,641
Not sure.

609
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:29,478
Ask him yourself.

610
00:31:30,613 --> 00:31:31,580
I don't want to.

611
00:31:55,504 --> 00:31:56,606
Ugh...

612
00:31:58,074 --> 00:32:00,042
such Maeng Gong.

613
00:32:06,048 --> 00:32:08,217
Losing to Red Z wasn’t his fault...

614
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:11,187
he thinks it was Kang Woo Seung’s fault.

615
00:32:12,421 --> 00:32:14,123
Stop taking down your own team...

616
00:32:14,657 --> 00:32:16,025
and wise up.

617
00:32:18,961 --> 00:32:19,962
Team kill?

618
00:32:22,198 --> 00:32:24,000
You think I told him to make turnover?

619
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,236
How can we win...

620
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:29,639
with a turnover like that at the clutch?

621
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:31,173
What kind of pro makes a turnover...

622
00:32:31,173 --> 00:32:33,409
like that in crunch time?

623
00:32:34,543 --> 00:32:35,745
In my day,

624
00:32:36,445 --> 00:32:38,547
in the 4th quarter,

625
00:32:38,547 --> 00:32:41,617
I never made a turnover.

626
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,227
(17 years ago)

627
00:33:03,572 --> 00:33:04,507
Five!

628
00:33:06,008 --> 00:33:06,909
Four!

629
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:08,878
Three!

630
00:33:09,812 --> 00:33:10,746
Two!

631
00:33:11,847 --> 00:33:12,815
One!

632
00:33:17,687 --> 00:33:20,690
(Maeng Gong)

633
00:33:24,894 --> 00:33:25,895
I don't understand.

634
00:33:26,262 --> 00:33:28,631
Why do you freak out in the clutch?

635
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,700
Why? Huh? Why are you trembling?

636
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,368
Why, why why? Why?

637
00:33:40,543 --> 00:33:41,477
You little thing,

638
00:33:41,777 --> 00:33:43,779
they say
even third-hand smoke is bad for lungs

639
00:33:43,779 --> 00:33:46,916
so I run away every time I see a smoker.
You will never know.

640
00:33:48,751 --> 00:33:51,988
Even when I can sleep only two hours
after an away game

641
00:33:52,421 --> 00:33:55,591
I always stop by the hospital

642
00:33:56,392 --> 00:33:59,028
just to catch a glimpse of you sleeping,

643
00:34:01,397 --> 00:34:04,767
but now you don't like to look at me and
even turn your back on me?

644
00:34:04,767 --> 00:34:05,635
Really?

645
00:34:06,035 --> 00:34:07,203
Yes, I don't.

646
00:34:07,203 --> 00:34:10,172
Why, why, why?
What make you hate me, why?

647
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,053
With FA coming up,

648
00:34:24,053 --> 00:34:26,622
your fans must be a little anxious.

649
00:34:26,622 --> 00:34:27,823
Anything you’d like to say?

650
00:34:27,823 --> 00:34:29,959
Just like I said on stage
when I first joined,

651
00:34:29,959 --> 00:34:31,961
I want to finish my career here at Just.

652
00:34:31,961 --> 00:34:34,630
If I hear from the club,
I will put them at the top of my list.

653
00:34:34,964 --> 00:34:38,601
What if another team offers you
a much higher deal?

654
00:34:39,101 --> 00:34:41,904
It might make me pause,
but still Just would be the first option.

655
00:34:42,772 --> 00:34:43,739
Right, Jae Hee?

656
00:35:07,663 --> 00:35:10,399
What's up, Coach Bae, Coach Bae.

657
00:35:11,634 --> 00:35:14,704
You should go home and rest
after you are off work,

658
00:35:14,704 --> 00:35:17,540
What are you doing out here
trying to see me?

659
00:35:17,873 --> 00:35:21,043
Big Pandas, 21 wins, 29 losses.

660
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,212
Currently ranked in 7th place.

661
00:35:23,212 --> 00:35:24,947
You think I don’t know that?

662
00:35:24,947 --> 00:35:26,382
Why are you bringing that up?

663
00:35:26,882 --> 00:35:28,584
Do you think we can make the playoffs?

664
00:35:29,852 --> 00:35:31,454
Are you a spy for Manager Choi?

665
00:35:31,687 --> 00:35:32,888
Are you here to mess with me?

666
00:35:35,958 --> 00:35:38,628
So, how was it
seeing your hater in person today?

667
00:35:41,197 --> 00:35:42,898
I just don't get it.

668
00:35:42,898 --> 00:35:47,803
Why do the players get so worked up over
every single what those say online?

669
00:35:47,803 --> 00:35:49,472
You do, too, though.

670
00:35:49,472 --> 00:35:50,573
When did I ever?

671
00:35:50,573 --> 00:35:52,942
Huh? How was it in the earlier game?

672
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,077
Woo Seung shouldn't have passed it to you,

673
00:35:55,077 --> 00:35:58,414
but you were so worked up, taking your
jacket off and stepping up to the court?

674
00:35:58,414 --> 00:35:59,248
How!

675
00:36:00,049 --> 00:36:01,984
How could I sit there and stay calm?

676
00:36:01,984 --> 00:36:04,887
We are on the edge, in the 7th place.

677
00:36:04,887 --> 00:36:06,589
Only four games left,

678
00:36:06,589 --> 00:36:07,757
but they seem lost,

679
00:36:07,757 --> 00:36:09,859
throwing up airballs in the clutch.

680
00:36:09,859 --> 00:36:11,527
How am I supposed to stay calm?

681
00:36:11,527 --> 00:36:12,461
Here you are so worked up, again.

682
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:16,799
Gong, not everyone is like you.

683
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,634
How many guys in this league

684
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,603
do you think can play like you?

685
00:36:20,603 --> 00:36:23,172
It's frustrating.
I'm frustrated, okay?

686
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:27,476
Kang Woo Seung, he was doing great assists
early in the season,

687
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:29,779
but then suddenly
he can’t even stay focused on the game.

688
00:36:29,779 --> 00:36:32,348
Park Joon Hyuk, he started off bold,

689
00:36:32,348 --> 00:36:36,018
so I thought
we finally hit the jackpot with a rookie,

690
00:36:36,018 --> 00:36:38,020
but now he's forcing reckless shots.

691
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,956
Chess, the one guy I trusted,

692
00:36:39,956 --> 00:36:42,258
why is his scoring getting worse?

693
00:36:42,258 --> 00:36:45,227
I can't go play for them, damn.

694
00:36:45,227 --> 00:36:46,462
"I'm back," here we go, Jordan!

695
00:36:47,063 --> 00:36:49,398
Are you going to
quit coaching and step back on the court?

696
00:36:50,032 --> 00:36:51,300
I mean,

697
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,502
why did you come to
a brand-new team with no star players?

698
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:54,837
You should've just stayed with Just.

699
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,839
There are
a bunch of national team players.

700
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:57,907
They can't,

701
00:37:10,953 --> 00:37:12,221
they can't win a championship.

702
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,726
That’s not like you.

703
00:37:16,726 --> 00:37:18,494
Did you leave because
you thought you couldn’t win there?

704
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,330
You can't hide the sun

705
00:37:22,798 --> 00:37:24,233
with your hand.

706
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:26,836
What?

707
00:37:29,305 --> 00:37:30,539
You can't hide the court

708
00:37:31,474 --> 00:37:32,808
with your hand.

709
00:37:33,509 --> 00:37:34,644
What are you talking about?

710
00:37:38,781 --> 00:37:41,484
Ah,
does Jae Hee still watch all your games?

711
00:37:43,753 --> 00:37:44,787
I have no idea.

712
00:37:45,521 --> 00:37:47,290
She doesn’t even want to see me
these days.

713
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,557
My little one, too,

714
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,960
doesn't watch our games
since we lose all the time.

715
00:37:52,161 --> 00:37:54,030
It turns out
the kids don't like losing either.

716
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,765
No one likes to lose.

717
00:37:55,765 --> 00:37:56,699
That's what I'm saying.

718
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,234
Let's win the games!

719
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:01,170
Let’s win the last four straight and
make it to the playoffs!

720
00:38:04,674 --> 00:38:05,508
Alright.

721
00:38:06,442 --> 00:38:07,977
Jae Hee is not seeing me,

722
00:38:07,977 --> 00:38:10,346
but maybe she’s still watching us play.

723
00:38:10,346 --> 00:38:11,180
Alright, let’s bring it home!

724
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,348
Let’s bring it home!

725
00:38:13,149 --> 00:38:14,050
Let’s bring it home!

726
00:38:19,989 --> 00:38:21,090
Gong, where are you going?

727
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,225
To bring it home.

728
00:38:24,627 --> 00:38:25,494
Have some more drinks.

729
00:38:26,329 --> 00:38:27,229
Gong!

730
00:38:27,496 --> 00:38:28,497
Coach!

731
00:38:29,298 --> 00:38:30,733
Are you going back to the office?

732
00:38:40,309 --> 00:38:41,277
What's up?

733
00:38:41,844 --> 00:38:43,145
I followed the plan.

734
00:38:43,145 --> 00:38:45,014
Why didn’t Woo Seung pass me the ball?

735
00:38:45,014 --> 00:38:48,150
Maybe you were not in a spot
where the captain could pass it to you.

736
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,151
No.

737
00:38:49,418 --> 00:38:50,987
I was in position. He could’ve passed it.

738
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:54,490
Well, maybe he saw two defenders on you.

739
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,058
Maybe that’s why he didn’t pass.

740
00:38:56,058 --> 00:38:57,960
No, no, there wasn’t a single defender
near Joon Hyuk.

741
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,228
- Ah, was there?
- Yeah.

742
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,097
I have no idea.

743
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:17,947
Captain.

744
00:39:17,947 --> 00:39:18,748
Yes?

745
00:39:19,081 --> 00:39:21,417
Would you not just look for
scoring chances for Jung Hyup

746
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:23,119
and give me the chances too?

747
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,888
No defender, wide open,
it was a perfect chance to take the shot.

748
00:39:25,888 --> 00:39:27,023
I got it.

749
00:39:27,023 --> 00:39:29,492
Did I get the play wrong?

750
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,093
During practice match,

751
00:39:31,093 --> 00:39:33,930
I kept looking for open threes,

752
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,631
but you never passed me the ball.

753
00:39:35,631 --> 00:39:36,666
Park Joon Hyuk.

754
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:37,533
Yes.

755
00:39:38,534 --> 00:39:40,036
- I said I got it.
- I mean,

756
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,939
you didn’t pass to me at all and

757
00:39:43,372 --> 00:39:46,242
maybe I’d misunderstood the play.

758
00:39:46,242 --> 00:39:47,076
look,

759
00:39:47,944 --> 00:39:50,980
Do I have to follow all your asks
even in a practice game?

760
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,548
Am I not even allowed to say that?

761
00:39:52,548 --> 00:39:53,716
Hey, hey, hey, stop it.

762
00:39:53,716 --> 00:39:55,584
Hey, hey, relax, Joon Hyuk.

763
00:39:55,584 --> 00:39:56,619
Relax? Me?

764
00:39:56,619 --> 00:39:57,753
We are heading out.

765
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,189
- Did I say anything wrong?
- Let's go, let's go.

766
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,658
It's ridiculous, seriously.

767
00:40:02,658 --> 00:40:04,193
Come on, let’s just go and take a shower.

768
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,296
That was a bit much.

769
00:40:13,903 --> 00:40:15,404
You’ve been acting kinda off lately.
What’s wrong?

770
00:40:16,172 --> 00:40:17,440
In the Red Z game,

771
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,376
I missed that pass and
we lost the possession

772
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:21,844
without even getting a shot off.

773
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,413
It was by one point.

774
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:28,517
This is how I am lately.

775
00:40:29,919 --> 00:40:32,855
My passing vision’s been narrowing.
I’ve lost some confidence, too.

776
00:40:33,823 --> 00:40:34,824
To be honest,

777
00:40:35,658 --> 00:40:37,994
I’m too tight to find him
even when Joon Hyuk is open.

778
00:40:42,598 --> 00:40:44,500
How can I bring that up to him?

779
00:41:14,563 --> 00:41:17,500
(6 Just)
(7 Big Pandas)

780
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:23,306
If I miss the playoffs again this year,

781
00:41:24,173 --> 00:41:25,908
I’m not Coach Maeng Gong, but Maeng Gone.

782
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:59,308
(Coach Maeng Gong)

783
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:01,277
As the regular season
heads toward its end,

784
00:42:01,277 --> 00:42:04,413
Competition for the playoffs
is heating up.

785
00:42:04,793 --> 00:42:07,229
(Big Panders VS Flash)
(the 2nd quarter)

786
00:42:09,586 --> 00:42:11,554
(Director Yang Donggeun)

787
00:42:12,695 --> 00:42:14,230
(Coach Jo Seongmin)

788
00:42:25,234 --> 00:42:26,068
Park Joon Hyuk

789
00:42:26,068 --> 00:42:27,970
Play smart, enough with the wild shots!

790
00:42:28,771 --> 00:42:29,872
Chess, pass, pass!

791
00:42:30,573 --> 00:42:32,108
What's your problem, Chess!

792
00:42:33,442 --> 00:42:35,011
Narrow, no, Kang Woo Seung!

793
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:36,912
You, man, you are not in lava!

794
00:42:36,912 --> 00:42:38,781
Pass the damn ball!
Use some spacing!

795
00:42:38,781 --> 00:42:40,182
Move back, move back, move back.

796
00:43:01,337 --> 00:43:02,672
Look at these kids, shit!

797
00:43:06,008 --> 00:43:06,976
Hey, Kang Woo Seung.

798
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:10,313
You’re now passing to the back of
your team player?

799
00:43:10,313 --> 00:43:12,315
- This ain’t dodgeball, man!
- I apologize.

800
00:43:14,016 --> 00:43:14,884
Park Joon Hyuk.

801
00:43:15,618 --> 00:43:18,154
You’re just sprinting up the court
with no clue where the ball is?

802
00:43:18,154 --> 00:43:19,588
This ain’t a track!

803
00:43:19,588 --> 00:43:20,523
I apologize.

804
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:23,092
All of you.

805
00:43:23,092 --> 00:43:25,127
Every single one of you -
completely out of it!

806
00:43:25,695 --> 00:43:27,964
What, are you blaming the haters again?

807
00:43:27,964 --> 00:43:29,332
What excuse is it this time?

808
00:43:29,932 --> 00:43:31,867
We’re at the edge.

809
00:43:31,867 --> 00:43:33,502
Every game counts.

810
00:43:33,502 --> 00:43:35,638
You have to realize
how much each game means now.

811
00:43:36,672 --> 00:43:38,107
You guys are pro.

812
00:43:38,107 --> 00:43:40,610
You guys are pro,
not amateurs at the park!

813
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:41,577
Got it?

814
00:43:57,226 --> 00:43:58,995
Okay, let’s lock in again.

815
00:43:59,996 --> 00:44:01,330
Let's go, let's go.

816
00:44:07,403 --> 00:44:08,304
Park Joon Hyuk.

817
00:44:12,875 --> 00:44:14,010
That was on purpose, right?

818
00:44:15,011 --> 00:44:17,280
If you’re that mad, go ahead and hit me,
but not out here on the court.

819
00:44:18,014 --> 00:44:19,682
You think a missed pass is all on me?

820
00:44:19,682 --> 00:44:21,484
You never even try to sync up.

821
00:44:21,484 --> 00:44:24,020
Don’t put that on me. Not my fault
you can't play point guard skills.

822
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:24,854
Fine.

823
00:44:25,154 --> 00:44:27,957
If you’re not getting passes,
maybe look at yourself.

824
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:30,526
Oh, so now you are not giving me any pass?

825
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,861
Park Joon Hyuk.

826
00:44:32,194 --> 00:44:33,095
Stop it.

827
00:44:33,496 --> 00:44:34,597
Damn.

828
00:44:35,564 --> 00:44:36,399
(Big Pandas VS Flash)

829
00:44:36,399 --> 00:44:37,600
It’s been a close battle
all throughout the fourth quarter.

830
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,101
The score difference
between Big Pandas and Flash

831
00:44:39,101 --> 00:44:41,570
hasn’t gone beyond three points.

832
00:44:43,606 --> 00:44:44,340
Cut him off!

833
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:47,610
Kang Woo Seung just signaled
to his teammates.

834
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,885
Hey, hey, Joon Hyuk's open right there!

835
00:44:55,885 --> 00:44:57,987
What’s the move
from point guard Kang Woo Seung?

836
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:02,725
Ah, and with that,

837
00:45:02,725 --> 00:45:05,394
Lee Semin from Flash is
out of the game for five fouls.

838
00:45:05,394 --> 00:45:06,529
It's foul-out.

839
00:45:06,529 --> 00:45:10,066
Kang Woo Seung read the play perfectly and
broght a great pass.

840
00:45:28,784 --> 00:45:30,052
You skipped me on purpose, right?

841
00:45:30,052 --> 00:45:31,087
What?

842
00:45:31,087 --> 00:45:32,221
A chance for Park Joon Hyuk?

843
00:45:32,221 --> 00:45:34,257
There was a way higher chance
from Choi Jung Hyup under the rim.

844
00:45:34,257 --> 00:45:35,291
How dare you!

845
00:45:36,292 --> 00:45:37,426
Hey, get over here.

846
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,694
Get up.

847
00:45:41,597 --> 00:45:43,499
Kang Woo Seung, Park Joon Hyuk, ejected.

848
00:45:43,499 --> 00:45:46,869
It seems like Big Pandas are
falling apart from the inside.

849
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:48,004
Shit, what is wrong with them?

850
00:45:48,004 --> 00:45:49,772
Their team chemistry has completely
broken down.

851
00:45:50,406 --> 00:45:53,075
A team falling apart needs someone
to hold it together.

852
00:45:53,075 --> 00:45:55,211
Isn’t Coach Maeng Gong
supposed to be the one?

853
00:45:58,247 --> 00:46:00,116
Move out, you are ejected.

854
00:46:06,188 --> 00:46:08,057
It gets annoying as a shooter

855
00:46:08,057 --> 00:46:09,558
if you don’t get
the ball when you’re open.

856
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,160
It happens during a game.

857
00:46:11,427 --> 00:46:13,763
What do you expect,
a point guard to have a rear-view

858
00:46:13,763 --> 00:46:14,630
with a camera or something?

859
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:17,934
And with that,
Flash takes the win today - 77 to 72.

860
00:46:17,934 --> 00:46:20,536
Ah, a tough loss for the Big Pandas.

861
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:22,838
Kang Woo Seung, Park Joon Hyuk.

862
00:46:22,838 --> 00:46:25,841
These two should fight for the playoffs,

863
00:46:25,841 --> 00:46:27,677
not with each other.

864
00:46:35,618 --> 00:46:37,019
What did I do wrong?

865
00:46:37,019 --> 00:46:39,555
- What did I do wrong?
- So what, it’s my fault now?

866
00:46:39,555 --> 00:46:42,091
You’re the one who drove me crazy first!

867
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:44,060
I’m the one losing my mind because of you!

868
00:46:44,627 --> 00:46:46,162
Hey, knock it off!

869
00:46:47,797 --> 00:46:48,898
The coach is on his way.

870
00:47:09,218 --> 00:47:10,186
Explain.

871
00:47:14,557 --> 00:47:15,458
Kang Woo Seung.

872
00:47:16,158 --> 00:47:17,159
Park Joon Hyuk.

873
00:47:18,227 --> 00:47:20,296
Explain me the situation on the court!

874
00:47:22,031 --> 00:47:23,666
Coach, please calm down.

875
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,268
Coach Bae,

876
00:47:25,868 --> 00:47:28,037
You seriously didn’t know anything
while the team is falling apart like this?

877
00:47:28,571 --> 00:47:29,605
I apologize.

878
00:47:29,872 --> 00:47:31,574
I can't understand

879
00:47:31,574 --> 00:47:33,809
why these two fought on the court!

880
00:47:35,678 --> 00:47:38,014
Anyone who knows should explain it.

881
00:47:40,383 --> 00:47:41,751
Tell me right now!

882
00:47:44,887 --> 00:47:46,555
You’ve got to be kidding me.

883
00:47:52,595 --> 00:47:54,030
Nobody’s leaving this room

884
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:55,665
until I get an answer.

885
00:47:55,898 --> 00:47:56,866
What the...

886
00:48:01,137 --> 00:48:02,271
Nothing?

887
00:48:02,939 --> 00:48:04,974
There should be a reason!

888
00:48:06,275 --> 00:48:07,977
How come did you guys fight
during the game?

889
00:48:07,977 --> 00:48:10,513
On the damn court?

890
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:12,748
The court’s not your place
for your personal boxing ring, you idiots!

891
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:15,484
Kang Woo Seung.

892
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:17,320
You should tell me.

893
00:48:19,055 --> 00:48:22,058
You’re the captain,
but you still can’t control your emotions

894
00:48:22,058 --> 00:48:23,893
and dragged this whole team into a mess!

895
00:48:23,893 --> 00:48:26,862
You think this is what I trusted you for

896
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:29,031
and gave your the position?

897
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,032
I apologize.

898
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:32,501
I apologize.

899
00:48:33,703 --> 00:48:37,506
You’ve got no respect
for the coach, or your team players.

900
00:48:37,506 --> 00:48:39,275
You are out there
acting like some out-of-control stray.

901
00:48:39,275 --> 00:48:41,377
You're no different from a rabid dog,
you hear me?!

902
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:42,111
I mean,

903
00:48:42,745 --> 00:48:43,679
Park Joon Hyuk.

904
00:48:45,481 --> 00:48:47,450
Tell me, why?

905
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:54,257
Because the point guard didn’t trust me.

906
00:48:55,157 --> 00:48:57,260
Didn’t you stop believing in him first?

907
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:58,828
- Coach!
- Hey, listen!

908
00:48:58,828 --> 00:49:01,230
How many shots did you force today?

909
00:49:01,597 --> 00:49:04,367
You don't trust everyone on the team.

910
00:49:04,367 --> 00:49:06,302
Then, what’s the point?

911
00:49:06,636 --> 00:49:07,903
Coach, it was my fault.

912
00:49:08,504 --> 00:49:10,706
I wasn’t seeing the floor clearly enough
to make the pass.

913
00:49:10,706 --> 00:49:12,575
Come on, how is this your fault?

914
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:14,644
Joon Hyuk,
are you seriously gonna keep doing this?

915
00:49:14,644 --> 00:49:15,578
No,

916
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:18,214
You can’t just take one person’s side.

917
00:49:18,214 --> 00:49:21,250
Right, Joon Hyuk is just a rookie.
The captain could’ve let him go just once.

918
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,785
He can't just keep taking it!

919
00:49:22,785 --> 00:49:25,388
Joon Hyuk, you was too firm.
You should apologize.

920
00:49:25,388 --> 00:49:27,490
- Hey, Chess.
- Chess, that's not how it works!

921
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:29,992
Yoo Jin Ki, Kim Min Woo, watch your tone!

922
00:49:29,992 --> 00:49:32,395
Joon Hyuk messed up for sure,
but still, the captain is...

923
00:49:33,763 --> 00:49:35,398
Enough!

924
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,038
This,

925
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,106
you call this a team?

926
00:49:45,007 --> 00:49:46,042
A team?

927
00:49:47,576 --> 00:49:49,011
I don't.

928
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:51,948
I don't see you all in one team,

929
00:49:57,086 --> 00:49:58,754
but a bunch of irresponsible punks.

930
00:50:00,256 --> 00:50:02,558
You’re gonna feel the consequences of

931
00:50:03,426 --> 00:50:06,462
what you did today.

932
00:50:32,908 --> 00:50:34,910
(Coach Maeng Cancel Club)

933
00:50:34,964 --> 00:50:36,365
The butterfly effect of teamkilling:

934
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:39,028
Maeng Gone tears into his players,

935
00:50:39,028 --> 00:50:40,329
the players tear into each other,

936
00:50:41,264 --> 00:50:42,698
and in the end,
the team’s performance gets torn apart.

937
00:50:44,133 --> 00:50:45,968
Maeng Gone is killing this team.

938
00:50:46,269 --> 00:50:47,436
Resignation is the only answer.

939
00:50:58,514 --> 00:51:00,716
- You can’t get in here.
- Why is it so loud in here?

940
00:51:00,716 --> 00:51:02,118
You can’t go in, I’m sorry.

941
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:07,323
I’m telling you, your dad rigged the game!

942
00:51:07,323 --> 00:51:09,058
Look how he lost the game again today.

943
00:51:09,058 --> 00:51:10,760
My dad would never do something like that.

944
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,029
Wait, wait - let me go through!

945
00:51:13,029 --> 00:51:14,397
Jae Hee, Jae Hee.

946
00:51:15,331 --> 00:51:16,165
Jae Hee.

947
00:51:16,432 --> 00:51:17,900
- Dad...
- Are you okay?

948
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,703
I’ll make sure the truth
comes out Maeng Gong.

949
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:24,273
Your lies, your rigging!
I’ll bring it all to light.

950
00:51:24,273 --> 00:51:26,776
Please, get that person
out of here right now.

951
00:51:26,776 --> 00:51:28,177
Hold on, hold on, just one thing.

952
00:51:28,177 --> 00:51:29,478
Last one, last one, last one.

953
00:51:29,912 --> 00:51:33,449
So you’re gonna bet on
the rest of the games

954
00:51:33,449 --> 00:51:34,984
and make a big one, right?

955
00:51:34,984 --> 00:51:37,687
Hey, is it under or over?
Just tell me that.

956
00:51:37,687 --> 00:51:39,789
Let me cash in too, just once!

957
00:51:39,789 --> 00:51:40,957
Let me in, too!

958
00:51:42,124 --> 00:51:43,025
Are you okay?

959
00:51:44,527 --> 00:51:46,128
Why should I have to hear that?

960
00:51:47,496 --> 00:51:48,431
Jae Hee.

961
00:51:49,031 --> 00:51:51,067
ack when you were with Just,

962
00:51:51,067 --> 00:51:52,501
because I am your daughter,

963
00:51:52,501 --> 00:51:54,737
they supported me
just for being your daughter.

964
00:51:55,371 --> 00:51:57,073
But now?

965
00:51:57,073 --> 00:51:59,408
Every time you lose,
my DMs are flooded with haters.

966
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:00,343
Who?

967
00:52:00,343 --> 00:52:02,178
Who said that to you?

968
00:52:02,979 --> 00:52:05,448
That’s why I told you
to stay off social media.

969
00:52:05,448 --> 00:52:06,315
Then what,

970
00:52:07,149 --> 00:52:09,485
you want me locked up in this hospital
like it’s a prison

971
00:52:09,485 --> 00:52:11,387
not hearing anything, not seeing anything?

972
00:52:13,089 --> 00:52:14,290
A prison?

973
00:52:15,291 --> 00:52:16,192
Dad.

974
00:52:18,027 --> 00:52:19,262
Why did you leave Just?

975
00:52:19,662 --> 00:52:21,430
Jae Hee, there is something...

976
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:25,101
I’ll explain everything just not now,
okay?

977
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:26,435
Do you know

978
00:52:27,236 --> 00:52:29,038
what they’re saying about you, dad?

979
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,776
They call you a traitor who chased money.

980
00:52:37,313 --> 00:52:38,481
I wish you would...

981
00:52:40,983 --> 00:52:42,852
just stop doing anything.

982
00:52:46,789 --> 00:52:47,823
Stop being

983
00:52:49,992 --> 00:52:51,127
a coach.

984
00:52:55,998 --> 00:52:57,266
Jae Hee, Jae Hee.

985
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:11,881
Stop being...

986
00:53:14,083 --> 00:53:15,117
a coach.

987
00:53:20,323 --> 00:53:23,926
Did I leave Just to get this
from my daughter?

988
00:53:25,962 --> 00:53:27,330
Is this the best I can do?

989
00:53:28,698 --> 00:53:30,600
Is this why I left?

990
00:53:40,703 --> 00:53:42,487
Hey, Maeng Gong...

991
00:53:42,489 --> 00:53:43,423
(3 years ago)

992
00:53:43,425 --> 00:53:44,293
Cheers.

993
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:47,249
Oh, I need to head back to the office.

994
00:53:49,151 --> 00:53:50,386
You haven’t changed a bit.

995
00:53:52,154 --> 00:53:54,824
Just one win away from the semifinals.

996
00:53:55,992 --> 00:53:56,959
How do you feel now?

997
00:53:58,628 --> 00:54:00,830
Why are you asking something so obvious?

998
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:02,231
You already know.

999
00:54:03,966 --> 00:54:04,867
Maeng Gong.

1000
00:54:07,136 --> 00:54:09,071
You’ve done enough as it is.

1001
00:54:10,406 --> 00:54:11,340
Let’s leave it here.

1002
00:54:15,645 --> 00:54:16,512
Sorry?

1003
00:54:16,812 --> 00:54:17,880
You saw the news, right?

1004
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:20,816
Just Group’s losses are massive.

1005
00:54:23,252 --> 00:54:24,820
Within the next three years...

1006
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:27,223
They plan to sell the basketball team.

1007
00:54:28,424 --> 00:54:31,193
They’re just keeping it alive
until a takeover,

1008
00:54:32,662 --> 00:54:34,730
but there won’t be any major investment
in the team.

1009
00:54:38,401 --> 00:54:41,971
Wait, you mean
in the next game we should...

1010
00:54:43,172 --> 00:54:44,874
lose?

1011
00:54:44,874 --> 00:54:47,176
I’m telling you to be flexible.

1012
00:54:47,176 --> 00:54:48,144
But...

1013
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:54,283
Doesn’t that mean the same thing?

1014
00:54:56,852 --> 00:54:58,621
If we win...

1015
00:55:00,089 --> 00:55:01,624
you know, we have to pay
the sponsorship fee.

1016
00:55:02,558 --> 00:55:03,659
Yeah, I know.

1017
00:55:03,659 --> 00:55:04,627
Maeng Gong.

1018
00:55:06,128 --> 00:55:07,363
We’re out of budget.

1019
00:55:08,364 --> 00:55:09,665
Please don’t cause any trouble.

1020
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:19,342
Winning...

1021
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:22,111
is “causing trouble”?

1022
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:24,847
Please understand the club’s situation.

1023
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:29,518
If you can hold on three years
until the sale...

1024
00:55:30,519 --> 00:55:34,023
I’ll get you a spot
with another club, guaranteed.

1025
00:55:34,624 --> 00:55:35,558
Nope.

1026
00:55:37,827 --> 00:55:39,295
I can't do that.

1027
00:55:39,295 --> 00:55:40,229
No,

1028
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:42,131
I won't do that.

1029
00:55:42,131 --> 00:55:43,032
You won't?

1030
00:55:45,735 --> 00:55:48,204
The team retired your number, you know.

1031
00:55:48,204 --> 00:55:50,006
Then you should help
when we’re struggling.

1032
00:55:50,006 --> 00:55:51,607
I received that from this team...

1033
00:55:52,642 --> 00:55:55,478
so I can’t do this.

1034
00:55:56,512 --> 00:55:57,580
Why are you...

1035
00:56:00,016 --> 00:56:01,984
making a joke of our team?

1036
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:05,855
If you're planning to sell the team...

1037
00:56:06,522 --> 00:56:08,658
you should be encouraging us

1038
00:56:08,658 --> 00:56:11,661
to do our best until then.

1039
00:56:11,661 --> 00:56:13,529
A good record comes with a price!

1040
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:19,635
Don’t you know
we owe the players bonuses...

1041
00:56:19,635 --> 00:56:21,671
since we already made the playoffs
this season?

1042
00:56:24,874 --> 00:56:26,075
Go ahead, see what happens.

1043
00:56:27,376 --> 00:56:29,378
If you keep acting like this,

1044
00:56:29,378 --> 00:56:30,846
you’ll be gone before your contract’s up.

1045
00:56:34,617 --> 00:56:35,518
Understood.

1046
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:39,355
Whatever decision the club makes...

1047
00:56:40,623 --> 00:56:41,724
I’ll accept it.

1048
00:56:41,724 --> 00:56:42,858
However, I'll...

1049
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,362
do my best...

1050
00:56:46,362 --> 00:56:47,363
for the next game...

1051
00:56:48,731 --> 00:56:49,865
and...

1052
00:56:52,168 --> 00:56:53,636
every time we play.

1053
00:56:59,976 --> 00:57:01,043
No way.

1054
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:02,845
What’s that?

1055
00:57:08,818 --> 00:57:10,586
Come on, you reading fake news?

1056
00:57:10,586 --> 00:57:12,321
No, it’s all over the news.

1057
00:57:12,755 --> 00:57:13,656
What?

1058
00:57:15,391 --> 00:57:17,193
He’s leaving us and joining Big Pandas?

1059
00:57:17,193 --> 00:57:18,761
- For real?
- Isn’t that just a rumor?

1060
00:57:18,761 --> 00:57:19,862
This is fake news.

1061
00:57:19,862 --> 00:57:22,531
It’s real. He’s leaving us all behind.

1062
00:57:31,173 --> 00:57:33,042
Why’s it such a mess already?

1063
00:57:36,711 --> 00:57:37,579
(Maeng Gong joins Big Pandas as new coach)

1064
00:57:37,581 --> 00:57:38,849
This can’t be it.

1065
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:41,229
Why is Maeng Gong joining another team?

1066
00:57:41,317 --> 00:57:44,520
I can’t believe
Maeng Gong would stab us in the back.

1067
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:47,023
He unilaterally terminated his contract
with the team.

1068
00:57:47,023 --> 00:57:49,525
Today’s the last game.
Is he planning to lose?

1069
00:57:49,525 --> 00:57:51,327
It's a top-tier treatment.

1070
00:57:51,327 --> 00:57:52,595
He’s blinded by greed.

1071
00:57:52,595 --> 00:57:54,997
Don’t talk like that.
He's not that kind of person.

1072
00:57:54,997 --> 00:57:57,133
- It's in the news.
- He's coming.

1073
00:57:57,133 --> 00:57:58,267
Maeng Gong is here!

1074
00:57:58,701 --> 00:58:00,569
- Is that Maeng Gong?
- Maeng Gong!

1075
00:58:00,569 --> 00:58:02,438
- Hey!
- Maeng Gong!

1076
00:58:02,438 --> 00:58:04,473
- Maeng Gong!
- Hey, Maeng Gong!

1077
00:58:04,473 --> 00:58:06,609
- Maeng Gong!
- How could you be so irresponsible?

1078
00:58:06,609 --> 00:58:09,845
Maeng Gong.

1079
00:58:10,546 --> 00:58:13,683
Maeng Gong, that's not like you.

1080
00:58:15,284 --> 00:58:16,986
Maeng Gong!

1081
00:58:16,986 --> 00:58:18,854
Maeng Gong's going to Big Pandas.

1082
00:58:18,854 --> 00:58:20,222
This is betrayal.

1083
00:58:20,222 --> 00:58:22,091
How could he just abandon Just like that?

1084
00:58:22,091 --> 00:58:23,477
From now on, no more Maeng Gong.

1085
00:58:23,479 --> 00:58:26,849
(Just)

1086
00:58:47,416 --> 00:58:48,684
You were a smoker back then, weren’t you?

1087
00:58:51,687 --> 00:58:52,989
Do all the players sneak smokes like that?

1088
00:58:52,989 --> 00:58:53,923
Get out.

1089
00:58:54,457 --> 00:58:57,660
I admit asking for mercy was shameless.

1090
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:58,894
If you get it, go.

1091
00:58:58,894 --> 00:59:00,496
Big Pandas, currently ranked 7th.

1092
00:59:01,564 --> 00:59:03,232
One game behind 6th-place Just.

1093
00:59:03,966 --> 00:59:04,900
Aren’t you leaving?

1094
00:59:05,134 --> 00:59:07,770
If your team lose
one of the three remaining games...

1095
00:59:08,537 --> 00:59:10,273
you're out of the playoffs.

1096
00:59:10,473 --> 00:59:11,507
I’ll go.

1097
00:59:11,507 --> 00:59:12,475
Maeng Gong,

1098
00:59:13,576 --> 00:59:14,844
are the Big Pandas really one team?

1099
00:59:15,544 --> 00:59:16,445
What?

1100
00:59:19,148 --> 00:59:21,484
Even you don’t see them as a team, do you?

1101
00:59:24,086 --> 00:59:26,222
There are assist king Kang Woo Seung,

1102
00:59:26,622 --> 00:59:28,691
top-three rebounder Choi Jung Hyup,

1103
00:59:29,325 --> 00:59:31,494
high-scoring foreign player Chess,

1104
00:59:32,061 --> 00:59:34,630
solid backups Kim Min Woo and Yoo Jin Ki.

1105
00:59:36,666 --> 00:59:37,934
That lineup, and you’re still 7th?

1106
00:59:38,701 --> 00:59:41,304
If I were you, I’d be ashamed.

1107
00:59:41,304 --> 00:59:43,172
I'm mad!

1108
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:45,841
Even if I plan strategies all night...

1109
00:59:45,841 --> 00:59:48,511
everything falls apart
once the game starts.

1110
00:59:49,178 --> 00:59:52,682
I push training nonstop
just to build teamwork...

1111
00:59:52,682 --> 00:59:55,284
but just one big turnover mess
in 4th quarter.

1112
00:59:55,284 --> 00:59:58,087
All the off-court arguments...

1113
00:59:58,087 --> 01:00:00,356
now it’s all happening on the court.

1114
01:00:00,556 --> 01:00:01,591
I know.

1115
01:00:03,693 --> 01:00:04,760
It's hard to see Big Pandas

1116
01:00:06,295 --> 01:00:08,297
as one team.

1117
01:00:10,266 --> 01:00:11,767
I don't know what I missed.

1118
01:00:12,635 --> 01:00:14,470
where I messed up.

1119
01:00:15,037 --> 01:00:18,341
Maybe the best thing for the team
is for me to resign.

1120
01:00:18,341 --> 01:00:19,909
My head’s about to explode right now.

1121
01:00:21,611 --> 01:00:22,545
Resignation.

1122
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:25,014
That answer is easy.

1123
01:00:26,682 --> 01:00:27,817
But there’s another way.

1124
01:00:29,885 --> 01:00:30,720
Another way?

1125
01:00:31,621 --> 01:00:32,622
What's that?

1126
01:00:34,957 --> 01:00:36,225
I’ll make sure you win.

1127
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:38,694
What?

1128
01:00:38,694 --> 01:00:40,596
I’ll get Big Pandas to the playoffs.

1129
01:00:41,264 --> 01:00:42,164
But in return...

1130
01:00:42,965 --> 01:00:45,234
Forgive me for the hate comments I wrote.

1131
01:00:45,234 --> 01:00:46,269
Sounds fair?

1132
01:00:46,269 --> 01:00:49,639
Mercy again? Don’t you ever get tired?

1133
01:00:49,639 --> 01:00:50,873
Don’t you want that playoff spot?

1134
01:00:50,873 --> 01:00:53,843
Hey, how are you possibly
getting us there?

1135
01:00:53,843 --> 01:00:54,977
There's a way.

1136
01:00:55,645 --> 01:00:57,079
So learn from me.

1137
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:01,284
You think I’d learn anything
from a bratty hater like you?

1138
01:01:01,651 --> 01:01:02,451
Huh?

1139
01:01:02,451 --> 01:01:05,521
Do you even know how many years
I’ve been in basketball?

1140
01:01:05,921 --> 01:01:08,791
So what? You still lose all the time.

1141
01:01:08,791 --> 01:01:10,126
Who always loses?

1142
01:01:10,126 --> 01:01:11,961
Why you ignore 21 wins?

1143
01:01:12,695 --> 01:01:13,963
I’ll teach you

1144
01:01:15,064 --> 01:01:16,532
something you don’t know.

1145
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:18,167
Something?

1146
01:01:19,435 --> 01:01:21,904
Don't act like that and just say it.

1147
01:01:21,904 --> 01:01:23,039
What don’t I know?

1148
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:24,907
If you knew, you’d be winning by now.

1149
01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:30,880
You think I wouldn’t know something
even you know?

1150
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:31,814
Yes.

1151
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:34,283
- You don’t know.
- About what exactly?

1152
01:01:34,984 --> 01:01:35,785
You want to know?

1153
01:01:38,087 --> 01:01:40,289
Do you want to know what's in my head?

1154
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:42,525
I’ll tell you everything.

1155
01:01:42,525 --> 01:01:44,460
Even if I ask you to coach
in a wedding dress...

1156
01:01:45,328 --> 01:01:47,964
you'll carry a veil and bouquet...

1157
01:01:47,964 --> 01:01:49,198
to know it.

1158
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:52,268
The secret.

1159
01:01:56,339 --> 01:01:58,941
You want know how to make the playoffs...

1160
01:01:58,941 --> 01:02:02,011
even if you’ve got to team up
with a teenage hater.

1161
01:02:03,913 --> 01:02:05,014
Then how about this?

1162
01:02:05,615 --> 01:02:07,817
I’ll beg you for forgiveness...

1163
01:02:07,817 --> 01:02:11,320
and you pretend to fall for it.

1164
01:02:13,089 --> 01:02:15,224
Keep talking like that helps.

1165
01:02:15,224 --> 01:02:16,659
I’ve got nothing to lose here.

1166
01:02:16,659 --> 01:02:18,594
I know it sounds insane, but trust me.

1167
01:02:19,295 --> 01:02:21,664
I want Big Pandas
to make the playoffs too.

1168
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,635
For real.

1169
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:33,142
Playoffs,

1170
01:02:35,077 --> 01:02:36,012
you want it?

1171
01:02:38,781 --> 01:02:39,715
Playoffs.

1172
01:02:41,684 --> 01:02:42,885
Playoffs...

1173
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:44,720
Hey, hey, hey.

1174
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,889
Alright, tell me.
What’s your secret plan?

1175
01:02:48,124 --> 01:02:49,225
If you really want to know...

1176
01:02:49,659 --> 01:02:51,160
give me mercy.

1177
01:02:52,228 --> 01:02:53,229
You...

1178
01:02:57,433 --> 01:03:00,736
If you’re messing around this time,
no more mercy.

1179
01:03:01,237 --> 01:03:02,171
Of course.

1180
01:03:25,141 --> 01:03:28,077
(A Head Coach’s Turnover)

1181
01:03:28,564 --> 01:03:29,799
(Special thanks to Lee Seung Jun,
Moon Kyung Eun)

1182
01:03:29,801 --> 01:03:31,035
