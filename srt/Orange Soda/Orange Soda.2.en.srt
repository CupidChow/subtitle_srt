00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,310
After the Dragon Boat Festival,

4
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,520
the most important thing
for families with a 12th grade student

5
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,960
is the college entrance exam.

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,990
(1 step further to the dream, good luck on the exam)
Tomorrow is the first day of the exam.

7
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,110
We wish all the candidates

8
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,560
to get your desired score.

9
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:53,790
After the music,

10
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,520
let's get back to today's topic,

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,640
what is the most
unforgettable moment in high school?

12
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,790
Waiting for your answers.

13
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,900
(Maoxi County People's Radio Station)

00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,420
(Maoxi County People's Radio Station
To Zhou Yu)

15
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,480
Zhou Yu.

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,120
It's been seven years.

17
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,680
I can finally see you again.

18
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,150
Let's get back to the topic.

19
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,560
This is from an anonymous person.

20
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,120
I graduated f
rom Maoxi No. 1 Middle School

21
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,200
like most people in the county.

22
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,790
The most unforgettable picture

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,200
is that I could see the girl I like

24
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,310
every day at school.

25
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,640
She would listen to MP3
on her way to school

26
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,280
and hold the pancakes her mom made.

27
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,680
Every time I saw this girl,

28
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,280
(2010)
I told myself,

29
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,240
"One day,

30
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,280
One day,

31
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,430
- I will get you."
- I will get you.

32
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,240
Hi, Director Wang.

33
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,710
Zhou Yu.

34
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,150
One more year to go.

35
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,710
Study hard.

36
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,200
Go, go.

37
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,910
Cheng Yuzhou, what are you looking at?

38
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,910
Remember what I told you?

39
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,680
Don't mess with Basin Wang.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,520
Otherwise, you're done this semester.

41
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,280
- Basin Wang?
- What basin?

42
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,960
Nothing, nothing.

43
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,840
The basin relief.

44
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,030
Mr. Wang, I just transferred here.

45
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,280
Wanyue was telling me

46
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,030
our county is located in a basin,

47
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,970
and I should keep it in mind.

48
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,680
- Go.
- See you, sir.

49
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,680
- Come on.
- The bell is ringing.

50
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,030
Let's hurry, come on.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,960
Lu Yang, wait.

52
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,030
Why are you late in your senior year?

53
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,310
You might as well drop out.

54
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,150
I wish I could.

55
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,840
Don't talk nonsense.

56
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,270
Crouch down.

57
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,270
Crouch down.

58
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,360
Can't believe it.

59
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,800
Yan Ci.

60
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,150
You're late on the first day.

61
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,030
Come and crouch down.

62
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,520
Director Wang.

63
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,520
Yan Ci is late because of me.

64
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,470
Please don't blame him.

65
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,360
You're covering for him, Mr. Li.

66
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,000
It was an emergency.

67
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,030
Behave yourself.

68
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,840
I want someone to cover for me.

69
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,190
What are you mumbling about?

70
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,800
Walk back like this.

71
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,590
What are you doing?

72
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,470
Lu Yang, got hurt on the first day?

73
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,430
It's all Basin Wang's fault.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,840
Zhou Yu.

75
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,870
Why are you sitting in my seat?

76
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,520
What's wrong with that?

77
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,430
Don't listen to her nonsense.

78
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,560
Mr. Li said

79
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,710
we should rearrange the seats

80
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,160
according to the last final exam grade.

81
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,680
So we're sitting randomly now.

82
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,080
According to you,

83
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,430
it's only fair that I, who ranked last,

84
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,870
sit with

85
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,960
the one who ranked first.

86
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,360
Mr. Li is here.

87
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,640
Stand up.

88
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,270
Hello, Mr. Li.

89
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,920
You're not behaving yourselves.

90
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,430
So cute.

91
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,270
Sit down.

92
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,000
Cheng Wanyue.

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,510
I didn't know
your cousin was so handsome.

94
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,720
Sure. We have good genes in our family.

95
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,270
Allow me to introduce.

96
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,490
This is the new student
who just transferred from Hechuan,

97
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,510
Cheng Yuzhou.

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,720
Introduce yourself.

99
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,310
Hi everyone, I'm Cheng Yuzhou.

100
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,160
Yu means "meeting",

101
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,120
and zhou means "boat".

102
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,270
I hope we can get along well

103
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,040
in this semester.

104
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,070
A round of applause.

105
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,560
Let me see where

106
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,070
should Cheng Yuzhou sit.

107
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,630
(Seating Chart)
Let me check.

108
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,440
Mr. Li.

109
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,160
I want to sit next to Yan Ci.

110
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,360
I heard Yan Ci ranked first.

111
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,160
I want to study with him

112
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,310
this semester.

113
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,830
Cheng Yuzhou, are you serious?

114
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,590
Yan Ci,

115
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,480
would you like to sit with Cheng Yuzhou?

116
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,560
Whatever.

117
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,720
OK, it's settled then.

118
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,400
Lu Yang,

119
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,920
what are you doing with a camera?

120
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,160
It's a basketball game.

121
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,500
(Basketball Tournament)
As the head of propaganda,

122
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,510
I have to take some photos.

123
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,270
Stand on your tiptoes then.

124
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,070
Don't only take our bust shots.

125
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,830
I won't worry about that.

126
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,600
I'm just worried people may think

127
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,360
you're in a women's basketball team.

128
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,350
You...

129
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,400
Yan Ci.

130
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,950
Let me introduce.

131
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,750
This is the MVP player from last year,

132
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,310
Yan Ci, king of basketball.

133
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,870
Say something to everyone.

134
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,920
I don't know the others well.

135
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,160
Please help me get the school uniform.

136
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,220
Wanyue is the Recreation & Sports Secretary.

137
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,160
It's hard to get her do anything for me.

138
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,600
If you don't wanna say something,

139
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,480
make a shooting form.

140
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,750
Do you usually play basketball?

141
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,710
Occasionally.

142
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,950
There is a basketball game
in our school every year.

143
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,800
Each class will have a team.

144
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,270
I think Wanyue will be happy

145
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,480
if you can join.

146
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,200
What about you?

147
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,470
Me?

148
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,000
Will you be happy?

149
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,520
Be careful!

150
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,350
Sorry.

151
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,950
Hey, throw the ball over.

152
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,950
Use your eyes when you play.

153
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,000
My god.

154
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,070
It's unbelievable.

155
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,190
There's a great rival for Yan Ci.

156
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,360
Looks like this year's MVP

157
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,560
is up for grabs again.

158
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,870
Will it be the new transfer student

159
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,630
or our king of basketball?

160
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,950
- Watch out.
- Yan... Ci.

161
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,270
Who?

162
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,440
Mr. Li.

163
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,390
(Teacher's Office)
Why did you miss the final exam?

164
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,080
Something came up.

165
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,600
Do you know how happy I was

166
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,070
that you came to school?

167
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,270
With your grades,
there won't be any problem

168
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,520
for you to get into a good university.

169
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,030
You can't give up on yourself

170
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,510
and ruin your future.

171
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,960
You're only 18.

172
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,480
Think more about your future.

173
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,870
There's only one semester left.

174
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,960
Be grounded.

175
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,270
I think you should know it clearly.

176
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,840
If you have problems,

177
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,270
you can tell me.

178
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,870
It doesn't matter
whether it's on or off campus.

179
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,040
Got it?

180
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,350
Yeah.

181
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:05,990
Go back to class.

182
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,840
His family got into trouble?

183
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,720
Yuzhou, think about
joining the basketball team.

184
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,840
No.

185
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,200
Yuzhou.

186
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,360
You're the best cousin in the world.

187
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,630
I know you're good at playing basketball.

188
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,960
Heaven is about to confer
a great responsibility on man.

189
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,270
Don't you want to show

190
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,240
your own talent?

191
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,080
No.

192
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,550
All the girls in school will cry over this.

193
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,720
Can you bear to see it?

194
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,230
Moreover,

195
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,960
there will be a prize if you win.

196
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,160
- Not interested.
- You...

197
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,540
(Come and see!)

198
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,380
(I think everyone saw it.)

199
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,720
(Zhou Yu from Class 1, Grade 12
got wet.)

200
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,960
Who?

201
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,030
Alright, I won't force you.

202
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,600
You don't have to react like this.

203
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,360
Whatever you see on your phone,

204
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,480
don't tell Zhou Yu.

205
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,280
What?

206
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,790
You're not going back?

207
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,230
Zhou Yu.

208
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,280
Sorry.

209
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,550
- Is it broken?
- It's fine.

210
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,720
It's her. It's her.

211
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,840
- That's her.
- Yeah.

212
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,360
What's wrong?

213
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,230
Nothing.

214
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,750
Cheng Wanyue told me to ask you

215
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,870
if you wanna go to her home.

216
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,840
No, I need to go back home.

217
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,670
I asked Yan Ci

218
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,080
to discuss the last question
on the test paper, right?

219
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,960
I gotta go.
