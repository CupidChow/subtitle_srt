=Episode 16=

3
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:45,590
This is...

4
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,560
I asked the doctor about Wanyue's situation.

5
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,640
She can still eat fruits.

6
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,520
And she likes the loquat that we grow,

7
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,360
so...

8
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,280
It's late. Get in the car.

9
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,600
It's okay. I got it.

10
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,150
Come on.

11
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,120
Wanyue's recurrence has been controlled.

12
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,560
Don't worry too much.

13
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,430
Wanyue.

14
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,990
Yu.

15
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,520
Yan Ci.

16
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,590
You're exactly what I thought you'd be.

17
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,520
Yu's getting prettier,

18
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,080
and Yan Ci, you're the same.

19
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,470
You haven't changed at all.

20
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,750
You too.

21
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,270
Liar.

22
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,030
Men are full of lies.

23
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,840
This is certainly true.

24
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,120
I just didn't want you

25
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,240
to see me like this,

26
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,590
so I kept it from you.

27
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,960
Wanyue.

28
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,960
Yu,

29
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,240
don't feel sad.

30
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,150
Or I'll regret
letting you come to see me.

31
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,280
I've been sick for a few years,

32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,710
but medicine has been advancing.

33
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,560
Look, I've found

34
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,630
that my muscles are growing.

35
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,150
When you recover,

36
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,470
I won't be able to fight you.

37
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,240
Alright, put your hand down.

38
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,990
If it gets swollen,
you'll get another shot.

39
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,080
Put it down.

40
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,310
Oh,

41
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,560
tell me about you.

42
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,360
Yuzhou told me

43
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,000
you became a broadcaster,

44
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,360
and Yan Ci opened a car shop.

45
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,150
You don't know.

46
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,280
I've been so bored

47
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,240
staying in the hospital.

48
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,710
You should

49
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,710
talk to me every day

50
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,840
about what's going on with you guys.

51
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,920
OK.

52
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,630
I'll make up for the lost seven years.

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,920
Nurse, how's my cousin now?

54
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
Don't worry.

55
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,500
- There's nothing serious now.
- OK.

56
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,480
Please take care of her.

57
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,910
- I'm so stupid.
- It's my duty.

58
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,070
Thank you.

59
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,950
I didn't find out

60
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,360
about Wanyue's disease.

61
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,610
It's been seven years.

62
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,230
There are some things to be aware of
when using medicine.

63
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,390
I'm not much better.

64
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,000
Hurry.

65
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,710
Wanyue.

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,840
You woke up.

67
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,960
Does it hurt?

68
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,870
Do you need some water?

69
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,590
The doctor said
the surgery was successful.

70
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,600
You just need to focus on rehabilitation.

71
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,680
Your parents went to get medicine.

72
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,160
They asked us to look after you.

73
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,070
The doctor said

74
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,120
your hair would grow back

75
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,040
after a while.

76
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,720
You had a long trip yesterday.

77
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,800
I booked a hotel.

78
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,390
Go take a rest.

79
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,920
You need more rest.

80
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,920
Yeah, with Wanyue's situation,

81
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,120
you must have been exhausted.

82
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,270
Take some rest.

83
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,070
Hello, Director Li.

84
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,360
Zhou Yu, your grandma is missing.

85
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,870
What do you mean?

86
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,520
Hello?

87
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,800
Zhou Yu's grandma is with me.

88
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,150
What do you want?

89
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,920
If you still want to see her,

90
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,480
go to the location I sent you.

91
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,640
You,

92
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,160
Zhou Yu,

93
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,600
and Cheng Yuzhou.

94
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,630
Each one of you.

95
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,430
If you dare to call the police,

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,070
then I can't guarantee

97
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,720
if you'll see a living person

98
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,560
or a dead body.

99
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,240
- Come on.
- Don't be afraid.

100
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,200
Come on.

101
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,830
I'm out.

102
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,940
You're out?

103
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,910
Two fives.

104
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,340
Two eights.

105
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,760
Two Kings.

106
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:47,790
Two Jacks.
