Let me hold it for you. Make a wish.

4
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,430
It's your turn.

5
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,200
What did you wish for?

6
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,070
I wish the exam goes well

7
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,590
and I can get into a good university.

8
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,780
- What about you?
- Be careful.

9
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,870
My wishes are all about you.

10
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,430
What did you say?

11
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,870
I said I hope the exam goes well too.

12
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,300
(Basketball Finals
of Maoxi No. 1 Middle School)

13
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,680
- Come on!
- Come on! Come on!

14
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,630
If you can't do it, we can replace you.

21

Get a snap.

22
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:38,800
Defend it.

23
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,840
Why do I think
Yan Ci is slowing down?

24
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,840
Is he feeling unwell?

25
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,360
He indeed has slowed down.

26
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,400
Come on!

27
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,960

- Yan Ci.

31
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:24,840
Yan Ci.

32
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,470
Yan Ci.

33
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,240
Yan Ci.

34
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,000
What's wrong?

35
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,710
It burns.

36
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,310
Their relationship is so complicated.

37
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,630
What?

38
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,000
Don't you know?

39
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,080
- Yan Ci.
- He's having a fever.

40
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,470
Yan Ci's parents

41
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,520
died because of Zhou Yu's mom.

42
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,960
Come on, help him up.

43
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,680
Where did you go?

44
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,240
(2008)

45
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,240
Where did you go?

46
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,000
You said you'd come back.

47
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,120
Zhou Yu's father died in an accident.

48
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,590
Her mother couldn't accept it

49
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,840
and went mental.

50
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,710
One day, she went crazy,
and rushed to the street.

51
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,960
Yan Ci's parents bumped into her.

52
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,800
To avoid her,

53
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,720
(Happiness)
they had a car accident

54
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,190
and died at the scene.

55
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,990
Yan Ci was buying
ice cream for Zhou Yu

56
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,720
when his parents had the accident.

57
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,310
They saw everything.

58
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,830
This gave him a complex.

59
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,000
He couldn't hear the breaks anymore.

60
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,380
(Death Notice)

61
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,060
(Happiness)

62
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,870
You just had a high fever.

63
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,120
Eat something.

64
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,560
I have no appetite.

65
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,510
You can't take medicine
with an empty stomach.

66
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,070
You're afraid it'll kill me?

67
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,270
Of course.

68
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,430
Don't be.

69
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,830
Even if I'm dead,

70
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,390
it has nothing to do with you.

71
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,750
Yan Ci, you can't scare me this way.

72
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,430
I don't need your help.

73
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,120
I don't want to help you.

74
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,000
My own life is a mess.

75
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,920
I don't have the energy
to take care of others.

76
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,190
But you're important.

77
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,160
So Yan Ci, take the medicine.

78
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,830
What should I do?

79
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,190
Why is she your mother?

80
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,630
I can't forgive her.

81
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,310
I can't forgive her.

82
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,830
Is it appropriate

83
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,920
for us to visit a patient this late?

84
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,040
Time to show your care.

85
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,070
- Yu.
- Why did you come?

86
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,560
To visit him.

87
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,950
Yeah, how is he now?

88
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,870
Is the fever gone?

89
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:25,720
He just fell asleep.

90
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,510
Aren't you here to send support?

91
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,480
Go check if he's alright.

92
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,310
Take him to the hospital.

93
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,480
Don't delay it.

94
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,310
It's fine.

95
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,070
He's gotten a lot better.

96
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:44,920
What about

97
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,720
go to school with him tomorrow?

98
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,160
OK.

99
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,750
We're leaving.

100
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,720
Hasn't he fallen asleep?

101
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,480
Why are you still staying here?

102
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,680
I'm leaving.

103
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,480
Their relationship is so complicated.

104
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,000
Are you asleep?

107
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,320
Not yet.

108
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,150
Come out. I have something to give you.

109
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,320
What? Anything wrong?

110
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,240
I broke

111
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,030
your MP4 before.

112
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,480
This is a compensation.

113
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,120
Don't refuse to take it.

114
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,360
This is too much. I can't take it.

115
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,030
You can. I won it because of the game.

116
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,910
It's useless to me.

117
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,120
Thanks.

118
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,360
You came specially to give me this?

119
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,630
I just stopped by.

120
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,150
Gotta go.

121
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,630
Zhou Yu.

122
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,630
Can you consider

123
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,670

That'll be two yuan.

You're not a local, are you?

129

I'm on a business trip.

130
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,360
Have you been here before?

131
