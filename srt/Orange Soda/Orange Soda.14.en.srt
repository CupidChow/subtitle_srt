3
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,750
Be enthusiastic about Lingling.

4
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,430
She's been talking about you
all the time.

5
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,240
When you finish dinner,

6
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,710
show her around.

7
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:48,870
Did you hear me?

8
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,230
Hello.

9
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,790
Zhou Yu's mom passed away.

10
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,400
Stop the car.

11
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:56,950
Stop the car.

12
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,960
Cheng Yuzhuo, stop.

13
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,680
Dad.

14
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,870
You know it's not gonna work.

15
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,560
It won't change anything.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,870
Is there anything

17
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,560
more important than our family?

18
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,400
You have to finish this dinner.

19
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,400
Get in the car.

20
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:23,910
Sorry.

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,520
Cheng Yuzhou!

22
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,070
Hello, is it Zhou Yu?

23
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,630
Sorry.

24
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,480
The service just finished.

25
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,310
It's better to talk outside.

26
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,520
How are you?

27
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,150
I heard everything.

28
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,230
Our neighbor Ms. Mei

29
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,230
and Mr. Li both came to help.

30
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,550
I'm doing fine.

31
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,310
Sorry.

32
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,190
I came late.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,430
Something came up at home.

34
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,870
But I called you many times,

35
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,960
and you didn't pick up.

36
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,080
So I hurried back as soon as I got time.

37
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,960
I didn't expect...

38
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,150
You don't need to explain.

39
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,800
I understand.

40
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,150
It's all over. It's fine.

41
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,680
It breaks my heart to see you like this.

42
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,520
Let's go for a walk.

43
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,430
Did you get the admission letter?

44
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,680
I got it yesterday.

45
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,310
You'll receive it soon.

46
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,120
You've been tired.

47
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,560
When you get to Hechuan,

48
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,840
I'll take you to Xuanwu Lake

49
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,430
to see the scenery and relax.

50
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,840
Cheng Yuzhou.

51
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,120
I didn't apply for Hechuan University.

52
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,470
And I didn't apply
for any other schools in Hechuan.

53
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,590
What do you mean?

54
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,800
I'm not going to Hechuan.

55
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,190
Then where did you apply for?

56
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,560
Long-distance relationship
is no problem.

57
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,120
I'll come to see you
whenever I have time.

58
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,470
I'm used to traveling around.

59
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,080
You know what I mean.

60
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,960
I guess this is it for us.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,360
Is it because
I didn't come to see you that day?

62
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,030
It's not what I meant, Zhou Yu.

63
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,470
I really wanted to, but I had reasons.

64
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,120
I can't tell you now.

65
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,080
But I promise,

66
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,590
I will explain in the future.

67
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,640
Really.

68
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,520
It's not that.

69
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,560
Then why?

70
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,710
You don't believe me?

71
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,040
Your life and Yuzhou's life

72
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,720
have been different since birth.

73
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,920
I think you're aware of that.

74
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,600
It's not because I don't believe you.

75
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,560
It's just not necessary.

76
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,310
We were different from the beginning.

77
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,560
You're from Hechuan City,

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,830
but I haven't

79
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,510
left Maoxi Town.

80
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,680
This is just a stop in your life.

81
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,310
You will leave here one day.

82
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,240
But here is my starting point

83
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,480
and my endpoint.

84
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,920
I'm not destined to go to Hechuan.

85
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,510
But you're Cheng Yuzhou.

86
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,360
You can go

87
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,720
- anywhere you want.
- No, no.

88
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,120
I'm Zhou Yu.

89
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,360
I can't.

90
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,190
So what is it between us?

91
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,670
What does it mean to you?

92
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,310
No.

93
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,390
Let's not see each other anymore.

94
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,320
No.

95
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,870
No, Zhou Yu.

So, back to the question.

115
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,800
If you could press pause

116
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,600
on important moments in your life,

117
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,830
what choices would you make?

118
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,160
Love stays oceans apart,

119
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,480
oceans an easy reach.

120
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,510
Or you'll end up
being with someone else

121
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:42,120
and never tell my story again.

122
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,270
The seat is taken.

123
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,510
By Cheng Yuzhou, right?

124
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,030
No need to wait.

125
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,600
He can't come for the moment.

126
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,080
My brothers are entertaining him.

127
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,510
You wasn't in Maoxi.

128
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,750
It was hard to look for you.

129
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,590
Look for me?

130
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,440
You didn't serve enough time in jail

131
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,320
and want to spend a few more years there?

132
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,320
I ended up like this

133
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,480
thanks to you.

134
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,080
We have so much catching up to do.

135
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:07,990
Why are you hiding?

136
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,110
Come out.

137
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
Meet Mr. Yan.

138
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,840
Chuang.

139
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,230
What you want to say?

140
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,440
Nothing.

141
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:29,510
Just that your man is following me now.

142
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,960
You should learn

143
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,750
how to be a boss.

144
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,320
It was really you.

145
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,080
Don't mind me. Get him!

146
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,960
I was wondering.

147
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,750
So they're after you.

148
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,120
But I ran into them.

149
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,750
Are you alright?

150
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,550
- Chuang.
- Chuang.

151
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,750
Let go.

152
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,750
You two just wait.

153
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,320
Remember.

154
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,670
I will definitely get revenge
for the past seven years.

155
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,510
Let's go.

156
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,560
Go.

157
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,810
What does Wang Chuang want

158
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,040
forcing you to come back?

159
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,080
Don't ask.

160
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,560
