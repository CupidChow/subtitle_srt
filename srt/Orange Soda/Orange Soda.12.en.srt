00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,430
Yu and Mr. Cheng's nephew

4
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,600
make quite a good match.

5
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:44,920
It's good to marry far.

6
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,150
Yeah, but with her family background,

7
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,640
no one dares to marry her.

8
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,220
(Ideal university: Hechuan University)

9
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,240
Yu.

10
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,400
What's wrong? You didn't sleep well?

11
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,560
Do I have dark circles?

12
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,280
It's all Cheng Yuzhou's fault.

13
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,120
He bullied you?

14
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,310
No.

15
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,680
He just

16
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,590
keeps making me mad.

17
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,080
So I didn't sleep well.

18
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,150
Cheng Wanyue.

19
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,000
Are you speaking ill of me?

20
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,520
I'm not.

21
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,000
Oh, Yu,

22
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,430
let me ask you.

23
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,910
Are you more reluctant to leave me

24
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,520
or Cheng Yuzhou?

25
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,590
Of course you.

26
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,520
Did you hear, Cheng Yuzhou?

27
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,030
I'm more important than you.

28
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,870
You're not as important as me.

29
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,470
Childish.

30
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,280
Do you want to go to Hechuan.

31
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,310
No, I need to take care of Grandma.

32
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,280
Give me an hour.

33
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,960
Close your eyes.

34
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,240
Where are you taking me?

35
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,750
Hechuan.

36
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,960
Here we are.

37
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,220
(Trip in Hechuan)

38
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,190
Attention, my friends,

39
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,240
the express train to Hechuan

40
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,470
is ready to depart.

41
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,550
Here we are.

42
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,240
Here is Jiming Temple,

43
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,710
which was built
in the first year of Yongkang.

44
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,800
It's one of the most renowned
temples in the country.

45
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,120
Have a tour.

46
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,080
- What do you think?
- Not bad.

47
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,980
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah.

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,240
Let's go eat something.

49
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,520
OK.

50
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:18,910
Have a seat.

51
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,830
This is Hechuan's specialty,
Yuhua Tea.

52
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Together with Suzhou's pastries.

53
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,960
Have a taste.

54
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,320
What do you think?

55
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,190
- Delicious?
- Yeah.

56
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,160
Can I take some to go?

57
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,190
I want my mom and grandma
to taste it.

58
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,200
Of course.

59
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,830
Please wrap up some of these.

60
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,790
OK.

61
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,000
Let's go.

62
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,510
There's more?

63
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,470
Yeah.

64
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,640
Go.

65
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,270
This is your ticket.

66
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,270
- Have fun.
- Thanks, let's go.

68
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,960
Do you like it?

69
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,680
Let's go to the front.

70
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,270
More?

71
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,440
Go.

72
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,360
This is the last item.

73
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,430

74
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,700

76
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,080
Now it begins.

(Yu's Special Concert)

78
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,870
Have you had fun in Hechuan?

79
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,790
Very much.

80
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,310
Thank you for everything.

81
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,510
Yu, you're finally back.

82
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,240
Your mom lost her mind today.

83
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,360
I don't know why,

84
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,480
she kept running around in the street,

85
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,750
hitting and yelling at people.

86
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,190
You'd better go home now.

87
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,470
Why did you leave?

88
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,680
Why did you leave?

89
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,800
- Leave!
- Mom, what are you doing?

90
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,470
Didn't you leave? Why did you come back?

91
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,390
Go! Go!

92
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,520
All of you!

93
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,600
Mom, I forgot to tell you when I left.

94
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,040
- I won't do it again.
- Go!

95
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,560
Take some medicine.

96
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,470
I...

97
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,480
You applied to a university far away.

98
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,480
You want to leave us alone, right?

99
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,560
You think we're a burden to you?

100
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,030
Leave!

101
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,800
All of you!

102
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,240
I'm a burden.

103
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,560
I'm a burden to you.

104
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,920
I might as well die.

105
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,760
Mom.

106
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,240
You know that's not how I think.

107
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,070
You know I'll feel bad seeing you like this.

108
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,630
You never care about my feelings.

109
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,630
That's fine.

110
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,190
But you don't take your medicine.

111
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,360
Yan Ci's parents are not enough?

112
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,040
You want to harm more people?

113
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,950
You want me to stay

114
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,830
and never leave you.

115
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,680
Have you thought about my future?

116
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,070
I have my own life to live.

117
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,760

(Zhou Yu, Hechuan University)

122
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,510
- Go!
- I won't do it again.

123
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,440
You applied to a university far away.

124
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,440
You want to leave us alone, right?

125

You think we're a burden to you?

126
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,910
Go!

127
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,280

128
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,680

Yu.

130
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,720
- Are you hurt?
- Yu.

131
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,560
Are you alright?

132
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,390
Yu, don't cry.

133
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,390
It's just a mirror.

134
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,550
Yu, don't cry.

135
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,600

I'm sorry.

138
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,480
I shouldn't have said that.

139
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,840
Actually,

140
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,080
I'm worried

141
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,360
