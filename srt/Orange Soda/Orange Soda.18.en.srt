00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,840
Don't worry.

6
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,680
All his vitals are fine.

7
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:04,790
Who's the patient's family?

8
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,040
I am.

9
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,560
Doctor, how is he?

10
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,200
He's out of danger.

11
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,070
Luckily,
you stopped his bleeding on time.

12
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,150
But it takes time for him to recover.

13
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,680
You can take turns to look after him.

14
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,040
It's fine now.

15
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,480
Everything's over.

16
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,000
Here's a piece of news.

17
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,040
Recently,
the criminal investigation team

18
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,510
of our county's Public Security Bureau

19
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,950
solved many crimes

20
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,760
by an evil gang led by Wang.

21
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,640
With the cooperation of some citizens,

22
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,870
the police had concrete evidence

23
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,040
(Maoxi People's Radio Station)
and successfully mopped up the gang.

24
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,400
That's it for today's programme.

25
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,350
I'm Zhou Yu. See you next time.

27
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,470
What are your future plans?

28
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,430
Mind your own business first.

29
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,960
I gotta go.

30
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,480
Are you sure you don't need my help?

31
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,470
Relax.

32
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,470
I'm just going back home.

33
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,150
And my injuries are almost healed.

34
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,590
OK.

35
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,190
Why are you leaving
as soon as I get here?

36
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,230
I'd been with him for a long time

37
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,870
before you came.

38
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,340
How are you feeling?

39
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,200
Yu.

40
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,080
I can't wait to go home.

41
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,680
If you also can't wait,

42
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,430
let's go home now.

43
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,120
Rest.

44
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,280
Have more rest.

45
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,750
You collected all of

46
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,380
Wang Chuang's incriminating materials?

47
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,630
Wang Chuang has done

48
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,750
lots of evil things.

49
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,080
And with Yellow Hair
and Tang Qian testifying,

50
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,910
it was easy to collect evidence.

51
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,430
I just organized them

52
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,750
and submitted them
to people who should see them.

53
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,800
You're a good

Yu.

57
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,960
I have something to tell you.

58
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,800
Come closer.

59
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,360
I'm going to get the doctor.

60
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,910
I just want to kiss you.

61
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,000
But it hurts so much.

62
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,790
Zhou Yu.

63
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,720
Do you like me back?

64
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,590
What's wrong?

65
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,070
Something's left.

66
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,520
Cockroach?

67
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,320
I took it out.

68
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,000
Do you like it?

69
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,120
