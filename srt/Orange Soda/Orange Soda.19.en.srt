3
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,560
Yan Ci, you came to see me.

4
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:16,640
Yan Ci,

5
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,840
I remember when you were young,

6
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,040
you often came to my home,

7
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,200
climbing the tree to pick loquats,

8
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,510
leaving them all over the ground.

9
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,430
Her father scolded you many times.

10
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,840
Left. Left.

11
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,430
Yan Ci, can you aim accurately?

12
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,120
If you throw them on the floor,

13
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,280
I can't sell them.

14
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,230
You couldn't catch them.

15
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,280
What to do?

16
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,310
The loquats are almost ripe.

17
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,190
They're gonna rot if we can't sell them.

18
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,520
It's fine.

19
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,910
Let's eat them ourselves.

20
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,310
Such sweet loquats.

21
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,710
It's better to eat them ourselves.

22
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,840
Popsicles.

23
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,520
Popsicles.

24
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,580
(Popsicles)

25
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,000
Popsicles for sale!

26
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,030
Popsicles!

27
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,080
That boy came back again.

28
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,430
As usual,

29
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,800
guess which foot he steps on first
when he enters home.

30
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,280
Whoever loses
buys popsicles for the winner.

31
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:16,750
Alright.

32
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,910
I think it's the left foot.

33
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,590
I think it's the right foot.

34
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,360
I won.

35
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,400
I won.

36
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,150
I won.

37
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,910
I can have popsicles.

38
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,000
Silly.

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,280
- He always steps on his right foot first.
- You should buy popsicles for me.

40
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,120
Don't back out.

41
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,800
Do you want one?

42
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,400
Yan Ci.

43
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,560
You grew up with Yu.

44
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,710
You're supposed to be the closest.

45
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,430
I

46
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,120
may get muddled up sometimes,

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,910
but I know it clearly

48
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,750
that since childhood,

49
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,630
you've been the one

50
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,030
who cares most about Yu.

51
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,630
Now you're all alone.

52
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,800
You must have suffered a lot

53
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,190
these years.

54
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,040
I know in my heart

55
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,800
that you must have suffered a lot.

56
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,240
I feel bad for you

57
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,680
seeing you like this.

58
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,120
From now on,

59
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,310
live a good life with Yu.

60
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,630
I'm old

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,240
and can't take care of you.

62
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,750
But you still have a long way to go.

63
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,860
(Three months later,
Grandma died of illness)

64
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,520
Yan Ci.

65
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,120
About what happened before,

66
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,430
I owe you an official apology.

67
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,960
Sorry.

68
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,790
Yu.

69
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,270
We shouldn't feel sorry for each other.

70
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,920
We were young back then,

71
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,630
but now we've grown up.

72
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,360
Let bygones

73
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,270
be bygones.

74
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,190
Do you remember

75
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,830
the game we used to play?

76
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,910
Guess which foot he steps on first.

77
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,390
You always guessed first.

78
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,830
I'll go first this time.

79
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,000
Left foot.

80
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,390
I'll bet on the right foot.

81
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,120
OK, you won.

82
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,080
What do you want?

83
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,160
Give me a hug

84
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,310
as a friend.
