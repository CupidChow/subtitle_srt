3
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,390
Really? I'm out.

4
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,350
You're out? Two fives.

5
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,000
Two fives? Two eights.

6
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,280
Two eights. Two Kings.

7
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,590
Two Jacks.

8
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,350
Where's my grandma?

9
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,960
Calm down.

10
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,350
Have you eaten? Join us.

11
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,680
Why are you so arrogant?

12
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,000
Stay put.

13
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,040
Yu. Jifen.

14
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,230
Where are you?

15
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,190
Grandma.

16
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,950
What do you want?

17
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,070
Yellow Hair.

18
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,350
Show them.

19
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,070
I'm so hungry.

20
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,520
Yellow Hair.

21
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,350
Do you know what you're doing?

22
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,200
What are you doing?

23
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,790
Keep it down.

24
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,840
You might scare Grandma.

25
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,710
Wang Chuang.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,590
What kind of man are you?

27
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,400
Wang Chuang.

28
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,470
Am I a man now?

29
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,590
What do you want exactly?

30
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,190
What do I want?

31
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,120
The two of them

32
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,800
made me suffer.

33
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,870
I'm going to make them pay today

34
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,030
and let them feel

35
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,120
how miserable I was!

36
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,470
Wang Chuang.

37
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,430
We're the ones

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,560
who've had problems with you since then.

39
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,190
It has nothing to do with Zhou Yu.

40
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,000
Come at us.

41
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,960
Hit them.

42
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,430
Until they can't get up.

43
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,800
If any of you dares to fight back...

44
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,520
Wang Chuang!

45
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,520
Come on!

46
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,270
Go on.

47
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,840
You're such a dangerous woman.

48
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,680
Alright, enough for the warm up.

49
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,430
Let's do something exciting.

50
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,750
Yu.

51
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,150
Don't look at me like this.

52
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,470
Otherwise,

53
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,150
it will make me want to love you more.

54
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,080
Yan Ci.

55
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,550
Mr. Yan.

56
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,710
You

57
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,270
kowtow to me three times first.

58
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,200
Yu.

59
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,190
I liked you before.

60
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,270
But now

61
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,830
I prefer to torture you.

62
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,760
Wang Chuang!

63
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,230
Don't.

64
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,390
Kill me. Kill me!

65
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,400
Yan Ci.

66
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,120
Don't do this. Don't do this.

67
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,880
No.

68
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,560
No.

69
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,510
Kowtow to me three times.

70
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,630
Don't push it.

71
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,680
Aren't you so domineering?

72
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,920
Why are you kneeling
in front of me like a dog?

73
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,000
You want to bite me?

74
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,910
Come on.

75
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,040
- How dare you.
- Stop it!

76
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,750
Look at you.

77
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,040
You're so cheap.

78
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,240
She killed your parents.

79
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,070
You still want to protect her?

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,840
Wang Chuang!

81
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,790
Don't move.

82
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,430
I almost forgot you.

83
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,840
Cheng Yuzhou.

84
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,870
Why did you have to

85
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,430
mind other people's business?

86
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,680
If it weren't for you,

87
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,600
would my brother end up in jail?

88
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,160
Would he leave me?

89
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,310
If it weren't for you,

90
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,270
Zhou Yu would've be mine!

91
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:44,920
Why don't you talk?

92
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,120
Wang Chuang!

93
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,470
The letter.

94
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,270
You wrote it, didn't you?

95
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,520
To the radio station.

96
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,720
It was from you, right?

97
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,510
And those photos.

98
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,560
So you know my feelings for you.

99
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,800
There must have been a misunderstanding.

100
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,200
Misunderstanding?

101
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,710
Misunderstanding.

102
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,870
That's easy for you to say.

103
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,040
Misunderstanding.

104
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,390
Do you know
how I've spent the past seven years?

105
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,600
Because of him.

106
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,430
He ruined my brother

107
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,040
and me.

108
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,510
I lost my brother

109
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,390
and my family.

110
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,160
Because of him,

111
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,190
I can't have children anymore.

112
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,560
You owe me these.

113
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,750
You owe me!

114
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,800
You all owe me!

115
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,630
Wang Chuang!

116
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,600
Please let them go.

117
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,720
Let go.

118
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,070
Stop it!

119
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,240
Stop it!

120
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,750
You deserved it.

121
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,800
I already called the police.

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,840
Get out!

123
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,040
Get out! Get out!

124
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,870
Zhou Yu, I'm sorry.

125
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,830
Your grandma is fine.

126
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,750
Yellow Hair, how could you betray me?

127
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,920
Go to hell!

128
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,760
Yu.

129
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:33,870
Are you alright, Yan Ci?

130
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,230
Yan Ci.

131
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,550
I'll make all of you regret it!

132
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,200
Yuzhou. Yuzhou.

133
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,350
Yuzhou.

134
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,120
- Yuzhou.
- Do you feel both sad

135
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,200
and moved?

136
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,960
Let's get back together.

137
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,710
Okay?

138
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,630
If I survive this,

139
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,150
you can't back out.

140
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,440
No, I won't back out.

141
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,150
Let's go home, go home.

142
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,630
Let's go to our home.

143
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,030
No, no.

144
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,040
No.

145
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,320
No.

146
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,720
Help! Help!

147
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,390
No.

148
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,360
Go home.

149
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,000
Go home.

150
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,510
Let's go home.

151
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,670
