00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,710
You're hurt?

4
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,440
It's fine.

5
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,190
I fell down.

6
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,150
It looks bad.

7
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,840
Are you sure it's fine?

8
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,200
Not completely fine.

9
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,630
I...

10
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,000
I hurt my arm.

11
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:21,790
And also legs.

12
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,760
I sold my house,

13
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,510
and the hotels around are fully booked.

14
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,120
Fine.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,040
How about

16
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,520
you live in my place?

17
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,040
Thank you then.

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,120
Yu's house got smashed last night.

19
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,550
Don't worry.

20
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,000
I will be living here these days.

21
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,560
Be careful.

22
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,850
Wang Chuang will definitely
make a move on Zhou Yu.

23
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,830
I will keep an eye on her secretly.

24
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,710
Cheng Yuzhou.

25
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,870
- Why don't you want to see her?
- Not necessary.

26
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,710
Cheng Yuzhou.

27
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,360
Cheng Yuzhou, it's raining.

28
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,800
Well, that...

29
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,920

30
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,780

and is in a hurry to leave.

(Qian's Barbershop)

32
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,630
You still look annoying

33
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,960
after so many years.

34
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,450
Wang Chuang came after you
as soon as he got out.

35
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,150
Looks like he isn't gonna let you go.

36
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,030
What's your plan?

37
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,840
Since he wants to see me,

38
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,840
I will grant his wish.

39
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,800
Are you going to tell Yan Ci?

40
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,520
I'll handle it myself.

41
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,240
Sometimes I feel

42
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,030
you two are kind of alike.

43
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,280
Thank you, Tang Qian.

44
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,910
I just have a problem with Wang Chuang.

45
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,520
And I'm helping you and Yan Ci.

46
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,120
Hey, Chuang.

47
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,710
Qian?

48
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,910
I heard you're dealing
with Zhou Yu and Yan Ci?

49
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,240
So? What do you want?

50
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,520
I can help you.

(Qian's Barbershop

52

She's inside?

53
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,760
She passed out

54
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,390
and can't wake up for a while.

55
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,070
What's the rush?

56
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,630
How are you gonna thank me?

57
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,560
You're such a good friend.

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,160
I will give you benefits for sure.

59
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,870
Go, and keep it down.

60
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,750
You colluded to play me.

61
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,230
Yu.

62
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,070
We meet again.

63
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,520
Tell me.

64
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,600
Why are you pestering me?

65
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,240
Because I like you.

66
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,800
Tell the truth.

67
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,720
Go ask Yan Ci.

68
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,880
Yan Ci?

69
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,680
You don't know it yet?

70
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,350
I tell you,

71
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,510
I will kill him one day,

72
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,920
and make him suffer.

73
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,920
None of you can escape.

74
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,980
None of you can escape!

76
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,260
(2011)

77
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,450
Sir,

78
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,560
what's the right gift
for visiting an elder?

79
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,000
We have fresh fruits over there.

80
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,510
You said Zhou Yu's home is near here?

81
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,360
Just turn the corner and you can see it.

82
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:29,710
Good.

83
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,120
Go check around there.

84
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,000
I will bring my men there
a couple of days later.

85
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,600
She dared to get in my way.

86
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,000
I will make her pay for it.

87
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,430
Jun, how about I go?

88
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,590
You?

89
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,750
Come on, my silly brother.

90
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,390
After I teach her a lesson,

91
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,830
I will hand her over to you.

92
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,600
She's going to take the exam.

93
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,190
I will ruin it

94
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,190
and make her regret it
for the rest of her life.

95
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,790
- How much?
- Five.

96
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,400
Jun.

97
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,390

Hey.

99
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,680
- Are you alright?
- Don't.

100
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,070
OK, I won't touch you.

(Chengxi Police Station
Interrogation Waiting Room)

102
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,390
Officer, it's not our fault.

103
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,120
He started the fight.

104
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,480
What's wrong with you?

105
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,160
Especially you, Wang Jun.

106
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,510
You just got out, and caused trouble again.

107
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,070
No, officer.

108
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,830
It's all

109
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,600
his fault this time.

110
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,390
What are you doing? Behave yourself.

111
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,190
Officer, this is Yan Ci's ID.

112
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,120
How did you get hurt so badly?

113
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,720
Can I go to the hospital first?

114
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,760
Still not behaving?

115
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,160
Who started the fight?

116
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,910
Me.

117
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,950
See? I told you, officer.

118
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,560
I'm so innocent.

119
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,040
- Behave yourself.
- Officer.

120
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,630
Yan Ci didn't do it on purpose.

121
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,270
Could you deal with it leniently?

122
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,950
Yan Ci, say something.

123
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:34,840
Both parties are responsible.

124
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,150
There are two choices for you,

125
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,440
one, you two reconcile,

126
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,720
second, 15 days detention

127
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:42,750
for all of you.

128
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,590
I...

129
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,630
Yan Ci.

130
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,670
Don't forget the exam is in five days.

131
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,440
Go back.

132
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,200
Officer, we will reconcile.

133
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,510
Right, Yan Ci?

134
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,440
No.

135
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,870
Take them away.

136
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:05,960
Officer, can you listen to me?

137
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,440
- Go.
- I'm really innocent.

138
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,360
Officer.

139
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,360
- Go now.
- Go.

140
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,080
It was self-defense. I...

141
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,670
Is it really worth it?

142
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,480
Don't tell Zhou Yu.

143
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,140
(2011)

144
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,580
(2017)

145
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,840
I won't leave you alone.

146
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,200
Come to my home
for dinner tomorrow, Yan Ci.

147
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,720
Just like before.

148
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,360
Is it really worth it?

149
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,000
Don't tell Zhou Yu.

150
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,840
You don't deserve to see him.

151
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,390
Go as far way as you can.

152
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,610
(Admission ticket, Yan Ci)
Get lost!

153
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,280
Now!

154
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,550
Don't keep anything from me.

155
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,320
Yan Ci.

156
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,320
Wang Chuang told me

157
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,060
about what happened to the exam.

158
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,840
It was noting.

159
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,080
Already in the past.

160
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,350
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,150
- I was...
- We were too young, that's all.

162
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,240
If only I were Wanyue.

163
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,440
She would have

164
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,630
handled it perfectly.

165
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,030
There's something you're good at, too.

166
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,390
Don't think that way.

167
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,750
I just want everything
to be the way it used to be.

168
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,790
But I was radical

169
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,150
and ceased all contact with everyone,

170
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,120
including you guys

171
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,840
and Wanyue.

172
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,510
How about Wanyue?

173
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,840
Is she doing well?

174
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,240
You don't know either?

175
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,630
How come?

176
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,900
(Cheng Wanyue)

177
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,550
Hello, Wanyue.

178
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,270
How are you feeling now?

179
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,870
Any better?

180
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,080
Do you want to talk

181
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,120
with Yu and Yan Ci?

182
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,790
They're all right next to me.

183
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,440
OK.

184
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,040
OK.

185
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,550
I'll put them on the phone.

186
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,320
Yu, Yan Ci.

187
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,360
What? You don't remember me?

188
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,240
I should be asking you that.

189
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,510
Wanyue, where have you been these years?

190
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,550
I went abroad.

191
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,390
That's fine, but...

192
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,000
Yu, just tell me if you've missed me.

193
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,120
Of course.

194
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,840
But I couldn't reach you.

195
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,390
Yan Ci, did you miss me?

196
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,150
Yeah.

197
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,030
Cheng Wanyue, right?

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,320
There's an opening at 3:00 p.m.

199
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,980
I'm getting an appointment
for chemo for you.

200
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,960
Wanyue, what's going on..

201
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,510
Yu, Yan Ci.

202
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,030
I gotta go now.

203
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,040
Bye.
