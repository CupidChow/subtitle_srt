3
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,800
Yan Ci.

4
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:00,910
What?

5
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,350
I'm not welcome?

6
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,480
Chuang, it's not that.

7
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,680
I heard

8
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,120
that girl Zhou Yu

9
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,640
is getting prettier.

10
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,640
No wonder Cheng Yuzhou and Yan Ci

11
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,680
can't stop thinking about her.

12
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:25,990
Chuang,

13
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,350
what...

14
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,430
What are you trying to say?

15
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,640
Chuang, are you gonna...

16
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,680
You saw it.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,120
I'm doing proper business.

18
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,480
I quit long ago.

19
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,040
Don't forget what you owe me.

20
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,140
(2017)

21
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,540
(2010)

22
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,840
So touching.

23
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,910
Will anyone buy this movie?

24
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,190
What are you looking at?
Get delivery.

25
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,470
Hurry.

26
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,000
- Yan Ci!
- Mom.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,710
What can I do for you to forgive me?

28
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,590
Why should I forgive you?

29
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,280
Can you afford to pay me back?

30
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,360
Yellow Hair, what does it matter to you?

31
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,000
Yan Ci's business is my business.

32
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,360
Mr. Yan treats me like his own son.

33
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,680
He didn't scold you, because he's educated.

34
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,680
But I'm different.

35
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,870
- Sorry.
- It's fine, madam.

36
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,120
It's fine, it's fine.

37
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,800
Madam, madam.

38
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:48,690
- Mom.
- Madam.

39
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,240
It was all because of you!

40
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,000
- Mom.
- Stop talking.

41
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,150
Yellow Hair.

42
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,470
- Zhou.
- Let's go.

43
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,400
- Why did you leave me alone?
- Crazy woman.

44
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,710
Save your tongue.

45
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,680
Are you alright, madam?

46
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,150
Yan Ci.

47
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,360
Mrs. Caring is here again.

48
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:20,990
Move aside.

49
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,800
Can you not do these dangerous things?

50
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,560
Why do you care?

51
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,240
She got angry.

52
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,030
If you're so meddlesome,

53
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,520
we can have a match.

54
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,470
If you win, it's your call.

55
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,310
Fine.

56
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,470
You're all bullying a girl.

57
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,960
Is it fun?

58
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,470
Race me.

59
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,910
I know you.

60
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,360
The rich boy from Hechuan.

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,840
What?

62
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,960
Want to save the beauty?

63
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,280
Just say if you can race me.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,030
You're quite fierce.

65
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,920
I'm bullying Zhou Yu if I race her.

66
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,070
But if you race me,

67
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,000
aren't you bullying me?

68
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,040
I said,

69
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,510
him.

70
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,560
Race him, Mr. Yan.

71
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Race him, Mr. Yan.

72
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,680
Seems like someone hasn't learned

73
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,240
what the Racing King in Maoxi
can do.

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,040
You're crazy.

75
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,360
He actually challenged Mr. Yan.

76
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
Yeah.

77
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,630
The inspectors are here.

78
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,310
- The inspectors are here.
- Come on.

79
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,440
Yan Ci.

80
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,120
Don't be nervous.

81
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,800
I came only to pass on a message.

82
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,150
What does he want to say?

83
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,950
You catch on quick.

84
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,920
Yan Ci asked me to tell you,

85
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,680
he will be waiting for you

86
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,200
five days later
at the corner of West Street.

87
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,600
What if I win?

88
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,040
You'd better think about something practical,

89
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,000
for example, how to survive.

90
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,270
We have plenty of...

91
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,270
If I win,

92
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,870
he can't mess with Zhou Yu again.

93
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,520
Deal.

94
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,310
Yan Ci said

95
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,680
if you lose,

96
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,480
never set foot in Maoxi again.

97
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,270
I didn't expect

98
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,600
there are things that you can't do.

99
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,960
Kick-started it?

100
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,470
It's simple.

101
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,190
What are you doing with a motorcycle?

102
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,520
Riding it.

103
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,720
Something's fishy.

104
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,240
Have you fallen in love?

105
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:28,850
Have you?

106
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,760
You guess.

107
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,830
Cheng Yuzhou, tell me who she is.

108
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,240
I was worried that Mr. Yan wouldn't come.

109
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,040
But he got here early.

110
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,560
Men are always competitive.

111
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,230
Jun is here.

112
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,270
Jun.

113
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,150
Jun.

114
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,230
Jun.

115
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,680
Qian, it's already 8:00 pm.

116
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,510
That transfer student is not coming?

117
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,950
Jun spent a lot of money on it.

118
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,950
If the race is canceled,
you should pay us back.

119
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,680
Jun, don't worry.

120
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,190
You won't come in vain.

121
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,280
How are we supposed to compete?

122
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,320
If it's about speed,

123
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,070
we'll take the main road from here.

124
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,000
If it's about skills,

125
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,870
we'll take the mountain path.

126
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,390
You're the outsider. You pick.

127
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,190
Let's settle it at one go.

128
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,200
Start here.

129
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,750
Mr. Cheng.

130
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,630
I suggest you not talk big.

131
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Have a nice attitude,

132
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,120
or you'll look bad when you lose.

133
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,510
I'm racing him.

134
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,000
You sure have talked a lot.

135
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,480
I'm asking you.

136
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,680
Let's settle it at one go.

137
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,310
We'll ride towards each other.

138
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,240
Whoever gets out of the way first

139
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,390
loses.

140
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,560
OK.

141
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,710
Oh no.

142
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,870
So many people are here.

143
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,480
Will Cheng Yuzhou be in trouble?

144
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,160
Mr. Yan, hit him!

145
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,630
- Hit him!
- Hit him!

146
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,590
Hit him!

147
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,120
- Hit him!
- Hit him!

148
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,450
Hit him!

149
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,920
Hit him, Mr. Yan!

150
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,880
Hit him!

151
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,150
Hit him, Mr. Yan!

152
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,550
Hit him, Mr. Yan!

153
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,960
Yu, pick up the phone now.

154
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:44,270
No.

155
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,390
Hey...

156
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:50,270
Hit him! Hit him! Hit him!

157
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,280
Beat him, Mr. Yan!

158
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,230
Hit him!

159
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,390
Hit him, Mr. Yan.

160
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,480
Mr. Yan, go for it!

161
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,510
Hit him! Hit him!

162
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,270
Hit him! Hit him, Mr. Yan!

163
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,080
- Do you wanna die?
- Are you going to kill yourself?

164
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,510
It's none of your business. Leave.

165
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,990
Don't push her.

166
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,390
What do you care?

167
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,870
You haven't won yet.

168
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,790
Don't take yourself too seriously.

169
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,360
You too.

170
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,790
You're fighting?

171
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,510
Fighting?

172
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,160
Who organized this?

173
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,300
Don't you have something else to do?

174
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,040
Someone is coming.

175
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,550
Let's go. Don't stand there.

176
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:01,990
Stop.

177
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,440
Zhou Yu, right?

178
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,390
We'll wait and see.

179
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,270
Don't run! Stop!

180
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,720
Let's go now, Wang Chuang.

181
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,680
Stop.

182
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,700
- You told them to come?
- Stop.

183
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,550
Don't run! Stop!

184
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,320
Brats, stop!

185
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,750
Still trying to run?

186
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,360
- Still trying to run?
- Let's go.

187
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,700
(Sparkling)

188
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,750
Stop there, brat!

189
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,920
Stop running.

190
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,240
Go back home with us.
