3
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,540
(Obituary: My mother, Liu Jifen, died
in Hechuan on June 25, 2011 at the age of 40)

4
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:53,960
Yu is

5
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,280
so miserable.

6
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,520
Her father died not long ago.

7
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,770
Now she just reached adulthood,

8
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,200
and her mother passed away.

9
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,390
Right.

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,840
She has a miserable life.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,760
Mr. Li, you came to help.

12
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,880
Yeah.

13
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,230
She's my student,
just like my own daughter.

14
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,790
Does her grandma know about this?

15
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,480
What if she...

16
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,710
We sent her to the community
this morning.

17
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,950
She's all the family she has left.
We need to keep her safe.

18
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,560
Her mother's death

19
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,280
is not necessarily a bad thing.

20
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,480
Alright, stop discussing about it.

21
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,560
Yu is still inside the room.

22
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,790
She'll feel bad if she hears this.

23
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,700
(May my mother rest in peace,
and may relatives restrain your grief)

24
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,100
(Nurse Station
Hechuan No. 1 People's Hospital)

25
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,960
- Hello.
- Nurse.

26
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,920
Is Dr. Li here?

27
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,510
He's busy now.

28
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,760
Well, nurse,

29
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,480
when can we get the test results?

30
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,480
- The subscriber you dialed can't be reached.
- Please wait patiently. Soon it will be ready.

31
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,570
- Please redial later.
- How long are we going to wait?

32
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,710
Just a moment. Let me check it for you.

33
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,400
Please.

34
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,590
We've been waiting for a long time.

35
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,870
(Lu Yang)
We're getting anxious.

36
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,000
Calm down. I'm going to check it.

37
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,190
It's killing me.

38
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,190
- What do we do?
- It's fine. Let's wait a bit longer.

39
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,520
We've been waiting so long.

40
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,630
Who's Cheng Wanyue's family?

41
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,750
The test results are out.

42
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,960
Here, here.

43
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,240
Yu, eat something.

44
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,120
You haven't eaten anything all day.

45
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,630
There're lots of ceremonies to complete.

46
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,150
By the way, Yu,

47
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,710
today Cheng Yuzhou...

48
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,080
You're not going to tell him?

49
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,680
Alright, I got it.

50
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,430
Yu, it's almost time.

51
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,430
Get some of your mom's clothes for me.

52
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:48,990
It's fine.

53
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,150
I can do it myself.

54
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,980
(Bankbook)

55
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,140
(Yu, I've been a burden to you.)

56
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,790
Yu.

57
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,950
I've been a burden to you.

58
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,360
If there is a next life,

59
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,390
don't be my daughter.

60
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,480
Live the life you want.

61
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,480
Jifen.

62
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,680
Jifen.

63
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,800
I want some water.

64
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,240
Jifen.

65
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,310
Jifen.

66
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,560
It's all because of me.

67
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,190
It's all my fault.

68
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,070
I knew she was sick.

69
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,480
How could I say that to her?

70
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,720
I don't have a mother anymore.

71
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,390
Yan Ci. Yan Ci.

72
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,830
Something big happened, Yan Ci.

73
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,310
What?

74
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,200
Zhou Yu...

75
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,070
Zhou Yu's mother...

76
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,270
Yan Ci, are you alright?

77
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,160
Sorry for your loss.

78
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,630
When can you ever forgive her?

79
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,950
Until she dies!

80
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,430
(She'll never forgive me.)

81
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,340
(Inpatient Building)

82
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,950
What we can do now

83
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,510
is to keep the disease
from getting worse.

84
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,240
With her condition,

85
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,160
if she wants to get
a thorough treatment,

86
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,120
I can only suggest you go to a big city.

87
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,750
They will provide a higher level of care.

88
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,600
You said there was
a three in 100,000 chance.

89
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,390
Why does it have to be Wanyue?

90
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,360
It's fine.

91
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,750
The doctor said

92
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,800
there's still hope for her.

93
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,840
Don't worry.

94
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,920
What will we do?

95
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,030
Yuzhou.

96
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,360
Get some sleep.

97
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,190
You stayed up all night again.

98
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,880
I'm fine.

99
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,270
My mom will come tonight.

100
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,430
Go back and check on Yu.

101
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,160
She must have missed you.

102
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:32,460
(Father Zhou Liwen,
Mother Liu Jifen)

103
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,840
Yu.

104
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,710
Let's go.

105
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,390
Zhou Yu.

106
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,270
What are you doing here?

107
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,550
Look, my mom's dead.

108
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,510
Are you satisfied now?

109
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,510
Is this play fun to watch?

110
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:51,710
Zhou Yu.

111
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,240
You know I didn't mean it...

112
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,200
You didn't?

113
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,150
Then what?

114
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,600
Don't you think
my mom doesn't deserve to live?

115
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,240
OK, she's dead now.

116
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,960
She'll atone for her sins
in front of your parents personally.

117
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,320
Are you satisfied?

118
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,280
Yan Ci.

119
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,480
If you think my mom's life isn't enough,

120
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,510
you can take my life too.

121
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,550
- Sorry.
- Sorry for what?

122
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,440
Our family

123
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,790
has been sorry to you.

124
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,270
Me and also my mom
have been sorry to you.

125
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
Sorry, Zhou Yu.

126
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,270
From now on,

127
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,720
I don't want to see you anymore.

128
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,200
Girl,

129
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,150
did you see my daughter Jifen

130
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,630
and my granddaughter Yu?

131
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,360
Jifen's a bad person.

132
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,600
She doesn't give me water
when I'm thirsty.

133
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:55,600
Maybe... Maybe Jifen forgot.

134
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,200
Jifen

135
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,960
went to a place very far away.

136
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,240
Why didn't she take me with her?

137
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,630
Be...

138
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,480
Because...

139
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:13,150
