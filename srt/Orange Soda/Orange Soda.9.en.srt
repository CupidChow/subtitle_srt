You

00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,400
are drunk.

00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,200

00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,580

Thanks for your contribution.

8
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,790
- Come on, cheers.
- Cheers.

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,000
- Cheers.
- Come on, cheers.

10
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,120
Eat as much as you want.

11
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,120
Don't save money for me.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,840
Mr. Li.

13
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,840
Don't you worry about your wallet?

14
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,870
Your wife will punish you
when you get home.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,250
Tell me things I don't wanna hear.

16
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,200
I want five of these.

17
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,040
And chicken wings.

18
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,310
Oh, extra spicy.

19
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:40,990
Well,

20
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,870
please separate the spicy one, thanks.

21
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,760
Yeah, separate it.

22
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,380
Why don't you
add the chili powder yourself?

23
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,760
Didn't we say spiceness
can wick moisture?

24
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,350
Are you chickening out?

25
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,910
Sir,

26
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,640
- death level spicy.
- Alright.

27
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,520
No.

28
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,920
You two, I...

29
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,790
Yu, don't mind them.

30
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,230
Just leave them alone.

31
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,220
(Chili powder)

32
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,470
Are you two sure about this?
Don't waste food.

33
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,190
Why don't I try it for you first?

34
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,240
This is too hot.

35
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,840
Let me get you a new one.

36
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,590
Mr. Li said don't waste food.

37
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,360
Yu,

38
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,590
get some sodas for us.

39
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,750
You know my favorite flavor.

40
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,190
I want the one you bought me last time.

41
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,710
Enough.

42
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,910
Stop being a baby.

43
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,360
I thought you were capable,

44
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,120
but you were just bluffing.

45
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,470
Worst case,
they will have diarrhea tomorrow.

46
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,080
Yu, don't worry.

47
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,150
Look at you two.

48
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,680
You...

49
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,030
Wanyue, what's wrong with you?

50
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,400
What's wrong with me?

51
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,120
What's wrong with me?

52
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,280
You two were eating chili powder,

53
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,840
but how come my nose is bleeding?

54
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,960
Alright, enough of it.

55
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,190
Well, Yuzhou,

56
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,280
take Wanyue home.

57
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,030
- Yan Ci, send Zhou Yu home.
- OK.

58
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,680
How will you go back home?

59
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,070
I don't know.

60
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,110
Then...

61
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,400
I'll drive you.

62
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,440
Let's go.

63
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,720
I thought the city boy
would be sophisticated,

64
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,270
but turns out he has such bad taste.

65
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,670
What do you mean?

66
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,600
What do I mean?

67
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,560
You should know it better than I do.

68
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,190
Come at me if you want.

69
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,750
Don't get other people involved.

70
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,270
What?

71
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,270
You can't stand it
because I said something about him?

72
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,270
So the city boy

73
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,630
is not good for nothing.

74
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,920
He's good at seducing people.

75
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,400
Yan Ci,

76
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,240
when can you stop the cynicism?

77
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,720
Yeah, my whole family is sorry for you.

78
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,800
But don't forget

79
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,920
it's just my family.

80
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,630
Don't always act like
the whole world owes you.

81
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,200
If you're still like this,

82
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,480
I won't care about you.

83
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,760
Yu.

84
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,600
If you leave me here alone,

85
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,120
what am I gonna do with myself?

86
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,470
I won't.

87
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,870
I won't leave you alone.

88
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,000
Come to my home
for dinner tomorrow, Yan Ci.

89
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,870
Just like before.

90
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,750
Cheng Yuzhou, I know what you're thinking.

91
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,950
Do you want my help?

92
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,160
Mind your own business.

93
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,160
Don't look down on me.

94
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,870
I'm Yu's best friend.

95
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,950
I can get first-hand information of her.

96
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,680
And also Yan Ci's.

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,240
- But...
- OK.

98
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,480
You didn't even ask about my conditions.

99
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,560
You knew I'd say yes anyway.

100
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,160
Cheng Yuzhou.

101
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,360
Wait for me.

102
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,560
Something's wrong with you.

103
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,620
(The evening of the second day)

104
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,800
Let's wait a little longer.

105
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,600
Yan Ci should be on the way.

106
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,430
I'm hungry.

107
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,920
Yu, I'm hungry.

108
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,950
Here, Grandma.

109
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,560
Grab a bite first.

110
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,240
Yu, eat first if you're hungry.

111
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,950
I'm not.

112
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,920
Help Grandma in
and let her get some rest.

113
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,160
Mom, I'm sorry.

114
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,600
It's alright.

115
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,160
Go have a rest.

116
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,560
I want to wait a little longer.

117
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,560
OK.

118
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,280
Zhou Yu.

119
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,840
You don't deserve to see him.

120
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,240
You're impressive.

121
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,510
You must be pleased to see

122
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,550
Yan Ci running around for you,

123
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,270
losing his mind.

124
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,120
I just don't understand.

125
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,120
Where did you get the courage?

126
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,440
You killed his family,

127
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,550
how can you play innocent

128
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,630
and stick around with him every day?

129
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,000
I just want to...

130
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,200
What?

131
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,800
Take care of him

132
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,550
or keep harming him?

133
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,630
Zhou Yu,

134
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,080
what makes you think

135
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,790
you're the most important person
around Zhou Yu?

136
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,510
Or is it

137
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,550
that you enjoy being needed by Yan Ci

138
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,790
and then torturing him?

139
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,550
I just...

140
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,910
A word of advice for you.

141
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,240
If you still have a little conscience,

142
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,870
stay away from him.

143
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,150
As far away as possible.

144
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,120
Get lost!

145
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,440
Now!

146
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,550
You killed his family,

147
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,510
how can you play innocent

148
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,600
and stick around with him every day?

149
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,670

150
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,550
you're the most important person
around Zhou Yu?

151
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,630
