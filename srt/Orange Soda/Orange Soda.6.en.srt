4
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,150
Is it a good solution to this problem?

5
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,680
Yeah.

6
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,360
What are you doing?

7
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,880
Didn't you see her?

8
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,590
I did.

9
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,120
Pick it up.

10
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,480
What if I don't?

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,840
Let go.

13
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,150
What are you doing?

14
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,560
You said to learn with each other.

15
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,150
Yan Ci, let go.

16
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,070
Mr. Li is here.

17
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,150
You don't have anything better to do

18
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,640
during self-study time?

19
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,400
Is it so?

20
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,840
You two, solve the problem

21
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,790
on the blackboard.

22
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,040
Go now.

23
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,190
The rest of you, go back to study.

24
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,030
Good, you both got it correct.

25
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,560
Now, comment on

26
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,470

27
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,000
He's good. Worth learning.

28
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,280
Not bad. I'll note it down.

29
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,400
You two seem to be

30
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,470
in pretty good spirits.

31
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,190
Why don't you stay

32
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,800
and clean the hallway after school?
