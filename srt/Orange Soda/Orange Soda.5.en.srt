3
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:49,550
You wanted to see me?

4
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,360
Where's Wang Jun?

5
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:54,840
Who are you to see him?

6
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,760
Wait, wait.

(Mock Exam)

9
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,640
Annoying.

10
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,150
Why hasn't he come?

11
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,140
(Certificate of Honor, Yan Ci,
First Prize in Math Competition)

12
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,870
Yu, you're here.

13
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,080
Wanna play with Yan Ci?

14
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,360
My dad sent these fruit flavored candies.

15
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,840
I want to share them with Yan Ci.

16
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,870
Good girl, Yu.

17
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,400
But we're taking a family photo.

18
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,240
You can sit there and wait.

19
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,200
Once we're done,

20
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,360
we'll ask Yan Ci to play with you.

21
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,430
Kid, look at me.

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,310
Kid, eyes forward.

23
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,920
Look here.

24
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,030
One, two, three.

25
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,680
Wait, Yan Ci.

26
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,520
Yellow Hair said you got hurt.

27
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,730
I bought some medicine for you.

28
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,120
I'm not coming in.

29
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,870
I just want you to take it, okay?

30
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,800
Don't worry.

31
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,280
I'll leave as soon as you take it.

32
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,840
This can invigorate blood.

33
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,400
This can reduce inflammation.

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,960
This is a pain-killer.

35
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,960
I'm not blind.

36
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,960
I want to see you eat them.

37
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,640
If you don't,

38
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,960
I will go tie Zhou Yu up.

39
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,400
What exactly do you see in her?

40
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,150
You protected her once,

41
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,030
but can you do it forever?

42
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,910
It started with her.

43
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,150
Jun won't let her go.

44
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,800
Finished?

45
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,470
Let him have a try.

46
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,270
Yan Ci.

47
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,750
Yan Ci, I brought the test paper for you.

48
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,750
Mr. Li asked me to give it to you.

49
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,390
The questions aren't hard.

50
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,430
I'm sure you'll pass.

51
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,360
Did you have a fight again?

52
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,270
Those people at the pool hall gave you trouble?

53
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,150
It's none of your business.

54
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,630
Want to know why Yan Ci got hurt?

55
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,030
Why?

56
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,440
There's someone I want you to meet.

57
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,560
You're afraid of me?

58
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,950
What good would it do me to sell you?

59
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,760
Besides,

60
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,190
I don't want Yan Ci to hate me.

61
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,880
Fine.

62
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,320
Let's go.

63
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,360
Yu is so conscienceless.

64
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,240
She left without me.

65
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,520
Yuzhou.

66
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,120
I'm so worried about my score.

67
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,310
If I fail it,

68
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,630
Dad will scold me again.

69
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,750
If only we could change our brains.

70
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,430
Cheng Yuzhou, what are you thinking?

71
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,560
Your mind has been wandering a lot.

72
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,720
Do you have someone you like?

73
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,680
Tell me. I can hook you up.

74
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,000
What's the relationship
between Zhou Yu and Yan Ci?

75
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,600
Them?

76
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,680
It's complicated.

77
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,480
Why?

78
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,830
Zhou Yu...

79
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,080
Keep talking.

80
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,430
I mean, it's Zhou Yu.

81
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,190
Why is she with Tang Qian?

82
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,240
I hate it when you look so innocent.

83
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,390
I don't like you either.

84
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,680
You think you know everyone,

85
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,120
but actually, you know nothing.

86
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,310
Jun is inside.

87
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,680
Jun...

88
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,360
What? You're scared?

89
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,190
Didn't you say

90
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,870
you'd protect Yan Ci?

91
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,320
Let's go.

92
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,000
Where are you going?

93
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,390
Why did you bring here here?

94
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,870
She got in Jun's way.

95
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,390
She needs to resolve it.

96
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,310
She doesn't know it,

97
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,480
but don't you know
what Wang Jun is like?

98
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,040
Do you want her to die here?

99
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,310
She came voluntarily. I didn't force her.

100
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,070
(You're hurt and still protecting her.)

101
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,480
Why did you listen to her?

102
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,230
How obedient you are.

103
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,870
Why don't you listen to what I say?

104
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,350
Yan Ci.

105
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,750
What did you do behind my back?

106
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,830
I said, it's none of your business.

107
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,080
Yan Ci.

108
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,510
I just like you.

109
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,240
