(Father Zhou and Mother Liu)

4
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,240
When are you gonna forgive this?

5
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,200
Until she dies!

6
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,560
She went to visit your parents' tomb
to atone for her sin.

7
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,350
Are you satisfied?

8
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,430
From now on,

9
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,920
I don't ever want to see you again.

10
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,480
Yan Ci.

11
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,170
(If youth is full of pain,)

12
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,540
(will you choose to forget it
or miss it?)

13
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,770
(2010)
(Only time will tell.)

14
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,240
Where are you going, girl?

15
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,430
She came to look for Yan Ci
eight times a month.

16
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,740
(Zhou Yu)

17
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,600
Yan Ci.

18
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,260
(Yan Ci)

19
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,120
Are you sober now?

20
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,510
You really think I won't hit you?

21
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,400
You smashed my mom's stall,
didn't you?

22
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,070
She deserved it.

23
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,560
Do you think it's fun?

24
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,950
I think it is quite fun.

25
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,870
How dare she!

26
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,520
He's bleeding.

27
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,560
How dare you hit Mr. Yan?

28
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,800
Make way!

29
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,560
Let me go.

30
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,630
Don't be so childish.

31
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,030
Childish?

32
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,200
Are you happy?

33
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,360
Do you feel happy
hanging out with these people?

34
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,470
I'll kill her then.

35
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,360
What do you want exactly?

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,680
I want to make you suffer
as much as I do.

37
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:46,900
Yan Ci.

38
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,870
Yan Ci.

39
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,920
How are you feeling?

40
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,120
Please make way.

41
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,470
Yan Ci, I just...

42
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,520
(I just want you
to get over that accident sooner.)

43
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,870
(Zhou Yu, you don't want
to be responsible for the accident?)

44
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,470
(Let's just split.)

45
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,840
The number you have dialed
is not being answered at the moment.

46
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,080
(Cheng Wanyue)
Please redial later.

47
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,750
Why doesn't Yan Ci answer my phone?

48
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,680
Watching TV instead of doing homework?

49
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,060
(Cheng Yuzhou)

50
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,910
What a rare visitor.

51
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,430
You're totally giving up

52
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,190
on your fruitless studies.

53
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,840
Don't be sarcastic.

54
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,400
Cheng Yuzhou.

55
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm your dearest sister.

56
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,710
I missed you a lot
when you weren't around.

57
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,000
By the way, Yuzhou,

58
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,590
the loquats Grandma just bought.
They're very sweet.

59
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,680
Have a try.

60
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,840
When did you become so nice?

61
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,150
Just have a try.

62
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,120
How could I harm you?

63
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,870
Cheng Wanyue, you...

64
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,150
Cheng Yuzhou, you actually
fell for my trick.

65
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,160
Fortunately, I only have to
put up with you for two months.

66
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,310
I'm not leaving this time.

67
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,360
I'll stay for a year.

68
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,480
- Why?
- Step aside.

69
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,620
Don't block the air conditioning.

70
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,950
(Math, 145)

71
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,270
Don't take it.

72
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,310
Cheng Yuzhou, you dog.

73
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,240
Let's go.

74
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,070
Why do you take me
to your classmate's home?

75
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,950
I want you to meet more friends.

76
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,000
It's up front. Let's go.

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,840
Did you bring money?

78
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,430
I don't need to.

79
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
She's my friend.

80
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,040
We can take as much as we want.

81
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,510
I assure you, it's quite sweet.

82
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,640
Yan Ci.

83
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,480
Your friend is not convenient now.

84
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,440
Mr. Yan.

85
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,720
The pancake stall is fixed.

86
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,880
Can we leave now?

87
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,910
Let's go.

88
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,720
Yu. Yan Ci.

89
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,560
Yan Ci, are you alright?

90
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:57,910
(The case has been solved.)

91
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,360
Yan Ci, you didn't even come
for the final exam.

92
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,750
Mr. Li wanted to talk to you.

93
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,750
Yu, ignore him.

94
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,630
Let me introduce.
This is my cousin, Cheng Yuzhou.

95
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,430
This is my best friend, Zhou Yu.

96
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,560
Hi.

97
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,120
I'm Zhou Yu.

98
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,870
Grandma, take a rest.

99
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,880
Time to take medicine.

100
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,510
Who are you?

101
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,800
I'm Yu.

102
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,120
Is Grandma getting better?

103
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,750
Still the same.
She got better after taking medicine.

104
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,240
And she did not relapse these days.
So it's been good.

105
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,560
Hello, madam.

106
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,510
They smashed your mom's stall?

107
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,150
By the way,

108
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,360
this is my grandma.

109
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,870
That was my mother.

110
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,390
Come here, Yu.

111
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,360
Let me get you something.

112
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,080
Don't move.

113
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,510
It's lip gloss.

114
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,680
You look pretty now.

115
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,110
Yu.

116
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,920
Have you finished your homework?

117
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,560
Use honey trap to keep my cousin.

118
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,160
I'm going to do my homework.

119
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,430
Yuzhou, pick some more.

120
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,430
Make yourself at home.

121
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,790
OK.

122
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,800
The sunkissed ones are sweeter.

123
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,950
But it's a bit high.

124
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,560
No, no, no.

125
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,400
Be careful.

126
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,400
Are you standing still?

127
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,430
Hold it. I'll throw them to you.

128
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,670
OK.

129
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,680
Come on.

130
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,070
Sorry, I hit you.

131
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,070
It's fine.

132
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,480
I didn't mean to peek.

133
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,440
Watch out.

134
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,600
How long are you gonna hold me?

135
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,880
Sorry.

136
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,950
Let me wash it for you.

137
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,000
I'll take it off then.

138
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,070
No, no.

139
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,210
Don't.

140
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,910
No trouble.

141
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,430
I'll wash it myself.

142
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,390
Your hair is messed up.
Take it as a mirror.

143
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,360
Thanks.

144
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,720
Yuzhou, time to go.

145
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,790
Coming.

146
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,750
Cheng Yuzhou,
you aren't watching the movie.

147
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
What are you up to?

Yeah.

151
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,000
You're hurt?

152
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,360
Get one for me.

153
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,240
Where are you hurt?

154
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,960
Give me your hand.

155
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,600
I said give me your hand.

156
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,680
Another one.

157
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,390
Don't move.

158
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,510
What are you staring at?

159
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,870
Nothing.

160
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,030
I'll get you a soda.

161
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,390
OK.

162
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,120

00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,290

Introduce yourself.

Hi everyone, I'm Cheng Yuzhou.

167
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,910
