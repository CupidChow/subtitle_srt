Qian, I want a haircut.

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,680
Alright, Wang.

6
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,030
Still the same style.

7
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,510
It looked good.

also comes to play snooker?

How about

we play a game?

Yan Ci.

16
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:03,990
I like you.

17
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:05,990
I want to chase you.

18
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,190
Do you know what it means
to like someone?

00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,920
Yan Ci.

20
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,430
You never looked at me seriously.

21
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,400

Cheng Yuzhou,
why didn't you give me a ride?

70
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,600
