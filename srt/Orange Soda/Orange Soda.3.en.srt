=Episode 3=

3
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,440
What do you want?

4
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,470
Yan Ci, Cheng Yuzhou.

5
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,320
Alright, stop.

6
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,280
Let's talk it out. Calm down.

7
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,440
OK.

8
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:00,790
Let's talk it out.

9
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,360
Get rid of

10
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,280
this post yourself.

11
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,760
Or you can keep it.

12
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,760
I can give it to the police as evidence.

13
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,200
If you

14
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,120
and the others in the group
still keep the photos

15
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,840
on any social platforms
and electronic devices,

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,870
it's even better.

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,200
Serving time in jail

18
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,040
can teach you how to be a human being.

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,200
Alright, let's have a talk.

20
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,790
- I...
- Yan Ci.

21
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,630
Stop fighting.

22
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,590
Stop it. Or the teachers will come.

23
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,710
- Cheng Yuzhou.
- Stop.

24
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,960
What are you doing?

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,240
Stop.

26
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,760
You guys, come to my office.

27
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,040
Stop looking.

28
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,480
Go back to your classroom.

29
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,840
Keep fighting if you dare.

30
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,680
Yan Ci.

31
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,560
- Stop it.
- Yan Ci. Yan Ci.

32
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,970
- How dare you keep fighting?
- Enough, enough.

33
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:57,400
Grandma, happy birthday.

34
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,040
Blow out the candle.

35
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,240
When is the exam?

36
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,500
In June.

37
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,000
You're going to college soon.

38
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,120
Your father left,

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,470
and you're leaving too.

40
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,030
Everyone in our family

41
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,150
is leaving.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,960
No one is leaving.

43
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,310
No one leaves.

44
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,870
Mom, Mom, Mom.

45
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,030
- You can't leave.
- Mom, Mom.

46
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,750
Mom, you're hurting Grandma.

47
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,150
Our family

48
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,470
will not get separated again, right?

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,840
You can't leave.

50
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,240
You can't leave.

51
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,640
No.

52
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,030
Dad.

53
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,590
How's everything going?

54
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,870
I'm doing fine here.

55
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,360
And Mom is

56
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,710
starting to get better.

57
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,080
Actually,

58
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,190
I want to get them out of this town.

59
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,400
But Mom's afraid.

60
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,000
She thought I'd leave her.

61
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,190
Please protect the two of them,

62
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,520
and keep them safe.

63
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,470
I miss you so much.

64
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,560
It's fine, Grandma.

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,750
You and Mom used to wash my pants

66
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,720
when I wet myself.

67
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,200
Yu.

68
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,430
I didn't mean to wet the bed.

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,750
I know, Grandma.

70
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,360
I know you like everything to be clean.

71
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,520
How about this,

72
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,390
I will help you get changed.

73
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,800
You will smell as good as before.

74
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,760
It's fine.

75
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,350
Come on.

76
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,380
(Truth-seeking Building)

77
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,310
What happened to them?

78
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,240
Don't know.

79
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,630
Maybe they spoke ill of Mr. Li.

80
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,310
They've been standing there
all afternoon.

81
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,190
What, you feel bad now?

82
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,560
Let me guess.
Which one do you feel bad for?

83
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,630
Missing school all day
and goofing around.

84
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,390
I'll see how you'll support yourself.

85
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,480
My mom is always like this.

86
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,600
Why did you ask to see me?

87
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,240
Did you hit Jun's cousin?

88
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,370
Someone named Wang Chuang.

89
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,590
What's wrong?

90
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,800
I heard

91
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,270
Jun is getting revenge for him.

92
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,270
Yan Ci.

93
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,560
Listen to me.

94
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,480
You can't afford to offend Jun.

95
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,080
Find a time.

96
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,190
- I will take you to apologize...
- No need.

97
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,310
I have my own plans.

98
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,070
So this has something to do

99
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,000
with Zhou Yu again?

100
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,070
What are you doing? Get back to work.

101
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,040
Run! Run!

102
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,440
Come on.

103
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,920
Come on.

104
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,270
Can you show some strength?

105
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,310
Did you skip lunch?

106
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,480
How will you beat our next class
at this speed?

107
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,040
Faster!

108
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,190
Can you be more accurate?

109
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,000
Come on, cheer up!

110
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,680
We encourage all-round development.
So you...

111
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,590
Mr. Li.

112
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,840
I can't stand it.

113
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,560
I'm going to have a relapse.

114
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,790
Whoever else can take it
should take it.

115
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,480
Why aren't you active

116
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,630
in winning honor for your class?

117
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,800
You.

118
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,750
Try to be the MVP.

119
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,270
The school will reward you

120
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,150
with an MP4.

121
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,030
The newest version.

122
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,480
I don't even want an MP10.

123
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,870
It's too tiring.

124
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,320
You...

125
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,680
I'll do it.

126
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,590
If I knew I'd only be punished
to stand in the corner,

127
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,840
I would have punched him harder.

128
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,670
You can stand in the corner yourself.

129
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,750
No one is stopping you.

130
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,120
That's quick for you to fall out.

131
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,000
I rented a good movie.
Let's go watch it in my place.

132
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,120
Come on.

133
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,720
Two heroes punished the evil.

134
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:25,840
We should celebrate it.

135
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,270
- Let's go.
- What movie?

136
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,720
- With romantic scenes.
- Boring.

137
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,030
Come on.

138
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,470
Let's go.

139
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,550
What are you talking about?

140
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,840
- Let me hear.
- Just watching a movie.

141
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,840
A movie? I wanna join.

142
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,550
Yu, let's go watch a movie.

143
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,360
They didn't even tell us.

144
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,150
Alright, let's go.

145
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,160
Go.

146
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,360
So touching.

147
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,860
(Avatar)

148
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,750
Will anyone buy this movie?

149
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,230
Yu.

150
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,960
Hi, madam.

151
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,720
- I'm just passing by.
- Hi, madam.

152
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,510
Mrs. Cheng said you're here,

153
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,440
so I came to pick you up.

154
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,960
- Mom, it's late.
- Yan Ci, you're here too.

155
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,480
The grocery store is having a sale.

156
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,000
I bought some food.

157
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,600
You can come with us.

158
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,630
I bought a lot of things.

159
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,840
You can enjoy them together.

160
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,670
Madam, it's too nice of you.

161
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,630
It's nothing. I bought a lot.

162
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,790
Share it.

163
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,960
OK, I'll take some.

164
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,870
Lu Yang.

165
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,320
Take another one. Not this one.

166
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,200
Mom.

167
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,120
Yan Ci likes to eat it.

168
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,510
I'll take this one then.

169
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,440
Yan Ci, I bought your favorite,

170
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,720
canned yellow peaches.

171
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,670
