OK, we'll feed you.

110
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,190
Eat more, so you can grow taller.

111
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,870
Just a little taller.

112
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,040
I'm not short.

113
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,670

115
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,560
No one came to take it
after the scheduled time.

116

I thought you didn't want it,

117
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,360
so I already sold it.

118
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,510
What to do? Will Wanyue get angry?

119
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,630
Come on, cheers.

120
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,470

If you leave as soon as you come,

137
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,510
I'll be mad at you.

138

She came on time.

139
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,440
I took her to get the cake.

140
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,720
It's your fault then, Cheng Yuzhou.

141
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,440

145
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,480
You guys have fun. I'm leaving.

146
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,670
Yan Ci, why are you in a hurry?

147
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,390
- You're leaving already?
- Yan Ci.

148
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,840
Today's my birthday.

149
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,840
No one leaves.

150
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,510
Moreover,

151
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,870
school will start soon.

152
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,630
We won't be able to have much fun.

153
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,990
Let's go.

154
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,200
Come on.

155
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,200
Come on, Yu.

156
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,350
Sit down.

157
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,440
Come on, let's play the game.

158
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,960
Let me make it clear.

159
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,270
The sore losers should admit defeat first.

160
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,200
Or no one can get away with it.

161
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,470
OK.

162
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,000
First round, the two people the bottle
points to should have a linkarmdrink.

163
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,680
No problem.

164
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,670
So it's us two.

165
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,840
OK, the second round,

166
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,480
the two people gets pointed to

167
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,670
will have to drink this.

168
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,240
Oh no, seriously?

169
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,320
This is too much.

170
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,390
I quit.

171
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,750
Zhou Yu.

172
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,440
You're really drinking it?

173
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,960
Yu.

174
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,710
Maybe forget it.

175
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,270
- You'll feel bad.
- Yeah.

176
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,790
You should have some water.

177
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,960
Are you alright?

178
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,510
Yan Ci can't have something spicy.

179
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,080
I will let him go.

180
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,040
Boring.

181
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,200
I left your gift on the desk.

182
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,590
Yan Ci.

183
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,390
Forget it, let's ignore him.

184
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,390
Continue.

185
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,870
This round,

186
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,390
the two people get pointed to

187
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,550
will watch a horror movie together.

188
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,750
This is good.

189
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,030
Luckily, not me.

190
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,150
Every dog has its day.

191
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,040
Yuzhou.

192
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,270
Can you watch it yourself?

193
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,270
- You're cheating.
- Yeah.

194
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,440
I'm the birthday girl.

195
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,000
Can you do this to me?

196
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,200
It's no exception.

197
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,510
- Yu.
- Follow the rule.

198
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,120
Do you watch this kind of movie?

199
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,230
You're scared?

200
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,200
No. I haven't watched one.

201
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,550
I can't believe this is the first time
you've kissed a girl.

202
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,550
I swear.

203
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,000
You're drunk.

204
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,720
(Honeydew)
It surely has degrees.

205
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,120
But only 1.5 degrees.

206
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,030
Yu, wake up.

207
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,800
Time for the cake.

208
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,470
Yu.

209
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,360
- I want to go home.
- She can't hold her liquor.

210
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,960
You guys go on.

211
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,360
I will send her home.

212
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,510
Let's go eat the cake.

213
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,030
- OK.
- Let's go.

214
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,660

215
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,360
