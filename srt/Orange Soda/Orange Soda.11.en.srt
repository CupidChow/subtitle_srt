=Episode 11=

3
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,600
Why did you come?

4
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,230
I just realized I hadn't sent you flowers.

5
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,590
Did I disturb your sleep?

6
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,190
Have you considered
which city to go for college?

7
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,040
No.

8
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,120
Do you want to go to Hechuan?

9
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,120
Why?

10
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,640
It's close to here.

11
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,000
You can visit your mom and grandma
any time you want.

12
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,040
And the food there suit your taste.

13
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,640
The city is full of plane trees.

14
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,280
It's Hechuan's feature.

15
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,320
And its scenery is beautiful in summer.

16
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,590
Sounds good.

17
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,120
So

18
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,790
we can go to Hechuan University together.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,840
But...

20
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,000
But the admission score...

21
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,190
With your grades,
you can definitely make it.

22
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,470
I'll take you to an old restaurant

23
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,360
near Hechuan University.

24
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,620
Their duck blood and vermicelli soup
is quite tasty.

25
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,310
After that, we can go to
Xuanwu Lake for a walk.

26
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,030
Strolling around.

27
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,960
Hello.

28
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,470
Cheng Wanyue.

29
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,800
Yuzhou.

30
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,560
Cheng Wanyue, you...

31
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,360
Yuzhou.

32
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,400
What should I do?

33
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,240
It'll be fine.

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,960
It'll definitely be fine.

35
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,800
Cheng Yuzhou.

36
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,430
I've made up my mind.

37
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,000
Before going to Hechuan,

38
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,910
I want to treat Yu

39
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,240
and everyone to hot pot.

40
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,710
But I don't want to tell them now.

41
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,560
OK.

42
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,830
I don't want everyone to feel sad

43
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,000
in our last meeting.

44
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,920
Can you keep it a secret for me?

45
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,030
Sure.

46
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,710
Have some more.

47
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,760
Cheng Wanyue.

48
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,680
Why do you want to move suddenly?

49
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,120
What? My cousin can come here,

50
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,430
and I can't go to Hechuan?

51
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,190
It's not that, Wanyue.

52
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,430
I didn't know you would move out.

53
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,800
My dad got promoted.

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,600
We were supposed to move earlier,

55
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,120
but I wanted to stay here longer.

56
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,600
Yu, don't be sad today.

57
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,950
Be happy together with me.

58
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,120
Have some more.

59
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,320
Come on.

60
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,710

where do you want to go to college?

62
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,310
Wherever I'm admitted.

63
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,750
Yu, what about you?

64
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,920
What do you want to major in?

65
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,800
I...

66
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,190
I want to study broadcasting.

67
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,750
Where do you want to study that?

68
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,310
Hechuan University is fine.

69
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,630
Their radio and broadcasting major
is quite good.

70
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,070
You're going there together?

71
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,720
I'm following her.
