00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,772
THE ORIGINS OF THE FANTASTIC FOUR,
1996

2
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,909
I'm too scared to ride alone.

3
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,579
Then what? You want me to ride alone?

4
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:41,750
I'm a girl, you know.

5
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,711
-Anyone riding alone?
-Here.

6
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,927
Joo-man, look here.

7
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,095
Ready?

8
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,431
One, two, three.

9
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,362
That's enough.

10
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,115
You'll have nothing left
if you give away so much.

11
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:21,790
Text drinker lady,
"Thank you for the plum extract."

12
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:27,796
Sul-hee.

13
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,757
How did you decide to make wine
when you don't drink?

14
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,885
My dad, you, Dong-man and Joo-man.

15
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,096
Everyone I like is a drinker.

16
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,598
Everyone becomes happy when they drink.

17
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:43,186
True. Your plum wine makes us happy.

18
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:47,232
Everything else is fine and all,

19
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,485
but I miss the four us drinking
at Namil Bar

20
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:53,071
and having breakfast together.

21
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,281
That's when we recharged ourselves.

22
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,700
Why do you miss something that stupid?

23
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,911
One shot himself in the foot,

24
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,956
and the other left so that he could fight.

25
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,459
Kim Joo-man, that jerk.

26
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,843
Hey, why are you being so weird,
cooking for me?

27
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,804
What is this?

28
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,306
What are you wearing?
You're offending me.

29
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,226
I'm going to start a lunchbox business.

30
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:26,312
You didn't eat yet, right?
Sit down and eat the end pieces.

31
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,239
Sul-hee used to always cook me,

32
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,991
but I never cooked for her myself.

33
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:41,578
I guess your diaphragm is wide awake now.

34
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,580
I'll make her breakfast, 

35
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,915
and pick up dinner
from the best restaurants.

36
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:50,253
-Don't be like that.
-Why not?

37
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:55,550
Well, it makes me look bad in comparison.

38
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,928
Did you really date Ae-ra?

39
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,597
You sure it wasn't in your head?

40
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,974
Do you want a beating?

41
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,810
I had no idea.
How did you break up already?

42
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,699
I guess your plum extract
is selling well by now.

43
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,244
I'm not going to eat it, so don't bother.

44
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,250
-Ae-ra, this isn't...
-This is between us.

45
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,169
It's between us. 

46
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:35,006
It's lunch I made for Sul-hee.

47
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,675
Gosh, this punk.

48
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,014
You made this?

49
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:44,682
Yes.

50
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,311
Also, can we talk for a minute?

51
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,672
Do you want to carpool?

52
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,008
What's this?

53
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,011
Mr. Choi from team two was sent
to an overseas branch.

54
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,721
I bought it for cheap.

55
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,101
Isn't Mr. Choi a man?
Why is everything inside pink?

56
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:31,813
-I did some tuning.
-So you could carpool with me?

57
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,191
-Our country doesn't produce any oil...
-I'm not getting in.

58
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,738
I shouldn't have mentioned the oil.

59
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:06,848
Get out.

60
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,116
When did you learn how to drive?

61
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,453
Jokbal delivery car.
We make deliveries by car.

62
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,707
Our Sul-hee got even cooler
after starting her own business.

63
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,168
I'm not your Sul-hee.

64
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,675
You can eat the porridge in the freezer.

65
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,802
Just defrost it and then boil it.

66
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,310
Why are you so cool?

67
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,771
Are we talking again two weeks
our break up?

68
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,022
I never said that.

69
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,648
I'm not cool with it.

70
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,651
I feel the same about you
as I did two weeks ago.

71
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,863
When I see you, I want to hold your hand,

72
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,115
and take you home.

73
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,452
But you still wanted to break up.

74
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,372
I can't even tell you to eat
what's in the fridge?

75
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:13,831
Don't.

76
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,628
I won't be able to stand you
if you linger around and talk to me.

77
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:20,588
So...

78
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,718
Unless you plan on going out
with me again, don't talk to me.

79
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,102
Why is he still so straightforward?

80
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,819
My goodness.

81
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,239
What? What is it?

82
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,241
Why haven't you returned my pot?

83
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,995
Do you think I won't return it?
Why do you always come up here?

84
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,498
It's the only big pot I have.

85
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,375
Hey.

86
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,794
Did you bring that for me?

87
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,712
Why are you such a busybody?

88
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,383
Do you have...

89
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,385
cancer?

90
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,889
Who would ask such a thing so frankly?

91
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,560
You're not terminally ill, right?

92
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,562
My breast cancer is all gone now.

93
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,606
-I'm completely recovered.
-That's good.

94
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,650
Thank you.

95
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,697
Aren't you going down?

96
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,908
It's hot. Let me get some cool air.

97
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,203
This isn't a bank, you know.

98
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,635
Are you home?

99
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:57,310
Why are you throwing your bag?

100
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:00,480
I'm so mad. I won't go to school.

101
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,773
Did you not get picked
as the class president?

102
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,234
Why does every homework have to do
with moms?

103
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:09,322
We have to draw her, write to her
and help her.

104
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:13,534
Then they should only allow kids with moms
to enroll at schools.

105
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,578
Why am I the only one without a mom?

106
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,623
Sul-hee has one and Dong-man has one, too.

107
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:19,916
Why don't I have one?

108
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,879
But you're still the boss
out of the three.

109
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,047
I don't want to.

110
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,424
Bring my mom.

111
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,138
Did she really die?

112
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:38,935
She's now an angel protecting you.

113
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,812
She even made you the boss of the town.

114
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,441
Grandma's poker friend told me...

115
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,361
that my mom was kicked out.

116
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,738
She must have gone senile.

117
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,534
Are you sure she's up there?

118
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,538
Why? Are you upset?

119
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,542
I don't know. I've never seen her before.

120
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:12,051
Then throw these out.

121
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,803
What are these?

122
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:18,933
All the other kids were making them.

123
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,150
Mom, Merry Christmas!

124
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,614
I made it just in case.

125
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:37,243
Our dog came back home after a while, too.

126
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,454
I thought maybe mom might, too.

127
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,208
Ae-ra.

128
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,173
Do you want me to make you a snack?

129
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,927
Try making two.

130
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,098
All right.

131
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,725
We can share.

132
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,957
I love you.
Ae-ra loves you, mom.

133
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,303
Who are you?

134
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:45,561
Those pictures...

135
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,231
Are they of me?

136
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,914
I'll explain it all to you.

137
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,999
I had no choice but to do this.

138
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,835
It's strange.

139
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,297
I'd understand if you had died.

140
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,549
You're...

141
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,137
doing so well, aging beautifully.

142
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,057
Why?

143
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,228
No, Ae-ra.

144
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:32,483
I didn't leave you. It's not like that.

145
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:35,277
Were you watching me as a landlord?

146
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,574
You weren't there when I needed a mom.

147
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,285
Now, you're watching me in hiding?

148
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,287
That's unfair.

149
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,290
I just missed you so much.

150
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,962
I feel like I was thrown away.
This feels so weird.

151
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,303
I'll just remember that you're alive.

152
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,556
But...

153
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,810
I don't want to see you.

154
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,282
Why do you care if I eat or not?

155
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,160
If you're so worried, then don't break up.

156
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,288
Don't make food for me
if we're breaking up.

157
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,269
Can you tell Ae-ra not to go overboard?

158
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:55,816
What is this?

159
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,027
Porridge.

160
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,241
I'm giving it to you
because I made too much.

161
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,285
What kind of logic is that?

162
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:11,957
It's...

163
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:16,128
the same porridge she made
when you left for the army

164
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,588
and when you were sick.

165
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,552
Eat and sober up before serving the army.
I'll wait for you.

166
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,554
Your First Lady, Choi.

167
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:42,988
Dong-man.

168
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,333
Can't you stay?

169
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,087
Why is she holding my porridge?

170
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:03,384
I know you thought I waited for you,

171
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,885
because of this porridge.

172
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,305
But it wasn't me.

173
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,849
It wasn't?

174
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,893
Ae-ra waited for you
while you were in the army,

175
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,188
and she convinced me to get married.

176
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,484
Let go.

177
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,945
You're getting married tomorrow.

178
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:24,488
I can't do it.

179
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,533
I don't think I can do it.

180
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,660
Dong-man is dumb.

181
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,121
He doesn't care about what's beneficial
to him.

182
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,624
He liked you with everything he had.

183
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:40,087
If you sway him and get married tomorrow,

184
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,132
Dong-man won't be able to live.

185
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,596
I can't do this either.

186
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,184
I know you liked Dong-man.

187
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,396
I understand that you want to get married
to a wealthy guy.

188
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:03,027
Just leave him so he can live.

189
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,411
What is it?

190
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,788
My heater is broken.

191
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,373
Sul-hee went to Joo-man's.

192
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,126
-So you want to stay at my place?
-Can't I?

193
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,843
How can she sleep so well?

194
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,472
She sleeps as soon as she puts
her head down.

195
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,449
-Eat up.
-I don't want to.

196
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,534
Why? Why not?

197
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,079
Are you telling everybody you got dumped?

198
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,789
Stop overreacting. Just eat.

199
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,503
It's braised short ribs.

200
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,590
Are you having a party?
Why would you get short ribs?

201
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,220
Hey, what are you doing?

202
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,515
What are you doing?

203
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:18,060
What do you think I'm doing?

204
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,187
Do you have constipation?

205
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,481
I didn't hear the water running,
so I checked.

206
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,566
Please go home.

207
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:38,038
Hey, Dong-man!

208
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,882
His heart is beating too fast.

209
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,760
I think he really took something.

210
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,973
-Hey!
-It's for indigestion.

211
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,892
You fed me so much
that I have a bad stomach.

212
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,311
My gosh.

213
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,356
Why would you get a big bottle of it?

214
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,111
-Ae-ra.
-What, you punk!

215
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,905
-Your heater didn't break, right?
-What?

216
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,992
You're watching me
because you're afraid I might die.

217
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,412
Do you think I'm going to hang myself?

218
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,164
Do you think I'll take pills?

219
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,332
My heater is broken.

220
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:26,253
Why would you stay at a guy's house
because your heater broke in the summer?

221
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,756
You're not that smart, you know.

222
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:30,799
What's this?

223
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,387
-It's samgyetang with two abalones.
-Gosh.

224
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:41,643
Gosh, stop feeding me.
I got dumped...

225
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,146
and gained 3 kg because of you.

226
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,482
Shut up.

227
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,362
You're both stupid, so I got in the way.

228
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,907
Get ahold of yourself and don't lose her.

229
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:59,411
A dummy like you
needs another dummy like her.

230
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:09,129
You're a strong candidate this time.

231
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:10,756
If you get promoted, 

232
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,759
there's this new spicy chicken place...

233
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,844
We can talk once it's confirmed.

234
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,972
-What?
-It won't be chicken then.

235
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,058
I'll treat you to beef.

236
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,438
You're so good with words.

237
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,737
What do I do, Mr. Kim?

238
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,656
I think I broke this.

239
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,826
Why do I always cause trouble?

240
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:43,622
Stand up!

241
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,083
Don't crouch down in the copy room.

242
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,168
You can fix it by yourself.

243
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,338
You can read the manual here.

244
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,507
And make sure not to make
the same mistake.

245
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:11,024
You deserve a full-time position.

246
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,529
People keep taking credit
for someone else's work.

247
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:19,283
-But...
-I know.

248
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,869
I'm sorry to say this to you.

249
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,748
What's this?

250
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,333
RESIGNATION LETTER

251
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:32,087
-Don't do this out of anger.
-It's not out of anger.

252
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,299
My plum extract is on high demand,

253
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,092
so I need time to package them.

254
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,136
So you're quitting work?

255
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,889
I'm sorry. I know it's sudden.

256
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:43,807
Sul-hee.

257
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:48,103
-Out of all the resignation letters--
-You must be flustererd...

258
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,564
It's very satisfying.

259
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:53,942
My goodness.

260
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,903
Do they sell that well?

261
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:00,407
It's really good if you mix it with soju.

262
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,909
Sul-hee.

263
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,745
Please do well and come
on our home shopping channel.

264
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,582
Boss everybody around like a boss, okay?

265
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,417
Okay.

266
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:17,841
I'm home.

267
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:25,474
What is it? You're not even looking at me.

268
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,683
Something wrong?

269
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,480
-Nam-il.
-Yes?

270
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,151
Can you get my flip phone back?

271
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,446
You wondered about it.

272
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:47,329
Let's go back to Japan.

273
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,848
What's in here anyway?

274
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:12,062
Money? Documents?
Is it something like that?

275
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,857
You can probably figure out the passcode.

276
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:17,776
What?

277
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,654
She said it's her daughter and son's
birthdays.

278
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,953
It's the will she made
when she had cancer.

279
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,956
It's yours. It's from Mom.

280
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,460
I don't want it.

281
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,795
Whatever it is, I don't want to see it.

282
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,213
Mom...

283
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,966
was by your side for all 30 years.

284
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,345
What?

285
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:30,307
That's why she kept this phone,
so just have a look.

286
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,149
I'll get going.

287
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:01,755
Dad.

288
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,675
I was looking at something right now.

289
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:08,887
What's this?

290
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,182
What's all this?

291
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,060
Who is she?

292
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,399
This is not everything.

293
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,319
She'd come to the graduation ceremonies,

294
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,364
field trips and picnics.

295
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,366
She showed up for all special events.

296
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,663
She covered her face with sunglasses
and hat, but she stood out even more.

297
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,920
Your grandmother was really horrible
to her.

298
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,925
I guess everyone knew but me.

299
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,010
Don't resent your mom.

300
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:53,014
For every 10,000 won she earned in Japan,

301
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,100
she sent you 8,000 won.

302
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,979
She couldn't do that
when her business failed,

303
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:02,524
but she sent you a lot of money
while you were growing up.

304
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:05,861
What money? I never got a cent from her.

305
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:10,532
There were times when I only sold
two mackerel stews a day.

306
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,326
How could I afford to send you to college?

307
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,455
You were a troublemaker, too.

308
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,748
You got into a lot of trouble growing up.

309
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,709
I did not.

310
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,753
You rode a scooter in college
and scratched someone's car.

311
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,339
That's not even an accident.

312
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:30,469
In middle school, you played with matches
and set fire to a field.

313
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:34,473
You burnt around 30 hectares. 

314
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:39,102
-You were almost jailed.
-That's enough.

315
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,272
You were a high maintenance girl.

316
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,451
LANDLADY

317
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:04,377
Now I have a "Mom"
saved in my phone contact.

318
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:17,098
I thought you didn't want to talk,
so why carry my bag?

319
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,978
-Hey egg porridge.
-What?

320
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,398
If you went to see your dad this late, 

321
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,234
I guess you know about your mom.

322
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:32,322
-How did you know?
-I knew everything about you for 23 years.

323
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,158
Don't pretend we're close.

324
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,118
You...

325
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,248
lie low for about two months.

326
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,917
Don't go on blind dates, 

327
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,253
or see anyone else for two months.

328
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,046
I'll go clubbing.

329
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:56,429
For the time being, we went our own way.

330
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:02,561
You're the first female announcer
in Korea's MMA history.

331
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:07,732
So the concept of this cover shoot
is "pioneer" or "role model."

332
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,694
Why should a role model wear
something like this?

333
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:14,698
You'll wear this, hold a mic in one hand
and a glove in the other hand.

334
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:19,035
Why should an announcer wear
and short skirt and hold a mic?

335
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,247
I guess you weren't briefed beforehand.

336
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:27,877
I guess you weren't told about me
beforehand.

337
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:32,841
Ae-ra became a microphone psycho
with a louder voice.

338
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:39,848
Without a prince or a makeover,

339
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:42,267
Sul-hee stood on her own feet.

340
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:52,068
Send this photo to Drunken Fairy.

341
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:54,904
TO DRUNKEN FAIRY 

342
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:02,037
Drunken Fairy, your tasty plum extract's
on its way.

343
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:13,757
BUSINESS LICENSE

344
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:24,309
And Joo-man has been apologizing
for 61 days.

345
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:43,787
That pizza is family sized.

346
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:45,372
Can you eat it all?

347
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:57,884
Dong-man just trained like a monster
as if he was getting an upgrade.

348
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,428
Tap, tap!

349
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:03,473
I tapped out.

350
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,227
Tap? There's no tap.

351
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,187
We ain't got time for tap.

352
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,031
One more time.

353
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,076
One more time!

354
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,537
There's no standing up
when you learn from me.

355
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,082
-Let's go.
-Darn it!

356
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,169
Listen, Dong-man.

357
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:35,672
We only have two months
for you to get ready.

358
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:39,008
So I can just teach you three techniques
for you to master.

359
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,054
Three? I got it.

360
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,726
Just three? Master, go!

361
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,686
These are all finishing techniques,

362
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:52,439
and you only need one
for you to win the fight.

363
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,736
Why do you care about my birthday?

364
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,947
It's your birthday.
Of course I have to visit.

365
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,908
Who did you say ordered
the large size jokbal?

366
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,744
Mother.

367
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,871
I'll deliver that. Where should I go?

368
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:09,956
This is too awkward.

369
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,374
You're back?

370
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,711
How have you been?

371
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:17,088
Wear something with sleeves.
That's gross.

372
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,591
Did the gym close early today?

373
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:21,968
I heard you broke up with Sul-hee.

374
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,387
So why are you here?

375
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,268
I heard you broke up.

376
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,314
-Why are you here?
-Why are you here?

377
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,696
Sul-hee.

378
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,204
It's our new menu. See if you like it.

379
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,206
Okay.

380
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,587
It tastes good.

381
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,925
I thought the folder phone
was the key to a fortune.

382
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,637
If I had a fortune, I'd spend it.
Why give it to you guys?

383
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:08,014
You make me look bad.

384
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:10,809
You put me in such horrible situations.

385
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,353
Nam-il.

386
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,147
In Japan,

387
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,484
when the police told me
they caught the pickpocket,

388
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,320
that's when I met
the 15-year-old Kim Nam-il.

389
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:27,283
Kim Nam-il, who was born in Korea in 1989.

390
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:33,039
I was shocked when they told me
you were an orphan with no guardian.

391
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,252
I thought you were in a mess
because you had no mom.

392
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:42,340
You reminded me of the daughter
I couldn't raise.

393
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:46,219
So what? You raised Nam-il
instead of Nam-il as a replacement?

394
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:48,888
You weren't a replacement. You are my son.

395
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:51,975
From then on, 

396
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,060
I lived for you.

397
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:59,065
I didn't save you. You saved me.

398
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,235
Would I leave you because I found Ae-ra?

399
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,653
You fool.

400
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,990
Are you trying to make me cry?

401
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,743
You're all I have.
I'm bound to feel jealous.

402
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,873
When will you fully grow up?

403
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:19,752
Is our flight tomorrow at 7 p.m.?

404
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:22,171
I'll go to Japan alone.

405
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,882
You stay a bit longer.

406
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:26,175
What?

407
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:29,804
We shared 14 years together
and you spent less than a year with her.

408
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:35,059
Let's say I'm lending you to her.

409
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,605
So, spend a little more time here.

410
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,822
You weren't always this thoughtful.

411
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,999
Why did you come here?

412
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,960
Why care about your ex-girlfriend's
dad's birthday?

413
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,424
-Sul-hee, I think I have indigestion.
-You couldn't say a word.

414
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,138
-Sul-hee, you know?
-What?

415
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,767
-What does your third brother do...
-He's sweet.

416
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:19,312
-He should be a soldier.
-Prick your thumb when you get home.

417
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,731
My thumb? Myself? With a needle?

418
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:25,193
My back still hurts.

419
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,488
My whole back could get infected.

420
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,701
-Darn it!
-Did you just say darn it?

421
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:38,289
-Brothers!
-Don't. Stop!

422
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:44,128
-Come on.
-What do you want?

423
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,839
If your student for 15 years
ends up a loser, 

424
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,258
you said your life would be a waste, too.

425
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,468
So what?

426
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:55,306
Dong-man's been filming commercials,
using the media

427
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,308
and threatening me.

428
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,144
-We have to fight.
-How are you going to fight him?

429
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:03,106
Will you bribe people and try to cheat?

430
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,650
I'll fight for real.

431
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,903
So just come with me.

432
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,239
I won't lose this time.

433
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,625
Do you have you passport?
You can't go without it.

434
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,127
Thanks for everything, Soondae.

435
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,338
Did he just call me Soondae?

436
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,090
Dong-man.

437
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,927
I'm sorry for training you so hard,
but we had two months to get you ready.

438
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,014
Sorry?

439
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,891
Why are you sorry?

440
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,436
All I can say is thank you.

441
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,064
Thank you, bro.

442
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:51,112
I'm sorry I yelled at you and everything.

443
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,615
We won't see each other again, but...

444
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:56,993
see you again.

445
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:59,620
You never know, we might meet
in the ring very soon.

446
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,876
Yes, yes. You can come eat sausages.

447
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,253
Here. Air. Eat it there.

448
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:09,839
Take care of yourself, Soondae.

449
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,674
Sure. Thank you!

450
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,594
-See you later.
-Bye.

451
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,267
DONGCHUN GYMNASIUM

452
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,442
Thank you everyone for your patience.

453
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:32,070
It's finally time for tonight's big match.

454
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,281
It's RFC's top predator, Kim Tak-su versus

455
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:41,162
the rising star that shook the Octagon,
Ko Dong-man match will start soon.

456
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,332
Please welcome them
with your warm applause.

457
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,128
That's my daughter.

458
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,716
She's got that talent from me.

459
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,635
RFC Final.

460
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,887
Championship title match
for lightweight group.

461
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,556
Here comes Ko Dong-man!

462
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,329
He's so cool.

463
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,512
-I'll fight in standing the first round.
-Dong-man.

464
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,389
-From the second round...
-Dong-man.

465
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,351
Just do what you want.

466
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:49,313
-Pardon?
-Forget about strategies and coaching.

467
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,232
Just do what you want.

468
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:55,987
Just for today, I won't yell at you
to do something.

469
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,573
What's gotten into you?

470
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:01,826
Look around.

471
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,290
Think about it.

472
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,000
Dong-man.

473
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,837
Just standing here makes you the winner.

474
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:20,887
I don't like open endings
that are ambiguous.

475
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,513
What?

476
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,892
If I'm going to win, I want to win
properly and end it for good.

477
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,186
Open up.

478
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:32,899
Enjoy!

479
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,991
Today's game will have three rounds
and one extra round.

480
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,035
Okay!

481
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,912
Ready, fight!

482
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:24,909
Kim Tak-su wants to use the ground
from the start.

483
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,328
Stop. Standing.

484
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,207
Fight!

485
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,893
Can't you fight on the ground?

486
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,562
This is your limit. 

487
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,816
-Is this the best you got?
-What?

488
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:01,153
Thanks for the show.
I'll start fighting now.

489
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,822
What are you talking about?

490
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,668
Ko Dong-man is taking him
on the ground now.

491
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:33,936
Give up?

492
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,521
Give up?

493
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,149
Give up?

494
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,775
Dong-man, end it!

495
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:42,862
Tak-su, get out of it!

496
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,281
Give up? Stop!

497
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,620
Spit it out.

498
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,875
What's with him?
When did he start fighting on ground?

499
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,626
We have no choice. Face him head-on.

500
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,421
No, no. Let's wait until the judges call.

501
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:03,132
If you can last, I'll make it happen.

502
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:09,805
-Are you sure you won't coach me?
-Why bother coaching an animal?

503
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,141
Ready, fight!

504
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,320
I told you to do it properly
if you're going to copy my kick.

505
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,385
KO!

506
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:16,205
I have to protect Dong-hee until the end.

507
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,749
I shouldn't go if I know I can't win.

508
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,004
I want to do it!

509
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:26,340
I'm dying to do it.

510
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,175
I'm going to fight!

511
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,969
I'm going do it!

512
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:32,263
I'm telling you I can fight!

513
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,683
Tell them not to stop!

514
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:37,893
I can do it, I can!

515
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:45,901
This match ended at 27 seconds
in the second round.

516
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,987
Due to a knock out from a kick,

517
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:51,157
Taekwon boy, Ko Dong-man is the winner!

518
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:59,165
Good job, Dong-man!

519
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,715
He's my son.

520
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,468
I didn't say anything.

521
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,473
Dong-man ended up getting the gold medal!

522
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:18,017
That punk.

523
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:20,769
I better break his legs to stop him
from fighting.

524
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,610
Why is he so cool?

525
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,320
How annoying.

526
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,838
You fool, not again.

527
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:54,220
I dare to say that no one in Korea
will be able to beat him.

528
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:09,693
I think we could say that it's a feat
achieved in ten years.

529
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:17,243
Could you say a few words
about how you feel?

530
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,163
Okay.

531
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:27,711
I'm happy since I was able to overcome
my weak ground techniques...

532
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:33,342
and I want to thank everyone
for cheering for me.

533
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:41,183
We'll do a detailed interview
in the studio.

534
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,687
Athlete Ko Dong-man,

535
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,606
I sincerely congratulate you.

536
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,332
Why are you crying again?

537
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:11,463
Who cares if your ex wins or loses?
Why are you crying?

538
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,925
We shouldn't have dated.

539
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,427
Ae-ra.

540
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:19,638
I...

541
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,142
can't live without you.

542
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,770
But I can't ask you to take me back
in case we break up again.

543
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,610
I should've listened to Sul-hee.

544
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,028
So...

545
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:38,407
let's forget about dating and breaking up.

546
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:42,328
Just live with me.

547
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,751
-What?
-Live with me.

548
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,129
You want me to move in with you?

549
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:54,590
Hey.

550
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,051
If we kiss, it's day one.

551
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,386
If we live together...

552
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:02,431
it's marriage.

553
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,645
Marry me.

554
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:16,028
I can't live without you.

555
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,864
That's how it's been for 20 years.

556
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,034
If I have to choose

557
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:24,536
between never seeing you
and seeing you everyday,

558
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:26,789
I would choose...

559
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:31,835
to see you forever.

560
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:38,967
-What about MMA fighting?
-You.

561
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:40,636
You.

562
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:42,513
It's you. You.

563
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,351
It has to be you.

564
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:51,897
Marry me.

565
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:53,857
Okay?

566
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:58,278
Why bother asking?

567
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,419
Goodness.

568
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:17,172
Who will stop those young kids?

569
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,383
Why, that punk...

570
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:22,094
What did he say to make her cry?

571
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:24,555
You punk.

572
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,890
Why are you calling my son a punk?

573
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:28,559
I'm just...

574
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:31,145
letting you hold my hand for a minute.

575
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,689
People watching soccer hold hands
at times, too.

576
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:39,069
Anyway, I didn't forgive you
and we're not back together.

577
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,529
Gosh!

578
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,781
Why did you kiss me?

579
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,408
Why? Why did you kiss?

580
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:46,702
I'm fine with getting beaten up
for kissing you.

581
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:47,661
Gosh!

582
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,334
Did you just swear?

583
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,966
It's not a small wedding
because I want it to be small,

584
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,593
but it was forced on me.

585
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:15,063
The groom is always so unprepared.

586
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:18,817
Is a wedding a joke to you?

587
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:21,278
We need to plan what we're going to do...

588
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:22,905
Just trust me.

589
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:25,115
I have a plan in mind.

590
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:28,994
You shouldn't make plans.

591
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,872
You shouldn't abuse your head like that.

592
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,333
Okay, okay.

593
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:43,884
What's that noise?

594
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,386
Joo-man, are you crushing garlic?

595
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,723
Why would he crush garlic?

596
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,520
I think...

597
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,815
I think I know this sound.

598
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,608
What? What is it now?

599
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:01,652
Get up.

600
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,028
Let's go.

601
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,245
Hey, Diaphragm.

602
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,248
Were you peeling green plums?

603
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,084
That's what that sound was.

604
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,503
Stop calling me "Diaphragm."

605
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,381
Why are you peeling green plums?

606
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:28,595
It's just a side job.

607
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:31,306
I'm helping Sul-hee with her plum extract.

608
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:33,851
I get paid a set amount
for every bowl I peel.

609
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:38,063
Joo-man, did you know that Sul-hee ran
away from home often when she was little?

610
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,399
-She did?
-Yes.

611
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:44,611
She ran to my house because her brother
ripped her stuffed toy.

612
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:45,696
She went to her house.

613
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:48,657
She came because her mom didn't buy her
a dress for picnic.

614
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:52,911
-Guess what she did each time?
-Guess.

615
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,039
What? What do you mean?

616
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:09,761
What?

617
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,224
Sul-hee.

618
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:18,103
You said you'd never take Joo-man back.

619
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,397
You said you'd change
you family name if you do.

620
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,315
Well...

621
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:26,695
Gosh, who said I'd take him back?

622
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:29,781
We're just peeling green plums.

623
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:32,618
You're too busy with your invitations.

624
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:34,494
Who else would help her? I should.

625
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,748
Sul-hee, just be cool, dump him
and live your own life...

626
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:38,999
Then what?

627
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,251
Why does everyone have to be cool?

628
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,296
Sometimes, I want to beat him up, but...

629
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:50,636
Please just let us love each other.

630
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,349
I ought to give you a flying kick.

631
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:10,447
We never asked you to sponsor liquor.

632
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:15,953
Gosh.

633
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,249
I'll start calling you Mom, then.

634
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:23,418
What?

635
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,338
Already? That easily?

636
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:31,009
It's strange being all loving
from the start, 

637
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:33,971
but it'd be rude to call my mom
something else.

638
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:36,056
Sure, okay.

639
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,769
Thanks for being well-mannered.

640
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:48,235
Also, Dwarf Flower was kind of awesome.

641
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:51,780
I was so proud of you.
It was Cannes-worthy.

642
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:59,079
Why did you watching something like that?
You're embarrassing me.

643
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:08,296
Would it be too awkward to have a formal
family dinner with Dong-man's dad?

644
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:10,966
Not at all.

645
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:16,430
Every guy in Seosan was into me back then.

646
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,683
But he wasn't...

647
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:23,520
cool enough to even talk to me.

648
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:26,440
I see. I'm glad.

649
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:31,987
Then, does that mean...

650
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,156
I'm rich now?

651
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:38,660
I lived my own life.

652
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,496
I failed three businesses, and...

653
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:44,666
I have only a few hundred million
left in debt.

654
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,544
Only a few hundred million?

655
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:51,923
The villa and store are all mortgaged.

656
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:55,802
I sold parts of the villa to pay off
my debt, too.

657
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,221
The one you guys live in
is all I have left.

658
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:02,059
So please make sure to pay the rent
on time, okay?

659
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:05,312
What should I expect?

660
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:08,482
Why don't I have a turnabout in my life?

661
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:11,693
I bought Hwang Jang-ho's gym

662
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:13,528
and I had to support you guys.

663
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:15,238
My debt only grew because of you.

664
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:17,365
Gosh.

665
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:22,996
Anyway, why am I Nam-il?
I'm a girl.

666
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:29,461
-It's a name at birth.
-What does it mean?

667
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:30,837
I don't know.

668
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:32,964
No clue.

669
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:38,428
Why was her name Nam-il?

670
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,055
Well...

671
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:46,603
You see, Namil Expressway is
where Ae-ra was...

672
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,314
What? The interstate....

673
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,566
the highway?

674
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,777
Yes. That's where I...

675
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,905
That's where you gave birth to Ae-ra.

676
00:51:57,572 --> 00:52:01,535
What kind of a life lead you
to give birth on a highway?

677
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:06,915
No, when you exit Namil Expressway,

678
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,292
there's a motel called Namil Inn.

679
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,878
What? Namil Inn?

680
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:14,548
Yes. That's where...

681
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:16,049
we conceived her.

682
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,844
Oh my gosh, my goodness.

683
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:20,637
Hey, Jang-ho.

684
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,724
Okay.

685
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:28,186
Should we start a pork sausage business?

686
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:29,521
Pardon?

687
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,732
Let's follow another dream.

688
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:36,027
NATIONAL ATHLETE'S SAUSAGES

689
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:48,957
Be happy!
I'll come back if I see a way in.

690
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,712
CHOI AE-RA

691
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,942
Is this the plan you mentioned?

692
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:19,154
Yes. We're starting a business together.

693
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:23,450
We'll work together to run the business,

694
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,577
and he'll fight only during the season.

695
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,789
I said I'd tell her
after we register our marriage.

696
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:38,423
Must you spend the rest of your lives
together?

697
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,717
We've agreed to spend
this life together.

698
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:46,139
Ae-ra.

699
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:51,519
Our lives may be intertwined in may ways.

700
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:54,022
Intertwined? You're making me nervous.

701
00:53:54,731 --> 00:54:00,445
I have a feeling you and I will
see each other for the rest of our lives.

702
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:02,197
Why would you and I do that?

703
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:06,076
Anyway, I'm saying I wish...

704
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:08,119
you'd just see me as a cute guy.

705
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,829
How are you cute?

706
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,874
Your mom says I'm cute.

707
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:14,084
What the...

708
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:18,797
Don't get too close. That would be weird.

709
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:21,925
Are you the only ones who can love?
I can, too.

710
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:33,103
-Let's have a cold drink.
-Okay.

711
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:35,689
Are you insane?

712
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:37,691
Not even one drink?

713
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:40,068
Our wedding is tomorrow.
You can't drink today.

714
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,325
Darn it.

715
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:49,244
Just one drink.

716
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:53,248
-Order chicken feet.
-Okay. Medium spicy.

717
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:56,459
Is you mom buying you a place to live?

718
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,461
My mom has a lot of debt.

719
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:00,297
So make sure to pay rent on time.

720
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:03,925
I was hoping to benefit
from knowing the landlady's daughter.

721
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:05,969
Are you going to move in to Dong-man's?

722
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:08,346
I don't know. He has no plans whatsoever.

723
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:10,307
He thinks living together means
being married.

724
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,809
Do you have to have plans in life?

725
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:14,561
It's fun to just wing it.

726
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:16,563
It's not like planning makes it happen.

727
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:19,816
If it's random anyway,
might as well have fun.

728
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:25,405
Why did I say that I'd live with him?

729
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:28,199
If we weren't reckless, 

730
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:30,618
you wouldn't be a host,
and I wouldn't be a fighter.

731
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:34,039
Sul-hee wouldn't be a CEO
and Joo-man...

732
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,750
wouldn't have founded his diaphragm.

733
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,877
Why are you so obsessed with diaphragms?

734
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:41,755
Even if we can't win,
let's just go for it.

735
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,632
Living our way is winning.
Who cares about what others say?

736
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:46,343
We need to be reckless to hit a jackpot.

737
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,220
Don't mind what others are eating.

738
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,599
Where I am standing is the mainstream.

739
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:56,311
-Okay. Cheers!
-Cheers!

740
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:04,986
Dong-man, when you become a married man...

741
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:07,864
Did you just sigh?

742
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:11,951
-Why did you sigh?
-Because I'm happy.

743
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,915
-I'm so happy.
-Are you happy?

744
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,918
-So happy.
-Me too.

745
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:56,955
What's this?

746
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,165
What's going on?

747
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:03,086
Darn mosquitoes. Darn it!

748
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:05,296
My wedding is today.

749
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,006
Why did I sleep here?

750
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:08,550
Hey, Chewbacca. 

751
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,802
Did you have a dream or something?

752
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,804
What? Chewbacca?

753
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,806
Why am I back to being Chewbacca?

754
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:17,308
You look even uglier today.

755
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:20,770
What? Am I not getting married today?

756
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,440
You want to get married?

757
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:24,983
With whom?

758
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,235
Are you seeing someone?

759
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,362
I must've slept funny.

760
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:31,114
What?

761
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,783
Was this all a dream?

762
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:36,411
I can't believe this!

763
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,250
You're cute.

764
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:46,087
Hey, she's still cute
when she's not sober.

765
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:47,380
Only to you, maybe.

766
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:51,509
The thought of teasing her
for the rest of my life

767
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:53,303
really excites me.

768
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,223
This life will be super fun!

769
00:57:57,765 --> 00:57:59,434
I'm sure it'll be fun.

770
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:04,606
Right? My wedding is today.

771
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:07,692
Why did we sleep here
before our wedding day?

772
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:20,038
Everyone, thank you for watching
"Fight For My Way."

773
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:25,126
