1
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,272
I won't let you go again.

2
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,484
Let's stop making detours.

3
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,491
Stand strong.

4
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:38,204
We already kissed,

5
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,416
and I don't know anything about dating
or whatever.

6
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,419
If we kiss, it's day one.

7
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,049
Let's date.

8
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:54,679
Let's date.

9
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,642
I said let's date.

10
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,234
Since we're dating...

11
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,323
I want to do it again.

12
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,034
What?

13
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:18,995
I want to do it again.

14
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:43,561
They should ban those fireworks
nationwide.

15
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,898
Doing that kind of thing to impress girls,

16
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:50,360
and they end up burning the beach
and burning their hands.

17
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,531
Why would the beach burn?

18
00:01:56,825 --> 00:02:01,329
Why are you always so extreme,
impulsive, vulgar...

19
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,958
and so masculine like that?

20
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,752
I didn't do it impulsively.

21
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,589
It's been a while
that I could only see your lips.

22
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,345
Then is today really day one?

23
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,642
Kissing between friends is illegal,
cheating and a jerk move.

24
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,687
So we're definitely dating.

25
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:31,151
So, don't think about seeing anyone else.

26
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,361
And even when you're riding the bus,

27
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,071
don't sit next to a man.

28
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,117
Even on the bus?

29
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,579
Don't think about any other man.

30
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,206
Especially that first love or whatever.

31
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,877
Don't think about that vaccine
or wrist again.

32
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,005
Think only of me.

33
00:02:57,093 --> 00:03:00,180
The vaccine and the wrist were both you.

34
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,475
What did you say?

35
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,061
My first love...

36
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,063
that disgustingly dense first love...

37
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,025
the one that haunted me for 20 years...

38
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:13,943
It's you.

39
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,493
To me, you are like...

40
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:26,789
a pimple.

41
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,792
It would rise and fall by itself.

42
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,754
It hurt and then it doesn't.

43
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,298
If I leave it alone, it's fine.

44
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,091
But if I try to pop it,
it hurts like hell.

45
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,553
I did that for 20 years, looking at you.

46
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,935
That was me?

47
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:53,149
You seem like the type of person
who'd kidnap the person they like...

48
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:57,654
So...

49
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,951
Stop being my guy friend.

50
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:09,374
If you go back to being
a tricky guy friend after kissing me,

51
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,709
then I don't think I can live.

52
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,296
I really, really,

53
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,299
really like you.

54
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,678
Idiot.

55
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,431
You should've just kissed me.

56
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,226
I would've fallen for you right away.

57
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,521
Did you like it a lot?

58
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,942
Want to do it...

59
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,528
one more time?

60
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,646
Can you shoot those fireworks to someone?

61
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,315
I told you, right? 

62
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,483
I got the feeling
it would be on this time.

63
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,291
People still give out rice cakes
when they move in?

64
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,001
This luggage doesn't seem

65
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,211
like it's meant for a one-room flat,
does it?

66
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,131
-I think it belongs to a girl.
-Do you think she'll be pretty?

67
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,142
Where are you going?

68
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,228
To throw out the trash.

69
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,439
Why are you going out like that?

70
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:57,815
What?

71
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,817
This is how I dress
to throw the trash out.

72
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,611
By any chance...

73
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,906
did something happen in Daecheon?

74
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,494
With Dong-man?

75
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,454
We didn't do it!

76
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:13,998
What?

77
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,584
What didn't you do?

78
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,352
Are your clothes drying?

79
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,481
Hey, why are you exposing your stomach?

80
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,109
Are you trying to let everyone see?

81
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,278
She said she normally dresses like that
just to throw out the trash.

82
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,740
Hurry up and go.
Aren't you going to leave for work?

83
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,452
You guys are going to stay together
all day, right?

84
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,914
Well, we're both unemployed,
so at least we won't be bored.

85
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,583
Let's open Seol Hee's plum wine
when come back from work.

86
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,668
Okay.

87
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,420
-Bye!
-Okay.

88
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,964
-But you guys...
-What?

89
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:04,841
Don't do it.

90
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:10,888
Do what?

91
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,517
Don't open it first. The plum wine.

92
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:15,893
Don't do it.

93
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,734
-Unit 101.
-Ah! That scared me, you scared me.

94
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,945
-You didn't get it, right?
-Pardon?

95
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,448
The lady gave everyone rice cakes
except you.

96
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,785
Just you. She only skipped you, Unit 101.

97
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,831
What the heck? Why just me?
Making me feel bad.

98
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,458
She's famous.

99
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,961
The moving man even got her autograph.

100
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,172
Is she a celebrity?

101
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,675
She's an extremely famous Korean...

102
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,886
announcer.

103
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:05,568
You!

104
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,572
Why did you move to the apartment
above Dong-man's?

105
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,201
I was allowed to live across from him,
but not above him?

106
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:18,247
I saw on the internet
that you got alimony in dollars.

107
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,167
So why move here?
It costs 300,000 won a month!

108
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,837
To see obba everyday, just like you.

109
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,218
We're dating, officially.

110
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,470
I know.

111
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,555
It's for the best.

112
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:40,061
Then you've lost that disgusting
female human friend.

113
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:46,150
So I'll fill in that spot.
I'll be your friend.

114
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,446
I'll make sure that unnie gets to know...

115
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,157
how annoying that friend is.

116
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:57,537
I'm both his girlfriend and his friend.

117
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,915
No, you're not. After you guys break up,
you'll be nothing.

118
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,209
You won't even be friends.

119
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,461
What do you know?

120
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,549
Now it's going to be all or nothing.
We can't go back anymore.

121
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,342
Didn't you know that?

122
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,399
What does she mean it's all or nothing?

123
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,443
Hey!

124
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,094
Ahem.

125
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,520
Get changed and come out.

126
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,941
I have the weigh-in today,
so you should come along.

127
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:13,446
Then let's go on a date
or whatever it's called.

128
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,328
Why aren't you been talking?

129
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,372
Why do I feel like you're acting
like a real woman now?

130
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,875
What are you saying?

131
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,379
You're not sexy or innocent.

132
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,507
And since you're keeping your mouth shut
and not saying anything...

133
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,011
what would my pleasure be in seeing you?

134
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,140
You are a character who should
constantly be funny...

135
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:48,481
Of course, on the cuteness side,

136
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,815
you are above average.

137
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,155
Ah, heart attack.

138
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:04,580
The Chun's said they won't do
a second broadcast.

139
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,542
But we sold out,
so could you please talk to her--

140
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,753
Talk to them about what?

141
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,922
The owner's feelings have completely
turned around.

142
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,965
Would they even want to give
a rice cake

143
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,259
to an assistant manager
who rejects her daughter?

144
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,097
Did you know Ye-jin took the day off?

145
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:28,145
But why do you keep standing there
and talking?

146
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:29,897
What?

147
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:34,276
Why are you talking here outside
instead of coming in, like a delivery man?

148
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,404
Well...

149
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,323
I don't think I can come in anymore.

150
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,242
Why?

151
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:45,621
Because we are young, vigorous,
impulsive...

152
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,498
and immature animals.

153
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,710
And accidents always happen fast.

154
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,504
This bastard is so uptight.

155
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,215
-What did you say?
-Nothing.

156
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:00,553
Anyway, I'll be waiting here,
so get changed and come out.

157
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:07,685
Oh, I think it will take about an hour
and a half though.

158
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,730
An hour and a half?

159
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,940
Why? Are you exfoliating your whole body?

160
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,400
What?

161
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,610
You just need to change that shirt
and come out.

162
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,571
Isn't it our first date?

163
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,449
Do you really know that little
about women?

164
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,118
How women feel?

165
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,120
-Bah.
-Bah?

166
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,627
I mean, why is she like this?

167
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,644
What, am I that pretty?

168
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:58,611
REAL WOMAN

169
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,534
Hey, Choi Ae-ra, come back! Back.

170
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,161
Hurry and change clothes.

171
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,371
Why? Is it weird?

172
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,081
Your legs!

173
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:12,958
Do my legs look fat?

174
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,169
Why are your legs so darn pretty?

175
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,965
-What?
-Your legs are those of a woman!

176
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,302
-Did you think I would really be a man?
-Hey.

177
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:28,182
I feel like I'd kick the guys who look
at your legs.

178
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,100
So put on pants and come back out.

179
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,312
Who are you to be...

180
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:45,533
How dare you, who used to carry
my bag around, defy me?

181
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,496
Whatever about your bag,
just go and change to pants.

182
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,042
How dare you...

183
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,928
Go change to pants and come back out.

184
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:09,431
Ah, really. Her legs...

185
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,268
Wow, seriously...

186
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,396
Those legs will cause trouble.

187
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,818
He hit the second baseman's face.

188
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,946
Choo Shin-soo, who added a base hit,

189
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,574
had two hits and four walks,

190
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,535
which brought his batting average
up to 0.275.

191
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,751
-Are you just going to watch baseball?
-What?

192
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,171
I mean, your girlfriend is sitting
right across from you.

193
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,466
Do you only want to watch
Choo Shin-soo playing baseball abroad?

194
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:46,844
Why?

195
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,679
What do you mean, "why"?

196
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,222
Aren't we going to talk?

197
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,266
Are we only supposed to eat
in a restaurant?

198
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,648
We've dated for six years. 

199
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,152
How can we just sit and make eye contact?
You get duller.

200
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,404
It's duller?

201
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,741
Sul-hee, could you stop twisting
my words around?

202
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,284
I get tired of it, too.

203
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:16,040
Tired? Exactly what are you tired of?

204
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,376
You don't go on dates with me
or talk with me.

205
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,338
You don't even kiss me much,
and we don't do it either.

206
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,255
Hey.

207
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,926
What are you tired of
when you don't do anything with me?

208
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,473
What I am tired of is that...

209
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,476
when I am with you,
I always become the bad guy.

210
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,647
You don't get tired, you are kind,

211
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,024
and you're endlessly giving
and full of love,

212
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,319
so I always seem like the bad guy.

213
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:46,737
Only me.

214
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,243
Why are you like this again?

215
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,412
What do you mean "again"?

216
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:59,458
I mean, have I asked for much?

217
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,919
I don't want anything from you.

218
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,881
You know, I just want us to be
like before.

219
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,424
Is it that hard not to change?

220
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,010
How can someone stay the same
for six years?

221
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,220
I can. 

222
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,014
I still blush when I see you.

223
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,933
I'm like you more now than then.

224
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:19,895
And I just want to do
everything together with you.

225
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,899
-I'm sorry.
-You're sighing again.

226
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,736
I'm always jumping up and down for you,
and you're always sighing.

227
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:32,658
Are we just in the seven-year itch,

228
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,704
or are we in the middle of breaking up?

229
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,664
What?

230
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:42,126
Lately, I feel more lonely
when I'm with you.

231
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,638
-Just a sec.
-What?

232
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,851
My hands are sweaty.

233
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:25,961
But are you going to tell them?

234
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,589
Ah, Joo-man is going to laugh
so much about us.

235
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,717
Let's keep it a secret for now.
Sul-hee would say something.

236
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,052
Why?

237
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,554
I don't know.
Sul-hee has always been like that.

238
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,723
She said not to end up dating
while fighting.

239
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,017
She said to get married,
instead of dating.

240
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,062
In that case...

241
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,733
are you proposing to me right now?

242
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,237
Would you like this to be a proposal?

243
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,584
I'll be doing an arm bar now,
what will you do?

244
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:06,877
I have to escape.

245
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:10,672
Hold on.

246
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,758
What did I tell you to do?

247
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,934
Hey, you punk! I told you not to tap me.
Why are you tapping me again?

248
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,352
Because it hurts!

249
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:27,022
What? Why are you such an honest bastard?

250
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,024
Who can bear the pain?

251
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,152
Other fighters don't flinch,
even if their bones break. How come--

252
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,405
That's just being an idiot.
Why wouldn't you tap when you're hurting?

253
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,950
Hey, if you're hurting, tap right away.
Right away!

254
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,911
Why would you pull someone's arm out?

255
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,663
You're seriously a weird person.

256
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,877
Hey, are you really going to let her
stick around?

257
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:52,131
I can't train with you, Coach.
When's Doo-ho coming?

258
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,676
-What? Can't you train without Doo-ho?
-Why are you yelling at him?

259
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,974
Kim Tak-su, that jerk!

260
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,484
Please face each other and pose.

261
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,582
Wow, this is totally a drama.

262
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,054
Han Doo-ho.

263
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:49,897
What is this?

264
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:53,817
An athlete can change teams,

265
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,403
to a team with better conditions
and vision.

266
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,864
I need to go somewhere like that and grow.

267
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,283
Did the coach know in advance?

268
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,039
At Tiger, I'm treated differently.

269
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:11,418
-Their system is so organized--
-I asked you if the coach knew?

270
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:15,881
They also promote you a ton...

271
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,770
The dog with the most fear
barks the loudest.

272
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,729
What?

273
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,191
So keep acting like a jerk.

274
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,985
That way, Dong-man will grit his teeth
even more.

275
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:41,073
I think you're the one talking more
right now.

276
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,496
Tak-su, now people know better.

277
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:48,789
Know what?

278
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:51,124
That the side that stinks is the side
that's crap.

279
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,798
Let's not talk to each other.

280
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,681
Don't go there too easily.

281
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,435
If you're too weak,
it'll be no fun to crush you.

282
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,610
Gosh.

283
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:23,907
Coach.

284
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,411
I'm so ashamed.

285
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,082
-Coach Choi.
-Yes.

286
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:38,380
Doo-ho has a three-year old kid,
and he's only 26-years-old.

287
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,299
So?

288
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,717
He's still a kid. A kid.

289
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,680
Don't use the kid who's trying to survive.

290
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,057
Raise him well.

291
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:51,977
Okay.

292
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,317
Gosh.

293
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,278
Seriously, I'm so embarrassed...

294
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:06,199
I would never have moved if I was alone.

295
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:12,831
But my daughter's eczema
is really severe, and she keeps bleeding.

296
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,793
We had to move,
but there was no other way.

297
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,884
Did I say anything?

298
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,637
A crying martial artist?

299
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,807
You'll get hit on the back by Coach Hwang.

300
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:38,523
I know he's trying to screw you
and have Coach close the gym...

301
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,905
but I leave Coach in your care.

302
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,743
Why are people who are supposed to fight
chit-chatting?

303
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,336
Hey, Han Doo-ho.

304
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,840
Just come eat sausages whenever you want.

305
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:24,194
Well, you two go eat alone.

306
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,782
There's a famous restaurant that was
featured in the Four Heavenly Kings.

307
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:31,451
I was going to buy you beef, but whatever.

308
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,829
Just go. Let's eat separately.

309
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,583
Are you sulking?
You said you're a martial artist!

310
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,921
-Who's sulking?
-You sound like you're sulking.

311
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:48,093
Ah, just forget it. You two just go
and have a delicious meal.

312
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:49,719
We're dating.

313
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,139
What?

314
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:54,975
I said we're dating.

315
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:58,728
-Why? I mean, why?
-What do you mean, "why"?

316
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,565
So, you should know
when to invite yourself.

317
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,775
It's our first date today after all.

318
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:09,865
Is there something you can't tell me?

319
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:14,286
Are you worried that I caused an accident?

320
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,371
No, nothing like that. 

321
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,790
Do you have a big debt on her
or something?

322
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,335
I told you I really don't go well
with this old man.

323
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,137
Gosh.

324
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:49,988
Why do you keep clinging to me
like a puppy?

325
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:52,908
I'm hungry.

326
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,671
The food you used to make
seemed like dog food, but...

327
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:10,383
this feels like I got a gold ax...

328
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,844
instead of my iron ax from the pond.

329
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,515
Shut up and eat.

330
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,356
Hey, eat.

331
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,402
Is this dog food or what?

332
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,864
Eat what you're given.

333
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,629
Why are you on the floor?
There's space here.

334
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,049
Don't try to play tricks on me.

335
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:56,388
Hey, do you think I want to do something?

336
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,851
-Why are you telling me to lie on the bed?
-When did I? 

337
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,812
I told you to sit down.

338
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,439
Won't sitting down lead to lying down?

339
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,191
That's the trick.

340
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,278
Are you someone that would fall for that?

341
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,738
You're almost like a girl Fedor.

342
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,742
I feel like if you tried to hurt me,
I would get a fatal injury.

343
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:23,039
And would I do something like that
when we just started dating yesterday?

344
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,668
Am I some kind of jerk?
I really didn't have any other intentions.

345
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,628
A jerk without any intentions.

346
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:30,922
What?

347
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:37,804
Even though we only dated today,
we've seen each other forever.

348
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,932
We've been sickly platonic
for over 20 years.

349
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:43,893
What?

350
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:45,895
Are you a human?

351
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,481
Does a person even need to be
this uptight?

352
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,985
I'm a little upset that...

353
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,238
you keep looking at me
like I'm Chewbacca or Fedor.

354
00:26:55,947 --> 00:27:01,036
I also think we might need a turning point
in our relationship.

355
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:19,804
We really just went around and around
and had our first kiss in 23 years.

356
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:25,769
Don't you think we have to pick up
the pace, as slowly as we have gone?

357
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:36,404
Why are you so progressive...

358
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:43,119
Do I have to keep talking?

359
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,410
Don't you have any alcohol?

360
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,622
I told you to change your password.

361
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,793
Is this some community hall?

362
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,005
Hey, you two...

363
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,928
Want chili shrimp with Kaoliang liquor?

364
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,101
I could beat him up with Kaoliang liquor.

365
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,613
Oh wow, that feels good.

366
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,116
But can you all really skip work?

367
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:07,245
Hey, why should I keep working if I can't
take a day off for my BFF's debut fight?

368
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:10,165
I've basically raised you
since you were six-years-old.

369
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:12,542
-Of course I have to go.
-Thank you.

370
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,586
Should we go buy some tranquilizers?

371
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:17,839
-How can I take that before a match?
-No, for me, so I can take it.

372
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,383
Oh. Two, three...

373
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,634
Hello!

374
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,304
Are you all going somewhere?

375
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,556
Yes, I have something...

376
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,142
-Have a good day.
-Okay.

377
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,480
-Unit 102.
-Yes?

378
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,734
-Uh...
-Ah, the room rent...

379
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,113
Fighting!

380
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,327
What did she just say?

381
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,079
I think she cursed at you.

382
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,831
High kick?

383
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,546
My goodness.

384
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:03,343
After kicking him down,
you need to go in right away.

385
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:06,137
But you can't fall,
because you can't ground fight.

386
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,015
You have to knock him out
with your kick in the beginning.

387
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,893
Taekwondo-based fighters
usually can't ground fight.

388
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:15,563
Kick... But hey, why did you follow us
all the way here and act like this?

389
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,107
I used to be his original manager.

390
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,569
Can I have this t-shirt as well?
The "Hwang Jang Ho Gym" shirt?

391
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:24,322
Gosh, anyway, remember to kick.

392
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,740
Finish it with a blow.

393
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,283
I got it, I got it.

394
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:30,411
RFC match three, welterweight super fight.

395
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,956
I will be introducing both fighters.

396
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,166
Wow, let's sit down here.

397
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,503
Height 184 cm, weight 76 kg.

398
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:42,298
Why do guys like things like this?

399
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,217
I can't understand it.

400
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:48,471
The crazy fighter,
who's returned to the cage,

401
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:54,727
the wonder boy of strikes, Park Jung-sik!

402
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,898
Fighting against him in the red corner...

403
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,942
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

404
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:02,694
...record on pro MMA...

405
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,612
Where can you apply to do that?

406
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,367
-What do you mean?
-That.

407
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:14,956
Hong Su-hwan!

408
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:26,885
Please give it up for Park Jung-sik,
who's shown us a good fight.

409
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:53,828
Ko Dong-man!

410
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,960
Kooooooo!

411
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,004
What, what, what? What is it?

412
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,756
You startled me!

413
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:09,344
I guess you miss me
in places like this, too.

414
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,263
It's not like that.

415
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,978
What is she plotting
that she's acting like this?

416
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:25,652
Kooooooooo! That sounds familiar.

417
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:29,656
Why was he back there not making a sound?

418
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,616
How embarrassing!

419
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,925
I don't really like triangle kimbap.

420
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,343
It's just a concept.

421
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:53,721
It'll be very touching to show
that you're a hungry fighter.

422
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:58,101
I don't really want to be hungry,
and it feels like I'm trying to sell my--

423
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,520
Then just eat it.
Think of it as acting, acting.

424
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:05,191
If this gets broadcasted,
Mom and Dad would see it too...

425
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,902
Gosh, just try eating it.

426
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:14,742
I think I misunderstood the purpose
of this program. This is kind of...

427
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,452
Don't you want to become famous?

428
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:20,498
Don't you know what will make
your parents happy?

429
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,588
Ah, so you came to cheer Dong-man on, too.

430
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:31,467
Obba, I'm dating him.

431
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,053
Right... What?

432
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:37,223
Now, I officially got his back.

433
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:43,688
Oh, how can you so suddenly?
Anyway, congratulations for now.

434
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:46,315
Did you hear this warning sign?

435
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:51,696
The black dog doesn't bite,
but if someone bothers him,

436
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,573
the white dog bites.

437
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,367
If you bug him, I bite.

438
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:58,536
Don't film this.

439
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:03,082
But Ae-ra, this time around,
I have talked with Dong-man, and--

440
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:06,169
I told you clearly not to film this.

441
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:09,672
I'm leaving.

442
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,224
Why can't she hold herself back

443
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,643
instead of being so powerful
all the time?

444
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,898
RECRUITING CAGE ANNOUNCER

445
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,370
RECRUITING CAGE ANNOUNCER - RFC

446
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:46,125
Hey, do you really want to scream
and all that?

447
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:52,465
Rather than that, isn't it really cool
to hold a mic in the middle of the cage?

448
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:56,010
-That?
-My heart is already pounding.

449
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,138
But isn't that usually for men to do?

450
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,849
Do men and women hold a mic
any differently?

451
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,476
Even so, usually men do it.

452
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:06,187
-That's why I want to do it even more.
-What?

453
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,190
The first woman, the only woman,
the best woman. 

454
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,317
Aren't these titles a killer?

455
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:19,659
Let's not go easy on that Tak-su jerk
and just understand Doo-ho.

456
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,829
I understand. It just feels iffy to win.

457
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:28,000
Are you sure you'll win?
Doo-ho is stronger than Byung-joo.

458
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:34,632
What? Are you some idiot from nowhere?
That's sick!

459
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,425
Whatever. They have three seconds.

460
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,553
I should at least be there
to cheer you up.

461
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:42,223
This is the way to cheer him up?
Why didn't you write sausages?

462
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:45,768
Focus. Knock him over with the kick.
And go in right away.

463
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,353
Yes, I'll go inside.

464
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,439
Ah, I'm getting really nervous.

465
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,585
This is his debut match on TV.

466
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,129
But internally, he's very well known.

467
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:16,716
Because he has become a hot athlete,
he got his debut match very quickly.

468
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,310
Sul-hee, I'm going to the toilet.

469
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,770
But the fight is about to begin.

470
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,738
My stomach suddenly started aching.

471
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:54,795
Okay!

472
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,799
Okay! Ready! Fight!

473
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:16,317
That was a great kick from Ko Dong-man!

474
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:21,322
That kick... Was Tak-su first or him?

475
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:38,965
Due to Han Doo-ho's cut,

476
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:42,051
we will have a doctor check it briefly.

477
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:55,064
Coach, I think he's badly hurt.

478
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:58,359
Why do you care?
You are in the middle of a fight!

479
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:12,790
Okay!

480
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,751
Ready! Fight!

481
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,386
Who is getting hit?

482
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,331
Now! Go now!

483
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:03,215
He seems to be missing his chance
right now.

484
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,468
He shouldn't be waiting like that.

485
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:17,563
Why isn't he hitting him?

486
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:39,460
Go in! Go in!

487
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:10,032
RFC match three, light class super fight.

488
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:12,535
We will be announcing the winner.

489
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:16,122
We had a unanimous vote of the referees
for this fight.

490
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:21,168
Blue corner, taekwon boy,
Ko Dong-man is the winner!

491
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,169
Win!

492
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:35,349
Are you okay?

493
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,853
Why did you go easy on me?

494
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:42,898
I'd rather you knock me out
than you go easy on me!

495
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,330
MEXX CHICKEN WORLD

496
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:02,251
What matters whether you win or not?
You made this kind of name for yourself.

497
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,003
Octagon Waiter?

498
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:07,548
They say you're really nice
because you wait if the opponent falls.

499
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:11,886
So embarrassing.
What kind of nickname is this?

500
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:15,181
Why would you fight in the ring
if you can't hit an opponent who fell?

501
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,849
What do you know?

502
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:20,186
It feels totally different from kicking
a protective gear for taekwondo.

503
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:23,147
It feels like I can feel
the person's bones and skin.

504
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,691
You're so weak-hearted you can't hit.

505
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,234
I totally understand, Dong-man.

506
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:34,116
In the ring, the strong fighter beats
the nice fighter.

507
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,911
If you're going to be like that,
just give up!

508
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,954
I won't! I'm going to continue!

509
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,623
I just need to do a K.O. then.

510
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:44,877
I won't go into a dog fight like today,
and just finish in the beginning.

511
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,963
You think you can get a knockout
just because you want to?

512
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,591
Is anyone good from the start?
Is life a movie?

513
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,261
Are fighters all Rocky?
That's what a fake character is!

514
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:56,805
-I just need to overcome my flaw.
-My flaw?

515
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,724
My flaw? I should just whack you.

516
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,728
Please give me water!

517
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:06,732
Why is a coach with such
an excellent stallion so anxious?

518
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,651
What? Stallion?

519
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:11,237
He was already a legend.

520
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,199
Who knew a Seosan novice
would make it to a national team?

521
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,492
Just sit still and watch.

522
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,579
And don't keep hitting his head.

523
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:30,172
You have to see if he's making money,
eating and living well.

524
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:35,844
If you're so worried,
why don't you give him a call?

525
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,306
What would I say on the phone?
What would I talk about?

526
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,434
Do a parent and child only call
to talk about specific things?

527
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:45,688
You should talk about your new job.

528
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:48,691
Oh, and your business trip.

529
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,693
You call him.

530
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,029
Like father, like son.

531
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,998
What about a phone call
before you sleep...

532
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:08,294
Why call when we live
right in front of each other?

533
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,212
Okay?

534
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:14,341
Then I'll come over
for breakfast tomorrow.

535
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:19,013
I should probably wash my hair
every morning.

536
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,599
You're supposed to do that, stupid.

537
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,063
Then I'll enter my passcode now.

538
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:31,650
Oh, me too.

539
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,031
Should I...

540
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:41,076
-just go to your house?
-What?

541
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:45,664
I mean, we can watch the television
and eat something.

542
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:50,169
Eat... what?

543
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:54,173
Something like ramen?

544
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,216
Ramen?

545
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:03,974
In addition to no cohabitation,
I'll add no late night ramen.

546
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:06,685
Why?

547
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:08,729
What?

548
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:14,943
Why are you prohibiting
eating ramen and living together?

549
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,154
That's an abuse of authority.

550
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:22,159
I gave you a discount on maintenance fees.
I even did pest control.

551
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,911
I never even raised your rents.

552
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:27,414
I agree that you've treated us well.
But--

553
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:29,500
And you can't even follow that rule?

554
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:30,751
Are you animals?

555
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:36,090
Why are you guys all dying to date?

556
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,424
The whole villa is...

557
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:38,967
love affairs.

558
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,012
I think she's jealous.

559
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,263
If you're unhappy,

560
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:46,934
you can move to a place where
you can sleep together for higher rent.

561
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,314
Stop making me walk on pins and needles.

562
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,233
I think she's hysterical.

563
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,487
Is it the neighborhood or the blood?

564
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:02,324
NATIONAL ATHLETE SAUSAGES

565
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:05,285
Aren't you going to hurry and open?

566
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:09,206
Are you living that well?
Can't do your business right?

567
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:16,296
How did you know I sell sausages here?

568
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,508
I didn't. I came out to buy soju
and I saw you here.

569
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,678
Ah, okay.

570
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,264
Give me one bottle of soju.

571
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,015
Excuse me?

572
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,435
You must have some hidden away.

573
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:35,315
I can't sell any alcohol here.

574
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:38,068
Don't take my money.
Then you're not selling it.

575
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,241
It's truly an honor.

576
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,660
Don't overreact.

577
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:52,207
I'm not overreacting.
My life really changed because of you.

578
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,752
You became my role model
after I met you,

579
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,171
living your life the way you want.

580
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:02,885
-Should I give you an autograph?
-No, I'd just throw it away...

581
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:10,601
I knew that you went to Japan
a while back,

582
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,352
but why did you come back?

583
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:17,691
After a near death experience,
I thought I must find him.

584
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:19,359
My Nam-il.

585
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:21,570
Nam-il?

586
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:25,991
Nam-il. My baby.

587
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,619
He'll release his fury...

588
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:34,625
Song Yong-jin...

589
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:38,754
Don't you think
the landlady is really strange?

590
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:42,841
Why does she care if we sleep--
I mean, eat ramen or not?

591
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,887
I wonder what Nam-il is doing,
not looking after his mom.

592
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:51,934
Nam-il is her son, so never mind him,
but what about her daughter-in-law?

593
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:54,520
Imagine if you had a mother-in-law
like her. 

594
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:58,690
I would flip out.

595
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:06,824
So, you have a child.
How are you going to find him?

596
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:12,621
-I've already found him.
-What?

597
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:31,807
So, what exactly are you going to do now?

598
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,600
That bastard's all warmed up.

599
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:37,229
Tak-su, leave Dong-man to me.
You just worry about resting.

600
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:41,149
You've been working out so much lately,
you actually seem like an athlete.

601
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:45,779
What did you think I was?

602
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:49,658
Tak-su, just fight with Dong-man.

603
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:51,201
Excuse me?

604
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,495
Just fight Dong-man as soon as possible.

605
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,790
He doesn't protect his face or attack low.

606
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,166
Reminds you of someone?

607
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:02,713
Dong-man is exactly like you

608
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:04,756
when you first switched over
from taekwondo.

609
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:22,441
Come on. Aren't you going to grapple?
Will you only ever fight standing up?

610
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,860
I'm confident up here.

611
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,405
Ah, you jerk, how can you only do
what you want?

612
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,825
Will you negotiate with your opponent
during a match?

613
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:35,871
I just don't have to go low,
even if he tries to pull me down.

614
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:39,041
Then you'll never be
any more than half a fighter.

615
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:42,044
If you can't overcome it,
this is the end for you!

616
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:47,966
Let's just fight him.
He's someone you can't avoid anyway.

617
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:49,343
Let's fight him now.

618
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,472
Tak-su, what do you want to do?

619
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,182
I promise you.

620
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:58,602
Once Dong-man overcomes this,
no one can catch up to him.

621
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:11,448
Height 163.2 cm, weight, 50-- 45 kg...

622
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:16,453
The first female MMA announcer,
Choi Ae-ra!

623
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:29,508
Why are you knocking
on someone else's wall?

624
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:30,842
Are you a renter here?

625
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:32,886
Who are you?

626
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:35,597
I'm the owner's son.

627
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:40,936
Nam-il? That Nam-il?

628
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:48,110
Do you know me?
Why do you keep calling my name like that?

629
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:50,696
I'm sorry.

630
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:54,199
By the way, aren't the stairs a public,
common area?

631
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,451
Yes, they are.

632
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:59,037
Don't wear clothes
that make others feel uncomfortable.

633
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:03,500
Please don't harm other's enjoyment
of the common area

634
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,293
with your loud shouting.

635
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:10,298
No one would believe
you're 163.2 cm and 45 kg.

636
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:13,176
Neither are they curious to know.

637
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,767
He's so handsome, yet so rude.

638
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,313
Is she crazy or what?

639
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:10,984
Ye-jin, I asked you
to never call me again.

640
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,944
Why are you doing this to me, seriously?

641
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,281
What?

642
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:21,286
Take a picture. Here. That's right.

643
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:29,252
No, normally the car in the back
is always the one at fault!

644
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:33,423
You suddenly backed up
when the light changed.

645
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:36,551
Me? I backed up? Wow.

646
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:41,181
Wow, this girl is pretty hilarious.

647
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,265
Ye-jin.

648
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:44,059
Mr. Kim.

649
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,523
First, let's check the black box--

650
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,691
But my black box is broken right now...

651
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:55,320
It's the car at the back's fault!
Why do you keep arguing?

652
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:57,989
-You called the insurance, right?
-If your insurance goes up,

653
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:59,241
you'll lose more money.

654
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:03,286
Let's just deal with cash.
We'll call it even at two million won.

655
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:05,205
You two had samgyeopsal, right?

656
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:11,795
Thank you, Mr. Kim.

657
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:15,507
If it wasn't for you,
I would've given them two million won.

658
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:19,719
There's no way for two men
to eat samgyeopsal without soju.

659
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:23,682
It was shady. That's why
they wanted to deal with it in cash.

660
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:27,060
I must be getting punished.

661
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:34,276
I shouldn't always come to you.
I would really be a bad girl for doing so.

662
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:36,153
So stop it already. 

663
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:39,865
Why did you come all the way here
and get into an accident?

664
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:57,591
Ye-jin.

665
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:03,388
I really hope you'll stop from now on.

666
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:08,560
I won't go there anymore.

667
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:13,607
I'll stop. Don't worry.

668
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:17,235
Go home safely.

669
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:18,904
Okay.

670
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:37,714
Are you okay?

671
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,717
Did you hurt yourself?

672
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:45,305
I think I was so shocked earlier
that I pressed the brake too hard.

673
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,777
Please come to work tomorrow.

674
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:03,531
If you don't come, I get uncomfortable
and a lot of people talk about it.

675
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:06,743
I'll see you tomorrow.

676
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:10,622
Yes. Thank you for today.

677
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:35,063
What did you buy so much?

678
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:03,466
Together.

679
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,228
What? He got a new job?

680
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,190
How did Dad get a job
that I can't even get?

681
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:25,322
But does he have to... at my house...

682
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:30,285
Okay, I got it. Bye.

683
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:37,125
What is it? Your dad got a new job?

684
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:44,174
Yeah, but he's going to sleep at my house
for one night.

685
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,176
What's so serious about that?

686
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:49,721
Now that I think about it...

687
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:53,516
I don't think I ever slept alone
with my dad before.

688
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:58,980
He's your dad. You can just sleep.

689
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:01,274
Is that right?

690
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:06,321
You have an interview
the day after tomorrow, right?

691
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:09,407
Do you think you can do
that ring announcer...

692
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:12,535
and watch me fight?

693
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:16,831
If you're going to do it even if you die,
I have to watch it, even if I die.

694
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:17,999
To protect you.

695
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:22,379
You are such a tiny person,

696
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:25,548
who's been protecting me
since I was little.

697
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:29,260
I'm ready to jump in the cage
if I have to.

698
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:35,308
If you become a ring announcer...

699
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:40,438
would we become a couple
within the company?

700
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,857
A couple within the company?

701
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:45,402
I think it sounds pretty sexy.
Within the company.

702
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:48,655
You just do your job and make a living.

703
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,031
It's nothing sexy.

704
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:54,536
No, in the middle of work, secretly...

705
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,957
we can kiss each other.

706
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:01,668
What?

707
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:04,087
Kiss.

708
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:06,548
What?

709
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:09,676
Are you deaf?

710
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:10,927
What?

711
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:19,394
Are you being shy right now?

712
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:23,273
I'm not shy.

713
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,700
You're a real woman now.

714
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,496
Your cheeks are super red right now.

715
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:42,542
What are you saying?

716
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:48,256
Why are you holding someone's hand
without any reason?

717
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,800
You're supposed to do that.

718
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:57,390
Why are you looking at me so much?
My makeup's all messed up...

719
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:04,731
Why are you tying my hands?

720
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:16,451
Why do I... 

721
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:20,663
only see your lips?

722
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:24,501
What?

723
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:26,503
If we're dating...

724
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,673
can I keep doing it?

725
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:33,843
You crazy jerk, seriously!

726
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,470
Crazy jerk?

727
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,807
Why are you asking?

728
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:51,277
Do you like it?

729
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:55,156
Why do you keep asking?

730
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:10,797
I should've kissed you long ago.

731
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:14,425
Then you would've gotten a beating
from me.

732
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:21,683
Since I did it...

733
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,229
I really like it.

734
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:32,193
Choi Ae-ra, I really like you.

735
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:33,945
I think I'm going crazy.

736
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:39,409
I've always liked you, you jerk.

737
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:52,422
If it's all or nothing...

738
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:56,009
let's go with all.

739
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:57,719
What?

740
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:02,807
Do you want to...

741
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,062
sleepover at my apartment today?

742
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:30,001
Hey, is the chili shrimp good, dude?

743
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,210
Is it good?

744
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:32,837
Is it super delicious?

745
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:35,882
Why are you bugging someone
trying to concentrate?

746
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:38,718
You did something bad to me today.

747
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:41,554
Why? Did something happen to you?

748
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:46,726
Well, if I tell you, will you tease me?

749
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:52,482
What is it? I'll hear it first
then decide to tease you or not.

750
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:57,820
Is that so? Then... honestly, I...

751
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:01,240
A bow! Bow! It's a bow!

752
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:02,575
-Bow?
-Bow!

753
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,327
-Bow? Did you get a bow?
-A bow!

754
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:05,662
-A bow!
-A bow!

755
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,872
A bow? You got a bow?

756
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:11,668
