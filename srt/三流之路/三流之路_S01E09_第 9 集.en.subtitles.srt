1
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:38,288
Is he out of his mind?
Why is he taking his shirt off?

2
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,709
No way.

3
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,878
He's so handsome.

4
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,297
He must be a rookie.

5
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,299
Yes?

6
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,761
-Why are you zooming in?
-Sorry?

7
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,554
I said, why are you zooming in?

8
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:57,098
Gosh, I'm a bit confused.

9
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:00,894
I can zoom in or film a video if I want.
Who are you to tell me what to do?

10
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,856
Why are you zooming in
when he's about to get beaten up?

11
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,149
What's wrong with her?

12
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,485
Weighing 70 kg...

13
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,612
Professional MMA debut match...

14
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,322
Is she out of her mind?

15
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,450
He's a rookie street fighter...

16
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:20,038
Here comes the taekwondo boy,
Ko Dong-man!

17
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,086
Ready, fight!

18
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,604
What do I do?

19
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,023
What if he gets beaten up again?

20
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,055
Hey, what are you doing?

21
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,268
I won.

22
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,770
Do you really have to do this?

23
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,483
I can't watch it.

24
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,283
I think I'm in trouble.

25
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:43,788
Now...

26
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,625
you look pretty even when you cry.

27
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,648
Look at you. You're such a girl now.

28
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,046
Hey.

29
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,006
What?

30
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,301
Why are you holding my hand like that?

31
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,223
-What about it?
-Because your heart flutters?

32
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,227
Does your heart flutter?

33
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,439
Why do you keep asking?

34
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,817
I don't think it's just you.

35
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,821
-I feel strange, too.
-What?

36
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,742
I could only see you from afar.

37
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:08,039
I think... you look pretty.

38
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,543
I only thought about doing headlocks

39
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,671
and spending time with you.

40
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,755
Hey!

41
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,882
How can you say that?

42
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,221
When I hold your hand...

43
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,224
it feels good.

44
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,102
What?

45
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,354
When you look at me like this...

46
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,607
What about when I look at you?

47
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,027
I sometimes want to kiss you.

48
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,032
Why are you so honest?

49
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,535
You should keep that to yourself.

50
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,412
Why? Do you feel the same?

51
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,247
Do you imagine kissing me?

52
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,961
Don't think out loud, okay?

53
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,898
Thank you.

54
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,777
Honey, do you think Dong-man is done...

55
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,364
Honey?

56
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,414
What are you doing here?

57
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,875
I swear I heard you say honey.

58
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,753
You did, didn't you?

59
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,005
What?

60
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,470
I'm pretty sure she called him honey.

61
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,766
I swear I heard her say it.

62
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,505
She did her nose.

63
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,931
What is she? An ostrich?

64
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,350
Why are her lashes so long?

65
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,435
Are they hers?

66
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,649
I'm speechless.

67
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,944
Are those lashes yours?

68
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:50,410
Then why did he make
the photocopies for me?

69
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:53,079
Why did he fix the copier?

70
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:58,084
Did Mr. Kim help you with those?

71
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,504
Who cares if he looks like Park Bo-gum.

72
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,923
I really...

73
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,259
I really...

74
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:10,096
I really like him.

75
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,349
I really like him, that's why.

76
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,480
-Why did you run?
-What?

77
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,942
What do I do?

78
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,278
What do you mean? Why do you care?

79
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,780
Still, she's my coworker. 

80
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,534
She got drunk and passed out
at a bus stop. We can't just leave her.

81
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,911
Then what? Will she sleep at your place?

82
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,749
MOM

83
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:47,216
I'm relieved that she has such
nice coworkers.

84
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,136
You must live in the same neighborhood.

85
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,391
We had a company dinner nearby.

86
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,226
You're Kim Joo-man, right?

87
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,188
Yes, I am. How did you know my name?

88
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:03,774
I'd really like to meet you again.

89
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:06,986
Sure.

90
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,415
Gosh.

91
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:24,086
Can't you stop moving your chin?

92
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,381
Well...

93
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,761
Why don't you two spend
some time alone?

94
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,515
Hey, we don't need to.

95
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,603
There you go again.

96
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,022
Are you going to cry every time I win?

97
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,275
You flew for the first time in ten years.

98
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,780
I followed you around for ten years...

99
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,492
just to see that again.

100
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,288
Be good to me.

101
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,916
Give me a life of luxury.

102
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,383
Go home.

103
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,093
Get in your truck and leave.

104
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,053
Hey.

105
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,181
Let me hug you just once.

106
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,058
What?

107
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:23,604
Didn't you see Park Ji-sung hug Hiddink
after he scores?

108
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,817
This guy is such a pain.

109
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,402
Try it.

110
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,989
People will get the wrong idea
if they see us.

111
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,955
My baby.

112
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,292
-Move your car.
-Hello.

113
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:55,678
Look, I don't judge people, but...

114
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,889
move the car first,
and then you guys can continue.

115
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,809
Continue what? What do you mean?

116
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,312
Who is she?

117
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,148
She looks familiar.

118
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,448
You're a star now. Have some meat.

119
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,992
Here you go, Mr. Star.

120
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,870
Star, my ass.

121
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,834
Did you guys...

122
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,754
watch the match?

123
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,405
What's going on?

124
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,240
Why is he working out
early in the morning?

125
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,540
SUPER ROOKIE KO DONG-MAN KOS
OPPONENT IN 19 SECONDS

126
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,378
He's nervous now.

127
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,423
No wonder he tried so hard to keep
Dong-man out.

128
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,390
Dong-hee, it's time for breakfast.

129
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:23,974
Come out.

130
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,192
FAN SERVICE

131
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,695
Why am I his fan?

132
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,614
We are his true fans.

133
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,075
We've cheered for Dong-man
since elementary school.

134
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,494
Why did they blur out my face?

135
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,621
Am I a criminal or something?

136
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,541
Are you practicing vocalization
for tomorrow?

137
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:49,959
Cheongju KBC.

138
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,754
I'm going to ace this interview.

139
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,718
-Right, Sul-hee.
-Yes?

140
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:04,348
I'll deposit this month's rent
by next weekend.

141
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:07,560
Forget about this month.
I've paid it already.

142
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:08,769
Hey.

143
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,646
Why did you pay by yourself?

144
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,567
If I end up quitting my job,
you can pay for that month.

145
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,901
Then it'll be even.

146
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,571
You can be my announcer lifeline then.

147
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,203
Continue practicing.

148
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,331
NAMIL VILLA

149
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,485
Why are you calling
so early in the morning?

150
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:02,656
Can't your daughter call you
early in the morning?

151
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,284
What have you been up to?

152
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,871
-Gosh.
-Are you even earning money?

153
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,123
Are you even eating?

154
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,292
What about rent?

155
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,753
You don't think I can afford my rent?

156
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,547
Be quiet, I'll send you money.

157
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,591
Don't you dare!

158
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:23,385
Don't annoy me again, okay?

159
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,930
How can you pay rent
after quitting your job?

160
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:29,266
I'm the one who quit,
so why should you have to pay?

161
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:33,562
I'm the one who quit,
so I'll take care of it myself.

162
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,482
Spend your own money, Dad.

163
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,400
Your grown daughter can't even
send you money.

164
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,486
Why do you keep giving me money?

165
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:44,156
I feel bad whenever I take your money.

166
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,409
Don't you dare send me money.

167
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:55,000
His restaurant isn't even doing that well.

168
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:03,717
YOUTH MY WAY

169
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:08,597
So this program is about introducing
super rookies of all different fields.

170
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:12,309
I'll be the super rookie of MMA fighting?

171
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,145
Of course, I know how strong your fist is.

172
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,775
Don't feel bad.

173
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,070
We can laugh about it now.

174
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,198
I don't know about laughing.

175
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,535
Anyways, after what happened back then,

176
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,288
I never thought you would call me first.

177
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,500
With this and the blind date.

178
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,711
Come on, that was so long ago.

179
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,338
We can grab a drink
and leave the past in the past.

180
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,423
You're so shy.

181
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,885
Speaking of which, should we set it up?

182
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,511
What is Ae-ra up to these days?

183
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,097
Don't ask me about her.

184
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,984
THE FIGHT MONEY HAS BEEN DEPOSITED

185
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,776
Mom! It's your son!

186
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:47,321
Yes, your beloved son!

187
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,949
Your son sent you some money.

188
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,326
If you don't do it right,
I won't pay you.

189
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,953
I sent you some allowance.

190
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,663
You need spending money?

191
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,165
No, I sent you money.

192
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,794
You sent me money? Why?

193
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,003
Mom.

194
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,631
I earned money by doing something
I actually love.

195
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:08,801
This earning is very meaningful,
so I decided to send it to you.

196
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:10,886
Are you in trouble?

197
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,140
I'm about to get into some real trouble.

198
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,351
Believe in your son!

199
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,105
What's wrong?

200
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,898
Is Dong-man in trouble again?

201
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,192
It's not that.

202
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:28,904
He's driving me crazy.

203
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:35,995
It's just that my eldest son
wired me some money.

204
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,162
My allowance.

205
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,791
He's so concerned that I work too hard.

206
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,627
That's all he seems to care about.

207
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,879
He doesn't want me to go through hardship

208
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:49,216
He said he'll give me a luxurious life--

209
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,218
I thought it was a really short call.

210
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,012
Did he say all that?

211
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,139
What?

212
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,808
You know he talks fast.

213
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,185
Where did he get that money?

214
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,606
He can be so caring.

215
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,775
I told him not to send me money.

216
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,904
-Can you mail this out?
-Yes.

217
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,367
-Write down the recipient's address.
-Sure.

218
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,914
GYEONGGIDO BUCHEON

219
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,170
KANGMI VILLA SUITE 101
KANG DONG-HEE

220
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:39,475
I have to go and give a presentation
on tomorrow's show.

221
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,978
I can't get promoted
if you don't charge my battery.

222
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,521
Please?

223
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,733
This is just a charge.

224
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,071
A rapid charge.

225
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,544
No way, who's that?

226
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,280
Why are you coming out from there?

227
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,659
I wanted to get some coffee.

228
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:39,993
Did you walk down?

229
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:44,081
Did you walk down from the 10th floor
just to get coffee?

230
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:48,961
Yes, I'm trying to lose weight.

231
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,422
Mr. Kim's interested in his looks.

232
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,676
Look, he put something on his lips, too.

233
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:56,844
Wait.

234
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,263
Were you in there...

235
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,476
-eating something?
-No.

236
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,603
Excuse me.

237
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,357
I'm pretty sure he ate something.

238
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:16,572
Didn't you say MMA is your main job
and selling sausages is your side job?

239
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:20,033
Then why are you here at lunchtime?
You don't even have a family to support.

240
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:24,830
The moms who live here wait for me
to come by at lunchtime.

241
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:29,835
Of course, it could be me,
not the sausage they're waiting for.

242
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,337
Right, of course it is.

243
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,257
Why don't you run
for a head of borough office?

244
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:39,386
-Get ready to go to Daecheon tomorrow.
-Daecheon?

245
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:44,308
-To eat clams?
-Do you think you have time for clams?

246
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,226
You're going to earn money.

247
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,396
Daecheon Scallop Festival.

248
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,231
You're going to demonstrate
breaking boards.

249
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,525
You want me to perform in public?

250
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,528
You can practice hitting
while earning money.

251
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:00,032
900,000 won
barely covers your monthly expenses.

252
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,367
You want to buy your mom a house.

253
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,412
You want to get your dad a new car,
and support your sister.

254
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,497
You need to get married, too.

255
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,041
How much for this?

256
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,126
As if you've ever paid for sausages.

257
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,629
I'll pay for everything I ate so far.

258
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:18,008
Hey, I thought you weren't coming today.

259
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,551
Hello, ma'am.

260
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:23,096
Jang-ho had to come
because he missed you so much.

261
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,599
-I missed you, too.
-Me too.

262
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,684
You two are so funny.

263
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,353
-Sausages?
-Yes.

264
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,104
-How much?
-Three portions.

265
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:34,441
-Give me some liver.
-I'll give you extra liver.

266
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:40,030
-The pork's ear is extra good today.
-Sounds good.

267
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,626
It's good.

268
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:57,881
Hey.

269
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:02,761
I turn 30 soon.
This is an embarrassing present.

270
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,430
You've always loved stuffed toys.

271
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,516
These can't even be recycled.

272
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,185
They don't fit in trash bags either.

273
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,146
They need to be torn into pieces first.

274
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:17,526
Joo-man, you should log in
with some excitement.

275
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,237
What? Me? Why?

276
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,323
I left something in your game item box.

277
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:29,746
An armor? You bought me an armor?

278
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:34,710
-This is awesome, I feel like crying!
-Did you not get Ae-ra anything?

279
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,170
This. They're supposed to be comfortable.

280
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:40,549
Hey, this is for everyone.

281
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,134
Why don't I get anything?

282
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:45,470
You don't like stuffed toys or games.

283
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,432
-I couldn't get you anything.
-I didn't ask you to buy me something.

284
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,020
Where's my present?

285
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,691
Let's have another drink at my place.

286
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,192
Let's order chicken feet.

287
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,364
Which one? Very spicy?

288
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,366
Medium? Not spicy?

289
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,202
I suddenly feel very sleepy.

290
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:14,416
I feel like I have a body ache, too.

291
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,962
Perfect! Alcohol will chase away
your aches.

292
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,007
Forget it, we're tired as well.

293
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,216
Let's all go home.

294
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,469
-Are you tired?
-Let's go.

295
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:30,557
Is it normal for someone
to suddenly feel sick?

296
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,862
Do you think those two
will cross the line?

297
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,741
That guy...

298
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,285
will make it big one day.

299
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:54,247
I'm not saying this because
he's my friend, but he's a great guy.

300
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,126
Why? Because he got you the armor?

301
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,962
I told you to quit playing games.

302
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:05,967
I need to shower.

303
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,887
My goodness.

304
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,153
Why? Do you have something for me?

305
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,865
You got me something, didn't you?

306
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,251
Where are you taking it out from?

307
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,425
Open it.

308
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,732
Why is it so yellow though?

309
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:05,694
Pure gold.

310
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:07,946
Pure gold?

311
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,366
Who gives gold rings these days?

312
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,368
Pure gold is an investment.

313
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,372
Pure gold can be sold when you're broke.

314
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,251
Are we in a third world country?

315
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:27,466
You played a big role in making me
get back into sports.

316
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:32,512
Seeing you with a microphone
made me want to try again.

317
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,725
You even came to root for me.

318
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,854
Is that why you got me a gold ring?

319
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:45,192
Gold is an investment
as well as an emergency fund.

320
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,029
It could pay you rent.

321
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,742
You really are a country bumpkin.

322
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:58,747
Pure gold's the best.
Thieves never leave gold behind.

323
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,999
We lost all the gold rings
we have hidden.

324
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,795
I can't wear this in public,

325
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,839
and I can't sell this right away either.

326
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,967
Gold price is pretty high at the moment.

327
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:17,474
Why did you get me a ring of all things?

328
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,769
You scared me.

329
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,379
Is my hair too simple for an interview?

330
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,466
I've doing your hair since you were six.

331
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:56,596
You need to look twice as neat
to look as neat as everyone else.

332
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,975
One mistake could turn you
into a rowdy country girl.

333
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:07,440
By the way, did he go running again?

334
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,484
He's like a professional athlete.

335
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:14,364
I've been following him since I was a kid.

336
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,784
He probably forgot
that I have an interview today.

337
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,706
Hey.

338
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,250
Here comes the martial artist.

339
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:34,009
-Have some yeot.
-You went to get those?

340
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,720
Who sells yeot at this hour?

341
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:43,393
Well, I was walking and saw some.

342
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,021
-I was coming back home--
-Was it on the ground?

343
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,647
Yes.

344
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:50,066
I guess people drop things on the ground.

345
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:54,362
It's a big yeot.

346
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,537
I'm going to Cheongju KBC.

347
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,664
-I'm...
-You're going to go fight.

348
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:07,083
I'm finally broadcasting
Chun's kimchi show.

349
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,670
I'm going to look after Joo-man
since I'm his office wife.

350
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:15,216
-Let's do our best--
-To cause some trouble.

351
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,885
Are you a gangster? Why trouble?

352
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:20,347
Pain isn't blessing to youth.
We cause trouble because we are young.

353
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,432
-I agree!
-Let's go!

354
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,851
You can't influence Sul-hee in a bad way.

355
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:31,024
Kimchi, office wife, KBC and a fighter?

356
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,779
What a mess.

357
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,994
YOUTH IS ONLY YOUTH
WHEN YOU CAUSE TROUBLE

358
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:09,354
-What is it?
-My ear hurts.

359
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,064
Let me take a look.

360
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,113
It's finally your time.

361
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,365
My ears get rubbed against
the ground too much.

362
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,117
I can't even sleep, it's so painful.

363
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:26,037
Wait for it. They don't hurt
once they turn like this.

364
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,789
How long does it take?

365
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,917
I don't know
when my ears turned like this.

366
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,171
I think they look cool. It's like a medal.

367
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,548
Medal, my ass.

368
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:40,677
My daughter says I have monster ears
and starts crying.

369
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:44,347
Let's go guys.

370
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:48,393
-Let's go, we have to go to Daecheon.
-Byung-joo's not here yet.

371
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:52,021
Byung-joo's not going to be here
until next week. He has the flu.

372
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,732
Is he that embarrassed?

373
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,734
Let's just say he's sick. 

374
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,152
Hurry up and come out.

375
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,873
PAIN IS A BLESSING TO YOUTH

376
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,006
What took you so long?

377
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,760
The divorce was a few months ago
and you come now?

378
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,138
I was a bit busy. How have you been?

379
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,765
It's always the same with me.

380
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:32,479
Looking at these
reminds me of old days.

381
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,688
Do you want to sit in?

382
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:38,860
Show your face so that they can't make
fun of regional broadcasting.

383
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:40,945
It's okay.

384
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,543
Yes, ma'am.

385
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,630
Are you talking about the kimchi
that's on air right now?

386
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:06,262
I'm sorry, ma'am, but the product doesn't
include radish kimchi.

387
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:11,142
-Can you take that radish kimchi out?
-What? Why?

388
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,520
That crunchy sound is too much.

389
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:17,065
That radish kimchi looks good to me,
so what would the customers think?

390
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:21,236
Focus the camera on the host
and take the radish out.

391
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,614
Why does she keep scratching herself?

392
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,747
She's allergic to pork?

393
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,750
-Take her out.
-Hold on.

394
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,002
If only the old man, woman
and the kid is left,

395
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,129
it will look kind of sad.

396
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:41,881
Darn it.

397
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,469
Instead of having grandparents
and the grandchild,

398
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,347
let's do grandparents
and a married couple concept.

399
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:54,769
I'm sorry, but they don't come with it.

400
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:57,564
Why would you show it then?

401
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:03,236
Hey, I'll buy the kimchi, so send me
some boxes of radish kimchi, too.

402
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:06,489
They look so good, so I want both.

403
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,741
Why do you keep saying you can't?

404
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,785
Hey, do you hear me?

405
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,538
No! The radish kimchi doesn't come
with it!

406
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,768
-Who is she?
-Grab her.

407
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,937
Play the video instead.

408
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,858
Come out.

409
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,318
What's going on?

410
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,421
It's filled with fibers...

411
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,256
Should we order those?

412
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,967
That looks so good.

413
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:11,763
Oh, dear. Isn't that Sul-hee?

414
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:14,557
Look, Sul-hee's on TV.

415
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,935
You're right, it's Sul-hee.

416
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,020
Isn't that Dong-man next to her?

417
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:24,067
She's awesome.

418
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:30,782
Would you like to order kimchi?
Please go ahead.

419
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,118
-What's your number?
-Yes, ma'am.

420
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,539
Here's your order.

421
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:56,140
Why is she always so full of herself?

422
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:59,894
Why is she always on top of me?

423
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,022
Here's your first question.

424
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,733
Out of you three, who do you think will
not pass today?

425
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:12,490
Journalists shouldn't hesitate.
They're quick on their feet.

426
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:16,452
I think number 17 will not make it.

427
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,497
I agree with her.

428
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:21,916
Then...

429
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,170
Number 17, Choi Ae-ra, who got picked...

430
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:30,633
You're old and have no experience.
Your face looks the biggest on screen,

431
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:34,554
so why do we have to choose you?
Give me ten reasons.

432
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,181
Ten reasons?

433
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,351
Sure.

434
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,396
-First of all, I'm very passionate.
-Stop.

435
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,399
It's about passion again?

436
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,028
-Pardon?
-Sorry.

437
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:54,032
I've heard that too many times
while I was interviewing.

438
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:56,993
I see.

439
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:02,582
To be honest, what you like to do
and what you can do are different.

440
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:08,046
Whoever figures that out first
succeeds in their field.

441
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,341
This is hurting my pride.

442
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,762
People think anybody can become
announcers these days.

443
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:18,347
Why don't you just keep your current job?

444
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,810
I was going to do that...

445
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:26,647
but I wanted this so much
that I couldn't just live.

446
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:30,318
I don't know if I should say you're bold.

447
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,821
Everybody has their limits.

448
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,449
Do you know what a Maginot Line is?

449
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:42,705
It's been less than ten minutes
since we've met.

450
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,541
How do you know what I'm capable of?

451
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,920
You've aged without wisdom.

452
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:51,464
You don't know how to reply
to interview questions.

453
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,218
Do you call this an interview?

454
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,595
I think you're making it personal.

455
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,431
Ms. Choi.

456
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:04,519
As a person with experience,
let me give you some advice.

457
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:05,895
Don't.

458
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,816
You're not going to pass me.

459
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,111
Then don't try to hurt me.

460
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:16,114
I have the right not to be hurt.

461
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,199
I'll decide...

462
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,452
what I'm capable of.

463
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,546
Ae-ra.

464
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,466
Do you really think you'll make it?

465
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:43,850
Yes. Seeing you, I think I can.

466
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:48,146
You were an anchor and got married
to a rich family...

467
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:51,065
you were first in everything.

468
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:54,318
So, are you going to consider me
as your role model?

469
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:58,489
I thought first place was reserved
for the best...

470
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,908
but seeing you makes me doubt that.

471
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,703
I know I can be better than you.

472
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:07,039
Ae-ra, that's an ambitious plan.

473
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,710
-Let's talk after you pass.
-You just wait and see.

474
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:15,423
I'll make sure you'll never smirk again.

475
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,161
I wired you money. Go and check.

476
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,720
Are you in Daecheon?

477
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,598
I'm going there right now.

478
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,687
Daecheon?

479
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:15,024
Why would you come here?

480
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,027
You have to watch your weight.

481
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,948
I'm spending the night here.

482
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:23,741
What?

483
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,369
I'm not going home tonight either.

484
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,335
I don't want to go home tonight.

485
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,462
I won't.

486
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,346
You can finish all!

487
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:50,309
When I saw it, I really wanted to eat it.

488
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,438
It turned out fine, but...

489
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,732
we were really shocked.

490
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,902
Sun-hee, are you gluttonous?

491
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:04,240
We sold out because she ate so well.
It was for the better.

492
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,200
Still, we were on live.

493
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:09,537
Things need to be controlled,
at least internally.

494
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:13,457
You needed another person anyway.

495
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:17,003
We'll consider them a couple
and she can be the sister-in-law.

496
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:20,548
-That's good, let's stick to that.
-I'm not the sister-in-law.

497
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,049
I'm the wife.

498
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,260
Is that important right now?

499
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,971
-Do you think this is a joke?
-Sir.

500
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,891
Who cares who's the wife here?

501
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,310
Mrs. Chun, you're here.

502
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,813
Hello.

503
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:42,194
-I heard we sold out.
-We sell out all the time.

504
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,947
You should allow us to handle
your next sale as well.

505
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,700
This is all thanks to Mr. Kim.

506
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:52,538
He has an absolute taste.
Where did you hear about him?

507
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:57,126
My sister recommended him to me.

508
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,712
I heard he's good at what he does.

509
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,922
Is this your sister?

510
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,883
But how did you know him?

511
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:08,012
-I'm her sister and Ye-jin's mom.
-Mom?

512
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:11,974
Then do you own Granny's jokbal?

513
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,643
All of our family members are
in the food industry.

514
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:20,941
I see. That's why you asked for Mr. Kim.

515
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,239
Is that you?

516
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:33,496
It's you, isn't it?
You were with Mr. Kim before.

517
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:34,997
The one wearing pink?

518
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:39,543
-You said you had a team dinner in Oksu.
-When?

519
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,712
Did we have a team dinner then?

520
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,840
Did you guys go without me?

521
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,134
No, sir. It's not like that.

522
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,969
Why isn't she talking?

523
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:51,013
We saw each other, right?

524
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,974
What is it? Is something wrong?

525
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,393
Hey.

526
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,646
You've been going home early these days...

527
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,816
What is it? Were you with Sun-hee?

528
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,652
Why won't you say anything? Just say it.

529
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:07,029
Sun-hee, what's going on?

530
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,781
Miss?

531
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,868
Let's do it.

532
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:20,084
I'm Mr. Kim's common-law wife,
Baek Sul-hee.

533
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:24,588
That's why you shouldn't kiss him, Ye-jin.

534
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,465
Also, Mr. Choi.

535
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:29,552
I'm not Sun-hee.

536
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:33,139
It's Baek Sul-hee. Baek Sul-hee!

537
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,891
I'm Baek Sul-hee!

538
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,644
Sul-hee.

539
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:44,108
-Why aren't you saying anything?
-She's acting strange.

540
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,319
Well...

541
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:51,991
She's my girlfriend.

542
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:56,912
-What nonsense are you talking about?
-It's not nonsense.

543
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,874
I'm dating Sul-hee.

544
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,169
It's been six years...

545
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,337
and I like her a lot.

546
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:12,761
So Mr. Choi, please stop calling her
Sun-hee.

547
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,181
Ye-jin...

548
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,350
please don't cross the line.

549
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:38,287
We'll invite the taekwondo team to do
a martial arts demonstration.

550
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,752
Is he there?

551
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,475
Thank you.

552
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,937
Next up is...

553
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,689
we'll have them break boards
consecutively.

554
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:10,486
DAECHEON SCALLOP FESTIVAL

555
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,791
It's fake!

556
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,794
I know they are cheating.

557
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:30,214
They have the boards precut.

558
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,634
Quiet down, darling.

559
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:43,269
Ha-na.

560
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,480
Ha-na!

561
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,942
Keep going.

562
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,364
Okay.

563
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:58,659
Next up is...

564
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:11,422
This is crazy.

565
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:15,009
Why are you telling them
to break boards again?

566
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:17,094
-We ran out of boards...
-We could...

567
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:20,598
go to a construction site to see
if we can get something similar.

568
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:23,517
What are you talking about?
It's not like they're immortal.

569
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,769
Didn't you say a singer was coming?

570
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,938
-When is Hong Se-ri coming?
-She's on her way.

571
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,857
We need you to delay just a little bit.

572
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,900
How about one more round
of breaking boards?

573
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,194
-Are you kidding me?
-What about the host?

574
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:37,239
I told you to delete that line about soju.

575
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:39,617
Looking at anything green
makes me want to puke.

576
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:45,372
Why would you come to work
and drink soju with scallops?

577
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:46,665
Seriously.

578
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,584
We need a host to delay the show.

579
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:52,755
-Please, we need you to break the boards.
-I already told you no.

580
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:56,133
-Then do you want me to break it?
-Fine, I'll just do it.

581
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:58,260
You have to fix this problem!

582
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:01,388
What's wrong? This isn't a festival.

583
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,516
-We need you to stall!
-How can we do more?

584
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,602
Hold on. 

585
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:09,897
I know a well-qualified person.

586
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:16,987
Let me get this straight.

587
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:19,948
The host is drunk and Hong Se-ri is late.

588
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:24,244
He has to continue breaking boards
and the governor is mad.

589
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:30,542
-When is Hong Se-ri arriving?
-In 20 minutes.

590
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,961
She's been saying that for a while.

591
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,048
Then that means...

592
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:38,634
I have 20 minutes to myself, right?

593
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:39,760
Yes.

594
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,637
Pardon?

595
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:43,472
And...

596
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,475
you shouldn't do anything too crazy.

597
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:50,396
There are politicians here.
The governor will be watching you.

598
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,441
You can't get involved once I'm up there.

599
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,277
Those 20 minutes are mine, okay?

600
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,364
Okay.

601
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:20,551
Excuse me, you have to go up this way.

602
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,141
Governor, please excuse me.

603
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,019
What are you doing?

604
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:35,357
Hey, who are you?
How dare you touch--

605
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:37,860
I thought you'd be upset looking
at the photos later.

606
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:41,530
-My grandfather was just like you.
-It's just that one strand of hair...

607
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:50,372
Why are you getting rid of that?

608
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,000
Just let her be.

609
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,085
We have a lot of room anyway.

610
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:56,628
Ma'am.

611
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,757
Come sit up close, come on.

612
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,884
Don't forget what I told you to do.

613
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:13,270
Hello, citizens of the heart of summer,
Dacheon Beach. 

614
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,481
Welcome to the sixth
Dacheon Scallop Festival.

615
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:18,817
I'm your host for today, Choi Ae-ra.

616
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:23,697
First of all,

617
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:27,743
please give a round of applause
to thank the governor

618
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:30,788
for providing us with the venue
for the wonderful festival.

619
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:39,797
Governor Jang isn't good at his work,
but he's a good man.

620
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,881
Of course.

621
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:44,301
It doesn't matter who we pick.
No one does the job well anyway.

622
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,262
Anyway, where's Hong Se-ri?

623
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:50,599
You're right. Isn't she coming out?
Why isn't she coming out?

624
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:52,559
Where's Hong Se-ri?

625
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:57,689
Everyone, you're dying to see
Hong Se-ri, aren't you?

626
00:46:57,856 --> 00:47:01,193
She should change the subject,
not bring that up.

627
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:05,072
You can see Hong Se-ri anytime
if you turn on the TV.

628
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,199
Every single day.

629
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:11,620
But not me. I don't come out
when you turn on the TV.

630
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,499
-This is the only chance you can see me.
-She's a feisty little thing.

631
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,626
How did she suppress that all these years?

632
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:19,878
I don't sing for people ever.

633
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,339
You can't even pay to hear me sing.

634
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,759
What's going on?
I think Hong Se-ri's here.

635
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,678
Awesome.

636
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:30,597
Ma'am.

637
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:33,767
You don't need to be the best looking

638
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:34,685
Sir!

639
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:37,479
You don't need to have the best body

640
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:43,569
If you only care for me
That makes you the best for me

641
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:47,781
-Did you have fun today?
-Yes!

642
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,867
She's great.

643
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,245
Does she have an agency?

644
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:57,791
Hey, if the martial artists
and that psycho...

645
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:01,044
I mean, if the martial artists
and she performed as a set,

646
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:03,213
would we get paid more?

647
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,720
Yes, that's right.

648
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:13,348
I was the host. The host.

649
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:16,184
Daecheon is a short drive away.

650
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:20,147
Should I go tomorrow?
You said you're doing it tomorrow, too.

651
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,734
Why would the dad of a star come to this?

652
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:26,862
Dad, just wait.

653
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:31,408
I'll repay you for raising me
all on your own.

654
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,911
I'll give you a life of crazy luxury.

655
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:37,581
I don't need a luxury life.

656
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:41,376
Just take care of yourself.

657
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:48,133
Gosh.

658
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,555
Is this really Ae-ra?

659
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:57,851
-She was the main host of the festival.
-Really?

660
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,770
Are you paying again today?

661
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:04,107
I told you the dream I had
before she was born, right?

662
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:08,195
A dragon the size of a house...

663
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:13,825
was clutching magical pearls
with its front craws and mouth

664
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,702
and shot up trhough the sky.

665
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,914
He added the pearls this time.

666
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:23,335
Every time he tells the story,
things get added.

667
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:24,586
Am I right?

668
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,214
-Have a drink.
-Okay.

669
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:33,637
This is a large portion.
I put in a lot of scallops.

670
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,975
Thank you!

671
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,769
This is on the house. Enjoy!

672
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:43,146
Thank you!

673
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:44,982
Such good service!

674
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:54,533
Which one should I post?
Which came out the best?

675
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:58,328
Are you a social media addict?
Why are you posting already?

676
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:01,707
Others always brag
about eating and buying nice things.

677
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,375
Why can't I brag too?

678
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,585
Go ahead.

679
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,464
This one looks the most human-like.

680
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:12,551
I'll post this one.

681
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:20,142
I feel so good right now.

682
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:23,854
Our host seems to be in a good mood.

683
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:26,481
Your host?

684
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,987
Why are you laughing like a madwoman?

685
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:36,575
Since we're by the ocean, let's drink!

686
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:39,661
-Go home.
-Let's drink!

687
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,747
-Let's drink!
-Drink!

688
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:47,961
Ae-ra, he won't drink.
What should we do?

689
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,214
Doo-ho, you didn't finish your shot?

690
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,341
Is it because no one is singing?

691
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,511
Don't do what I think you're doing.

692
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:00,348
Obba, is this bottoms up?

693
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:03,143
You have to chug this shot. Chug it.

694
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:10,108
I don't know about obba.

695
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:13,653
I'm three years younger than you.

696
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:18,950
How long will you make me dance?
Bottom's up!

697
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:25,207
What if she gets drunk like Ha-na?

698
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:29,169
Bottoms up! Let's drink!

699
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:30,837
She...

700
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:32,798
She looks cute.

701
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:36,968
Hey, take her inside.

702
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,058
You're drunk. Go in and sleep.

703
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:48,355
Since everyone wants to drink,
Let's drink!

704
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,815
Drink!

705
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:55,487
I was in such a good mood.
Why did you make me leave?

706
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:58,198
Where did you learn things like that?

707
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:01,535
Obba, is this bottoms up?

708
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:04,746
You have to chug this shot. Chug it.

709
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:08,083
Why did you call Doo-ho obba?
He's younger than you.

710
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:10,502
That's just how the song goes.

711
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:14,798
You've never sang that "Bottoms up"
song to me. Why did you sing it to him?

712
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,134
Why were you so cute?

713
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,301
What did I say?

714
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:21,555
Was I cute?

715
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:32,983
They never have enough rooms
at times like this,

716
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,819
and always have just one left, right?

717
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,781
She's taking a while.

718
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:43,660
It's a tourist spot
and also a peak season.

719
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,036
Right.

720
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:50,167
I'm sorry, but we have plenty of rooms.

721
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:56,214
We have so many rooms,
I was deciding what floor to put you on.

722
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:03,013
Just put us on the same floor
as the festival staffs.

723
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:05,098
Why are you getting all mad?

724
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:15,233
You won't be scared?

725
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:19,154
What if I am?
Do you want to sleep with me?

726
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,158
I didn't say that.

727
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,119
How could you say something like that
so easily?

728
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:29,331
I meant just sleep. Just sleeping.

729
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:32,584
You have such a dirty mind.

730
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:35,837
You're a pervert.

731
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:46,431
MOTEL

732
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,320
What's this?

733
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,949
Why do I feel like being watched?

734
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:06,910
Is there a camera in here?

735
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,264
You scared me to death!

736
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:28,848
Darn it!

737
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:33,812
Die!

738
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:39,651
Die!

739
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:47,242
What do I do?

740
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,704
Ae-ra!

741
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:55,875
Dong-man, did you hear me scream?

742
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,628
Cockroach!

743
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:01,881
There's a cockroach in my room! Gross!

744
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:05,427
I hate them! I think I'm going to die!

745
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:10,265
There's another one next to you.

746
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:13,018
Where? Where?

747
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:20,567
Hey.

748
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:25,363
-I'm going to Daecheon to get a sketch.
-Okay.

749
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:34,748
Are you a man?

750
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,916
Why do you dry your hair like that?

751
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:39,669
Should girls dry their hair differently?

752
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:42,297
Why do you dry your hair
like my army sergeant?

753
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:44,049
Hey.

754
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,384
Get off.

755
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,845
Why are you on the bed?

756
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,640
You can move that and sleep on the floor.

757
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:56,478
Why, you little scumbag.

758
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:58,855
Then just sit next to me.

759
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:00,857
We sit on the same bed all the time.

760
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,027
It's different now.

761
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:08,573
Is it different?

762
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:12,869
It's the same.

763
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:30,929
-Let's watch TV.
-Don't turn it on.

764
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:33,139
Why not?

765
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:39,062
Just don't. It'll get awkward.

766
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:47,737
Hey...

767
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:52,742
why are you facing me? Turn away.

768
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:55,161
-I can't.
-Why not?

769
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,705
-My ears hurt.
-Ears?

770
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:03,503
-What happened to your ear?
-I've been doing ground training lately.

771
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:04,796
What's that?

772
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:08,675
Like in wrestling, when you roll
on the ground,

773
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,844
you get your ears scratched and all.

774
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:15,140
You're driving me crazy.

775
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:21,062
You're ear is super hot.

776
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:27,152
You shouldn't...

777
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:31,156
touch people's ear like that.

778
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,408
It feels like it's about to explode.

779
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:34,868
It's super hot.

780
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:39,038
Maybe it's infected or something.

781
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:40,582
Are you a doctor?

782
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:48,131
That's not why it's hot.

783
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,012
Did you...

784
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:56,431
do something?

785
00:57:58,099 --> 00:57:58,933
Do what?

786
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:01,311
Your face...

787
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:04,355
seems different.

788
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,067
Did you get a filler or something?

789
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:12,030
I can't even afford my rent.
How could I do fillers?

790
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:14,157
Go back to your room.

791
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,784
Not until coach comes back.

792
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,786
I can't be alone with a cockroach.

793
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:21,664
You are such a pain in the ass.

794
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:28,379
Then why don't we drink?
Should I go get some?

795
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:31,508
There should be a menu
for late night delivery places.

796
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:38,556
You know so well.
You must go to motels often.

797
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:41,059
It's my first time.

798
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,111
Dong-man.

799
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:08,336
Neither of them are home?

800
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:12,757
I said no sleeping together.

801
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:19,013
DAECHEON

802
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:06,936
My gosh!

803
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:24,579
OOPS WE DID IT MOTEL

804
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:07,288
