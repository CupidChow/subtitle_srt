1
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,051
Gosh.

2
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,396
Hey, do you think this is your room?

3
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,316
Why are you shirtless?

4
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,359
You startled me.

5
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:09,736
Don't you remember?

6
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:14,491
-Are you pretending?
-Forget it.

7
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,201
Who told you to sleep here?

8
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,828
You were shouting for drinks.

9
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,622
You're the one who wanted to drink.

10
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:25,085
You said you'd leave
as soon as your coach came.

11
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,671
Do you really not remember?

12
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,050
I remember your heavy breathing clearly.

13
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:33,885
Shut up.

14
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,722
Why did you do it?

15
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,082
Why do you have to be so handsome?

16
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,209
It's annoying me.

17
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,562
How can you sleep?

18
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,900
Are you an animal?
How can you sleep so well?

19
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,329
I can't believe you're so gutsy.

20
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:37,128
Why did you blow your breath on my face?

21
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,756
Did you have a dream?

22
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,841
You're talking nonsense.

23
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,760
You did it.

24
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:48,264
You came close to me and touched my face.

25
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,475
I didn't touch you.

26
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,519
I swear you were breathing
right at my face.

27
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,229
Whatever.

28
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,857
No, I have to make this clear.

29
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,319
What about you? Why are you undressed?

30
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,240
I don't know. Did I take it off
while sleeping?

31
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,830
Was it you by any chance?

32
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,249
Are you crazy? What are you saying?

33
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,966
-Did you request a morning call?
-Do you think this is a hotel?

34
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,094
Have you been to hotels as well?

35
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,556
Didn't you hear someone knock earlier?

36
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,396
Who is that?

37
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,357
Maybe it's my coach.

38
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,028
Darn it. I'm kind of embarrassed.

39
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,954
Sorry, I kind of fell asleep.

40
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,543
Who is it?

41
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,422
Why are you...

42
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:12,306
In life, timing is always...

43
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,308
so terrible.

44
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,979
ONE HOUR BEFORE DOOR OPENS

45
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,734
Say I'll go back once I get the sketch.

46
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,404
Okay, thanks.

47
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,701
The person you have reached
is not available.

48
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,661
Please leave a message after the tone.

49
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,722
30 MINUTES BEFORE DOOR OPENS

50
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,860
Why isn't she picking up?

51
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,864
Is she here already?

52
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,911
No, this won't work.

53
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:18,623
Look at this. My kids aren't from
the Shaolin Temple. 

54
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,209
There you go again.

55
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,753
Just use anything.

56
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,838
You're saying this because
you're not breaking it.

57
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:29,091
There are certain boards
for breaking demonstrations.

58
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,760
See how they break?

59
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,513
Yes, they can hit it with their hands
just like yesterday.

60
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,265
That was with their knees.
Try it yourself.

61
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,142
-They can do it.
-Excuse me.

62
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,896
Yes, how may I help you?

63
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,524
I'm with a staff member.

64
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:45,983
Who?

65
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,152
The host.

66
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,488
The host, Choi Ae-ra is my daughter.

67
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,824
Oh, you're Ae-ra's dad?

68
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,410
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

69
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,289
15 MINUTES BEFORE DOOR OPENS

70
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,170
Why are there so many?

71
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,549
Where is he?

72
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,178
OOPS WE DID IT MOTEL

73
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,394
You raised you daughter so well.
She's tough.

74
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,062
Tough?

75
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,189
She's a girl.

76
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,317
She's solid like a rock. A hard rock.

77
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,195
Ae-ra wouldn't even lose to Ronda Rousey.

78
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,239
Why would she fight her?

79
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:37,577
I'm more afraid of Ae-ra
than any woman in the world.

80
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:41,163
Ever since her microphone psycho days--

81
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,665
Psycho what?

82
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,377
It's here.

83
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,879
-Let's go in.
-It's here?

84
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,425
We did it?
Of all the names...

85
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,184
We all stayed in the same motel,
so I'm sure he got her a room here.

86
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,061
Who did?

87
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,564
I guess you didn't hear.
Dong man did. Ko Dong-man.

88
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,065
Dong-man?

89
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:09,942
Ko Dong-man?

90
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,028
-Let's go up.
-Okay.

91
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:17,283
Why did you come inside?

92
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:26,167
Why? Something going on in that room?

93
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,169
An affair?

94
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,587
Is it?

95
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,801
They are definitely the ones
in rooms 408 and 410.

96
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,847
Gosh, why won't they pick up?

97
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,974
Did the kids run away from home?

98
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:45,186
What's the area code here?

99
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,604
It's 041.

100
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,022
Why?

101
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:49,815
Zero-four-one.

102
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,069
One-one-two is just 112
without an area code.

103
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,825
So, I was wondering

104
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,245
if I could get pictures of martial arts
show and sketches here.

105
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,623
It would publicize the festival,
so it's a win-win.

106
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,627
I guess that martial arts guy
is pretty famous.

107
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,505
-Yes, kind of.
-No wonder.

108
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:13,923
He stood out.

109
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:17,968
His kicks deserve better place
than doing shows in countryside.

110
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:21,055
Right? He's good.

111
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,474
Above all, with his looks,

112
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,351
he'll be popular in no time.

113
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,604
Our program isn't about finding stars.

114
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,940
It's more about selling their stories.

115
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,321
She must've left already.

116
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,491
Why won't she answer the phone?

117
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,245
Then I'll go see Dong-man first.

118
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,621
What room is he in?

119
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,998
Let's see. I think it's that way.

120
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,042
Hey, Doo-ho.

121
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,128
Is Dong-man still sleeping?

122
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,713
Dong-man?

123
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,047
I don't know.

124
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,883
Why? Didn't he sleep with you
in your room?

125
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,095
No, I thought he slept with you.

126
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,725
Where did this punk sleep...

127
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,318
No, no! I was wrong.

128
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,988
I was confused with the motel
in the front. How stupid.

129
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,698
This isn't it. She isn't in there.

130
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:21,907
Sir, it's another motel.

131
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,246
Who is it?

132
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,709
Why are you...

133
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,632
Sir...

134
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,726
Mister, just a minute.

135
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,022
Dad, hold on.

136
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:57,151
-Excuse me, sir.
-That's right, I have a performance.

137
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:01,155
Mister, I need to break some boards first.

138
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:05,284
That's right, we're late.
You have to go now.

139
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,286
Dong-man, get in here.

140
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,040
Close the door and come in.

141
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:17,004
Sir, he has to be extra careful
with injuries right now...

142
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:28,265
JULY 1, 1989 CHOI AE-RA

143
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,476
Get in here.

144
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,609
Go first.

145
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,765
No, raise it.

146
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,268
Yes, okay.

147
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,148
Let Ae-ra do both the first
and second part.

148
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:22,194
She was great yesterday. 

149
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,154
She'll be a star soon.

150
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,532
No, don't come here!

151
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:36,834
How did you...

152
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,883
Should we call the cops?

153
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,635
-What if Dong-man dies?
-What?

154
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,323
It's not an O. It's an X,

155
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:10,409
100% X. It's not even a triangle.

156
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,578
Triangle?

157
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:17,625
-What's triangle!
-Why are you doing this to me?

158
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,793
She hits me while I'm sleeping

159
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,212
and you show up behind the door.

160
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,131
Why are you two doing this to me?

161
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,843
So why did you sleep here?

162
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,887
You useless little punk.

163
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,055
How dare you!

164
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,015
Why am I a useless punk?

165
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,059
Why did you sleep here?
What were you after?

166
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,313
Listen to me.

167
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,775
Even if she and I were alone on a deserted
island, I'd consider her as a comrade.

168
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:43,859
Actually...

169
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:49,031
I'd consider and respect her
as if she's an island native or a monkey.

170
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,116
I swear, I won't even look at her.

171
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,287
No, I'm just saying.

172
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,206
What's wrong with Ae-ra?

173
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,499
What?

174
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:04,296
Why are you calling her an island native?

175
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:23,649
So what are you doing all the way here?

176
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,153
-Sleeping in the same room is forbidden.
-Pardon?

177
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,828
But why do you talk casually to me?

178
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,956
I'm older than you.

179
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:39,999
I see.

180
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:46,880
-Didn't we meet somewhere before?
-No, we did not.

181
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,133
-Scoop.
-Okay.

182
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,142
Why steak?

183
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:02,730
Steamed meats are jokbal
and grilled meats are steak.

184
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,523
Meats are all the same.

185
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:08,110
She said she's goping to quit selling
jokbal and open a restaurant.

186
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,446
Here you go.

187
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,865
Enjoy the food.

188
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,160
-Is it good?
-Yes, Mom.

189
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,831
I should treat you to a nice restaurant
one day.

190
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,166
One day? When?

191
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,963
-About meeting our family--
-Forget it.

192
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,256
Sorry?

193
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,842
There's no need to rush the marriage.

194
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,635
Living with in-laws...

195
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,805
She'll get married when it's time.

196
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,559
I almost forgot.

197
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,605
It was so funny, I still can't believe it.

198
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,690
What are you talking about?

199
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,485
Do you remember Kyu-sik from Jochiwon?

200
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,779
-Who?
-You know who.

201
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:55,324
Honey, you know the only son of the man
on the mountain, right?

202
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,701
-Who, Kyu-sik?
-Yes.

203
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,162
There's now a paved road
through that mountain.

204
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:03,123
Kyu-sik made about one billion won.

205
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,126
No, I think it was 1.5 billion won.

206
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,086
So what?

207
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,254
I met his aunt,

208
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,715
and she asked if you're still single.

209
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,383
I said you are and she said...

210
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:16,970
Kyu-sik has been waiting for you
 to grow up.

211
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:20,057
I found that hilarious.

212
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:25,062
It's not a funny story to share
during a meal.

213
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,858
INTERN JANG YE-JIN

214
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,324
What's wrong with you?

215
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,910
Kyu-sik is way too old.

216
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,913
He was in the army
when I was in kindergarten.

217
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,540
He's probably in his 50s by now.

218
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,708
Are you trying to marry me off to him?

219
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,712
You never know
until you walk down the aisle.

220
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,715
You made Joo-man feel bad.

221
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,509
He's not your boss!

222
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,719
Don't mind him too much.

223
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,722
Live off of this.

224
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,100
Why are you giving me this?

225
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,768
Am I a trash can?

226
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,396
Here.

227
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,608
We have no cash.

228
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,028
We spent it all sending your brothers
 to college.

229
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,321
This is for you.

230
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,158
Where did you get this, Mom?

231
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:22,286
I took it from your dad's mom
before she died.

232
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,707
I wanted to spend it on your wedding.

233
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,125
So take it.

234
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,920
My goodness, you're amazing.

235
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,424
Why are you giving this to me now?

236
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,718
Having something like this gives you guts.

237
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,094
Guts?

238
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,221
Stop being so timid.
Do what you want to do.

239
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,517
If Joo-man upsets you, just dump him.

240
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,191
Sul-hee has three older brothers.

241
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,943
Yes, I know that.

242
00:19:55,694 --> 00:20:01,283
Some families have many daughters
because they tried for sons.

243
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,787
I ended up with three sons
wanting to have a daughter.

244
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,377
The day she was born,

245
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,505
I screamed and ran around the hospital.

246
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:19,384
I heard. You screamed that it's a girl.

247
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:22,679
She beat her brother's names,

248
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,058
and now her name is on the storefront.

249
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,018
Our Sul-hee means a lot to you.

250
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,229
She's not yours yet.

251
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,105
Right.

252
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:35,400
Your family might think
you're losing out,

253
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,820
but I think
my daughter's too good for you.

254
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,907
Of course, she's way better than me.

255
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,951
Be good to her...

256
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,495
or I'll kill you.

257
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,039
Don't look down on her because she's kind.

258
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,209
Don't give your number to people
you must ignore.

259
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,758
Sit here and watch.

260
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:05,722
I will appear from behind that wall there.

261
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,141
Then I'll come up here.

262
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,395
I bet you will.
The host has to be in the center.

263
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,981
At the center, the forefront,
in the middle.

264
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,859
I'll be smashing things up there.

265
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,445
Please don't tell my dad what I did.

266
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,239
If you do...

267
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:25,826
I'll tell him you beat me with a hanger.

268
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:28,036
I don't want to talk to you, you punk.

269
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,375
Don't tell my dad.

270
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,259
Why do I see nothing but my own face?

271
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,636
-Is this on video?
-Let me see.

272
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:46,763
Let me take a look.

273
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,516
I said I'll take it for you.

274
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,020
Why would you film my daughter?

275
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,106
Dong-man.

276
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,900
Oh, hey.

277
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,862
What are you...

278
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,574
Oh! Aren't you Ae-ra?

279
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,917
-You startled me!
-You startled me.

280
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,419
Mr. Han Doo-ho.

281
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,050
Is Byung-joo with the Tigers now?

282
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,718
Does our coach know?

283
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,054
When you sign the contract,
be wise, just like Byung-joo.

284
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,434
Thanks for the offer, but--

285
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:36,063
Take your time
before you give me an answer.

286
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:40,901
I'm hardly good enough
for Tigers to want me.

287
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,404
And if I sign, Dong-man
will be left alone.

288
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,365
What is your motive?

289
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:49,368
Why do you care about our intention?

290
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:50,702
What?

291
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,499
Don't you want to move to a house
without mold?

292
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,918
Think about your role as a dad.

293
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,921
Your kid has allergies,
scratching her skin until it bleeds.

294
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:07,302
You can't live life based on childishness
and loyalty, can you?

295
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,141
One...

296
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:15,936
Hello.

297
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,000
Excuse me.

298
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,467
Are you hosting the event, Ae-ra?

299
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,760
While you smash boards?

300
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:49,845
Yes.

301
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,347
You should've called me.

302
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,474
We had no idea.

303
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:58,979
I guess you don't know.
I'm a producer at KBC.

304
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,939
Public TV.

305
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:04,192
I produced shows like 1 Versus 20...

306
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:07,279
Happy Monday and How are you.

307
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:13,577
If you wanted to become an announcer,
you should've told me.

308
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:17,539
-I could've asked my producer friends--
-Don't you dare...

309
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,208
mention me to anyone.

310
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:26,256
Sir, from right here,

311
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,633
you can zoom from this position,
using two fingers.

312
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:29,759
You're doing fine.

313
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,845
That's too far in, pull back out.

314
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,513
-That's it.
-Okay.

315
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,438
Were you surprised?

316
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,859
You haven't seen him
in about five years.

317
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,363
I never wanted to see him again.

318
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:53,783
Why did you call him when I'm here?

319
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:54,993
I didn't call him.

320
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,578
Why did you agree to be on his show?

321
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,830
I didn't really agree.

322
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,876
Did you call him first?

323
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,504
-He called me.
-Why?

324
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,673
He wanted to set me up on a blind date.

325
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,719
Jang Kyung-koo did?

326
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,517
-So, did you go?
-What?

327
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,435
-Did you go to that blind date?
-What?

328
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,231
You did go to that blind date.

329
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,357
What?

330
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,109
You're so simple minded.

331
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,071
Hey.

332
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,782
You better get things together.

333
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,745
Once a Jang Kyung-koo is always
a Jang Kyung-koo.

334
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,251
MEXX CHICKEN WORLD

335
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:47,796
Sul-hee, shall we have Seoul chicken
or American chicken?

336
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,175
Seoul.

337
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,094
We'll have another Seoul chicken.

338
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,053
Okay.

339
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:58,014
Mr. Park, congratulations
on getting promoted.

340
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:01,518
Good for you, you got promoted
and getting married, too.

341
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,563
I'm busy preparing things
and thanking people.

342
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,606
How are the wedding preparations going?

343
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,110
It's all about money.
Photos, dress and makeup...

344
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,445
soon-to-be married couples
are like pushovers.

345
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,823
Where will you live, Gimpo?

346
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,826
Yes, our parents will lend us
some money...

347
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,620
and we'll get a loan from a bank.

348
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,082
By the way, do you guys still
secretly date at work?

349
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,667
Oh, not anymore.

350
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,795
Everyone knows about us now.

351
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,339
We will get married soon, too...

352
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:34,509
when Joo-man gets promoted.

353
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,597
You didn't have to say that.

354
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:39,931
Congratulations.

355
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:43,351
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

356
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:52,110
Gosh, ice creams cost 800 won these days.

357
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,529
Economy for the ordinary people is ruined.

358
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:56,489
You mean failed.

359
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:59,784
Anyway, Chan-ho shouldn't have done that.

360
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,119
What?

361
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,663
He dated someone for four years.

362
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,749
I was actually closer to her.

363
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,251
Now, he's marrying a young girl
he only dated for four months.

364
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,172
What's wrong with that?

365
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,093
You're being so cranky today.

366
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:23,141
Is it because Chan-ho got promoted
and you didn't?

367
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,061
Do you think I'm that shallow?

368
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:29,397
I don't want Ye-jin's aunt to promote you
to a manager.

369
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,943
Why do you think it's from her aunt?

370
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,072
I could've done it with my performance.

371
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,115
Don't be upset. 

372
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,409
I'm fine, even if you're an
assistant manager forever.

373
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,203
I'm not okay with it.

374
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:46,706
Who would want to be
an assistant manager for life?

375
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,250
If I do better, I can make you happier.

376
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:52,379
I'm already happy.

377
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:55,882
Look. We're happy eating
ice cream together.

378
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:59,803
I want to enjoy small things
with you like now,

379
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:02,055
-and love each other--
-Small things?

380
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,768
Small things.

381
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,940
Why does happiness always have to be
small things?

382
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,275
What?

383
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:18,613
If we continue this way,
when would we buy an apartment,

384
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:22,117
buy a car, get married...

385
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,620
get promoted and have babies?

386
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,247
Joo-man.

387
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:30,792
I'm sorry, but I'm not grateful
for those little things anymore.

388
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:34,713
I want to meet my friends
and brag about myself.

389
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,048
I wish I had something to be proud of.

390
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,304
Joo-man.

391
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:47,475
Why do I keep thinking
that you've changed?

392
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,813
People can't be same all the time.

393
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:55,483
You can't live life
like you're playing house.

394
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:07,203
I'm wearing the same dress as yesterday.

395
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:09,748
How do I look?

396
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,878
You look pretty.

397
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:21,176
Why do I have a huge pimple today?

398
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,974
Hey, act normal today.
Don't try to stand out.

399
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,350
Don't dance.

400
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,352
By the way, would you really...

401
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,190
feel that way
if you went to a deserted island with me?

402
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,193
-What?
-Am I...

403
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:41,279
the same as natives or monkeys?

404
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,868
Why would you respect me so much?

405
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,289
Ae-ra.

406
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:56,085
Alcohol saved you yesterday.

407
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,800
What are you saying?

408
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,262
Why? Do you want to go
to a deserted island with me?

409
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,561
You know...

410
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:21,694
we're not entirely just friends, right?

411
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,279
What?

412
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,783
Are we kind of seeing each other?

413
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:31,746
Hey.

414
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,624
Stop talking nonsense
and go do your rehearsal. 

415
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:35,834
I'll go watch.

416
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,127
Gosh.

417
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,011
IS THIS SOME OR WHAT?

418
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,482
You look great.

419
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,321
Testing microphone.

420
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:08,533
You're going to be here, right?

421
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,120
-I'm the host of this festival...
-What's she doing?

422
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,706
Didn't you text her?

423
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,833
I thought you texted her.

424
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,668
What are you talking about?

425
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,548
Dad, it's just a rehearsal.

426
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:26,426
Don't worry about me and just focus.

427
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:38,897
Move.

428
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,235
What are you doing?

429
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:48,489
-Why are you...
-I must be mean.

430
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,617
I don't like seeing you excited.

431
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,329
Let's start the rehearsal, Hye-ran.

432
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:56,623
Okay.

433
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,299
Hello, citizens of Daecheon.

434
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:09,385
Oh dear, isn't she Park Hye-ran?

435
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:12,680
Wow, isn't that Park Hye-ran?

436
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:17,101
Where are you going?
Aren't you getting started soon?

437
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,436
Let's go.

438
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:23,399
-It's going to start soon.
-Let's just go.

439
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:24,317
What?

440
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,071
Let's just go.

441
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:31,699
I'm here to volunteer to support
this wonderful festival today.

442
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,619
I'm announcer, Park Hye-ran.

443
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:43,378
Take it.

444
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:46,631
I'll take it.

445
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:48,257
Okay.

446
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:55,807
I didn't come here to see you on stage.

447
00:32:56,516 --> 00:33:00,186
I came here to give you these.

448
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,188
Just go.

449
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:04,732
Shouldn't we eat together?

450
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:10,238
I haven't seen you for two months.

451
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:14,200
-Let's have dinner together.
-I'm not hungry.

452
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,369
I want you to leave now.

453
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:21,958
Okay.

454
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:25,044
I'll leave.

455
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,515
Once you get home,
put the side dishes in the fridge.

456
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:39,434
What are you doing?
Why are you giving me money?

457
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:42,020
Because I want to.

458
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,106
I'm not a child.
I'm old enough to support myself.

459
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,275
Why are you making me feel
ashamed of myself?

460
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,069
I can't even give 30,000 won
to my daughter?

461
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:52,905
But why would you give it to me now?

462
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,282
Why now!

463
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:59,787
Why would you come and see me
all embarrassed like this?

464
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,294
There's nothing to be embarrassed of
in front of your dad.

465
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,630
I'm totally fine.

466
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,133
You should leave.

467
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:16,137
I'm going to tear up if I keep looking
at you, so please leave.

468
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,389
Ae-ra.

469
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,517
In life...

470
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:27,190
each person has their own field of play.

471
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,153
Are you telling me give up on my dream?

472
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:36,866
Does it make sense if a professional
gambler plays card with grannies?

473
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,829
Park Ji-sung shouldn't be playing
in recreational soccer.

474
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,332
You're a professional.

475
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:50,338
I'm not satisfied with a stage that small.

476
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:53,091
Are you satisfied?

477
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:05,144
You were acting all grown up.

478
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,397
You're not there yet.

479
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:11,484
Go.

480
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,277
I'm leaving.

481
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,825
That little brat.

482
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,005
Come next time when I call you.

483
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:34,882
What?

484
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,802
Next time...

485
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:41,681
I'll be on a grand stage.

486
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,183
So come when I call you then.

487
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:46,894
Okay.

488
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,188
Call me then.

489
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:53,151
Even if you're in North Korea...

490
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:58,197
I'll cross the 38th parallel to see you.

491
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,076
I'll get going.

492
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,988
You should go, too.

493
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,951
I don't want you to see me cry anymore.

494
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,624
I'm going back to Seoul.

495
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,668
By yourself?

496
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,254
Let's go together tonight.

497
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:57,798
Forget it.

498
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,134
I'll go by myself.

499
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,813
I'm going to sleep here.

500
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,190
I'm lying on the bench.

501
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:05,574
-Can I go out for a little bit?
-Where?

502
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,619
The guys want me to come out
since I left early.

503
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:11,747
-Should I come, too?
-What?

504
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,458
No, it's just the guys.

505
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,086
Don't you think it's too late though?

506
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,671
I'll come right back.

507
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:23,384
Just eat with me and go for a walk.

508
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:25,803
It's too hot for a walk.

509
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,763
Why are you going out if it's too hot?

510
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,515
What?

511
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,935
Just don't go.

512
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:51,662
I want to fight you sometime.

513
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,373
You're my only sparring partner.

514
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,042
I think...

515
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,253
you're actually really strong.

516
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,717
Coach.

517
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,178
Are we supposed to be a circus?

518
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,473
We don't have energy. We didn't even eat.

519
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,099
More boards?

520
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,435
-Why are they so hard to break?
-Are they hard to break?

521
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:15,686
What did you say?

522
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,689
-Gosh.
-Why are they so hard?

523
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:34,622
This festival has so many problems.

524
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,665
This is so disorganized.

525
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:04,402
How can you drink without knowing
your skirt ripped?

526
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:08,697
Wouldn't you drink if you were me?

527
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:12,243
What's wrong with you, Ye-jin?
Why aren't you coming to work?

528
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,788
I know this is wrong,

529
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,583
but I still like you.

530
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,169
Why do you like me?

531
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,130
You're too good to me.

532
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:28,342
I just like you more and more!
I want you to pay attention to me!

533
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:34,390
I just like you more and more.
I want you to pay attention to me!

534
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:37,059
I just like you so much.

535
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:43,315
I feel like I'm going to die.

536
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,575
I like you.

537
00:40:58,747 --> 00:40:59,790
Stop crying.

538
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,681
Are you going back to Seoul?

539
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,352
-Yes.
-Get in, I'll give you a ride.

540
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:21,896
Why?

541
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:26,025
What do you mean, "Why"?
I'm going there anyway.

542
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,407
How do you want me to do this
without a script?

543
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,745
Most events outside of Seoul
has many variables.

544
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,788
You know...

545
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:43,542
-you can do it impromptu--
-This festival is so disorganized.

546
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,252
At least get the blue print.

547
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,839
Who can do this without a script?

548
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,091
Well, one person can.

549
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:53,302
-Sorry?
-Nothing.

550
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:57,848
We'll try to get the blue print ready.

551
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:02,311
Did Ae-ra leave already?

552
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,445
Don't go. Wait for me.

553
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,781
I want to go with you.

554
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:34,218
Oh right, how was Chan-sook's wedding?

555
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:36,637
I didn't get invited, so I couldn't go.

556
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:39,890
Why would she invite you?

557
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:43,435
That's true.

558
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,063
Hey.

559
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:50,985
How did you know I went to her wedding?

560
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,361
Sorry?

561
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,948
How did you know about the festival?

562
00:42:56,782 --> 00:43:00,744
-That? Dong-man told me--
-I know he didn't tell you.

563
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,957
He didn't tell me directly,
but I heard him say something like it.

564
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,252
Are you stalking my social media page?

565
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:14,091
No, I don't even know your account.

566
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:19,179
RECENT SEARCH

567
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,642
12 Maebong Road, Oksu.

568
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,228
That's Namil Villa.

569
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,482
Because of you...

570
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:34,028
I still get goosebumps whenever I see
pungmul band perform.

571
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:36,655
Goosebumps?

572
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,658
I'll make it short.
Stop the program you're planning.

573
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,869
Don't ever show up in front of me
or Dong-man.

574
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:45,372
Ae-ra, I'm not who I was before.

575
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:49,960
I wouldn't trust you even if you reformed
as a total different person.

576
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:57,384
Open the door.

577
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:02,222
-Ae-ra.
-Open the door.

578
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:24,119
I'm not the old Jang Kyung-koo.

579
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,668
I'm not a pushover anymore.

580
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,118
Am I a joke to you?

581
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,081
You must be the one who thinks I'm a joke.

582
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:12,626
I bet you had fun watching me.

583
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,503
It wasn't funny at all.

584
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:17,756
I was so upset and it drove me mad.

585
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:21,802
I was scared.

586
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,054
What?

587
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:29,518
I hated the fact that someone like you
likes Joo-man.

588
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:33,397
I was afraid.

589
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:39,987
Please stop doing this to Joo-man.

590
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:43,532
Don't come see him at night,
text him or call him.

591
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:46,910
Also, please unfriend him on social media.

592
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:50,789
I...

593
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,002
don't want to do that either.

594
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:58,672
Your relationship with him
is dissolving anyway.

595
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:03,051
If Mr. Kim is torn,
then I don't want to stop.

596
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,596
If you're at that stage
of drifting apart...

597
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:07,473
I'll just...

598
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,351
continue to sway him.

599
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:37,419
SUL-HEE, DID YOU GO DOWN?

600
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:14,206
Why did you help her put on a safety pin?

601
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:18,168
That's mine.

602
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,088
That's mine.

603
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:27,970
Then that becomes a double discount.

604
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,847
Pardon? What was that?

605
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:34,434
It comes out to 12,000 won.

606
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:38,272
-Really?
-What?

607
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,023
Just a minute.

608
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,359
Let me help you with that.

609
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:51,827
Points from your card
including the discount...

610
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:55,372
it comes out to 9,800 won.

611
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,457
I had points?

612
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,834
Yes, should I apply them?

613
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:00,085
He's so smart.

614
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:01,211
Do you need a validation?

615
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:06,300
I recommended you
because you're Dong-man's friend...

616
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:08,510
and put you at the ticket counter.

617
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,304
But you keep causing trouble.

618
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:14,016
Last time, you sold a ticket for 700 won.

619
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:18,061
I'm sorry that I keep causing trouble.

620
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,981
Can I just be a janitor?

621
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,567
Do you know how tiring that is?

622
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:27,738
I prefer to feel at ease
than being physically uncomfortable.

623
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,408
Why are you like that?

624
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,163
Here.

625
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:45,339
A woman having the shirt open is like
a guy having his fly open.

626
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:50,469
Why are you so absentminded,
clueless and clumsy?

627
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:52,262
You're bothering me.

628
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:56,266
Maybe I should just quit.

629
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,769
You'll be different elsewhere?

630
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:01,104
Just stay where I can see you.

631
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:18,538
You're only a year older.
Let's just be friends, okay?

632
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,875
-Okay, sure.
-Cheers!

633
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:28,465
Let's start drinking.

634
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:30,384
Drink!

635
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:33,971
Drink!

636
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,180
Koong Koong Da.

637
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,058
-Gamjatang.
-Tangsuyuk.

638
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,727
-Yukgaejang.
-Jangookji.

639
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,229
Drink!

640
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:43,772
Drink!

641
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,108
Drink it up. Drink!

642
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,571
-Manager Kim, could you...
-Manager, she spoke English.

643
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:56,451
-She spoke English.
-I can't drink much, I need to stop.

644
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:59,204
Since she's my friend's friend,
I'll drink for her.

645
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:02,749
You're a real man!

646
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,418
You have to grant him a wish!

647
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:08,130
I'm too drunk, I need to use the restroom.

648
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:11,550
Sit down.

649
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:14,219
I'm going to call home.

650
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:18,557
Hey, Park Sul-hee.

651
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:22,394
-I'm Baek Sul-hee.
-Okay, Baek Sul-hee.

652
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:25,439
You're really pretty.

653
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,232
What?

654
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:29,568
I'm still older than you.

655
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,488
Today is Kiss Day.

656
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:38,160
I want to be with you tonight.

657
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,955
You little jerk!

658
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,332
I told you not to do that!

659
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:49,087
I told you she's my friend's friend,
you jerk!

660
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:02,100
My dad told me to sterilize wounds
with soju.

661
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:03,894
Should I go get one?

662
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:07,314
What's wrong with you?

663
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,611
What did I do wrong this time?

664
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:16,823
You're the one who fought.
Why are you yelling at me?

665
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:22,829
Why did you throw a kick at someone
you can't even beat up?

666
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:28,919
-Why did you flirt?
-What?

667
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:31,838
You're wearing a short skirt
to get attention, right?

668
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:35,759
And smile all cute to guys.

669
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,095
Are you trying to seduce guys?

670
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:41,807
Are you trying to drive me nuts?

671
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,392
It's because I like you!

672
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:47,437
I wanted you to look at me.

673
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:52,234
-That's why I wore this skirt and smiled.
-What?

674
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:56,613
Because I like you more and more,
I wanted to get attention from you!

675
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,868
Darn it, why must I say this?

676
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:05,080
You're so annoying.

677
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,044
You're so darn pretty.

678
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,999
What are you afraid of
to do such a thing?

679
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,669
-Am I not being myself?
-You're being exactly like yourself.

680
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:38,757
It's so obvious
that you're afraid of something.

681
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,595
Smiling like that isn't cool at all.

682
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:46,765
If you're upset, just yell and cry.

683
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:49,309
If you're happy, just say it.

684
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,770
If you want something,
just be honest to yourself.

685
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:53,313
That makes it less pathetic.

686
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,232
Like Ae-ra?

687
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:59,027
You know, you're more pathetic than her.

688
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:04,032
Then why didn't you date her?

689
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:06,743
What?

690
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:10,330
You weren't totally sure about it.

691
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:12,707
That means it isn't right.

692
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,503
We've shared 20 years together.

693
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,880
-What do you know about us?
-After 20 years...

694
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:21,675
even furniture in your house
grows on you.

695
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:23,218
What?

696
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:25,512
Don't confuse being comfortable
as liking her.

697
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:28,807
If she wasn't for 20 years,
it won't be her ever.

698
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:37,148
Do you think I want to act crazy myself?

699
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:42,487
I need you. That's why I'm acting crazy.

700
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:48,326
You said I was your first love.

701
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,079
Sure, Hye-ran.

702
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:54,207
You were my first love.

703
00:54:55,583 --> 00:55:00,755
But I was only 20 years old then,
so I let myself get hurt...

704
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,882
and acted like a fool.

705
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,677
But, that's all in the past.

706
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:08,471
What?

707
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:12,809
My first love has ended and now...

708
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,104
I only see Ae-ra.

709
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:21,693
Is it Ae-ra again?

710
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:26,489
You think I was a terrible girl to you,
right?

711
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,159
But you were cruel to me, too.

712
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:33,496
I was always nervous because of Ae-ra.
That's why I...

713
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:40,462
I won't lose you to her.

714
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,841
I've seen this scene countless times.

715
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:49,512
She seems like a manipulating witch.

716
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:53,808
Maybe we should send Dong-man to the army.

717
00:55:54,809 --> 00:56:00,148
Since it's Dong-man and Hye-ran's
100th day together, they should...

718
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:03,693
kiss!

719
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:06,696
Kiss!

720
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:11,159
Kiss!

721
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:12,994
Kiss!

722
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:19,292
Dong-man kissed a girl.

723
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:25,965
You probably didn't get any chocolate
since Hye-ran dumped you.

724
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:50,490
In life, timing is always so terrible.

725
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,870
And I always ran away.

726
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,999
What are you doing!

727
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,627
If it hasn't worked out for 20 years,
it never will!

728
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,739
I won't let you go again.

729
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:35,910
Let's stop making detours.

730
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:44,335
Stand strong.

731
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,924
We've already kissed...

732
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,760
and I don't know anything
about some or whatever.

733
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:55,889
If we kissed, it's day one.

734
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:00,560
Let's date.

735
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:06,191
Let's date.

736
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:11,112
I said let's date.

737
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,287
Since we're dating...

738
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,709
I want to do it again.

739
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:27,420
What?

740
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,340
I want to do it again.

741
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:10,004
Darn it, why isn't it working?

742
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:13,591
Relax, take it easy. Don't be nervous.

743
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:26,437
But it's you, right?

744
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:28,982
Hwang Bok...

745
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:34,070
Ganako Hwang.

746
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:37,073
I go by Ganako Hwang now.

747
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:45,623
How long do you plan to stay
in Namil Villa?

748
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:55,091
I'm going to live there forever.

749
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:59,095
