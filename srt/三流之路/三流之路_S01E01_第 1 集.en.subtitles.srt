1
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,480
Whoever made noise, stand up.

2
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,651
No one? 

3
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,572
-No one? Really?
-Thank you.

4
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,950
Look at your uniforms.
Are you old ladies going hiking?

5
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,619
Are you trying to display
all the colors of the rainbow?

6
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,664
Sir, I just spoke one word. 

7
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,332
-Please forgive us.
-Is that so?

8
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,961
Dong-man and Joo-man, our man brothers.

9
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:48,423
-If you get this question, I won't hit.
-Sir.

10
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:51,676
Don't try to make a deal with students.
Please be generous instead. 

11
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,094
I agree. 

12
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,346
Fine then, I'll just hit you.
Come up. 

13
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:57,766
Challenge accepted!

14
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,101
-I'll challenge myself.
-Listen carefully. 

15
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:03,563
There's a 20% chance
you'll know this question. 

16
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,816
You have a 40% chance
of getting it wrong.

17
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:10,070
What percent is the chance
that your butts stay safe? 

18
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:11,988
Is that a question?

19
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,074
-Could you repeat once more?
-Five...

20
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,825
-Four, three...
-I think it's 50 percent.

21
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,785
-50 percent.
-Two...

22
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,828
It's 50! The answer is 50 percent!

23
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,915
Fifty? Wow, give them a round of applause.

24
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,879
I'll give you two a reward.
Come up. 

25
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,506
Yes, sir. 

26
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,386
Gosh.

27
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,264
-We're here.
-Great, turn around. 

28
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,517
-Sorry?
-Both of you, turn around. 

29
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,605
Since you were so sure it was 50,
I'll hit you 50 times.

30
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,440
I thought the answer was one percent. 

31
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,109
One? Just turn around. 

32
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,610
Does anyone know the answer?

33
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,154
Yes, Moo-bin.

34
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,576
The answer is 11 percent. 

35
00:01:58,701 --> 00:01:59,786
Correct!

36
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,207
-That jerk.
-Such a brown-noser.

37
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,254
Sir, hold please.
That was my bone!

38
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,298
-I really got hit on the bone!
-Shut up!

39
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,510
PUNGWOON GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL
IN SEOSAN, 2006

40
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,470
Please, Ma'am.
That hurts! 

41
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,308
Are you going around to perform?

42
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:26,896
-Her dream is to become an anchor.
-Give me your headband.

43
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:29,649
Hurry up. 

44
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,279
Could you let it go this time?

45
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,157
That's not it, Ma'am.

46
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,324
When I become an anchor...

47
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,411
I'll look for a TV show for you.

48
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,453
Ae-ra,

49
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:47,625
you have to study really hard
to become an anchor. 

50
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,338
Ma'am, she's smart.
Last time, she even placed 29th.

51
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,174
So, Miss 35th place. 

52
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,467
And you want to be an anchor as well?

53
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,386
No, I'll be a good wife. 

54
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,431
Enough talking.

55
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,893
Clean the auditorium
if your items were confiscated.

56
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,895
No, not today. 

57
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,041
Take your hands off
before I snap your wrist.

58
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,628
Hey, they're out of coffee milk. 

59
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,504
Dammit.

60
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:37,842
Bo-ram, here you go.
I bought it in advance.

61
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:41,012
Don't do this anymore.
Your mom will scold me. 

62
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,806
-You'll come to tutoring today, right?
-I can't.

63
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,725
I have to skip school and go to Gangnam.

64
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,268
Gangnam? Why? 

65
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,646
It's none of your business. 

66
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,658
That lady from the convenience store
is in trouble.

67
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,662
-This fried dumpling tastes--
-Like persimmons?

68
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,873
What, you're a chef, now?
Got some kind of absolute taste?

69
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,459
It smells like a burger. 

70
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:16,756
I keep on telling her she shouldn't use
the same microwave. 

71
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,678
What's that?
Why are you wearing this today?

72
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,013
To match my outfit.

73
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:29,394
You won't ever be a city boy. 

74
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:33,231
Please just act like you're from Seoul.

75
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,900
Look at me. 

76
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,403
Wolf-cut.

77
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,490
-Does she know you're wearing that?
-What?

78
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,785
-Who are you talking about?
-Jang Bo-ram.

79
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:46,995
Why does she need to know?

80
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,289
You're our best fighter
and she leads the girls.

81
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,040
You could be allies.

82
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:52,709
Allies?

83
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,460
What's that? 

84
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,130
Why...

85
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:01,884
-Did she say she likes me?
-She brings you coffee milk everyday.

86
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,973
Do you know how hard it is
to get coffee milk in our school? 

87
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:13,604
Even I wouldn't want to get involved
with a guy in a ragged red shirt. 

88
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,616
Park Moo-se. No, what's your name?

89
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,994
-It's Moo-bin.
-Right, Moo-bin. 

90
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,121
Sponsor this poor guy. 

91
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,832
Lend him your expensive shirt. 

92
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,960
Your classmate is entering
the National Sports Festival. 

93
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,837
Could you do that for him?

94
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,799
He's going to Gangnam so you'll get it
back before evening study. 

95
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,676
Gangnam?

96
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,887
That's where his taekwondo match is. 

97
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,598
He'll win the championship

98
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:52,101
and take off his uniform
for an awesome ceremony.

99
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:56,064
If he shows those fine marks
on his shoulder,

100
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,982
he'll look like a kid from Seoul.

101
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:06,866
Look what he's offering you.
That's a precious gift. 

102
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:10,870
I can't ignore the importance
of a good ceremony. 

103
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:16,334
It's the fate of a star fighter, you see. 

104
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,800
-What time is the match?
-6 p.m.

105
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,260
Can we catch the 3 p.m. train?

106
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,806
Hey, we can make it. 

107
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,350
We look perfect. 

108
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,232
She's so sick. 

109
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:44,821
Ma'am, I think we both have a flu. 

110
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,781
We need to be quarantined.

111
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,410
Can we leave early?

112
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:56,791
Your lips are so pale.

113
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,294
Sorry.

114
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:01,921
Let's go. 

115
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,767
I think we have acute
hemorrhagic conjunctivitis.

116
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,896
I can smell the pain relief gel
all the way from here. 

117
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,191
Don't apply it around your eyes.
You could go blind. 

118
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,986
I got hit by a shuttlecock
during PE class.

119
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,572
It hurts as if I was hit
by Hyun Jeong-hwa.

120
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,949
Hyun Jeong-hwa plays table tennis. 

121
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,910
You're trying way too hard. 

122
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,502
We're doomed. 

123
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,588
Nothing worked. 

124
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,718
Shall we try saying we broke an ankle?

125
00:07:57,518 --> 00:08:00,396
Who touched my car this time?

126
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,732
It's a new car. 

127
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:11,908
I have a great idea. Follow me. 

128
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,918
The plastic mic, where is it?

129
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,464
Hey, what are you doing?

130
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,049
Put that down. 

131
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,550
Don't do it. 

132
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:33,054
Where are you going?
Yellow and pink, I saw you girls!

133
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,518
Where are you girls going?

134
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,647
Choi Ae-ra! Baek Sul-hee!
You girls are in trouble!

135
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,566
You only live once!

136
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,235
What are we going to do tomorrow?

137
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,072
I didn't think about tomorrow.
I just didn't think!

138
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,537
KUKKIWON IN GANGNAM, 2006

139
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,711
Do you know why men die
for their hometown friends?

140
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,171
To drink together?

141
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,508
No. Because a country bumpkin
shouldn't get intimidated. 

142
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,594
Also, we practically raised him
since he was six. 

143
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,846
We have to support him. 

144
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:21,352
Ko Dong-man! Ko Dong-man!

145
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,358
Keep your distance. Good. 

146
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,610
Separate, separate!

147
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,738
-Fight!
-Dong-man, use your feet. 

148
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,031
Use your feet!

149
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,452
Go for it, move in first!

150
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,955
Kick him!

151
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,332
Kick him!

152
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,001
Kick him!

153
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,837
Just kick him!

154
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,880
-What's she doing there?
-Kick him!

155
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,632
The psycho mic girl is here again. 

156
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,217
-Do it!
-Kick him!

157
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,595
-Kick him!
-Go for it!

158
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:00,891
Ko Dong-man!

159
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,895
Seosan's ong-bak, Ko Dong-man!

160
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:17,408
ROUND 1
ONE TIME ONG-BAK,  ONE TIME BAEK JI-YEON

161
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,327
Watch out, watch your left!

162
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,162
Turn around, get out of the way!

163
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,168
-Ko Dong-man!
-You're doing good!

164
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,132
Keep them quiet. 

165
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,384
Country girls are very scary. 

166
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,220
What's wrong with them?

167
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,139
Bo-ram!

168
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,267
What are you doing here?

169
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,103
Why did you give the coffee milk
I gave you to Dong-man?

170
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,606
What? Did you come here to ask me that?

171
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,274
Don't you have class?

172
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,653
Do you like Dong-man by any chance?

173
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,673
From now on,
you can say you have a boyfriend.

174
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,134
Let's go out!

175
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,386
Jang Bo-ram!

176
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:02,930
Hey, did you hear that?

177
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,934
Congratulations!

178
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,104
We have an alliance now!

179
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,482
That's not it. 

180
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,276
What did he just say?

181
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,154
Something about going
to a college together, I think?

182
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,990
How dare you give away your uniform?

183
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,702
-Come here.
-Can you let go of my ear?

184
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:25,870
Fighting!

185
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,790
I sent him to Seoul to train
and look what he's getting up to.

186
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,793
Congratulations.

187
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,671
Did she snap her neck?
Why can't she keep her head still?

188
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,470
Are you really going out with him?

189
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,972
Yes, I'm going to. Why?

190
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,516
-Tell my mom if you want to.
-I'm going to. 

191
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,728
He can't even calculate probabilities...

192
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,232
and always gets beaten up in class.
He also wears a red shirt, so why?

193
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,942
Because he's cool and he's the best!

194
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,361
I only date the best. 

195
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,288
Hey!

196
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,166
When did we drop this?

197
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,377
Sorry, my bad. 

198
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:16,796
Hey!

199
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,257
I said sorry!

200
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:25,387
Did the legendary idiots from back then
really become legends?

201
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,597
Sorry.

202
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,517
Excuse me, I'm sorry. 

203
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,727
I'm sorry.

204
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,729
Are they letting VIPs in first?

205
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,820
The mic girl who wanted to read the news

206
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,365
now works at an information desk. 

207
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,576
Please enter in an orderly fashion
to avoid accidents. 

208
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,751
-Sir, which suite?
-Penthouse.

209
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,715
The Taekwondo prodigy who wanted
to smash the world...

210
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:10,099
We got rid of all the ticks and I sprayed
phytoncide as complimentary service.

211
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,394
...he crushes bugs now.

212
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,024
The pink princess who wanted
to become a good wife...

213
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,821
Hello, have a nice day. 

214
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,657
...now works as a customer service agent.

215
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,619
Hello, this is Dream Home Shopping
where we spread happiness. 

216
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,419
Joo-man, who loved convenience store...

217
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,964
Let's cut it by five each
for two thousand.

218
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,343
Can't you discount it by five?

219
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,305
You can't cut five cents each
for two thousand fishcakes?

220
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,347
It's soft. 

221
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,850
...became a buyer
for a home shopping channel.

222
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,436
-It's all natural.
-Is it, right?

223
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,399
We are starting the real legend
of the Fantastic Four Idiots. 

224
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,319
FANTASTIC FOUR

225
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,863
Welcome.

226
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,407
Welcome.

227
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,826
HOW DID IT GO?

228
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,996
Welcome.

229
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,083
Why won't you pick up the phone?

230
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,252
Hey!

231
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,172
Moo-ki, pick up the phone!

232
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,882
Did he fail again?

233
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,843
Welcome.

234
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,681
Choi Ae-ra?

235
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,811
Ae-ra, is it you?

236
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,399
Yes, should I go now?

237
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,402
It is you. 

238
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,908
Who are you?

239
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,662
It's me, the second Kim Ju-ha.
Don't you remember me?

240
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,997
How could I not remember you?

241
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,125
Hold on. 

242
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,377
Okay.

243
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,880
You work here,
but you've never been in here, right?

244
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,634
It's my first time, too,
thanks to my boyfriend's card. 

245
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,181
Don't feel too intimidated by me.

246
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:15,891
Whatever.

247
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,561
#LUCKY DEPARTMENT STORE
#LUXURY DESIGNER BAGS

248
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:20,562
Done.

249
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:25,109
But seriously, how cool that we meet
like this today?

250
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,944
It's so good to see you.

251
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:27,987
No way.

252
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,571
I'm getting married.

253
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,572
What the hell.

254
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,490
He's a doctor.

255
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,117
I didn't ask. 

256
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,202
My wedding is at the Hilton Hotel.

257
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,122
We're moving into Dogok tower palace
and my ring has 2.5 carat diamond.

258
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,456
Our honeymoon...

259
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,877
I thought you were rapping.

260
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,672
I was cheering for the Korean soccer team.

261
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,466
I got carried away, so I got
on top of a car.

262
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:54,221
That was caught by the news,
and my mom saw it and flipped out.

263
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,850
I was too loud, wasn't I?
I'm sorry.

264
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,020
Also, when I was in the fifth grade,

265
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,605
I was in the same class
as Du-jun from Beast. 

266
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,734
-Really?
-Seriously, back then,

267
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:11,488
I was a better dancer than him
and also more popular--

268
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:15,200
Can't you talk about the present
and not the past?

269
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,954
Kyung-koo said you are a specialist. 

270
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,080
That's right.

271
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,958
I dedicate my life to the health
of the people.

272
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,128
Then, are you a doctor?

273
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:29,131
I help treat eczema. 

274
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,092
Oh, you're a Dermatologist?

275
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,762
-Dermatology is popular these days.
-Gosh.

276
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,514
That's it. That.

277
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,642
You seem excited.

278
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,395
I'm a man with a car.
I'll drive you later. 

279
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,813
No, it's fine. 

280
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:48,192
When I sold bidets, I had to take
the subway everywhere. 

281
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,862
My transport expenses ended up
being the same as my studio rent.

282
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:53,864
A studio.

283
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,117
When you pay rent
on a month-to-month basis,

284
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,204
don't you feel like you're being robbed?

285
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,831
I have an annual lease. 

286
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,209
Really?

287
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,920
You must be rich!

288
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,714
Didn't you major in anything?

289
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,051
I heard you were famous for some sport.

290
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,302
What did you do?

291
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,683
Sport...

292
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,938
I didn't do sports.

293
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:27,940
I see. 

294
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:36,156
Anyway, did you give up on being
the second Baek Ji-yeon?

295
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,618
You were going to be
the second Kim Ju-ha.

296
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,328
Why do you depend on
your boyfriend's card?

297
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,206
What do you mean? It's called love. 

298
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:47,000
You should get married
before it's too late. 

299
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,168
I have someone.

300
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,379
-Really?
-He's a judge...

301
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,506
What?

302
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,091
...in training.

303
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,510
It's hard to support a student, isn't it?

304
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:05,519
Hey.

305
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:09,022
Why don't you tell me the age
of your doctor boyfriend?

306
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,441
Does it start...

307
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,485
with a three?

308
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,404
Four?

309
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,781
He looks young for his age.

310
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,911
I see, he must really look young.

311
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,708
You should get married soon.

312
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:32,462
You'll find someone soon
if you lower your standards.

313
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,257
After all, every Jack has its Jill.

314
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,177
What?

315
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:41,930
By the way,

316
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,600
is he coming to your wedding,

317
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:48,478
that boy from pungmul band?

318
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,190
Why would he?

319
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,651
You still think I flirted with him, right?

320
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,570
But you know what?

321
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:01,825
I care about the look. 

322
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:07,414
He is on the same level as you are.

323
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:10,334
Hey, I'm prettier than you now.

324
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,717
MOM

325
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,844
Hello.

326
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,515
You must've been so upset. 

327
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:31,271
So, you're saying the blanket you received
smells of farts?

328
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,194
We sincerely apologize
for the inconvenience caused. 

329
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,112
I see. 

330
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,573
It smells like someone farted on it!

331
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,826
I have a sensitive nose!
Come and smell it yourself!

332
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,997
I'm terribly sorry, but I have rhinitis,

333
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,582
so I can't smell my own farts.

334
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,252
Since you have a sensitive nose...

335
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,712
What did you say?

336
00:20:57,172 --> 00:21:00,384
I'll help you process the refund.

337
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,012
Please confirm your information first.

338
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,184
Are you Park Jum-soon?

339
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,561
-No, that's my wife!
-I see. 

340
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,398
Then what is your wife's number?

341
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:17,776
What? What did you say?

342
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,736
I'm sorry.

343
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,531
Hello, sir.

344
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,575
We apologize for the inconvenience.
I'm sorry.

345
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,214
Ye-jin.

346
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,134
Yes? Hello. 

347
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,469
Are these going to the conference room?

348
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,556
Yes, I'll be done soon.

349
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,391
I'll do it.

350
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,310
You will?

351
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,603
There are 100 sets. 

352
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,398
-I need to make 100 sets.
-Yes.

353
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,984
I like doing these things.

354
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,113
It's 100 sets...

355
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:08,869
I'm sorry.

356
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,288
Don't you have a boyfriend?

357
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:12,581
I do. 

358
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,082
You do?

359
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,209
Then just get married. 

360
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,671
The full-time employees
look down on us. 

361
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,799
You know people like you
make it worse. 

362
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,428
We have a meeting here.

363
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,264
Hello, sir. I'm sorry.
We're done.

364
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,685
Pick yourself up.

365
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:56,708
Hey.

366
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,461
Just for a minute.
I need to recharge.

367
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,090
What am I going to do with you.

368
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,843
You came because of me, didn't you?

369
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,804
Your meeting starts in two hours.

370
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,515
What did you do this time?

371
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,810
Stop getting stuff on your face. 

372
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:15,977
Honey.

373
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:20,857
Should I really just get married?

374
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,819
-What?
-What do you think?

375
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,780
Why are you saying that again?

376
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,117
Are you on your period?

377
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,579
I'm not trying to start a fight. 

378
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,749
Come on, we've been dating for six years.

379
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,115
Why did you ignore all my texts?

380
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,242
Did you...

381
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,703
fail again?

382
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,331
I'm sorry, honey. 

383
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,169
Why can't you ever pass?

384
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,380
So, where are you?

385
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,174
I'm eating alone.

386
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,721
But, I'm thinking of traveling
across the country. 

387
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,222
What?

388
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,475
Traveling across the country?

389
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:42,063
Do you have time to go around biking?

390
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,275
I'm going to bike around
and refresh my brain.

391
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:48,403
That was the deal if you had passed.

392
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:52,157
If you used your brain to pass,
then you'd need to refresh it.

393
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,457
I was going to treat him
rib eye if he passed.

394
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,170
How am I going to look after him
from now on?

395
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,385
What should we have for lunch?

396
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,972
There's this really good clam noodle
restaurant nearby.

397
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:20,268
I'm sorry, but I have another appointment.
I need to go right now. 

398
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,603
You have to leave?

399
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:24,231
-I'll drive you then.
-It's okay.

400
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,690
Taxi!

401
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:29,402
Taxi? Wait, please! 

402
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,822
Sir, could you give me a moment?

403
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,450
Can I have your number?

404
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,994
-I'll give it to Kyung-koo.
-Okay.

405
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:41,206
I bought you coffee so why don't you
buy me soju on Friday?

406
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:45,210
There's a place in Sillim
famous for gizzards.

407
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:48,088
They give you three dishes
just for 9,900 Won. 

408
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:51,466
Hey, let's just say I paid
for the coffee today. 

409
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,425
Sorry?

410
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:56,888
So I don't need to buy
soju this Friday, okay?

411
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,306
We can go now. 

412
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:14,114
AE-RA

413
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,286
What is it?

414
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:20,996
What?

415
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:25,125
Why do I have to go all the way
to eat with you?

416
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,794
No, I'm not going.
Wait, rib eye?

417
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:29,879
Did you say rib eye?

418
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,894
She wanted to have lunch.
Why isn't she answering?

419
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,773
You should get some hair transplant
before the wedding. 

420
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,942
You need to look as young as you can.

421
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,485
I keep on making changes. 

422
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,613
I even cut facial bones just for you. 

423
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,740
And you won't get some hair transplant?

424
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,366
Fine, bye. 

425
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:04,623
What? Why is this being annoying, too?

426
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,042
What's wrong with this?

427
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,045
Wait, let me fix it. 

428
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,928
DONG-MAN KO

429
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,527
Are you okay?

430
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,906
-You must be a doctor.
-Sorry?

431
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,200
You have thick hair, too. 

432
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,910
Yes.

433
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:58,009
We're very sorry. 

434
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:01,262
Why did you come so late?
My lunch hour is almost over. 

435
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:04,099
Hey, I came on time.
You weren't at your desk. 

436
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,852
Hey Park Chan-sook.

437
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,189
Why is your face so red?

438
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,441
I'm not red. 

439
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,944
By the way, do you know him?

440
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,154
You should introduce him to me. 

441
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,198
Why should I?

442
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,701
Hey, Dong-man. 

443
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,704
-This is my college friend--
-I'm Park Chan-sook.

444
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,003
Sure.

445
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,298
Are you going to kiss her hand?

446
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,679
-I'm Ko Dong-man.
-I see. 

447
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,599
-And he--
-He's not your boyfriend, right?

448
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,060
I'm not, that can't be. 

449
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,771
So, you are just friends?

450
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,401
Kind of. 

451
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,029
-Kind of?
-Yes.

452
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,449
We're kind of friends. 

453
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:06,327
If he's not your boyfriend nor a friend,
what is he?

454
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,332
To tell you the truth...

455
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,339
What nonsense is she saying now?

456
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:21,968
He likes me. 

457
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:24,637
Whatever.

458
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,389
And you won't go out with him?

459
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,016
He's handsome and he's a doctor. 

460
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,977
-Doctor?
-I saw his white coat. 

461
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,566
That white coat?

462
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:38,651
And you won't go out with him?

463
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,321
Let me remind you, I care about the looks.

464
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,156
He's handsome enough--

465
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:46,326
I guess he's just okay-looking. 

466
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:47,619
That doesn't make sense. 

467
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:50,538
Then is your unemployed boyfriend--

468
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,832
He's the best. He'll drive you nuts. 

469
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:57,337
When I look at him,
all my fatigue goes away.

470
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:02,467
When it comes to men,
looks matter the most. 

471
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:13,561
It's been so long since I had beef. 

472
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,156
Hey, let's switch seats. 

473
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:26,741
Why?

474
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,702
The sun's too bright. 

475
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,996
Let's just switch seats.
Hurry up. 

476
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:35,333
Just sit anywhere, you are so picky. 

477
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,626
Hurry.

478
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,757
It's not that bright. 

479
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,638
Hey, can you pat my head?

480
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:49,931
What did you say?

481
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,559
Can you pat my hair?

482
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:56,896
In dramas, the guy pats the girl's head. 

483
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:00,233
No, I don't want to touch you. 

484
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,945
If you want rib eye, do it. 

485
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,905
My goodness, you are so cheap. 

486
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,636
Did you not wash your hair?

487
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:30,346
Why are you...

488
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:35,393
making me... touch... your hair?

489
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,353
This is crazy. 

490
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:51,618
I told you to pat my hair not grab it. 

491
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:04,213
Hey.

492
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,383
Are you around 1m 85 tall?

493
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,011
I'm 1m 85.6.

494
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,097
Are you ready to order?

495
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,392
Yes, please. Could we have rib eye...

496
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,770
Really? Did your boyfriend pass
the bar exam?

497
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,230
Can we have beer and soju as well?

498
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,815
He failed. 

499
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,108
Okay.

500
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:29,364
I'm going to rejuvenate myself
and work forever. 

501
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:33,159
If he doesn't pass the exam,
I might have to retire at the current job.

502
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,870
Gosh, he's such a punk. 

503
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,497
What?

504
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,916
Why isn't he paying back your deposit?

505
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,463
-Well, he will later.
-Sure, he will. 

506
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:48,841
His girlfriend has varicose veins
at her age...

507
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:52,762
and stands all day at work to support him.
He must have lost his mind. 

508
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:55,348
Hey. Don't speak badly about my boyfriend.

509
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:59,227
If he was a nice guy,
he could at least do physical work.

510
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,104
I won't let him do that. 

511
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:04,190
What a virtuous woman. 

512
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:08,194
Nice to meet you, ma'am.
Have a great lunch. 

513
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,030
Hey.

514
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,992
You should leave.
I'm not treating you. 

515
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,872
Can we have the rib eye now?

516
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:27,755
Stop staring at it.
Are you going to get it?

517
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,426
How much discount can I get?

518
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:35,263
Hey, it's already at 50 percent.
That's the most discount I can do.

519
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,474
It has eight gears.

520
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:52,572
Bus 171 will be arriving soon...

521
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:57,869
A-E-I-O-U.

522
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:00,788
APPLY NOW.
JOIN KBC.

523
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:04,584
A-E-I-O-U.

524
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,026
Wait.

525
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,406
You should take the cab.

526
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,932
The number you dialed
is currently unavailable.

527
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:03,768
Please leave a message after the beep. 

528
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,062
Why isn't he picking up?

529
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,817
Hello.

530
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,026
Room 208?

531
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,695
Room 208?

532
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,407
What was that?

533
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:29,961
-Hey!
-What is it?

534
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:33,422
Clean it all up!
Room 208 is here. 

535
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,508
-She's here.
-Hurry up. 

536
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,593
Put away the radish first. 

537
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,679
-Put it in.
-Clean it up. 

538
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,056
Get Moo-ki. Hurry up and clean!

539
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:46,185
Hey, Moo-ki!

540
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,614
Oh, you're here.
What brings you here?

541
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,783
Why won't you pick up your phone?

542
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,744
I was sleeping.

543
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,081
How can you sleep?

544
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,208
My gosh.

545
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:11,752
Don't just stand there.

546
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,337
Take this. 

547
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,381
Right.

548
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:19,093
-What is this bike for?
-I thought you wanted to tour around. 

549
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,013
Don't tell me you'll ride
the broken bike you have. 

550
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,349
-You'd kill yourself.
-I see. 

551
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,895
You didn't have to buy me one.

552
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,233
It only has eight gears.

553
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,122
Why are your pants inside out?

554
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:50,917
The tag is hanging out. 

555
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,554
You need to come to your senses, okay?

556
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:05,431
Okay.

557
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:16,025
It's the lady from the radish
barley rice restaurant. 

558
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:19,111
-Hello, how are you?
-Hello.

559
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,239
Do you deliver these days?

560
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:24,867
Yes, I'm trying to make a living. 

561
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:30,790
Did you bring the whole container?
You won't be able to make a profit. 

562
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,333
How's business?

563
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:35,002
Your radish kimchi is the best. 

564
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,672
-Can I have one?
-No, no. 

565
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,632
You'll ruin your clothes.
Don't use your hand. 

566
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:40,591
Here you go. 

567
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,762
Do you have shaky hands?

568
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,014
Maybe because I quit smoking. 

569
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,108
That rat...

570
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:03,489
That rat hair tie
with a missing ear is mine.

571
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,993
I'm sure that's mine. 

572
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,465
How come...

573
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:26,846
your top and Moo-ki's pants
look like one outfit?

574
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,024
Menthol.

575
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,359
This smells like Moo-ki's cigarettes. 

576
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:01,380
-Did you dodge? Come here!
-Wait.

577
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:04,216
-Come here!
-No, listen to me. 

578
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,302
-You!
-I'm sorry. 

579
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,056
-Don't go in!
-Sorry!

580
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,266
-Hey!
-Stop it!

581
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,354
-You jerk!
-Help me!

582
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,115
Moo-ki.

583
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:33,079
This bag was a gift of yours last year.
You said we'd get married when you pass.

584
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:36,499
Yes.

585
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:38,709
But...

586
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:43,172
I keep... failing. 

587
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,009
This bag...

588
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,639
was the very first brand bag I got. 

589
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:56,060
I yelled at you and scolded you
for wasting money...

590
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,316
but I realized that it was real. 

591
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:06,904
Thinking about you buying me this bag
with your limited savings...

592
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,454
made my heart ache so much. 

593
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,957
At the same time, I trusted you. 

594
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,544
I'm sorry. 

595
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:23,754
I'm sorry, Ae-ra. 

596
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,925
I already knew you weren't as smart. 

597
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:33,013
If you failed again this time,
I was going to tell you to give up.

598
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:37,768
If you failed again,
I was going to take care of you. 

599
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,021
-Hey.
-Yes?

600
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,731
Go on your knees at least. 

601
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,785
Do you know how much I make
at the information desk? 

602
00:40:56,912 --> 00:41:01,542
You think I get paid millions since I paid
for your deposit and allowances?

603
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:07,089
Do you think I don't have dreams?

604
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,510
Do you think that's why I supported you?

605
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,221
I'm really sorry. 

606
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:17,016
How can you be so stupid? 

607
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,810
It would've been better
if you had an affair

608
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:23,147
with someone younger or rich,
I wouldn't have minded as much.

609
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,608
But how could you...

610
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:27,735
She's just...

611
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:31,113
She's just a small restaurant owner. 

612
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:37,203
Actually, it's not that small. 

613
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:44,710
RADISH KIMCHI AND BARLEY RICE 

614
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:46,629
Like I said...

615
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:50,841
it's not that small. 

616
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,137
She wasn't a cook
at a small restaurant.

617
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:58,641
She had customers lined up.
She was the rich queen of radish kimchi.

618
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:04,230
He wasn't foolish at all. 

619
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:06,941
TRAVELING ACROSS KOREA

620
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,280
-Did you finish packing?
-Yes.

621
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,325
-Are you leaving now?
-Yes.

622
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,497
I already booked all the accommodation.

623
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:24,250
So, I have to go.

624
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,422
The bike was enough.
You didn't have to lend me the car. 

625
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:35,094
It's okay, the car isn't important.
You're more important. 

626
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:36,053
That bike...

627
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:38,639
must have more than 18 gears. 

628
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,350
It's got 28 gears.

629
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:43,936
Hey.

630
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:49,233
I've been waiting to give this to you
for a while. 

631
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:54,238
This is the deposit for Moo-ki's room. 

632
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,282
I added some more money inside. 

633
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,534
Is that my compensation? 

634
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,996
Just take it. 

635
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:06,083
-Yes, take it.
-Yes, you should take it. 

636
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,377
Hey...

637
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,132
do you want a ride?

638
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,344
You have to take that bike.
It was really heavy.

639
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,929
Yes, take the car. 

640
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,347
Get on. 

641
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:23,892
-What?
-Hey, wait. What's wrong?

642
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,563
Are you okay?

643
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,357
This is mine. 

644
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,402
What? Just say so, then.

645
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,454
Taxi!

646
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:52,880
Yeah, that's not going to work.

647
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,843
Gosh, no.

648
00:43:57,926 --> 00:44:00,888
It doesn't fit. 

649
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,223
It really doesn't fit. 

650
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:07,436
You should call a truck instead
or you can ride the bike home. 

651
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:10,939
I don't know how to ride a bike!

652
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:36,548
I asked for sausage, not liver. 

653
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:40,219
You should eat protein to build muscles,
not carbs at this hour. 

654
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:43,514
This isn't protein, it's cheap fat. 

655
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:46,433
What did you say?

656
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,937
Once a coach, forever a coach. 

657
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,356
Once a martial artist,
always a martial artist. 

658
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,442
An athlete must remain
in shape for competition,

659
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,528
so you can make a comeback.

660
00:44:57,611 --> 00:45:00,656
-Who said I'd make a comeback?
-Did I say anything?

661
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:04,952
Let me ask you honestly. 

662
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:07,287
-Why do you keep coming here?
-To sell sausages. 

663
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:13,377
You know you can't sell much here.
You're driving me nuts.

664
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,755
It's David and Goliath's fight. 

665
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:23,387
I'm the coach that trained a 185.6 cm tall
and 64 kg slim-fit David. 

666
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:27,516
If you're still trying to get me
go back, give up now. 

667
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,518
I'm not going back to Taekwondo.

668
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,979
I'll be 30 soon.
I can't make the national team. 

669
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,689
Who told you to do Taekwondo?

670
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:36,650
Choo Sung-hoon was born in 1975. 

671
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,986
In the fighting world, you're still young.

672
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:42,489
Are you going to waste your talented legs?
Don't you want to kick?

673
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,616
You were the first one in Korea
to do a roundhouse kick!

674
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,661
Doesn't it kill you to see men
worse than you up there?

675
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,413
I won't do any sports ever again. 

676
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,668
That number one roundhouse kick
died on November 3, 2007.

677
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,378
Please just leave me alone, so I can live.

678
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:59,381
You still haven't gotten over it?

679
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:03,218
-Please just forget about it.
-I won't go back to sports.

680
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,054
I was never happy doing sports. 

681
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:09,057
It was always humiliating
and it was way too intense. 

682
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,144
I'll never do it again, never!

683
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:15,814
So, are you happy now?

684
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,358
Are you doing anything intense?

685
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:26,867
Go.

686
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,620
Okay, bye. 

687
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:44,885
Is she sleeping?

688
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,638
Leave her alone. 

689
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:53,310
I'm so humiliated that I feel sick.

690
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:01,735
Why am I...

691
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:06,532
so pathetic even with my breakup?

692
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:11,036
We have sad news. 

693
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,413
Anchor Park Hye-ran, who had retired
when she got married...

694
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:17,209
announced that her marriage is over
after three years. 

695
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:20,796
She's the one who married a business guy.

696
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,340
Yes, that's her. 

697
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,425
Wow, I wonder what happened. 

698
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:44,695
What's that?

699
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,488
-What was that?
-What?

700
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,614
What's wrong with you?

701
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:50,117
-Why are you...
-There's a person!

702
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,911
-There's a person!
-Oh, no!

703
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,833
Oh no, are you okay?

704
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:00,210
Are you okay?

705
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:06,300
-There's a person.
-What?

706
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:12,306
Sir, are you okay?

707
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:15,142
Can't you see there's there's a red light?

708
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:18,312
Are you here to see Ae-ra?

709
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,648
Did you get a new car?

710
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:23,817
Where did you get the money?

711
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:27,487
-Do you know him?
-Well...

712
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:30,198
Are you okay?
Did I hit you hard?

713
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:33,160
I'm fine. I didn't get hurt. 

714
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,579
-You should get going...
-Stay down, call your insurance.

715
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,247
You were with him?

716
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:42,252
-We're like family. There's no need to--
-Shut up. 

717
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,130
Call the police and the insurance company.

718
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,341
Go to a hospital and get treated. 

719
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:52,346
Did you guys fight?

720
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:54,473
-You see...
-Sir.

721
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:57,476
Who is she? Is she your aunt?

722
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:59,978
-I'm not his aunt.
-She's the mother of his child.

723
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,191
The mother of this...

724
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:06,985
jerk's child.

725
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:08,904
What are you saying?

726
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:13,158
Oh, she's Moo-ki's mom.
Hello, ma'am. 

727
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:15,702
What a place to meet you. 

728
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:17,996
In this old lady's belly...

729
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,376
there's his baby. 

730
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:26,713
He used the money I gave him...

731
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:32,302
to eat in this old lady's restaurant. 

732
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,809
Eating meals...

733
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:42,145
and then they...

734
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:47,526
-I'm so...
-Speak properly!

735
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:54,366
They have a baby together.

736
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:00,539
-Sir, please be rational.
-Hey.

737
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:04,084
-Please, listen to me.
-You shameless jerk!

738
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,753
I'll kill you!

739
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,176
-Hey, let go!
-What are you doing?

740
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,886
Let go of Moo-ki!

741
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:19,224
If you touch him, I'll to kill you!

742
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:21,101
You should let go. 

743
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:24,271
-Let go!
-Please, wait! 

744
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,650
Did I get hurt?

745
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,117
Check your teeth if they're loose. 

746
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,037
They're fine. 

747
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,456
Did that lady play sports or something?

748
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:44,624
She is really strong. 

749
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:49,212
She made money making radish kimchi
with those arms. 

750
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:52,883
Why did you have to attack him first?

751
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,303
Idiot. Did you actually ever do Taekwondo?

752
00:50:56,803 --> 00:51:00,140
And then what? Roundhouse kick
a pregnant woman?

753
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,518
But seriously. 

754
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:06,813
Now, you get dumped
by someone still studying?

755
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:11,735
Tell everyone that I dumped him. 

756
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:16,364
What's wrong with you?
This is so frustrating. 

757
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:20,577
-Mind your own business.
-I'm doing just fine. 

758
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:22,412
Hey.

759
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,832
-What?
-Hye-ran.

760
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,336
She got divorced. 

761
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:38,637
Get your act together, okay?

762
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:40,764
I'll be watching you. 

763
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:09,209
Today really sucks. 

764
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,462
I told you to stop buying fakes.

765
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:16,174
There's lots of good quality,
affordable shoes out there.

766
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,263
Oh my God.

767
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:29,729
Stop crying!

768
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:32,858
Why are you kicking my shoes!

769
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:35,735
Oh my God.

770
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:43,118
-She had a brother?
-No, he's not her brother. 

771
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:46,955
-Then who is he?
-A 20-year-long boyfriend. 

772
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,541
No, just a friend. 

773
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:52,169
He lives across from her. 

774
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:54,421
She is very cunning. 

775
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:57,132
Just a friend?

776
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,427
I shouldn't have given her more money. 

777
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:02,220
What?

778
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,057
Anyways, Moo-ki...

779
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:10,145
That bag, was it a designer bag?

780
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:14,065
I have no money. 

781
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:17,777
It's fake.

782
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,243
You're so frugal. 

783
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,924
Oh no, it's scratched. 

784
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,345
Throw it away. 

785
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,972
Why are you holding onto something
from that jerk? 

786
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:49,601
-This one is real.
-What?

787
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:51,770
This bag is real. 

788
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,275
I'll get it fixed tomorrow.

789
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,320
So, you'll keep carrying something
that jerk gave you?

790
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,490
I'll fix it and sell it. 

791
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:05,575
I'll sell it and drink with you. 

792
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:07,953
My goodness. 

793
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:12,207
Are you an idiot or a psycho?

794
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:13,541
My goodness. 

795
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:18,880
Hey, follow me. 

796
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:22,634
Where are you going?

797
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,311
Choose.

798
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:37,732
Are you buying me a bag?

799
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,068
Just choose. 

800
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:51,037
Take this. This is the prettiest. 

801
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,000
That's brand new.
It's 22,000 Won. 

802
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:59,379
This is the most expensive bag here.

803
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:01,881
This is so much better than yours. 

804
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,217
You should use yours to hit people with.

805
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:06,886
Also, when you have to hit
someone like Moo-ki,

806
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:09,055
put a stone inside and smack him with it.

807
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:12,017
This won't break. 

808
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,023
-Hey, Dong-man.
-What?

809
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:22,777
I'll carry this bag until the day I die. 

810
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:25,864
Here you go. 

811
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,869
You don't have to carry it forever. 

812
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:34,706
Choose a pair of shoes, too.

813
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,962
Do you take credit card?

814
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:49,721
KO DONG-MAN

815
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:59,731
You have a good sense. 

816
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,951
-Are they comfortable?
-Yes.

817
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:14,871
This bag is really nice, too.

818
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:17,123
-It's sturdy, right?
-Yes.

819
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,501
It can fit five to six bottles of soju. 

820
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:24,547
Hey, that's not for alcohol.
That's not why I got it for you. 

821
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:30,220
I didn't know you could buy handbags
for women. 

822
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,182
You're so lame. 

823
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:37,185
Why do you giggle like that?

824
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:39,521
Yes, this is it. 

825
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:43,566
This is it. This is what I wanted earlier.

826
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,278
-This?
-Yes, this. 

827
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:50,156
This makes your heart flutter. 

828
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:54,994
Hey.

829
00:56:57,705 --> 00:56:59,207
Did this make your heart flutter?

830
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,168
What?

831
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:05,213
Why would my heart flutter?

832
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:10,927
Then why is your face so red?

833
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,639
It's like you were just welding something.

834
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:19,310
I don't know.
Why am I red?

835
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:24,691
You...

836
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:26,943
What?

837
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:32,365
You need to quit drinking. 

838
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:37,829
Right.

839
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:40,165
I should quit, right?

840
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:43,918
Is my heart failing?

841
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:04,814
At the National Sports Festival
held in Gangnam yesterday,

842
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:08,026
something more interesting
than the actual matches took place. 

843
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:11,696
We'll end the sports news
with our last video of the day. 

844
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:12,655
Hey!

845
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:15,116
Bo-ram, no one can stop her. 

846
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:18,369
You should just let go first. 

847
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:20,038
Stop it, Ae-ra!

848
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:22,207
-Hey!
-Hey!

849
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,501
Oh no, Ae-ra!

850
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:29,005
Hey, why did you scratch her?
That's cheating. 

851
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:30,340
Hey, Dong-man. 

852
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:31,466
Let me see. 

853
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:35,637
Why would you start a fight
when you can't even win?

854
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:37,263
We have to go see a doctor. 

855
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:38,431
Let's go. 

856
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:42,435
Hey, did you see that?

857
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,232
Didn't you serve in the army?

858
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:50,068
You don't want to do it?
Then quit! I won't stop you. 

859
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:52,487
How have you been, Ae-ra?

860
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,197
I heard you work at an information desk. 

861
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,741
It's fun, I like to talk in the mic. 

862
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:59,077
I also make announcements sometimes.

863
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,328
Ae-ra, please save me. 

864
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:03,039
Please show us you can party. 

865
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,374
Who is she?

866
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:06,834
Should we make an entire bet on her?

867
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:09,170
Take the bus back home later.

868
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:10,338
What's going on?

869
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:11,548
Can you pick me up?

870
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:12,882
Say that again!

871
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:15,927
I can't go by myself, so come. 

872
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:17,845
Hey!

873
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:21,182
