1
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:22,313
Ae-ra.

2
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,274
If I tell you not to do it...

3
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,235
Ae-ra!

4
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,072
What's wrong?

5
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,746
Dong-man... what's wrong?

6
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:41,374
What's wrong? What is it?

7
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,420
Why? Why?

8
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:49,841
Why are you talking like that?

9
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,594
What?

10
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,639
Why aren't you making any sound?

11
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,226
Why is nothing making any sound?

12
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:04,147
Why? Why?

13
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,274
Why is everything quiet? Why?

14
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,151
Why? Why!

15
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:15,116
The storm has passed
and the world shut down.

16
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,789
EPISODE 15

17
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,174
I wasn't expecting you.

18
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,760
Lie down.

19
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,179
Sorry?

20
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,014
I said to lie down.

21
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,227
Shouldn't we talk first?

22
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,604
You can't treat your own back.

23
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,251
Why did you do it?

24
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,046
Why...

25
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,511
Why did you...

26
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,976
You're being ridiculous right now.

27
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,831
It's okay with me...

28
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,500
if you date Chan-ho.

29
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,838
What?

30
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,050
I'll wait.

31
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,929
I wish you wouldn't go out with him,

32
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,433
but if you do...

33
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,853
I'll wait.

34
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,232
You can hurt me.

35
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,235
You can hurt me all you want, 

36
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,947
and I'll still wait for you.

37
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,077
Do I have to go out with Chan-ho
just to hurt you?

38
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,800
I will...

39
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,388
wait for you until I turn 50.

40
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,807
Do as you wish.

41
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,102
I'm not the old Baek Sul-hee anymore.

42
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,897
I won't fall for your lame tricks.

43
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,192
Sul-hee, why do you talk like Ae-ra?

44
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,694
Back in Joseon era, 

45
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:59,822
they branded people for cheating.

46
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:07,121
You stubbed your toe while moving
Ye-jin's packages,

47
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,458
and you burned your back
on the coal today.

48
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,212
You're being punished.

49
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,881
So I don't feel bad at all.

50
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,884
I'm just putting ointment on you.

51
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,595
Lie down.

52
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,597
What?

53
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,724
Lie down.

54
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:47,996
What happened?

55
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,456
Is he okay?

56
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,963
He has a concussion, which is why
he couldn't hear temporarily.

57
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,090
Based on the scans,

58
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:02,468
the damage isn't severe,
so he'll be fine soon.

59
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,558
Thank you.

60
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,102
The problem is...

61
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:15,440
there's a hairline fracture
in his temporal region...

62
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,736
To be honest,

63
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,531
I cried a little.

64
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,867
Just a little?

65
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,870
No, I cried a lot.

66
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,667
That flip phone is the only way
to show...

67
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,546
how the real Hwang Bok-hee's like was,

68
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,090
rather than the clown Hwang Bok-hee.

69
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,303
Keep it safe for now.

70
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,182
I thought...

71
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:55,271
you were a warrior who wasn't
fazed by anything, but...

72
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,106
But it turns out I'm a crybaby?

73
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:00,485
Not at all, you seem even cooler.

74
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,406
When I was young,

75
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,744
I was an assistant at Rose Photo Studio.

76
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,956
I just really liked being
in front of the camera.

77
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,875
I see.

78
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,504
When I met my husband,
I decided to give up. 

79
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,883
But the fire within me wouldn't go out.

80
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,096
I wanted to be in front of the camera

81
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,098
and be an actress.

82
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,768
So that's why you auditioned
for that movie.

83
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,854
I heard the competition was fierce.

84
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:42,527
In order to win, I had to hide.

85
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,614
Back then,

86
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,451
no one wanted an actress with a child.

87
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,664
That's when my life started to tangle up.

88
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,667
Come on, it wasn't completely tangled. 

89
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,627
You were the fairy in the posters
in my room.

90
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,629
The path I chose...

91
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,923
was a thorny one. 

92
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,902
Dong-man, it's time to eat.

93
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,697
Wake up.

94
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,974
Dong-man slept for days.

95
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:21,417
Eat up, your first lady, Choi.

96
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:16,556
Wearing a red hat

97
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:21,936
I'm a clown that always smiles

98
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:28,276
Behind the blue smile

99
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:33,823
Are the tears that no one sees

100
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,162
Am I really going to be on TV?

101
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:43,958
It's a MMA show,
so the audience pool is small.

102
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,919
But it's a famous show among fans. 

103
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,881
But why am I...

104
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:55,511
We've always had male hosts,
and they all seem the same after all.

105
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,221
Above all, 

106
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:01,475
I recommended you because I thought
you'd show some innovation.

107
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,979
The production director saw your video,
and approved you right away.

108
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,182
It's a bit pricey...

109
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,685
to sell on a home shopping show, 

110
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:48,230
so we could throw in sauces
to make it a package.

111
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,401
Mr. Kim, would you like the claws
and guts separately?

112
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:53,819
Yes.

113
00:10:55,655 --> 00:11:00,576
Anyhow, we should give customers
more options to make a strategic approach.

114
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:03,996
What strategy?

115
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,004
Mr. Kim, are you okay?

116
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:15,966
Are you crying?

117
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,095
It's my first pay.

118
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:23,349
I wanted to treat you something nice,
so I looked all over Cheongdam-dong.

119
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,142
-Joo-man.
-What should we get?

120
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,645
Cheese, chili?

121
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,232
I heard from somewhere that...

122
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:37,071
steamed cockroaches
taste the same as lobsters.

123
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:38,948
What?

124
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,157
You know...

125
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,703
It's kind of gross that I can't eat it.
Let's go some place else.

126
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,665
You're worried about the price, right?

127
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,291
I mean...

128
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,378
Isn't 57,000 won too much?

129
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,004
It's just an insect from the sea.

130
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,633
Sul-hee, can't we just enjoy our time?

131
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,051
Please?

132
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,554
Sure, go ahead and order.

133
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:08,519
Here.

134
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,859
Why are you giving me the whole thing?

135
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,987
-Are you going to eat fries only?
-What?

136
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,990
Whenever you do this, 

137
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,618
I get kind of emotional.

138
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,581
Joo-man, what's wrong?
Why is your nose flaring again?

139
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:32,209
Why are you making me look like a bad guy?

140
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,838
Don't do that. It's upsetting me.

141
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,632
Fine, I'll eat the tail.

142
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,304
Forget it, just...

143
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,118
Stop this.

144
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,995
You should stop now.

145
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,333
Sul-hee, I cried at work today
and made myself a fool.

146
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,835
I know, everyone at the office knows.

147
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,963
Chan-ho knows we used to date now.

148
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,175
-That's a good thing...
-What?

149
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:26,639
We dated for six years and we only had
two bad months. The rest was really good.

150
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,224
Can you forget all of that?

151
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,726
I miss the six years we dated,

152
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,270
but because of the last two months...

153
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,105
I don't want to go back.

154
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,066
Seeing you change...

155
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,903
I can't do it again.

156
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,783
You changed, too.

157
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,454
Why are you acting as if you didn't?

158
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,456
How did I change?

159
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,251
You were never worried about anything
and you were naive.

160
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,545
You were just a pure white puppy.

161
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,338
Why are you talking about a puppy?

162
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:03,259
After you met me, you matured,
started becoming conscious of yourself.

163
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,512
Whenever you did that, I blamed myself,

164
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,138
and it was painful for me, too.

165
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,392
Sure, I changed and you did, too.

166
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,769
-So...
-I don't want to.

167
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,939
-I can't break up with you.
-What?

168
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,608
You said you don't have regrets
because you tried your best.

169
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,027
I'm going to try everything I can, too,
so I won't regret.

170
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:23,946
I'm going to cling on.

171
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,074
So take this.

172
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,498
I love you so much,

173
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,125
and I won't marry anybody else.

174
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,919
And I need to put some ointment today too,

175
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,796
so come up right away.

176
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,757
If I get infected, I'll die.

177
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:52,725
Hello.

178
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,101
Thank you.

179
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:58,022
Before we start the broadcast,
we'll conduct a short interview first.

180
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,023
Okay.

181
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,236
Here's the first question.

182
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,947
I heard your shoulder injury
is pretty serious.

183
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,284
Aren't you afraid to go back in the ring?

184
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,328
I'm lucky my injury is not too bad.

185
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,954
Lucky?

186
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:17,207
If I think about Sam Vasquez
and Gary Goodridge,

187
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,126
it can get scary.

188
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,672
What happened to them?

189
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:43,484
I'm putting porridge in the fridge,

190
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,653
so eat when you get up.

191
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,821
Don't lie around and not eat anything--

192
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,160
Hey.

193
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,539
Why are you yelling at me?

194
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,090
Can you hear me?

195
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,928
-Can you hear everything now?
-Yes, I can.

196
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,140
I heard you being noisy since you came in.

197
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,145
You're such a pain!

198
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,321
I was really scared.

199
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,909
I really was.

200
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,842
Excuse me, what brings you here?

201
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,386
Excuse me?

202
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,765
You can't come in here.

203
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,944
How have you been?

204
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,535
You look well.

205
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,580
I tried looking for you everywhere.

206
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,765
Do you know how scary it is to not be
able to hear for merely five minutes?

207
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,477
It's like the world has been turned off.

208
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:46,231
It feels like you're
at the bottom of the ocean.

209
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,068
I couldn't even breathe.

210
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,197
You can hear me no problem, right?

211
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,200
-There's no ringing, right?
-I'm good.

212
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,036
Have some.

213
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,038
It's good. Why aren't you eating?

214
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,964
Why are you so calm?

215
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,466
Dong-man.

216
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,095
You can really hear me well, right?

217
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,555
Yes, I told you.

218
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:23,352
Then, you don't need
a complete rest, right?

219
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,062
What?

220
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,106
Then...

221
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,150
listen to me carefully.

222
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:31,777
What is it?

223
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,487
You have...

224
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,074
a fracture somewhere in your skull.

225
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,039
The problem is...

226
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,667
the hairline fracture
in his temporal region.

227
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,044
A fracture?

228
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:53,132
With fractures in temporal region,
they heal without any treatment.

229
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,593
However...

230
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,388
the fracture is near the ear cochlea.

231
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:03,642
If he receives more impact
in the same region...

232
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,728
So if you receive more impact,

233
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,398
you might not be able to hear forever.

234
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:15,237
You'll get trapped in that ocean forever.

235
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:23,662
What nonsense is this?
I can hear just fine now.

236
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,497
So the conclusion is...

237
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,792
you can't fight anymore.

238
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,085
I won't let you.

239
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,132
Okay.

240
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:39,761
I'll meet the doctor first
and hear from him--

241
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:44,433
MMA fighter Sam Vasquez died of severe
brain injury within six weeks.

242
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,854
Gary Goodridge got Chronic Traumatic
Encephalopathy in his 40s.

243
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,939
Those are the extreme cases.

244
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,151
During a fight, injuries occur often.

245
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,319
They occur often?

246
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,406
Why do I have to watch you get injured
so often?

247
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:06,705
Ae-ra.

248
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,376
If I was going to quit this fast, 

249
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,712
I wouldn't have started again
after ten years.

250
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,091
Fine, do as you like.

251
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,762
If you decide you fight again,

252
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:23,889
that's the end for us.

253
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,317
It's been over 20 years.

254
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:41,782
I still can't...

255
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,744
forgive you.

256
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,376
You kneeling down...

257
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,005
won't bring back the years
I spent in silence.

258
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,466
But still...

259
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,595
stay like that a while longer.

260
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,140
I'd like to...

261
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,560
watch a bit longer.

262
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,776
Director.

263
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:21,446
We already aired the preview. It's done.

264
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,615
We can't pull off a show.

265
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,118
You should know better than this.

266
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,078
You're making me feel uncomfortable.

267
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,164
Director.

268
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,251
-Stop it.
-Help me out.

269
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:42,092
This show can't go on TV.

270
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:48,849
Stop, stop.

271
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,518
Look for Dong-man on VCR 3.

272
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,936
Hang on.

273
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,688
Are you sure...

274
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,191
-we can air this?
-Yes.

275
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,580
Is this for show?

276
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,337
I guess you can find out
by returning to the ring.

277
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:23,467
You can't threaten me with this,
just because I love you.

278
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:24,760
I can't choose one.

279
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:29,598
I'll protect you even if it means
playing unfair.

280
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,434
Fight again and we're over.

281
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,269
We can't even be friends.

282
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,855
We'll never meet again forever.

283
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,077
Yes, Dad.

284
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,079
On TV?

285
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,747
I'm on TV?

286
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:55,832
What preview?

287
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,421
Show her the footage first.

288
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:06,385
The show airs in an hour.
There's no time for another inspection.

289
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,428
Who is she?

290
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,139
Producer Jung Kyung-koo.

291
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,851
Did the person you filmed
agree to this broadcast?

292
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:15,936
Excuse me?

293
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,813
From what I heard,

294
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:24,277
you and Ko Dong-man once met
as a suspect and victim.

295
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,948
Are you allowed to use a program
to get a revenge?

296
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,992
It was all in the past.

297
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,078
Who are you anyway?

298
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,874
Me? I represent Ko Dong-man.

299
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:39,626
What?

300
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:52,931
It's quite cheap.

301
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:02,190
MACKEREL

302
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:08,405
EFFECT OF MACKEREL.

303
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,837
Where did he go?

304
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,631
Did he go to the gym?

305
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,681
She must be upstairs.

306
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:38,977
What is she dragging around?

307
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,655
Is she hanging herself?

308
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:56,411
Oh, no.

309
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,831
She can't kill herself in the flat
above mine.

310
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,563
You can't barge in like this.

311
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:27,275
You barge into my place and Dong-man's.
Can't I...

312
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:33,990
What's that chair for?

313
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,326
Why is it over there?

314
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:41,414
Die 60 years later quietly
at some other place.

315
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:44,042
-Why in the flat above...
-Why would I die?

316
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,460
What's that then?

317
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,214
I was changing the bathroom light bulb.

318
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,343
The light bulb?

319
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,139
UNPAID BILLS

320
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,104
Do you think you won?

321
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:09,651
Gossips say you got a fortune in alimony.

322
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,070
Why would I take their money?

323
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,449
Like people say, I'm a spoiled brat.

324
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,744
Do you think I'd leave with a fortune?

325
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:24,124
I told them clearly
that I didn't want a cent,

326
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,001
and walked out with my own feet.

327
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:33,008
Is that why you're renting a place
for 300,000 won a month?

328
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,427
I asked if you think you've won.

329
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:39,764
No one knows better than you
what I mean to Dong-man.

330
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,476
He will take me back.

331
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,146
I won't lose him to you.

332
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,608
Knowing each other for so long...

333
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,861
is only good for friendship and loyalty.

334
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,159
To her, this was...

335
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,245
Don't think that you won.

336
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,789
...the only way to preserve her pride.

337
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:13,965
What are you doing?

338
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:18,345
You've been struggling with this
for a week now.

339
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,977
What's this noise?

340
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,482
What? Come and hold the chair.

341
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,416
Don't air the show.

342
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,335
I refused to interview.

343
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,045
It'll air soon.

344
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,215
-Pull it.
-No.

345
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:59,386
Ae-ra's right.

346
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,681
People never do change.

347
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,391
I told Ae-ra something, too.

348
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,893
I told her I'm not the old Jang Kyung-koo.

349
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,564
That I'm not as lame and sloppy.

350
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,580
What are you doing outside my place?

351
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:32,752
What's in there?

352
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:35,463
You mentioned in your messenger profile...

353
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,382
that you wanted strawberries.

354
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,552
Do you think I asked you to buy me?

355
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:44,222
You confessed to me a day after
dumping Chan-sook,

356
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:47,225
got me pulled from the pungmul band,
and you're constantly texted me.

357
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,519
You're telling people we're dating.

358
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,730
That's what I want.

359
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,523
Does that even make sense?

360
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:56,651
Why should I become an outcast
because of you?

361
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,862
If no one likes you,

362
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,072
maybe you'll date me.

363
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,243
What kind of stupid logic is that?

364
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,203
Don't come here again.

365
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,085
Why are you here?

366
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,505
I'm out on my 100-day holiday.

367
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,674
I have 546 more days to serve.

368
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,552
If you bother her again, I might desert.

369
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,430
Then, I'll bring a K2 rifle with me.

370
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,056
I'm warning you.

371
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,393
Don't bother Ae-ra again, okay?

372
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:33,271
Did you want to get back at me that badly?

373
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,107
Or do you still want Ae-ra back?

374
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,026
Just watch the show. It'll air soon.

375
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:41,529
I bet you made up a story to paint me
like a fool.

376
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,240
Without a story,

377
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,493
will anyone care for an unknown fighter?

378
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,328
What?

379
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:51,539
The story and malicious editing
was strategical.

380
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,834
I caught the deliberate headbutt.

381
00:29:57,253 --> 00:30:00,173
-What?
-I tried my best to make you look good.

382
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,549
Watch it yourself.

383
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:06,095
From my point of view,

384
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,099
it was an intentional outburst.

385
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:14,270
It looks like he purposely induced
a no contest.

386
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,689
This is such a malicious editing!

387
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,483
The director...

388
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,612
was determined to create
fiction with fact.

389
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:26,074
He replayed the headbutt in slow motion
and inserted an expert's interview.

390
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,700
It's a total mess.

391
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:33,331
Our people are unable to deal
with the media backlash.

392
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:36,334
Didn't you know they were
filming Dong-man?

393
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:39,546
Tak-su, you shouldn't get all agitated.

394
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:43,633
Even if it's a light concussion,
you need to relax and keep calm.

395
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:45,134
Let me make this clear.

396
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:48,638
I won't fight
against that monster again, okay?

397
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,849
Get the media to stop talking.

398
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,811
Makes sure talks about rematches
don't start.

399
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,694
WE ROOT FOR DONG-MAN,
THE RISING STAR

400
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:06,072
What is this?

401
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,367
Why... Why is it so...

402
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:10,660
Good?

403
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,787
Are you touched?

404
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,416
Did you cry?

405
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,879
No, is my face...

406
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,090
Did you photoshop my face?
What did you do?

407
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,054
What have you done?

408
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:35,101
Why are you slapping your husband's back?

409
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:38,271
If you knew he would get hurt like that,
you should've stopped him.

410
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,189
Why did you support him?

411
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:43,401
-That is a sport.
-My goodness.

412
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:45,069
He's in a cage.

413
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,989
How can I watch him bleed?

414
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,243
Dad.

415
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:53,953
Yes?

416
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,000
Dong-hee, do you want something?

417
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:04,130
-I want to go see Dong-man.
-What?

418
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,007
I have something to give to him.

419
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,093
This is our newest menu.

420
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,429
-Then we'll have that.
-Okay.

421
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:20,104
My wife used to be an idol trainee.

422
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,648
She's really beautiful.

423
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,733
Our daughter is prettier
since she takes after her.

424
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,319
-People say she's like a fairy.
-A fairy?

425
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,488
See? You got it all wrong.

426
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:31,699
Why did you have to come and find Ae-ra
and chase her around?

427
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,205
My daughter is really cute, right?

428
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,207
But, not too long ago...

429
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,459
she got bullied at school.

430
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:45,505
One boy called Choi Ji-ho started it.

431
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:46,881
It turns out...

432
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,885
he thought if no one liked my daughter,

433
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,514
she'd only play with him.

434
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:59,435
If no one likes you, maybe you'll date me.

435
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,521
That really woke me up.

436
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:06,067
It's karma. I realized what I did
is coming back to my daughter.

437
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:10,405
That's why I came looking for you guys.
To get rid of my karma.

438
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:14,993
Have you been going to church
or something?

439
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,625
You shouldn't make food
and deliver them to men.

440
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,711
Hello.

441
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,215
You don't look like the housewife type.

442
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,593
You're so nosy.

443
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,555
Are you having instant ramen again?

444
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,182
You're so nosy.

445
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,271
Why are you coming up?

446
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,189
To eat with you.

447
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:47,525
-You and me?
-Yes.

448
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:48,609
Why?

449
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,696
We both don't have anyone
to eat with right now.

450
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,089
It took me 20 years
and I couldn't fix him.

451
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,092
But I guess Sul-hee fixed his rhinitis.

452
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:18,848
Mother.

453
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,391
Hey.

454
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,685
Why aren't you at work?

455
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,063
I took a half day.

456
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,065
I had packages to mail out.

457
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:28,232
I see.

458
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,818
By the way,

459
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,488
why did you two break up?

460
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,326
Is it because of me?

461
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:41,454
Or was it because of his sisters?

462
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:44,415
No, it's not like that.

463
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:45,875
Then, what is it?

464
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,253
It just happened...

465
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,254
Sul-hee.

466
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,548
Don't lie to me and tell me the truth.

467
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:58,012
Did Joo-man cheat on you?

468
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,434
That scumbag.

469
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:08,481
You can't really say that he cheated.

470
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:12,985
Actually,

471
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,822
when Joo-man's dad was alive,

472
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,950
he had two more women aside from me.

473
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,705
I fell ill twice because of it.

474
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,500
You shouldn't live like me.

475
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:30,128
You don't deserve to suffer that way.

476
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:33,172
I didn't know.

477
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:37,385
A mother can be sly.

478
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,388
If your child is precious...

479
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,474
you should know other children are, too.

480
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:47,103
But, I can't help but think my son
deserves better.

481
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:51,816
He was always so protective of you.

482
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,696
I guess I was jealous.

483
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:01,409
I think I was lonely.

484
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:05,705
It was fine. I'm fine now.

485
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,584
Still,

486
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,587
if you two get back together,

487
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:16,090
I won't ever visit your house.

488
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,134
Pardon?

489
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,803
You don't have to come
to any family events.

490
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:24,849
I won't let his sisters
ever call you again.

491
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,685
I swear it on my name.

492
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,273
I'm sorry, Mother.

493
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:38,070
You're right. I'm a fool.

494
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,865
I didn't want to lose you.

495
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,534
I was being silly.

496
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,502
Mother.

497
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,259
I'm really sorry.

498
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:03,387
I'm sorry that we didn't last in the end.

499
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,602
Even if I don't see you again,
please take care, okay?

500
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:22,657
I'll visit your place to meet the idol
and the fairy one day.

501
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,993
Right, do you know Hwang Bok-hee?

502
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,579
-Who?
-Hwang Bok-hee.

503
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:30,331
That Hwang Bok-hee.

504
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,088
What's this?

505
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,924
It is a soup or a stew?

506
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,467
It's mackerel stew.

507
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,178
My parents own a fish stew restaurant.

508
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,098
Why would anyone make such stew...

509
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,559
My dad is really bad at fishing.

510
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,436
What?

511
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,355
He used to be a fisherman.

512
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,607
But he could never catch
the expensive fish.

513
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,526
He'd always get some Pacific saury
or mackerel.

514
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:02,530
We had a big family because we lived
with grandparents,

515
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,115
but there was only one mackerel.

516
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:08,536
So my mom got mad,
so she put it in water and boiled it.

517
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,878
But my dad...

518
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,047
liked it.

519
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,135
That's why we opened a restaurant,
but the business isn't good.

520
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:27,805
Unit 101,

521
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,558
are you normally that talkative
while eating?

522
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,143
Pardon?

523
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:35,479
I'm starting to get a headache.

524
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,149
What about you? Do you only eat?

525
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,819
-You should have conversations--
-I get indigestion if someone talks.

526
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:43,821
So just...

527
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,240
take your food and go to your room.

528
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,825
Gosh.

529
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,661
Then you can eat it by yourself.

530
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,496
I'll come back for the pot later.

531
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:54,415
Eat it.

532
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:07,136
No wonder you don't have anyone
to eat with.

533
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,639
-Hurry up.
-Rock, paper, scissors!

534
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,893
Blue sky, milky way...

535
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,521
Green light, red light.

536
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,106
Green light...

537
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,360
Do you call yourselves humans?

538
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,656
What brings you here?

539
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,825
How can you do this?

540
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,244
Why would you do this to the kids?

541
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,123
Am I an adult movie actress?

542
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:21,127
You killed me with a few lines you wrote,

543
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,465
and now you made it impossible
for me to be a mom.

544
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,013
Director, please.

545
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:37,351
The preview is already out.

546
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,395
We can't pull off the show.

547
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,856
You should know better than this.

548
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,816
Don't make me feel uncomfortable.

549
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:46,819
Director...

550
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,947
-Stop this.
-Please help me out.

551
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,074
This show...

552
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,326
can't air.

553
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:59,039
My baby understands everything now.

554
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,042
What did my child do wrong?

555
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:07,631
My Ae-ra... Please leave Ae-ra alone.

556
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:11,635
You can't tell a child
that her mom is an adult movie star. 

557
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,724
That's too cruel.

558
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,827
If my parents find out you're here,

559
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,080
they'll freak out again.

560
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,417
Obba.

561
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,463
I couldn't even raise my baby...

562
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:51,300
for taking clothes off in a movie. 

563
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:53,844
Bok-hee.

564
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,181
I'm going to Japan tomorrow.

565
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:02,144
Can't I sing to my baby just once?

566
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:17,868
Wearing a red hat

567
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:24,583
I'm a clown that always smiles

568
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:32,925
Behind the blue smiles

569
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:40,266
Are tears that no one sees

570
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,146
Dwarf Flower?

571
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,085
Dong-man.

572
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,547
You'll give this to me? When?

573
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:13,757
Dong-man.

574
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:16,427
As always...

575
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:21,599
protect Ae-ra.

576
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,560
Protect her for me, okay?

577
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:31,942
Caramel.

578
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:36,196
The caramel lady.

579
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,956
Why do you keep going to my place?

580
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,628
-I wanted to eat with Ms. Hwang.
-Why?

581
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:54,089
-What?
-Why do you care so much about my mom?

582
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,966
Why are you pretending to be nice?

583
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,719
I'm not pretending to be nice.
I was just eating with her.

584
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:02,890
I tend to believe people are
inclined to be evil.

585
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:07,019
Whenever I see you, I want to test you...

586
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,063
to see if you're really nice, 

587
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,650
and if you really are that naive.

588
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:14,943
Look.

589
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,946
People are all the same
when it comes down to it.

590
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,074
Everyone is weak and insecure.

591
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:24,328
Being so prickly...
It's like you're going through puberty.

592
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:28,957
Are you going through a puberty?

593
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:32,961
Why did you get a tattoo on your arm?

594
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:36,757
-Get it removed!
-What's wrong with you? Why hit me?

595
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,761
You're a brat, yet there's no one
to smack you.

596
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:44,306
That'd be the saddest thing in your life.

597
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:48,102
I won't let Kim Nam-il become
that pathetic.

598
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:53,232
Now, Kim Nam-il is Hwang Bok-hee's
kind and nice son.

599
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:57,611
If spankings are medicine, I'll hit you.
Got it?

600
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,156
Spankings are medicine for punks
like him.

601
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:19,717
So...

602
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,136
Why Nam-il?

603
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:24,847
She's a girl.

604
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,270
Are you that sad because of her?

605
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,107
Have you ever been that sad
because of me?

606
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:42,197
I'm tired right now.

607
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,325
When your business failed, 

608
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,912
and when you cried alone and got cancer...

609
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,792
who was by your side?

610
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,378
Was Ae-ra there?

611
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,132
Nam-il.

612
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:02,468
Let's go to...

613
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:06,764
Japan together with me, Mom.

614
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,442
Why is Dong-hee suddenly coming?

615
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,746
-Hi.
-Sorry, we're late.

616
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:35,667
Dong-hee.

617
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:55,187
-Can I get this mailed out?
-Sure.

618
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:58,899
Please write down the recipient's address.

619
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,404
You're wearing the new sneakers.

620
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,660
Didn't you come to see me?

621
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,162
Why won't you look at me?

622
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,915
You still don't want to talk to me?

623
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,253
Do you want me to show you the gym?

624
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,551
Don't lose anymore.

625
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:30,097
Dong-hee.

626
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,600
You'll talk to me now?

627
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:37,771
Why did you make me feel bad
for ten years?

628
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,526
You were mean.

629
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,493
I told you, it wasn't because of you.

630
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,497
What's this?

631
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,626
I'm your...

632
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,379
fan girl.

633
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:11,346
It took me ten years to make
this scrapbook.

634
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:28,405
So don't lose anymore.

635
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,658
I hate seeing you unable to get up...

636
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,870
more than being unable to get up myself.

637
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,165
Don't ever lose again.

638
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:48,008
This is where athlete Ko Dong-man trains.

639
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:54,556
I don't get it. What's going on?

640
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:58,477
You have four interviews, 

641
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,939
a magazine shoot,
a water park poster shoot...

642
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,358
-A water park?
-Yes.

643
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,860
But you need to take off your shirt.

644
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,446
You have an offer
for a TV commercial, too.

645
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:11,198
-A commercial?
-Yes.

646
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,326
The effect of going on TV is really huge.

647
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:18,997
Look. He's an assistant director at RFC.

648
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:24,044
The CEO told him to get you to confirm
a rematch with Kim Tak-su.

649
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:27,381
-Why?
-They want a fair fight.

650
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:32,386
But you know, I may not be able
to continue MMA fighting.

651
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:37,891
It's scary after an injury
like that, right?

652
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,228
They say skull fractures heal
on their own.

653
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,397
It's a common injury for fighters, too.

654
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,024
Once a baseball player gets
hit in the face,

655
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:48,694
it's hard for them to get back
in the batter's box.

656
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:50,988
Trauma's are tough.

657
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:53,407
It's not because of the trauma.

658
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:55,200
If I keep doing this, 

659
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:57,911
I have to give up something huge.

660
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,013
Ma'am.

661
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,434
What brings you here at this hour?

662
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,103
Ma'am.

663
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,619
I saw the article.

664
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,416
I see you made up your mind.

665
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,378
I was afraid.

666
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:51,339
It was the first time I couldn't hear.

667
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,550
I was terrified.

668
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:55,469
The trauma of the injury...

669
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:58,263
What scared me most
when I couldn't hear was...

670
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:01,141
that I may never...

671
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:04,019
stand in the ring again.

672
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:05,979
That scared me the most.

673
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,898
Then will you fight again?

674
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,156
Yes.

675
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:22,412
I request a rematch with Kim Tak-su.

676
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,212
That's one way of getting dumped.

677
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,096
Ae-ra.

678
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,349
Must we?

679
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,478
I...

680
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,065
can't let you go.

681
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:55,779
Dong-man.

682
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,282
When you couldn't hear,

683
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,827
I pulled all sorts of tricks.

684
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:08,083
I never went to church school,
but I went to an early prayer service.

685
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,920
If this wish was granted, 

686
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:14,089
I swore I'll be good from now on.

687
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:17,134
I begged and pleaded.

688
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:20,929
-For me to get better?
-No.

689
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:25,684
I begged that you'd quit MMA fighting.

690
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:34,317
Whenever my dad went out to the sea, 

691
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:38,738
my grandmother would pray
with her rosary all day and night.

692
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:42,659
Later on, she got dementia
and forgot his name,

693
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,748
but whenever it was windy,
she asked for her rosary.

694
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:53,086
Grandmother was trapped there
all her life.

695
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:58,466
She said whenever my dad goes
out to the sea...

696
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:02,971
she'd feel anxious and suffocated.

697
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:07,309
I don't think I can live like that.

698
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,729
I couldn't even survive that one week.

699
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:12,689
I'm scared, too.

700
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,360
I'm scared that I'll lose
my hearing again.

701
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,863
I'm scared of getting hit and injured.

702
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:20,906
But...

703
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,868
what frightens me more is...

704
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:28,830
going back.

705
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,501
If I'm told that this was all a dream, 

706
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:35,754
and I need to go back
to exterminating ticks,

707
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:38,089
delivering packages,
and moving boxes, then I...

708
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:39,925
I won't...

709
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:43,970
I won't be able to survive a single day.

710
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:48,350
I don't want to be an extra again.

711
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:53,563
I don't want to live without a dream
like a fool.

712
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:57,275
To be honest...

713
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,906
I knew you couldn't stop.

714
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,331
This isn't...

715
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,668
just my dream anymore.

716
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:19,297
It's also my dad's, Dong-hee's
and Coach's dream.

717
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,508
Ae-ra.

718
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:27,555
-If you trust me...
-I guess this means...

719
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,517
we can't even be friends, right?

720
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:47,784
No.

721
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:50,370
I can't be.

722
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:56,710
I didn't hide myself, 

723
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:58,753
beat around the bush,

724
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:03,550
nor plan to break up with you.

725
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:13,101
I can't be just friends with you again.

726
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:19,399
Okay.

727
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:23,361
I'll go.

728
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:26,906
Ae-ra.

729
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:33,913
Ae-ra.

730
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:36,624
Ae-ra...

731
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,424
Do you really have to do this?

732
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:48,553
Can't you just stay by my side?

733
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:57,103
I can't bear to watch.

734
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:02,734
It's too hard.

735
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,530
It's really hard.

736
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:13,578
I wish...

737
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:17,415
I really wish, 

738
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,878
we had never started this.

739
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,943
What brings you here at this hour?

740
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:28,945
Ma'am.

741
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,367
Please protect Ae-ra...

742
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,121
from now on.

743
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:42,375
I don't think...

744
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,838
I can protect her anymore.

745
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,506
Dong-man.

746
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,261
I never told you,

747
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:55,388
but I'm...

748
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:58,850
very thankful to you.

749
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:01,895
There's no need.

750
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:05,231
Come to think of it, 

751
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:11,613
it wasn't because of the caramel
you gave me.

752
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:17,744
I think it was always Ae-ra for me...

753
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:23,458
from the beginning.

754
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:58,660
