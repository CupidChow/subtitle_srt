1
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:22,814
I told you to stay out of it.

2
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,524
I told you you'd regret it!

3
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,695
If you didn't get into trouble,
why would I care?

4
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,407
It's because you always get hit and cry--

5
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,534
You make my heart flutter.

6
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:36,828
What?

7
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,621
My heart flutters.

8
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,043
Every time you do that...

9
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:46,212
my heart starts to flutter.

10
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,051
My heart flutters.

11
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,679
Something's wrong with me.

12
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,065
That's why you better watch out.

13
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,026
I'm not cool and sophisticated either.

14
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,489
I'm like a dog.

15
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,075
Once I bite, I will never let go.

16
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,748
What do you mean you'll never let go?

17
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,084
I'm just about to bite you.

18
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,419
I've declared a state of emergency.

19
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,714
I might even shoot a nuclear bomb at you.

20
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,343
That's why we should be careful.

21
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,615
Wear them. You need them to drive.

22
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,795
Let's go.

23
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,381
Let's go.

24
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:15,885
Come on, get on.

25
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,226
Hey.

26
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,437
That's uncomfortable. What are you doing?

27
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,151
So you can focus on driving.

28
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,236
You're worried for nothing.

29
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,113
Shut up.

30
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:41,536
Our back nerves aren't that sensitive.

31
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,083
Let's go.

32
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,044
Hold tight.

33
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,854
Sul-hee, I'm really sorry.

34
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,772
But it was really short.

35
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,941
I wasn't even like this.

36
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,652
Why are you reenacting it?

37
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,615
I was caught off guard,
she kissed me out of blue.

38
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:23,745
It's not like I can slap a woman
or sue her either.

39
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:24,829
So?

40
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,623
How was it?

41
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:27,874
What?

42
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,626
It wasn't bad, right?

43
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,586
It was just...

44
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,632
It felt like a slug was stuck on my lip.

45
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,302
You're so creative and detailed.

46
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,471
What? A slug?

47
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,307
That's not what I meant.

48
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,975
So, you're saying...

49
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:50,146
you weren't excited at all
when she kissed you?

50
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,899
Of course not. It's not like that.

51
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,777
Then I'll handle the slug.

52
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,531
What are you going to do?

53
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:02,867
Sul-hee!

54
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,670
My heart flutters.

55
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,714
Every time you do that...

56
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,217
my heart starts to flutter.

57
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,936
I was thinking...

58
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,481
if you don't have any plans
the day after tomorrow...

59
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,651
What? Did you want to do something?

60
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,072
Do you want to come and watch my match?

61
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,865
It's at the Dongchook gym at 4 p.m.

62
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,161
You're going to fight again?

63
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,580
You were beaten up like crazy
and you still...

64
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,045
It's okay, just be yourself.

65
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:07,932
Wow, there are so many stars today.

66
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,560
Where?

67
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,479
There. Is that the big digger?

68
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,108
It's big dipper.

69
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,737
Hey, do you want to...

70
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,573
for a drink at Namil Bar tonight?

71
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,241
Sure.

72
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,329
Really? You sure?

73
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,749
Yes, sure.

74
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,379
What are you guys doing?

75
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,465
I'm glad you guys are here.

76
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,759
The Fantastic Four,
let's go to Namil Bar.

77
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,511
I won't go if Joo-man goes.

78
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,096
You guys go ahead.

79
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,433
Gosh, what's wrong this time?

80
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,019
Then the three of us can drink.

81
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,022
Didn't you two already have a drink?

82
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,440
Ae-ra looks flushed.

83
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,403
-Why are your ears so red?
-Are you color blind?

84
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,990
My ears aren't red. It's just hot.

85
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:10,286
-Why are you yelling?
-Enough with the chat and let's go.

86
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,205
Let's open up the plum wine.

87
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:15,124
No, I'm going in. You two go ahead.

88
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,418
Just us two?

89
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,838
You guys always drink together.
What's wrong?

90
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,049
I'm going.

91
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,774
Anyway, that...

92
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,152
Park Moo-bin.

93
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,157
I'll take care of him.

94
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,576
How? Are you going to beat him?

95
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:55,039
I'm not a gangster.
Why would I beat a person?

96
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,209
I have a strategy, that's all.

97
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,930
He's not someone you can handle.

98
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,349
Why do you always date such thugs?

99
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,436
-When did I?
-During middle school.

100
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:21,023
A guy borrowed your phone
and changed schools the next day.

101
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,776
-Park Doo-young.
-How do you remember his name?

102
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,445
He was your first love.

103
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,196
He wasn't my first love.

104
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,158
In college, you dated Sang-mo
from the pungmul group.

105
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,618
I didn't go out with him.

106
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,620
The last one you supported
for two years.

107
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,457
And he dumped you for another woman.

108
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,041
That's enough.

109
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,669
Now, Park Moo-bin's been added
to your list.

110
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,130
Do you collect thugs?
Is it your hobby?

111
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,968
You forgot the most important one
from my list of defected men.

112
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,595
My real true love.

113
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,475
-The wrist guy?
-Yes.

114
00:07:55,975 --> 00:08:00,313
Thanks to him, my wrist still aches
when it rains.

115
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:04,817
Where did you find such a jerk?
How is he your first love?

116
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,449
TRADITIONAL BAR AT COLLEGE TOWN, 2011

117
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,075
That's enough.

118
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:15,828
Hey.

119
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,917
-You'll forget once you go to the army.
-They still sell Fin.K.L bread there.

120
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,252
When things get difficult,

121
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:27,590
men miss their girlfriend more than ever.

122
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:28,925
Is she your girlfriend?

123
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,969
You guys broke up ages ago.

124
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,973
Take this off, too.

125
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,142
Come on.

126
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,820
Hangover porridge before the army.
I'll be waiting for you.

127
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,406
From your first lady, Choi.

128
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:57,870
She scared me!

129
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,540
Is she a homeless or what?

130
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,351
He must be sleeping.

131
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,690
He might as well. It's going to be
the last time for him to sleep in.

132
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,508
What a witch.

133
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,804
She's still pretty with smudged mascara.

134
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:16,991
Are you okay?

135
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,494
I'll be waiting outside.
Let's sober up together.

136
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,221
Dong-man.

137
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:47,063
Did you really wait for me all night long?

138
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,196
I forgot to give him kimchi.

139
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,367
Did she leave?

140
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,627
What's this?

141
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,047
Is there a mouse here or something?

142
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,268
What was that?

143
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,731
Hey! Darn it.

144
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,025
Are you all right?

145
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,153
Oh, that really hurts.

146
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:37,905
Are you still drunk?

147
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,574
Aren't you leaving?
Or do you prefer prison?

148
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,869
Are you going somewhere?

149
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:45,830
What?

150
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,138
Do you have to go?

151
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,307
I can't live without you.

152
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,519
She's acting like she'd wait for me.

153
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,188
Two years will fly by.

154
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,400
Why is she holding my porridge?

155
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,195
Seriously.

156
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:21,198
I said I'd give you my leftover rice.
Why did you have to come?

157
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,869
Why did you bring that out?

158
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,371
Did I ask for your rice?

159
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,791
Why did you bring kimchi
and fall down on the stairs?

160
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,003
Let me see.

161
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,963
Does it hurt a lot?

162
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,218
Forget it.

163
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,095
What?

164
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,222
Are you crying?

165
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,894
Are you a kid?
Are you crying because you fell?

166
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:56,567
Hey, I told you.
You look ugly when you cry.

167
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:00,905
Do you get discharged
on September 5, 2012?

168
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,991
You're really coming out then, right?

169
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,583
Stay out of trouble, okay?

170
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,929
How do you hurt your wrist
by liking someone?

171
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,555
Did you beat him up?

172
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,766
Did he deserve to get beaten up?

173
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,142
Yes.

174
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,478
He was so utterly clueless.

175
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,481
He probably had no idea I liked him.

176
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,527
There's no cure for being clueless.

177
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,404
They don't even know
that they are clueless.

178
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,365
Go and sleep.

179
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:45,741
Sleep.

180
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,160
Hey.

181
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,623
Do you still think about...

182
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,750
your first love or something?

183
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,879
First love is like an immunization shot.

184
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,132
You're nervous before getting the shot,

185
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,260
and it hurts briefly when you get it.

186
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,387
You're fine after the shot,
but it leaves a scar.

187
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,348
Hey, I told you.

188
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,892
First loves are nothing.

189
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,355
Goodnight.

190
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,325
Who is it?

191
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,789
An immunization shot?

192
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,960
Who is it?

193
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:47,970
Idiot.

194
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,938
SHE WAS PRETTY...

195
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,965
Dieting is the hardest part of training.

196
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,510
So you dumped him?

197
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:30,930
Chew.

198
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,475
Are you a dog?

199
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,018
It is.

200
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,396
Why did you spray Febreze to breakfast?

201
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:43,817
I can't tell if I'm eating beans
or Febreze.

202
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,363
-It's the scent of my skin.
-Your skin?

203
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,201
Have you lost your mind?

204
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,382
Ae-ra, are you a food fighter?

205
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,802
Why aren't you talking?
Are you preparing for a fight?

206
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,265
Did you two fight?
Why aren't you talking to each other?

207
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:19,228
Do you think we fight all the time
or something?

208
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,230
Did he call you ugly again?

209
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,065
Did he say you need to be reborn?

210
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:27,111
Hey, when was I blunt with her?

211
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,491
Ae-ra, did you put on a lip tint?

212
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,118
What?

213
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:36,745
No, I didn't.

214
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,289
Yes, you did.

215
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:43,669
Why did you put on a lip tint
before brushing your teeth?

216
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,254
She didn't put on a lip tint.

217
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,591
-What?
-That's just the color of her lips.

218
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:55,097
Gosh, I taste Febreze in the eggs
because of this punk.

219
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,745
Hey, come out.

220
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,676
Why are you keep on coughing?

221
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:36,138
Is something in your throat?
Do you still smoke...

222
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,973
You didn't quit, huh?

223
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,559
Hey, I never smoked.

224
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:44,480
-Why did you go back inside?
-Because I felt like it.

225
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,065
Okay.

226
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,567
Are you going somewhere?
Meeting someone?

227
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,153
Why is he asking so many questions?

228
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,530
You're unemployed, so where are you going?

229
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,201
I'm going shopping,
so that I can get a job.

230
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,120
-Shopping?
-I have an interview.

231
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,872
So I have to buy a suit.

232
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,416
Alone? What about Sul-hee?

233
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,794
-Sul-hee has a job.
-Right.

234
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,048
How long will it take?

235
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:12,883
What?

236
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,723
It was really brief.

237
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,058
It was like a slug--

238
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,186
Stop talking about that stupid slug.

239
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,064
Let's talk later.

240
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,445
What are you doing?

241
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,573
-We can't carry a bag together?
-What?

242
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,201
I didn't hold your hand or link arms.

243
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,411
Can't we carry a stupid bag together?

244
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,914
Look around.

245
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:47,209
Who else is carrying a bag together?

246
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:50,212
Who else kisses a slug in the copy room?

247
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,382
-Sul-hee.
-You're gross.

248
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,263
She buys clothes online all year round.

249
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,473
And now, she goes shopping
for every event.

250
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,684
Women are so strange.

251
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,769
If she used that money on games,

252
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,313
she should've been ranked
number one right now.

253
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:13,694
How do I look?

254
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,616
It's okay.

255
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,710
That looks okay, too.

256
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:43,932
It's okay.

257
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,685
Why did you come along?

258
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,478
Did you come for the coffee?

259
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,689
Did you come for the air conditioning?

260
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:54,693
You need to tell me which one
looks pretty. At least say something!

261
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,280
You look pretty in all those clothes!

262
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,627
Hurry up and go.

263
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,851
-Was it this copy room?
-What?

264
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,730
Mr. Kim, looks like we're eating meat
for lunch today.

265
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,857
Hi there, Sun-hee.

266
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,485
It's Sul-hee.

267
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,659
Mr. Kim.

268
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,789
This happened last time...

269
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:53,877
do you put something on your lips?

270
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,339
You're stylish, aren't you?

271
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,605
Aren't you going?

272
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,525
Going to the gym again?

273
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,361
Yes, I have to exercise.
I have a match tomorrow.

274
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,864
You never listen to me.

275
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:29,162
You need to get beaten up so bad
to say you'll give up MMA for good.

276
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,957
Why are you still here nagging?

277
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,126
I...

278
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,754
I want to tag along and see the place.

279
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,220
Hey!

280
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,888
Back from the copy room again?

281
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:50,309
What's wrong with you?
You're making me anxious, I can't work.

282
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,394
Let's open up, so you can relax.

283
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,980
We've been together six years
and practically live together.

284
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:57,816
Say that I'm your common-law wife.

285
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,484
You don't use that term like that.

286
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,987
You do if we're in a de facto marriage.

287
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,072
Why should I be the common-law wife?

288
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,742
Sorry, I have an urgent meeting.

289
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,838
Why are you so clumsy?

290
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:21,631
Are you a child?

291
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:26,261
No, I should've been more careful.

292
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:28,847
For what?

293
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,933
-Pardon?
-Just open up.

294
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,436
Just tell the truth.

295
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,688
Don't bother other people.

296
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,815
-What?
-Just yell.

297
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,818
Make an announcement
that Kim Joo-man is your man.

298
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:45,113
If you don't have guts to do that,
then at least act cool.

299
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,324
Sorry.

300
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,534
When I look at you,

301
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,704
you remind me of myself ten years ago.

302
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:57,209
It's frustrating and heartbreaking.

303
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,216
Isn't this an illegal temporary building?

304
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,676
Did you get the building permission?

305
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,180
Does it have an adequate
fire extinguishing facility?

306
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,434
Jab.

307
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,812
I heard he works as an instructor as well.

308
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:18,814
Do you pay him minimum wage?

309
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:23,735
The Ministry of Employment and Labor's
hotline is 1350.

310
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,406
Lee Byung-joo!

311
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,242
Punch the sandbag!

312
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:33,245
The newbie makes the best sandbag.

313
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:34,663
Stop protecting him.

314
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,957
You're not the one competing tomorrow.

315
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,584
He has a match, too.
You both need to be careful.

316
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,545
I'm teaching him a few moves.

317
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:46,550
Or put the two losers
up against each other.

318
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,305
-That jerk--
-It looks like that guy...

319
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,391
likes to beat up Dong-man.

320
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:59,729
Do you not have other plans for today?

321
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:07,529
Jap!

322
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,490
Jap!

323
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,576
One.

324
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,211
Lee Byung-joo!

325
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,338
I got carried away.

326
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,883
You jerk, is he your sandbag?

327
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,969
If you want to fight, let him put on
gloves and fight properly.

328
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:34,806
Why are you high-kicking someone
wearing mitts?

329
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:38,435
I need to throw real punches and he needs
to get them to see what it's like.

330
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:41,146
I'm building his resilience
to physical attacks.

331
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,066
I'm fine, coach.
It was just grazed.

332
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,987
Ae-ra wants to try.

333
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,327
Could you teach me, Mister?

334
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,331
Me?

335
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:02,542
Hey, he's busy. Don't talk nonsense.

336
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:03,752
I'll teach you later.

337
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:06,755
Not you. I want to learn from him.

338
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:10,383
He's the strongest
and best looking guy here.

339
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,219
My goodness.

340
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:13,887
Come on up here.

341
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,223
It's okay to try for fun.

342
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,392
Watch your head.
There you go.

343
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,353
Okay, then.

344
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,692
Ae-ra, don't go all psychotic.

345
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,616
You're putting on a head gear
to fight a woman?

346
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:35,867
Sorry?

347
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,955
Ae-ra's about to lose interest.

348
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,126
Sorry, my bad. I'm a tough man.

349
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:54,302
Can experts like you really tell
when you're about to get punched?

350
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,429
You bet. Watch.

351
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:01,977
This is what I see.
Just like a slow motion.

352
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:03,728
I see and evade everything.

353
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:04,980
Let's play.

354
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,653
Wow, you're amazing.

355
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,489
A true fighter ought to have

356
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,033
a better eye hand coordination
than a punch.

357
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,327
Let's move a little faster.

358
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,746
I'm not good at punching.

359
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:25,709
It's okay, it's me you're fighting.
I see everything.

360
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,212
Real experts protect their faces well--

361
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:32,007
-It's instinctual.
-Punch.

362
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,174
I see everything.

363
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,926
-Right.
-You're too slow.

364
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,179
Left, right, left.

365
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,931
-I can't avoid...
-Left!

366
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,564
-Come here, come here!
-Sorry.

367
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,524
Are you trying to hit a woman?

368
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:55,780
Your nose...

369
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,117
It's bleeding.

370
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:02,370
Come here. I know you took lessons!

371
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,166
You dated for six year?

372
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,210
We had no clue.

373
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,671
Aren't they our first in-house couple?

374
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:16,718
How did you start dating?
You work on different floors.

375
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:23,808
-I guess you guys weren't busy with work.
-That's why we're treating you lunch.

376
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,937
-I hope you understand.
-Okay.

377
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:32,442
Thank you, come to our wedding.

378
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,110
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

379
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,695
Enjoy the food.

380
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,614
I'm so envious.

381
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:39,949
Don't say that.

382
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:44,621
There are quite a few here
who don't have boyfriends.

383
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,167
I don't drink soft drinks.

384
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,588
She's seeing someone, sir. 

385
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:55,965
Yes.

386
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,176
I have a boyfriend.

387
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,304
Everyone should tell the truth.

388
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,265
Is anyone looking to date a colleague?

389
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,813
Don't suddenly give us
a wedding invitation.

390
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,274
I dated for six years, too.
We'll get married soon.

391
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,443
Great, good for you.

392
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,698
I have a feeling that there's going to be
another couple.

393
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:25,161
Mr. Kim, you should make
this Kimchi project a big hit,

394
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,497
get promoted and get married.

395
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:31,459
He's a full-time employee
at a major company.

396
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:35,755
He was born in 1989, type O blood,
height 178.7 cm and his weight is--

397
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,049
Okay, good luck.

398
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:41,803
-Pardon?
-I look forward to a good news soon.

399
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:46,808
Ye-jin, how you describe your ideal man?

400
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:49,853
My ideal man is Park Bo-gum.

401
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,231
My boyfriend looks
exactly like Park Bo-gum.

402
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,817
What's wrong with you?

403
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,569
Did you just choke?

404
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,654
-Really?
-The restroom?

405
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,782
-Ye-jin.
-Yes?

406
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:06,828
If you have time...

407
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:08,580
shall we have some tea?

408
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,207
I'd love that.

409
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,168
Let's go to a cafe and eat cake.

410
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,303
Byung-joo.

411
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:24,763
Darn it.

412
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:28,516
I think he cried.

413
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,393
Really?

414
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:33,938
He got his on the nose.
Even Fedor would've cried.

415
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,940
Noses hurt extra.

416
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:40,612
He attacked Dong-man's nose first,
especially with his foot.

417
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:47,869
I'm sorry. Just like you,
I got carried away.

418
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:48,912
What?

419
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,009
I heard you mom sells jokbal, too.

420
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:05,762
Was you nickname jokbal as well?

421
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,848
Yes, I was called pink jokbal.

422
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,308
Mine too.

423
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:14,687
Our parents own a jokbal place,
and we both like pink.

424
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:19,609
When I was young, I wished I had
an older sister.

425
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,947
Can I be good friends with you?

426
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:32,330
In dramas, girls like her are rude.

427
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:40,755
Ye-jin, you're not rude but pretty.

428
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,048
Pardon?

429
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,385
You think I'm pretty?

430
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:46,886
You're pretty, too.

431
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:55,645
If I was a good drinker,
we could have had a drink.

432
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:59,566
But I can't, so I wanted to have tea
with you instead.

433
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,567
Why?

434
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:03,611
Do you have concerns?
Did you fight with your boyfriend?

435
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,405
Sorry?

436
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,783
By the way, what's your boyfriend like?

437
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,955
He's like a teddy bear.

438
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,374
Like a cub.

439
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,626
My boyfriend is exactly like that.

440
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,296
Our taste in men are similar, too.

441
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,464
You have a boyfriend?

442
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:28,011
It's a secret, but I have someone, too.

443
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,846
Really?

444
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,723
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.

445
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:33,766
I totally understand.

446
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:37,437
If you say you have a boyfriend,
they'll ask questions.

447
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,813
Do you want to see him?

448
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,317
We took a photo together this morning.

449
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:46,654
I bet he looks like Park Bo-gum.

450
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,865
But Sul-hee...

451
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,617
this is a secret, okay?

452
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,007
It's Mr. Kim.

453
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:11,888
You two are dating?

454
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,890
I have a crush on him,

455
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,975
but he'll become my boyfriend soon.

456
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,772
I like him so much.

457
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,524
I just look at him and I'm so happy.

458
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:27,904
Ye-jin, why are you doing this to me?

459
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:31,449
I thought my first love was
in middle school.

460
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,242
But I was wrong.

461
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:39,707
I think about him all day
and my heart is pounding all the time.

462
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:43,503
I think Mr. Kim is actually my first love.

463
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:47,465
I must be crazy, Sul-hee.

464
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:54,764
I thought Hong-sik was my first love,
but then I was wrong.

465
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,142
I think about Mr. Kim all day.

466
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,687
I think I'm going to die like this.

467
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,399
I must be crazy.

468
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,110
I like him so much.

469
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:11,948
Should I splash water on her?

470
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:15,743
I'm thinking about how I should tell him.

471
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:25,712
How do I ask him out and maintain
a long relationship?

472
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,715
Should I slap her face?

473
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:31,300
What should I do now?

474
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,219
Sorry?

475
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,847
In dramas...

476
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,349
they slap the girl with kimchi.

477
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,435
That's the rule of thumb.

478
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,856
Can you give me some advice?

479
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,028
You want an advice from me?

480
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,488
That's when I realized.

481
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:55,283
In the course of one's life...

482
00:33:55,658 --> 00:34:00,246
I'm happy I told you this though.

483
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,542
Slapping someone is...

484
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,169
really...

485
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:07,837
really...

486
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,465
difficult.

487
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,738
Sonya, stop looking at the camera.
You're not on a shoot.

488
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,573
I can't help it.

489
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:40,411
Wait, Tak-su. Did you just get mad at me?

490
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,121
No, I wasn't.

491
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,414
To be honest,

492
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:47,627
this scandal's a big problem for me,
just before I release my second album.

493
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,546
To be honest, no one really knows
about your album.

494
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,592
You'll get publicity as my girlfriend
and this scandal will benefit me, too.

495
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:57,970
-Sonya, this is a win-win situation.
-Is this a business relationship?

496
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:03,476
It's love.

497
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,812
Love.

498
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,689
Cut.

499
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:11,359
Sonya, why do you keep looking
at the camera?

500
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:14,487
-This isn't a selfie.
-Are we done yet?

501
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:18,574
If you look at other scandal photos,
they are all blurry.

502
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:22,036
Let's go just once more.
She keeps on staring at the camera.

503
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,205
It doesn't look like a paparazzi shot
at all.

504
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,165
Let's go again. Be natural.

505
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,917
You should practice your acting.

506
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,295
That scumbag.

507
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:36,801
You made his nose bleed,
why are you still mad?

508
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,721
Hey, would you lose
if you fought him fairly?

509
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:45,226
You tell me not to fight, but I guess
you don't want me to lose.

510
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:51,065
-People get mad even if their puppy--
-That's enough.

511
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:54,485
I called the other two,
so get changed and come to the bar.

512
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,196
I have an interview tomorrow.

513
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,116
We're not drinking. You have to rehearse.

514
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:01,367
Let's go.

515
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:09,625
Age doesn't matter unless you're a cheese.

516
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:13,588
If you're not a cheese,
age doesn't matter at all.

517
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,132
With an earnest passion, 

518
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,676
and with my experience,

519
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:22,930
I'll become Choi Ae-ra of KBC news.

520
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,725
That's perfect.

521
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:30,104
Ae-ra's a great speaker.
You'd make a good saleswoman.

522
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,648
I'd pick you for sure.

523
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,067
I was having such a bad day.

524
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:38,946
You guys make me feel excited
and my heart starts to flutter.

525
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,199
I'm tearing up for some reason.

526
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,952
Why are you exaggerating?

527
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,246
I saw you practicing
to become an announcer

528
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:51,876
and Dong-man doing taekwondo
since we were young.

529
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:55,129
You two are finally doing it
in real life tomorrow.

530
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:57,882
It is making me feel nervous
and emotional.

531
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,802
Honey, I haven't passed yet.

532
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,890
Mom, did I win already?
Why are you crying?

533
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,392
I feel like you're already halfway there.

534
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:13,022
You guys are sparkling right now.

535
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,732
She's right.

536
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,526
You guys are making me jealous.

537
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,657
-Let's drink!
-Cheers!

538
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,334
You match is tomorrow, right?

539
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:37,213
If you become a MMA fighter,
would you meet Sa-rang?

540
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,675
-Choo Sa-rang?
-Why would I meet her?

541
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,678
Kim Dong-hyun met her.

542
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,313
Hold on.

543
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,694
You look nervous.

544
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,904
Of course I am!

545
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,283
Does my hair look okay?

546
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,076
Am I dressed properly?

547
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:16,544
-You look just fine.
-Do I really look okay?

548
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,382
Look at me in the eyes and say something.

549
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:30,725
Because you usually look like an animal...

550
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,230
What about it?

551
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,399
You look...

552
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,484
-kind of...
-Hey!

553
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,571
He means you're pretty!

554
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,575
-She scared me that I almost cursed.
-I was startled.

555
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,910
Why are you yelling?

556
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,079
It's like you got caught doing something.

557
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:55,583
-Did you do something?
-Did we?

558
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:57,835
I don't remember.

559
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,758
You do plastering yourself?

560
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,594
Ma'am, do you even have
a license to do this?

561
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:10,765
Did you finally decide to go for her?

562
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,359
You should take the taxi today.

563
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:25,029
I bet the traffic is horrible.

564
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:28,366
You should rest your legs.
You need to use them later. 

565
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:41,087
I'm your first sponsor.
Pay me back after you win.

566
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:45,424
You told me not to fight,
so why would you sponsor me?

567
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,844
-Get going.
-Hey.

568
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,890
You're not coming to watch, right?

569
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,393
It starts at 4 p.m.
at the Dongchook gymnasium.

570
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,772
I'll never watch you fight again.

571
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,234
Fine.

572
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,946
-Hey, Ko Dong-man.
-What?

573
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,781
Don't get intimidated.

574
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,408
Knock them out!

575
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:14,078
You're acting like my dad.

576
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,248
I hope you ace it. 

577
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,083
Go!

578
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,253
Bye, go!

579
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:45,025
2017 KBC ANNOUNCER INTERVIEW

580
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,783
INTERVIEWEE WAITING ROOM

581
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,622
I'm number 24, Park Na-ri.

582
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,791
Hello.

583
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,169
SAMPLE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

584
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:07,548
Hello, I'm KBC announcer, Park Na-ri.

585
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,675
I'll give my best to...

586
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,562
-Twenty-three, 24 and 25, please come in.
-Yes.

587
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:32,740
With distinct sociability, I believe
I could get closer to the audiences.

588
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:36,243
Lastly, I think the most important
qualification for announcers is...

589
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,037
sense of duty.

590
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,498
Okay, thank you.

591
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:45,920
-If you don't have further questions--
-Excuse me.

592
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,214
You haven't asked me anything yet.

593
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,882
2017 KBC ANNOUNCER INTERVIEW

594
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:53,010
Do you have any talents?

595
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,430
For instance, something you can do
on variety shows.

596
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,600
Variety shows?

597
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,270
How about a song? I'll sing.

598
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,356
That would take too long.

599
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,274
We'll consider we listened to it.

600
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,027
-Good job everyone.
-Then...

601
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,529
how about a dance?

602
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,197
I can do a cover dance of AOA.

603
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,616
I can see your passion, but...

604
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:19,078
if you dance right now,
it will make everyone awkward.

605
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,207
Then...

606
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:27,044
-I prepared a self-introduction...
-Number 25.

607
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:29,463
Yes?

608
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:34,677
I'm not sure how it's like for you,
but time is gold for us.

609
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:40,891
If you want to steal our time,
you should have filled up your time first.

610
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:46,021
While other interviewees went abroad
to study, went to graduate school,

611
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:48,232
what were you doing during that time?

612
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:52,611
Passion should be proven through
your experiences.

613
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,199
I...

614
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:01,245
earned money.

615
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:02,830
Pardon?

616
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:07,251
While they went to study abroad
and volunteer...

617
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:09,295
I...

618
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:13,966
was earning money.

619
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:27,980
Mom.

620
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,985
-Mom.
-How did you do?

621
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:51,503
Dad, what are you doing?

622
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,048
Are you busy?

623
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:58,719
Can I... come see you?

624
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:03,057
I'm really busy
because the boat just came in.

625
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,476
Let's talk later. Okay.

626
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,319
We were always short on time.

627
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,949
I tend to doze off during the day,
but I don't really sleep at night.

628
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,118
Also, I'm more focused during night time.

629
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:25,579
We wake up earlier than others...

630
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,249
and we sleep later,
but we never had enough time.

631
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:32,711
I'm a night owl, so working late
is not a problem for me.

632
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:36,048
Jab, jab!

633
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:38,884
We lived harder than anyone.

634
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:43,222
Our résumés don't reflect
how hard we lived...

635
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:46,725
but it's acting as if it entirely
captured our life.

636
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:50,604
And that's making me mad and upset.

637
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:03,534
Once the news releases after the match,
all of the cameras will be on you.

638
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:07,329
It'd be good if you look like
a sexy fighter.

639
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,375
Do you think this is sexy?

640
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,752
I look like an office worker from the 90s.

641
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:20,050
Even if two people score the same,
the camera will turn to the handsome one.

642
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:23,137
Why do you think
my sausages sell so well?

643
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:26,515
Sure, sure. You'll become rich in no time.

644
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,269
Wait, did the news get released already?

645
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:32,730
What is this?

646
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,733
KIM TAK-SU ADMITS TO DATING SONYA

647
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:42,448
We stopped Ko Dong-man's news
with your scandal.

648
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:46,160
We promised to buy two advertisements
at this newspaper in exchange of this.

649
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:50,330
Dong-man costs me so much money.
He's a money eater.

650
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:52,124
He tires me out.

651
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:55,252
No one really cares
about a newbie fighter.

652
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:59,173
Scandal of a star fighter like you
will cover everything.

653
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:01,842
He's having his debut match today.

654
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:08,599
Hey, you need to do your job properly.
Do you want to go back to your home?

655
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,810
It's not a real match.

656
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:15,773
It's like an opening at at a concert.

657
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,399
They won't broadcast it anyway.

658
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,568
-No one cares.
-I do.

659
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,196
I care, okay? I do.

660
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:25,282
Don't let him come near the ring at all.

661
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:29,244
I talked to the fight matchmaker already.

662
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:31,038
I already planned out everything.

663
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:34,875
There's someone who's confident
to beat Dong-man.

664
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:38,003
-We'll put him against Dong-man.
-Do you think that's possible?

665
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,464
What could an amateur know
about Dong-man?

666
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:43,383
-He beat Dong-man before.
-He has?

667
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:48,472
I wish people just found out.

668
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:51,809
I'd rather have them find out about us.

669
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:56,396
We're always together,
but no one suspects us.

670
00:46:57,856 --> 00:47:01,068
Sul-hee, you know that would put us
in an awkward position.

671
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:04,863
-I'm so nervous.
-Why?

672
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,492
Because of everything.
You're kissing someone else at work.

673
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:10,953
Stop thinking about that.

674
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:14,289
Why is she so pretty and young?

675
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:18,627
She's from a rich family
and she's so nice.

676
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,796
You're a lot prettier.

677
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,967
No one even doubts that I'm dating you.

678
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:30,472
I already know your mom and your sisters
don't like me.

679
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:36,728
That's why I feel like
I'm dragging you down.

680
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,606
I feel like I'm your secret mistress.

681
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:44,736
It really makes me feel sad.

682
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,906
Why would you think that?

683
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:51,910
Sometimes, I wish you weren't
an assistant manager.

684
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:54,538
I wish you never went to college like me.

685
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:58,709
I want you to earn 50,000 won
less than what I make.

686
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:01,295
Even in that case,

687
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:06,675
I would still love you for 100 years
just like I love you right now.

688
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:25,777
If I make a big hit on this kimchi project
and get promoted,

689
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,281
let's tell the truth.

690
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,492
After that, you should quit.

691
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:36,163
Quit?

692
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,582
I know you want to become a blogger.

693
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:42,794
Once you quit, I'll support you,
so you can become one.

694
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:45,923
And be a manager's wife.

695
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:48,425
What?

696
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,262
Once I get promoted...

697
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,017
let's do it.

698
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,020
Let's get married.

699
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,016
How do you want your hair done?

700
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,436
Make me look prettier than a girl idol.

701
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:45,482
-Are you going to be on a variety show?
-No.

702
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:49,069
I want to support my man.

703
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:50,570
Really?

704
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,615
I want my man to become the star.

705
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:55,450
Make that obvious for everyone.

706
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,914
Yes, I ate.

707
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,791
I'm working.

708
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,753
Mom, I'm at work right now.

709
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,714
Dong-man.

710
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:12,676
Do you want me to send you some money?

711
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:15,262
You think your son doesn't have money?

712
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:16,763
I'm working.

713
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,557
That's not what I meant.

714
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:22,019
-Your dad...
-What now?

715
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,938
Did he say something like
I can't even feed myself?

716
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,690
No, that's not it.

717
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:30,318
He's worried that you may have
ran out of money...

718
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:33,071
and aren't eating too well.

719
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,785
Is he there?

720
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:41,955
Yes, do you want to talk to him?

721
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:46,460
I told you to make up with him.

722
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:53,216
-Hey...
-No, no. Never mind.

723
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,010
I have to get to work.

724
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:03,727
Just give a message to dad.

725
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:09,316
Ask him to believe in his son.

726
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:10,942
I'm hanging up.

727
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,078
What is there to believe in?

728
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,621
You're so...

729
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:25,415
He'll win in anything he does.

730
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,292
KO DONG-MAN VS. LEE BYUNG-JOO

731
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:30,962
You can't change the match-up
last minute like that.

732
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:33,965
You're making me feel bad.

733
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:37,803
I know new fighters
usually go up against each other.

734
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:42,140
But the one who was supposed
to fight Dong-man suddenly forfeited.

735
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:44,518
Suddenly? Right before the match?

736
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,562
Should I feel bad about this?

737
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:52,943
I'll go easy on you.

738
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:57,489
Coach, I'm fine.

739
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:00,492
You should help Dong-man from his corner.

740
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:03,787
I feel so bad.

741
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:06,873
Hey.

742
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:12,295
Even if there's no one, Byung-Joo was
a champion in his region.

743
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:15,132
How can you match him up
with someone just making his debut?

744
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:18,552
Why are you playing so dirty?

745
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:23,431
Coach, let's just do it.

746
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,478
-What?
-I think I can do it.

747
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:35,152
It's been ages
since we walked through here together. 

748
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:37,571
Don't be nervous. There's no need to.

749
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,031
-Coach.
-Yes? Why?

750
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:41,950
Are you nervous? Does your stomach hurt?

751
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:44,452
-Do I have to take off my shirt?
-Why?

752
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:48,206
I'm used to wearing my uniform...

753
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,250
You're nervous? Do you need the toilet?

754
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:54,462
I'm a little embarrassed.
There are so many women out there, too.

755
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:58,466
I see. But then,
they'll be so far away anyway.

756
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:01,595
-They won't be able to see you that well.
-Really?

757
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:05,765
-You look great with those gloves on.
-Hello.

758
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,351
Why are you here?

759
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:11,229
I saw the scandal article.

760
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,691
Tak-su is second to none
when it comes to being shady.

761
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:18,278
Why did you do something
you can't even do well?

762
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:22,449
-What?
-Why did you meet with a reporter?

763
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:24,242
Just stick to your moral.

764
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,704
Am I an idiot?
Should I just sit and do nothing?

765
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:29,748
Don't let Tak-su mess you up.

766
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:33,126
You and Dong-man should focus on
what you're good at.

767
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,128
Win with your competency.

768
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:37,505
Did you hear that?

769
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:41,676
Idiots should use their body,
not their brain.

770
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:47,057
Dong-man, I'm here today as your fan.

771
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:48,725
Pardon?

772
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:50,602
Let me see you fly again.

773
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:02,489
Thank you.

774
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:06,368
Honey, do you think Dong-man is done...

775
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,330
Honey?

776
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:31,184
Does he think he's Choo Sung-hoon
or something?

777
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:33,478
He'd better be just as good as him.

778
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:47,033
Next up, here comes Ko Dong-man!

779
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,163
Don't bother him.

780
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:36,750
The one dating a celebrity isn't the king.
It's the one with skills.

781
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:40,628
I don't care, I'm just going to enjoy it.
It's been a while since I've been here.

782
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:42,422
Open your mouth.

783
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:46,301
Enjoy it.

784
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,276
Let's go!

785
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:11,117
Round four of RFC super fight.
Let me introduce the fighters.

786
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,661
First in the red corner.

787
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:17,374
Standing at 180 cm tall, weighing 71 kg,

788
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:19,876
with a ten wins and five losses
in MMA fight record...

789
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:22,337
Isn't that Park Hye-ran?

790
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,880
Is she here to watch the fight?

791
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:26,216
-So unusual! Film her!
-It is Park Hye-ran.

792
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:28,093
Lee Byung-joo!

793
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:31,930
-Are you Park Hye-ran?
-Are you here alone?

794
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:34,140
-Did you come alone?
-Were you invited?

795
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,392
May we interview you?

796
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:38,353
What brings you to the MMA fight?

797
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:41,147
I came to cheer for a fighter.

798
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,066
Who's the fighter?

799
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:47,487
The fighter standing
in the ring right now.

800
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:51,366
Ko Dong-man!

801
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:56,996
Ready?

802
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,206
Ready?

803
00:56:58,289 --> 00:56:59,499
Ready, fight!

804
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,492
Stop!

805
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:41,416
-Did you get that?
-It ended in 19 seconds.

806
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:43,293
-What? Is it over?
-Did he just fly?

807
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:44,919
It is over already?

808
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:55,138
How did he suppress all that for years?

809
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:06,566
We will announcer the winner
of this event.

810
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:11,321
After knocking down his opponent
in just 19 seconds,

811
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:13,448
the winner via KO is Ko Dong-man!

812
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:14,866
Winner!

813
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:53,196
Excuse me, what's your name?

814
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:55,532
This was your debut match, right?

815
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:58,493
-What's your agency?
-How do you know Park Hye-ran?

816
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:00,703
How do you feel about your match?

817
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,622
Did you expect to win?

818
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:06,543
-May we get a brief interview?
-A word, please.

819
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:56,634
Hey, what are you doing?

820
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:00,763
I won.

821
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,022
Do you really have to do this?

822
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,735
I can't watch it.

823
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:28,499
I'm in trouble.

824
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:34,047
Now...

825
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:37,717
you look pretty even when you cry.

826
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:50,563
Dong-man.

827
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:53,941
Don't feed only the white rabbit.

828
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:56,152
The black rabbit will be sad.

829
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:59,656
You don't want it to be sad, right?

830
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:04,535
The uglier it is,
the nicer you should be to it.

831
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:24,347
Here.

832
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:26,974
Why are you doing this?

833
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,926
