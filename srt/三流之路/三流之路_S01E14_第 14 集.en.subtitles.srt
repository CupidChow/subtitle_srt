1
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,441
Who is it? Is it Ko Dong-man?

2
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:25,734
What's going on?

3
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,111
Who is it?

4
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:48,214
Every storm in life finds you
when you have your guard down.

5
00:00:56,181 --> 00:01:00,060
CALM BEFORE THE STORM

6
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,652
Last week, they robbed the neighbors
and took everything.

7
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,816
-Hey, Ko Dong-man!
-You scared me!

8
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,818
I said to be quiet.

9
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:53,071
Who would be inside here?
Stop being an idiot and come quickly.

10
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,074
No, I'm sure of it.

11
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:16,261
I'm certain there was someone in there.
I saw toe socks!

12
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,097
Why are you so slow?

13
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:22,267
-Slow?
-It's the landlady's personal life.

14
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:27,355
-What?
-She had lipstick on.

15
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,108
Why would she have lipstick on at home?

16
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,652
For her lover.

17
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:40,160
But you being so slow...
Why would you do that there?

18
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,120
That's why... 

19
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,789
So this is what a woman's sixth sense is. 

20
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,460
But you...

21
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,547
Have you seen Park Hye-ran come outside?

22
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,717
I haven't seen her at all.

23
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,304
Why are you concerned about that?

24
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:01,472
See you.

25
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,144
What? What? You want to follow me inside?

26
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:10,773
Don't come inside my house anymore.
I'm tired now.

27
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,318
What's tiring? 

28
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,945
If someone else saw, they'd think I...

29
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,989
What? Make you tired or something?

30
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,074
You do tire me.

31
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:24,495
Is this a barracks?
Why should a man and woman...

32
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:29,167
Until when...

33
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,963
Is this some kind of boot camp
for Ko Dong-man?

34
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:35,757
Go sleep.

35
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,783
What are you guys doing there?

36
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,913
Mom, who are they?

37
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:09,499
No.

38
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,461
Out of the two, who is it?

39
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,047
Mom?

40
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:23,596
Yes, I'm Madame Hwang's only son,
Kim Nam-il.

41
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,665
Obba, I know why you're here, but...

42
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,335
don't tell me to hide anymore.

43
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,756
Why now, after living quietly?

44
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,969
Have I been quiet?

45
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,930
There wasn't a single time
where I was living quietly.

46
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,311
For the past 30 years,

47
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:16,733
I've never acted like I wasn't a mother.
You know that.

48
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:20,945
Still. Why would you reveal it now?

49
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,780
If he's that Hwang Bok-hee's son,

50
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,368
would it still be that bad?

51
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,851
His legs gave way.

52
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,478
Why? What is it?

53
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:58,900
So you will go to that weigh-in
or whatever?

54
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:03,696
Why are you using your feet like that
on your boyfriend?

55
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,325
What's the point of dating
if you want to be selfish? 

56
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,202
What am I? An accessory?

57
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,580
That's right!

58
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:16,125
You said your job interviews
tomorrow overlap, right?

59
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,668
Which one are you going to?

60
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,380
Did I ever say to never fight again?

61
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:24,008
I just said don't compete against
Kim Tak-su! You really...

62
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,388
Hey, lower the volume.

63
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,184
He should hold his neck,
so he won't be able to attack anymore.

64
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,525
What's that sound?

65
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,154
She's...

66
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,032
actually living in there, right?

67
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,079
Are you a village chief? Why do you care?

68
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,528
CERTIFICATION OF CONTENTS

69
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,378
Bok-hee had a grown son like that?

70
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,630
Why are you all serious?

71
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:46,883
Who's serious?

72
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,054
You know, since we're here,
should we see the kids?

73
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:55,683
You're always so lacking
in your brain department.

74
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,394
What would you tell the kids?

75
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,771
Are you going to say
you came to see Hwang Bok-hee?

76
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,608
But why did you come anyway?

77
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,735
I live in Bucheon!

78
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,904
What's that got to do with anything?

79
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:11,491
I told you. My house is in Bucheon.
There's a bus that comes here in one shot.

80
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:15,286
You call that an excuse?
What kind of a load of crap.

81
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:16,954
What?

82
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,417
Gosh.

83
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,113
Hey!

84
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,909
-What?
-For your digestion,

85
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,745
and eat yeot.

86
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,210
Hey, but they're really funny though. 

87
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:07,004
Maybe you left quite an impression
when you yelled at them?

88
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,967
Is it something like, you're the first
interviewee that rebelled like that?

89
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:14,512
Choi Ae-ra.

90
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,683
As a senior in life,
let me give you some advice.

91
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,643
Please don't.

92
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,980
You're not going to pass me anyway.

93
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:30,361
Then don't hurt me, either.
I have a right to not be hurt.

94
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,239
Let's go.

95
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,493
The interview for the ring announcer
is also today, right? 

96
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,579
How could they both be on the same day?

97
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,543
So you're sure you're going
to the announcer thing. Not the octagon?

98
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:50,256
Of course, it's been my dream
ever since I was six.

99
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:57,555
Was your dream an announcer or the mic?

100
00:09:59,056 --> 00:09:59,890
What?

101
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,435
As your boyfriend, friend,

102
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:05,021
and someone who has witnessed your life
for the past 23 years,

103
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,606
if I give you honest advice,

104
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:11,068
you're not made to be an announcer.

105
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:15,239
Hey! Why are you discouraging me before
my interview? You're bringing bad luck.

106
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:20,244
You're too good to be just sitting down.
A psycho should fly.

107
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:26,709
Still... An announcer seems
like something mainstream.

108
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,128
I'd like to be a part of that.

109
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:32,590
Hey, isn't where you are
the mainstream for you?

110
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:34,800
What?

111
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,637
Isn't where you're happy
the mainstream for you?

112
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,601
So... Just go with the thing
that makes your heart beat faster.

113
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,814
Still, I made it to the final interview
for the announcer. I can't reject that.

114
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,941
It's crazy.

115
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,781
RFC KIM TAK-SU VS. KO DONG-MAN
PRESS CONFERENCE

116
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,295
-Tak-su.
-Yes?

117
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,056
That person...

118
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,234
Why did you come to Korea?

119
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,487
I have come here to train the first
Asian fighter to represent my family.

120
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:40,032
Is that the only reason you came to Korea,
because of him?

121
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,828
Focus on him.
I'm just here to be in the shadow.

122
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,080
He's the one
that's going to step in the ring.

123
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,042
Since when have you known
fighter Ko Dong-man?

124
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,806
Please pose.

125
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:27,371
SEOUL TO CHEONGJU

126
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,693
Number 11, Choi Ae-ra?

127
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,572
Is Choi Ae-ra not here?

128
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,657
Yes.

129
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,247
Choi Ae-ra is here.

130
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,434
Mainstream is what makes you happy.

131
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,104
So... just go with the thing
that makes your heart beat faster.

132
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:38,025
I think the innovative strategy
for the popularization of MMA is...

133
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,735
the hearts of women.

134
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,780
The only women in the octagon,
the ring girls.

135
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,616
But with only ring girls,
you can't win the hearts of women.

136
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,701
A professional woman that leads the game

137
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,412
in front of the athletes,
not by their side,

138
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:54,124
I think that's the key to gaining
women's hearts.

139
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,961
Still, isn't a female announcer
too unconventional?

140
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:01,507
It's not unconventional. It's innovative.

141
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,300
What?

142
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,553
Oh well, let's just wing it. 

143
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,179
If I don't make it here,

144
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,724
I will immediately apply
for ring announcer of the rival league.

145
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,101
Then Chairman,

146
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:17,982
you'll lose the first ever female ring
announcer right in front of your eyes.

147
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,486
However, I am kind of tight
on time right now.

148
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,281
Yes.

149
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,117
So, there is no need to hear any more.
You passed.

150
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,121
-Yes?
-You're in.

151
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,502
No, why? How can it be this easy...

152
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,380
You are good. Also, you stand out.

153
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:47,803
Excuse me. I am, uh...
On the back of the resume,

154
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,180
I enclosed my master's degree
that I obtained in England.

155
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,309
You don't need a master's degree
to hold a microphone.

156
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,352
In the ring, all that matters
are your skills.

157
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,855
Here?

158
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,150
I love it.

159
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,361
Then you'll start with the next big match
right away.

160
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:09,074
The big match is a little...
We already cast someone.

161
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,553
Why is John Carlos
wearing the Sausages shirt?

162
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,557
Why is he being the second
for Go Dong-man?

163
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:38,646
-Right. What kind of variable is this?
-Take it away.

164
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,856
Take it away. Take it all away
and bring it back to me!

165
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,233
Tell him we'll pay more than
Hwang Jang-ho.

166
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:46,862
-Tak-su, do you think he's here for money?
-What?

167
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,406
Try giving him millions,
he still won't come to you.

168
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:54,536
Burn up that gym, deport him,

169
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,538
or soften up the referees!

170
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,582
Do something!

171
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,378
Seeing how you act, you've already lost.

172
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,014
What? Why?

173
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,266
Why are you like this all of a sudden?

174
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,811
I won't do it anymore
even if you give me millions.

175
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:19,895
What?

176
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,522
Fifteen years ago,

177
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:25,526
when Dong-man came to me
before he went to Coach Hwang,

178
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,778
I recognized his talents,

179
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,489
but I fell for your family's millions.

180
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,368
Coach Hwang who picked the iron ax
became a general,

181
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:39,540
but I've become a jerk
with my student of 15 years.

182
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,668
I'm sorry I couldn't guide you properly.

183
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,387
Why is that? Why does it have to be her?

184
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,515
If a celebrity throws the first pitch,
it will begin trending on the web.

185
00:16:56,598 --> 00:17:00,602
Anchor Park coming to see the game
created a lot of buzz.

186
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,397
What does MMA have to do with a celebrity?

187
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,149
Excuse me?

188
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,485
The chairman is from abroad.

189
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,487
He doesn't really know
about domestic conditions.

190
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,532
Then can I see you do it?

191
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,535
Are you telling me to audition?

192
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,708
I'm was asked to be here
to donate my talents.

193
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:26,211
I heard you get paid ten times
more than that person.

194
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,547
Then that's not a donation.

195
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:33,886
If you're ten times more expensive,
you should be ten times better.

196
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:35,929
Isn't that how it should be?

197
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,977
What's wrong? Are you not confident?

198
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,981
It's not a question of confidence.
It's a question of pride.

199
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:07,169
I... passed. Passed.

200
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,339
I passed immediately.

201
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,269
You beat Park Hye-ran.

202
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,775
Earlier, I was like that
because I was put on the spot,

203
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,693
but it's nice meeting you.

204
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,904
Yes, well. It's okay.

205
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:38,492
By the way, I didn't think
Park Hye-ran would actually come.

206
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:42,663
I heard she's been rejected everywhere
and has no work. It must be true.

207
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,414
Why doesn't she have a job?

208
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,960
Would Hyesung Group want to see
their divorced daughter-in-law on TV?

209
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,050
I heard it would be hard for her
to come back to the mainstream.

210
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,763
Even nowadays, the negative comments
are brutal.

211
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:02,182
I'm impressed
that she didn't kill herself.

212
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,936
Where did she put her car,
now that she's riding the bus?

213
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,111
That goes to our neighborhood.

214
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,613
Just follow me until you ride
the local bus.

215
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,448
Why should I follow you?

216
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,038
-How much is it?
-1,300 won.

217
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,211
Please wait a moment.

218
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,255
For two.

219
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,767
Wow, awesome. Isn't that Park Hye-ran?

220
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,908
She ditched her boyfriend and made
frantic attempts to marry a chaebol.

221
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,368
I don't care about Park Hye-ran.
Just live quietly.

222
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,704
You could still probably find
that picture.

223
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,623
Here is the link for that picture.

224
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,373
It's not that. What do I say to Sul-hee?

225
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,708
It's not like I'm homeless, 

226
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,460
and the Namil Bar excuse won't work.

227
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:59,341
It's my match tomorrow.
Then do I sleep alone? I can't recharge?

228
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:04,972
-Just... should we just tell?
-You will?

229
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,766
You're a jerk, right?

230
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,770
You came on to me first.

231
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,399
Jeez, you! I ought to fly
an elbow towards you!

232
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,735
Hey. You can't say those words
to your boyfriend.

233
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,284
Oh, plum plum?

234
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,703
It's peaches.

235
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:31,832
I just like plums these days, don't I?

236
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,959
I told you it's peaches.

237
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,253
But why are you guys here
and not going inside?

238
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,754
We should go in.

239
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,259
Now, dismissed.

240
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:54,980
Sul-hee.

241
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:57,399
Yes?

242
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,325
I will sleep with Ae-ra today.

243
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,665
It's my match tomorrow.

244
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:18,462
I really need a recharge from Ae-ra.

245
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,590
Let me borrow her for one day.

246
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,762
No, that... Sul-hee. You see...

247
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,557
I will lend her.

248
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,311
Take her.

249
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,864
Hey, Soondae.

250
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,242
Are you finishing up your business?

251
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:54,915
I'm not Soondae, I'm Jang-ho.
Jang for general and Ho for tiger.

252
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,090
NATIONAL ATHLETE'S SAUSAGES

253
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,430
I came because I have a favor
to ask of you, jagi.

254
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,474
Jagi?

255
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,143
Not that.

256
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,438
Ah... that's right.

257
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:24,903
My favor, can you grant it?
Are you tight lipped?

258
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,531
I will grant whatever it is.

259
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,669
Please keep this.

260
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,430
Jang-ho, hold onto this for now,
and then...

261
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:46,693
My girlfriend is so great.
How can you get in right away?

262
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:52,032
Then if I win tomorrow,
are you the one doing the interview?

263
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,659
So you should win.

264
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,953
I can't interview Kim Tak-su
if he wins even if I die.

265
00:24:58,788 --> 00:24:59,748
I should win.

266
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,084
Are you scared?

267
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,795
Are you a little scared?

268
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,881
Honestly?

269
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,676
Hey! Stop being honest. You should
just say that you aren't scared.

270
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:17,766
It's the 15 minutes that took
ten years to earn. I will never lose.

271
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,018
So don't worry.

272
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:27,817
Dong-man.

273
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,029
During the 15 minutes of your fight,

274
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:35,367
I will watch over you without blinking.

275
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,161
I will be right below the octagon.

276
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,623
I will watch over you
so that nothing happens.

277
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:48,338
Such a small punk always saying that
she would protect me.

278
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:53,677
Whatever you do, after 15 minutes,
the situation is over.

279
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:59,140
When you open your eyes,
I will be right beside you.

280
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:04,854
How I really feel is that...

281
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:10,151
So that you can't get up tomorrow,
when you sleep...

282
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,280
I want to shoot you with a tranquilizer.

283
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,078
Stop crying.

284
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,333
I won't lose, so you don't wail.

285
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:33,466
If you were just some kind of an okay guy,

286
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,552
I would tell you to go do it.

287
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:39,139
But I don't just like you.

288
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,225
I really like you so much.

289
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:47,314
So how can I do that? How can I?

290
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,984
Why do you so easily confess
your feelings?

291
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,404
So disgustingly cute.

292
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,888
I'm sorry, but...

293
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,601
I like you so much.

294
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,439
I don't think I can do it.

295
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:35,487
Because you love me so much,
you want to protect me?

296
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,216
No.

297
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,720
Because I really like you so much...

298
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,182
I can't stop myself today.

299
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,422
You are really like a dog.
You are really like Bok Shil.

300
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,636
You really shot me
with a tranquilizer, right?

301
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:45,849
Why don't I want to get up?

302
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:51,563
Do you want to continue sleeping?
I will take care of the coach.

303
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:56,818
But then...

304
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,320
Yes?

305
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:11,666
These days, I really like you a whole lot.

306
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:18,131
I like you to the point of wondering
if a person could like another this much.

307
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,342
But that wasn't nonsense.

308
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:24,512
What?

309
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:28,266
More than yesterday... today...

310
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,770
I like you 500 times more.

311
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,357
This jerk is too honest.

312
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:39,402
Every time you just come at me like this,
I get arrhythmia.

313
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:43,406
How could I have left you
and held it in for 20 years?

314
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,618
I must have been a poop dummy.

315
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:50,747
I...

316
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,542
You like me even more like that?

317
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,461
Yes.

318
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:02,592
I like your poop belly.

319
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,596
I like your short arms and legs.

320
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,265
I like your scent, too.

321
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:15,647
From you, there's a seaweed soup scent,

322
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,484
which I like a lot.

323
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,448
I like you so much.

324
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:29,494
Ae-ra.

325
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,833
Why would seaweed soup smell
come out of a person?

326
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,346
Do you want to go in together?

327
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,723
Look at this jerk!

328
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,810
I'm so embarrassed.
I'm so embarrassed, I could die.

329
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,480
You said you'll protect me!

330
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,399
This is something between girls.

331
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,028
What do I say to Sul-hee?

332
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,322
I should have dried my hair
before coming out.

333
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,325
-Ae-ra.
-You want to go together?

334
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,578
Fighting.

335
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:35,226
The weather is so nice, so I think
it's good to hang the laundry outside.

336
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,940
The weather's totally like summer.

337
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,818
Because it's July.

338
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,582
You held it in for 20 years,
and you make trouble in the end.

339
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,349
Why did you come without permission?

340
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:15,600
Are you my girlfriend?

341
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:17,685
What are you doing?

342
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:24,817
You cried, right?

343
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:28,321
Wow, you cried. You cried, punk.

344
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,614
I just yawned.

345
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,828
Are you heartbroken?

346
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,581
Is your diaphragm all ripped up?

347
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:41,334
Why does my diaphragm have
to become the subject of your jokes?

348
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,628
Don't be so down and get up.

349
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:44,963
Why?

350
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:49,300
Hey, Kim Joo-man.
I've known you for ten years.

351
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,011
As for Sul-hee, I've known her
for 20 years.

352
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,431
Whenever you and her fight,
I'm definitely on her side.

353
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,642
Leave. Get out.

354
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:02,772
Sul-hee is not 99 percent a nice person,
she's 100 percent  a nice person.

355
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:06,818
To give such unbelievable Sul-hee to you,
she's too good for that.

356
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,903
Sul-hee's an angel.

357
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:13,074
But I don't trust other men.
Out of all of them, you're the best.

358
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,577
So go downstairs and beg for forgiveness.

359
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,875
-However, in that house...
-What?

360
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,462
Ae-ra's there, too.

361
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,091
I have a match today,

362
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:34,053
so shouldn't our Fantastic 4
all come together for breakfast?

363
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,139
That's our history and custom.

364
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,604
Why are you giving Joo-man that?

365
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,815
No, I'm fine.

366
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,401
I like wooden chopsticks.

367
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,529
There are three fried eggs.

368
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:56,743
I'm fine because I have high cholesterol.

369
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,870
What do you mean high cholesterol...

370
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,997
Sul-hee, hurry up and let's eat.

371
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,666
The perpetrator is eating,
so why should the victim avoid eating?

372
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:13,051
Ae-ra, what is this?

373
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:14,093
What?

374
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,180
Is this voice phishing?

375
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:22,518
Is the plum wine you made available
for purchase?

376
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,562
I wanted to purchase mulberry wine. 

377
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,690
Why? Why would they want to buy my wine?

378
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,650
Are they scammers?

379
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:32,695
You're the one receiving money,
so how are they scammers?

380
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,864
If anything, you'll be the one
scamming them.

381
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:37,700
For example, you receive their money,
but you don't send it to them.

382
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,661
There are strange people on the web, too,
so...

383
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:44,415
Since you make it so neatly and cleanly,
everyone who's seen it wants to buy it.

384
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,084
I would also like to purchase it.

385
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,252
Oh, Koala Fairy wants to buy it, too.

386
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,879
The ID koala seems suspicious...

387
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,006
They must've really wanted it bad.

388
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,050
One person opens it up
and now everybody wants it.

389
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:57,303
What is going on?
No, then how much should I sell these for?

390
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,597
First, let's figure out the
production cost.

391
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,849
How much net profit per bottle
do you want to make?

392
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:02,850
I'm not sure.

393
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,812
A net profit should be set,
considering additional expenses...

394
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,563
About...

395
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,735
-700 won?
-Might as well not sell it, then.

396
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:13,903
Then...

397
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,240
800 won?

398
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:20,535
It won't even cover the bus fare
to go to the post office.

399
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,913
Them 1,100 won.

400
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,708
-Think it over.
-What? What? What?

401
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,545
Is that too expensive?

402
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:33,214
DONGCHOON GYMNASIUM

403
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,758
I heard a lot about you.
I'll leave myself in your care.

404
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:38,594
Sir, thank you so much
for your cooperation.

405
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:41,264
Of course I should cooperate.

406
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,809
I'm fine.

407
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,936
I'm really not scared.

408
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:55,987
I'm about to go to a fight,
you shouldn't sigh.

409
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,530
Gosh.

410
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,700
I have a match today, yet you hit my head?

411
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:03,244
Thinking about it again,
I take back saying you should win.

412
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,248
You can lose. You can just lose.

413
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:11,127
So tap. If it's painful, then tap.
Make sure to tap.

414
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:14,088
It hasn't even started
and you're telling me to tap?

415
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:17,300
If you don't tap, I'll go up and end it.

416
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,468
I will really climb over the fence.

417
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:22,555
I got it. If I think I might die,
I'll tap.

418
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,974
I will go on my back and call it quits.

419
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:30,563
But if I can handle it,
I'll make it a decisive win.

420
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,526
Why is this dude all fired up?

421
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:40,573
So, you go for it today as well.

422
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:59,717
Last week, I drank beer with Mr. Kim
until 11 p.m.

423
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,846
You don't have to tell me those things
anymore.

424
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:07,391
We met at 8 p.m.
and I got dumped right away,

425
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:10,228
During the whole three hours,
all he talked about was you.

426
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,982
Mr. Kim said...

427
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,903
he'll choose you over Mansur's daughter.

428
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:31,123
Mr. Kim, let's go home.

429
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,258
-Honestly...
-Be careful.

430
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,301
Let go. I'm fine.

431
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:47,139
Even if it's not Grandma Park's,

432
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:52,979
but Mansur's daughter,
Sul-hee is the one for me.

433
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,523
I get it now.

434
00:37:55,606 --> 00:38:02,029
To me, Sul-hee's pretty than Kim Tae-hee.
She kind of looks like Lee Young-ae.

435
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,408
You guys are as if Park Bo-gum
and Lee Young-ae are a couple.

436
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:09,662
Even that hair...

437
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,415
That hair looks good
because Sul-hee did it. If you did it...

438
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:17,503
Me too. Out of all the guys
I used to like,

439
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:19,130
you're the fattest one.

440
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:25,303
Why did I fight with Sul-hee
because of you?

441
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,974
I deserve to be shot dead.

442
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,395
I thought that because of you
he was being, well...

443
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,278
Anyway, he kept rejecting me.

444
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:47,408
You said you live in Oksu-dong, right?
That's on my way.

445
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,160
Do you want me to drop you off?

446
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:51,704
Get in. Hurry, quickly. Get in the car!

447
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,790
No, I have another appointment.

448
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,543
Should we eat it together?

449
00:38:57,626 --> 00:39:00,338
Let's get tteokbokki next time.
Next time, I'll invite all the interns

450
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,465
and we can all eat it together.

451
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,675
Ye-jin, you should also...

452
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,637
I hope you'll keep your boundaries.

453
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:14,018
Now, I hope that you'll seriously stop.

454
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:19,607
Even though he said he didn't like it,
I thought he was just saying that.

455
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:23,194
What are you trying to say to me?

456
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:42,213
I wanted to draw it
without Mr. Kim, but...

457
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,090
I just drew it.

458
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,635
Why are you giving me this?

459
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,348
To make my heart more at ease.

460
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,268
Since I made a nice unnie shed tears,

461
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:58,854
I didn't want to be cursed
that I'd cry tears of blood.

462
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,356
And my heart was pretty uneasy.

463
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:04,860
I really...

464
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:09,156
I really wanted to apologize sincerely
before I go.

465
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,785
Are you going somewhere?

466
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:14,870
Good job!

467
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:17,081
Good job!

468
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,547
Since we're having company dinner already,

469
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,216
I'll just take this as my farewell party
as well.

470
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:31,846
Still, how can we send you off all the way
to England without a farewell party?

471
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,433
Ye-jin, they say British guys are
really handsome.

472
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,186
From now on, I plan on studying hard
instead of chasing after guys.

473
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,327
Sul-hee.

474
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,080
Sul-hee?

475
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:04,462
When are you going there again?

476
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:09,425
Want to go together next time?

477
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,761
Those things are more fun
when you go with someone.

478
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:17,016
Okay, when the time comes.

479
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:20,352
-Here, meat.
-Oh, thank you.

480
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:24,982
I feel like if I eat this, I'll die.

481
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,693
That's when it's most tasty.
You've never had it like this before.

482
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:37,953
Perhaps, the weekend is a little...

483
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:43,250
Of course, you have to go on dates and,
of course, you have a boyfriend, right?

484
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,296
Stop poking around, you bastard.

485
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:50,841
I guess you didn't know, Chan-ho.

486
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:52,551
Chan-ho?

487
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,805
I had one, but we broke up
not too long ago.

488
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:02,186
Excuse me! Can we have more charcoal?

489
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,915
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

490
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:27,962
Here at Grand Dongchoon today,

491
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:31,298
there will be a 38th RFC match,
the greatest combat league of Korea.

492
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:35,135
Thank you for visiting us today.

493
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:40,849
Please give big applause for the athletes
and the game.

494
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,521
This is not the last match of Ko Dong-man,
but his first.

495
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,941
No matter what, be careful of injuries
and don't fall into Tak-su's pace.

496
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,152
No ground fight, yet. Keep it in mind.

497
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:37,948
Coach, it took me ten years to be here.
I'm going to fight without any regret.

498
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,366
Open up.

499
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,454
Enjoy it.

500
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:53,797
Which one is it?

501
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:59,803
Among the two... Which one is it?

502
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:28,290
This match will have three rounds.
The referee is Im Tae-wook.

503
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,335
Corner!

504
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:39,218
Okay. Okay.

505
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,387
Ready, fight!

506
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:49,978
I told you to put a tray underneath!
It's dangerous!

507
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:52,940
Excuse me. Could you lift the grill?

508
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,108
Be careful, please.

509
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:10,708
Mr. Kim, are you okay?

510
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:13,377
Sul-hee, are you okay?

511
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:37,860
Athlete Ko avoids
Kim Tak-su's signature kick.

512
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:48,579
What was that? That kick looked
exactly like Kim Tak-su's.

513
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,831
Corner.

514
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:03,594
He wobbled for sure just now.
He took some impact for sure.

515
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:05,763
Tak-su, are you okay?

516
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:10,017
Tak-su, standing won't do.
You got to bring him to the ground.

517
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:13,395
Keep your mind straight
 and avoid a ground fight. Got it?

518
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:16,690
Get on his nerves.

519
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:21,737
When he acts up and gets enraged,
bring him down to the ground.

520
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,992
Okay! Okay! Ready, fight!

521
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:51,391
I don't think anyone would've expected
this match to be such a close match.

522
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:54,770
Although Kim Tak-su is in
good condition today,

523
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:56,605
I wonder why he's like that
against a rookie.

524
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:57,648
Standing.

525
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,361
Fight!

526
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:13,121
Come in. Come in, you jerk.

527
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,415
Dong-man, don't fall for it! No ground!

528
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,043
Come in.

529
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:21,672
It looks like Ko Dong-man is trying
to avoid ground skills, 

530
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:26,718
but you can also say that Kim Tak-su is
avoiding standing match with Ko Dong-man.

531
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:50,659
What's wrong?
Are you scared to fight ground?

532
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:55,163
Is it because your sister is always
sitting that you want to fight standing?

533
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,556
Dong-man, no!

534
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:19,813
Yes!

535
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:24,985
Hold out intention could be pretty
uncertain depending on the looks of it.

536
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:29,531
If you seem to be losing,
hit him with your head.

537
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,576
Let's drag it to an invalid game.

538
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:34,703
Seriously...

539
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:38,165
If you end it making it look like
you led the game,

540
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:42,377
I'll take care of the media afterward.

541
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,420
Where else can you get hurt?

542
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:28,423
What are you doing?

543
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:33,387
A talisman, so you don't get hit or hurt
where I kissed you.

544
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:40,769
My ear hurts.

545
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,145
Then...

546
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:46,024
Don't get hit in your eyes.

547
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:50,362
Here too.

548
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:51,488
-There?
-Yeah.

549
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,245
-Here, here, too.
-There, too?

550
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:06,503
-Here, too.
-There, too?

551
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:07,587
I think I might get hit.

552
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:28,316
I couldn't move a single step.

553
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:38,910
For two, please.

554
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,056
This is severe.

555
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:04,895
Coach, I'm okay.

556
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:08,607
I'm totally okay.

557
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:15,030
I'm okay. Don't stop!

558
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:19,910
I can fight! I want to fight!

559
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:25,874
Coach, tell them to not do it.

560
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:39,262
Tell them to not do it. Don't stop it!

561
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:42,057
Don't stop it! I said I can fight!

562
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:47,771
This match, second round, two minutes
17 seconds in, due to Ko Dong-man's injury

563
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:51,483
this match will be invalid in accordance
with the terms.

564
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:54,152
It will be marked as a "no contest."

565
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:56,154
I can do it!

566
00:51:57,572 --> 00:52:00,617
I told you I'll fight till the end!

567
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:03,036
Why? I said I can, so why?

568
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:06,790
Don't stop it! I will do it!

569
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,542
I will do it!

570
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,392
Mom.

571
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:29,813
Are you sad?

572
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:39,865
But Mom. You don't like me calling you
Mom anymore, right?

573
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,033
What?

574
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,870
There are so many abandoned dogs
these days.

575
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:51,626
And among the many reasons,

576
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:54,963
there is one reason...

577
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:58,341
that's most beautiful yet shitty.

578
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:05,307
When they get their own kid,
the beautiful parents full of love...

579
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:08,727
abandon their dog.

580
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:14,900
What are you trying to tell me?

581
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:17,986
It's only right to bite
when they take yours away.

582
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:23,408
I told you... to leave the kids alone.

583
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:29,581
Right, Mom. What did you do
with that flip phone?

584
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:55,232
Dude, just come in. Why--

585
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,040
Tell us about today's match.

586
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,292
I think I was in a leading position.

587
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:18,046
I'm very sorry that the match had to be
halted due to opponent's injury.

588
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:21,883
But you know, they say it's invalid,
but injury is also your ability.

589
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:24,219
Tak-su! Tak-su! Is your head alright?

590
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,013
Coach, where were you all this time?

591
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:30,308
Your head. Tak-su!

592
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:36,231
-Tak-su!
-What's wrong?

593
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:38,149
-Tak-su!
-Tak-su!

594
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:39,609
What's wrong?

595
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:41,528
-Tak-su!
-Tak-su!

596
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:43,947
-Call the ambulance.
-Kim Tak-su.

597
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:06,678
Coach Choi, once you arrive
at the hospital, give me a call.

598
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:07,637
I will.

599
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,993
Follow me, punk. Let's go to the hospital.

600
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:54,351
Did I scare you? I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Ae-ra.

601
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:04,361
I told you to tap.
Coach told you no ground fight.

602
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,905
I'm okay.

603
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:10,450
If you're just going to do whatever
you want, then why do you go out with me?

604
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,202
Why do you tell me that you love me?

605
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:16,539
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I did wrong.

606
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:22,587
But I didn't severely get hurt.

607
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:25,340
So everything's okay.

608
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:30,637
Didn't you see Kim Tak-su stretchered off?

609
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:33,556
Can you not do this thing?

610
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,271
Aren't you too cruel to me?

611
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,485
No matter how much...

612
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:49,489
No matter how much I see you get beat,

613
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,659
I don't get used to it.

614
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,286
I just can't watch it!

615
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:01,418
If you keep on doing this,
I don't want to see you. 

616
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:03,878
I don't want to date you.

617
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:09,467
-Ae-ra...
-If I tell you not to do it...

618
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:12,345
Ae-ra!

619
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:16,099
What's wrong?

620
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:23,064
Dong-man... what's wrong?

621
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:26,568
What's wrong? What is it?

622
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,738
Why? Why?

623
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:35,201
Why are you talking like that?

624
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:37,996
What?

625
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:41,833
Why aren't you making any sound?

626
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:46,629
Why is nothing making any sound?

627
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,511
Why? Why?

628
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:57,348
Why is everything quiet? Why?

629
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:05,482
The storm has passed
and the world shut down.

630
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,994
Why do you ask, punk?

631
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:20,580
I turned it off.

632
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:02,705
