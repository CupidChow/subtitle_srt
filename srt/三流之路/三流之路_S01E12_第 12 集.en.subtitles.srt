1
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:24,065
Choi Ae-ra, I really like you.

2
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,901
I think I'm going crazy.

3
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:34,534
I've always liked you, you jerk.

4
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,423
If it's all or nothing...

5
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,676
let's go with all.

6
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,386
What?

7
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,641
Do you want to...

8
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,730
sleepover at my apartment today?

9
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:28,922
Are you okay?

10
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:30,632
Let me take a look.

11
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,179
Oh, no...

12
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,516
Gosh, it's bleeding.

13
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,851
Ye-jin!

14
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,781
Be careful.

15
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,991
-Gosh.
-You scared me!

16
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:58,660
What's this?

17
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,745
Why did you come out a closet?

18
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,831
How are you here at this hour?

19
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,959
What's wrong with that?
I'm in front of my house.

20
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,753
What were you two doing in there?

21
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,964
Why did you come out from there?

22
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,008
It's Chronicles of Narnia.
It's their secret passage.

23
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:17,804
-What?
-You knew about it?

24
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:22,851
I didn't say anything about you using it.

25
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,104
Go ahead and have fun all you want.

26
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,606
Drink all you can
while your livers still work.

27
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:33,611
Be innocent, reckless and live
without thoughts...

28
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:38,283
just like children. Don't play around
like adults.

29
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:41,035
For some reason, I want to talk back.

30
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,912
I want to talk back to her.

31
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,122
After you enjoy,

32
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,709
go back to your own rooms, okay?

33
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,004
-We just kissed upstairs.
-Hey.

34
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,013
Wait, hold on.

35
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,599
Mom told me she'd kick me out
if I bring guys over.

36
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,351
-No, I'll leave.
-Please, she'll leave soon.

37
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,520
I'll just tell her what happened.

38
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,481
She'll have her eyes on me.
She'd beat you up if she sees you.

39
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,401
-Why would I get beaten up?
-Just stay here.

40
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:14,777
Ye-jin...

41
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,448
Ye-jin!

42
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,331
Were you sleeping?

43
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,339
Why did you come so late?

44
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:37,133
I have to watch the drama,
it's on already.

45
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,597
Are you going to watch it here?

46
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,479
I knew that was going to happen.

47
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,814
What a jerk. He's sleeping with her.

48
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,485
It's late. You should go.

49
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:06,788
The landlord doesn't have the right
to do this.

50
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,207
-That's right.
-Then...

51
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:13,586
Do tenants have the right to trespass
the rooftop?

52
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,296
She's being hysterical again.

53
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,632
Hey, I can hear you.

54
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:22,220
I think your son
should find you a hobby

55
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:25,974
or suggest you go mountain climbing--

56
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,101
That's enough. Go home. Split up.

57
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,734
You.

58
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,737
Did you just tell him you'll shower
and come back?

59
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,037
I'm already inside your head.

60
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,666
By the way, if someone tells you
not to do something,

61
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,793
it makes you want to do it more.

62
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,461
What?

63
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,298
Do what? What are you talking about?

64
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,758
If Joseon wasn't so strict
and conservative,

65
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:04,429
people wouldn't have sneaked
into the watermill.

66
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:10,601
You might be the one
setting things on fire.

67
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:14,814
Go in.

68
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:18,276
You know what they did at watermills,
right?

69
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,532
Gosh, those two...

70
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,660
-I can see the resemblance.
-What?

71
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:33,583
I can now seeÂ why you stationed
yourself here.

72
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,828
That was above my lips...

73
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:45,465
You have a unique taste.
You must like that area.

74
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,926
You should've stuck out your lips.

75
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,144
I think your intestines
want to say something.

76
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,022
This stupid thing again.

77
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,235
Hey.

78
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:11,199
I'm not a reckless, thoughtless
airhead dude...

79
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,784
who stopped maturing before puberty.

80
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,706
We're dating and now we're sitting
on a bed together.

81
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:25,671
I don't want to be a gentleman
to you at all.

82
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:27,882
You're...

83
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,510
so manly.

84
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,347
Yes.

85
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,058
I want to be a man.

86
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:40,770
But...

87
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,106
this isn't homework.

88
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,234
What?

89
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,945
Even without a turning point like this...

90
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,322
you're not Chewbacca to me.

91
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,033
You're a girl to me.

92
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:58,621
I want to hold you right now
and hug you all night long.

93
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,540
I want you to stay here.

94
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,711
You should keep thoughts like that
to yourself.

95
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,633
So tell your loud intestines
to quiet down.

96
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,943
Just sleep.

97
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,071
I can't sleep just holding your hands.

98
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,240
I'll hug you like crazy.

99
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,034
I need to do this much.

100
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,713
Just sleep.

101
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:54,760
Hey.

102
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:59,223
I feel like I'm going to die.

103
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,104
Is your stomach filled with gas?

104
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:10,401
Well, I can't breathe.

105
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,407
My heart is racing like crazy.

106
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,495
Your heart?

107
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,660
Mr. Kim.

108
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,120
Mr. Kim?

109
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,082
Mr. Kim.

110
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:06,999
Mister...

111
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,778
SUL-HEE

112
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,224
Hey.

113
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,893
Is it your dad this time?

114
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:12,982
Why do people keeping coming
whenever I sleep with you?

115
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,777
Ae-ra, are you there?

116
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,910
Take the soju bottle away.

117
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,088
She just came, too.

118
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,174
-Like, ten minutes ago?
-Yes.

119
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,510
I'm wearing this
because I'm doing laundry.

120
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,184
What's wrong?

121
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,020
Joo-man...

122
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:53,939
didn't come home.

123
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,198
What are you doing with that?

124
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,867
Why is this here?

125
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,577
Why are you wearing jogging trousers?

126
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,287
Why? Do you want to go, too?

127
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,289
You can't hit a girl anyway.

128
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,500
Are you trying to hit someone with this?

129
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,628
I won't, so go to the gym.

130
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,714
-I can't say what I want if you're there.
-Are you going to curse again?

131
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,216
Of course, I will.

132
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,384
Then why do curse words exist?

133
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,847
Yes, Coach.

134
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,683
I need to go somewhere today.

135
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,728
-What?
-What is it now?

136
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,523
Okay, I'm coming.

137
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,736
-Is something up?
-No.

138
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,154
You two go first.

139
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,949
Don't cause trouble
and I'm confiscating this.

140
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,663
Let's go, Sul-hee.

141
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,125
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

142
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,212
You should've told me earlier!

143
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,505
I was scared.

144
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:01,924
What?

145
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,388
If I brought it up,

146
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:11,392
it really is going to become a problem.

147
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,271
But I didn't have the confidence
to beat her.

148
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:16,730
Sul-hee.

149
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,525
You're his girlfriend.
You shouldn't be the one scared.

150
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,945
-You've been seeing him for six years--
-Those six years...

151
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,738
were all I had going for me.

152
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,658
And I realized how weak that is.

153
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:32,246
Time spent with me
must be dull and boring.

154
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,832
But he must've felt excited with her.

155
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:39,420
If he leaves you after all those six years
because of those short excitements,

156
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,088
I won't let him have you.

157
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,090
Come on.

158
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,728
You don't know the apartment number?

159
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,481
I only heard that she lives here.

160
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,612
How could Joo-man...

161
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,450
He may not even be there. I may be wrong.

162
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,827
Something may have happened to him.

163
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,204
Then give that wench a call.

164
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,665
I don't want to.

165
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,833
Why?

166
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,128
It hurts my pride.

167
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,258
Do you really have to do this?

168
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,637
I watched Dong-man's match
and he'll be a star in no time.

169
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,013
What a nonsense.

170
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:34,725
If you search his name online,
that match comes right up.

171
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:39,229
Rather than explaining it later,
it's better to come clean first.

172
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,774
Look.

173
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,402
I didn't do a press conference
even back then.

174
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,738
Why must I do it after ten years?

175
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,115
That way, you become the victim.

176
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,117
What?

177
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,871
If you use the media well,
you'll control the world.

178
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,465
SUL-HEE

179
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,565
Where am I?

180
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:25,859
What's going on?

181
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:30,906
Are you up?

182
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,576
Ye-jin, why didn't you wake me up?

183
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,371
I tried after my mom left,
but you wouldn't get up.

184
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,416
You should've kicked me to wake me up.

185
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,006
I somehow ended up staying the night...

186
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,551
but I fell asleep here.

187
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:54,013
So, I'm sure you slept in your room and...

188
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,932
Don't you remember last night?

189
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,102
Remember what?

190
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:04,231
I came to bring you a blanket and you...

191
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,028
What? Why won't you finish your sentence?

192
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,072
Well, you suddenly hugged me.

193
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:17,828
The moment Joo-man walks out from here,
he's dead meat.

194
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,956
We're not sure yet.

195
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:22,791
Sul-hee.

196
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:27,254
-He won't answer his phone. It's certain--
-I want to go home.

197
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,009
What are you afraid of?

198
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:35,137
Just dump him and carry on with your life.

199
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,307
Work on self-improvement
and follow your dream.

200
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,600
What is my dream?

201
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,603
We can start figuring that out.

202
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,731
You cook well
and you're good at curling my hair, too.

203
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,775
I have a dream.

204
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,736
I always had one.

205
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,614
What nonsense are you talking about?

206
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,618
I didn't drink and even if I did,
I don't make mistakes.

207
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,411
Why are you overreacting?

208
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,246
Because you're lying.

209
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:05,375
You grabbed and pulled my arm
like this yesterday and then...

210
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,795
you hugged me and...

211
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,424
you said, "Sul-hee, turn off the light."

212
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,013
Then you fell asleep snoring.

213
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,265
You really crushed my pride.

214
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,646
42 MISS CALLS

215
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,648
Darn it.

216
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,275
I have a dream.

217
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:34,363
I had one until now, ever since I was six.

218
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:39,493
Why do you think Joo-man
is all that matters to me?

219
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:40,953
That's not what I meant.

220
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:44,123
Dong-man had taekwondo
and you had your microphone.

221
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,208
While you guys were pursuing
you dreams...

222
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,336
I quietly...

223
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,381
kept my dream alive in my heart.

224
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,758
Why didn't you tell me then?

225
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,636
Now you can achieve that dream.

226
00:18:58,762 --> 00:18:59,888
A mom.

227
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,518
My dream is to become a mom.

228
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,312
What?

229
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,940
I always was the mom when we played house.

230
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,110
Being a good mom...

231
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,654
and being a good wife...

232
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,282
is my dream.

233
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,744
I wanted to marry Joo-man...

234
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,372
and have that life.

235
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,709
Sul-hee.

236
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,336
Does that not count as a dream?

237
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,214
Does everyone have to better themselves?

238
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,510
You're all smart and you live
the lives you want.

239
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:43,223
I think it's okay if I just focus
on my family.

240
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,560
That doesn't make me less than you.

241
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,979
That's a great thing to do.

242
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,647
It's all good, but...

243
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,484
-find someone else, not Joo-man--
-To me, Joo-man is...

244
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,196
not just an ordinary boyfriend.

245
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,241
He's my world.

246
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,286
So...

247
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,956
so...

248
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,629
I just want to go home.

249
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:28,143
What's your problem?
Why are you really here?

250
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,439
I somehow...

251
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,986
fell asleep before I knew it.

252
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,988
At the intern's house?

253
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:44,952
Are you actually saying you slept here?

254
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,412
Sul-hee, nothing happened.

255
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,666
Mr. Kim...

256
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,673
He left a sock.

257
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,389
Why did you take off your sock?

258
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:06,848
Why?

259
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,020
Why, if you fell asleep before you knew?

260
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,523
Sul-hee, it's not like that.

261
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,279
I didn't cross the line.

262
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,905
Is that what you all think?

263
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,117
Is everything fine if nothing happened?

264
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,829
I swear nothing happened.

265
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,664
It's the same to me.

266
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,212
Whether you slept together or not,

267
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,506
it's the same.

268
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:41,550
What?

269
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,969
You were here all night...

270
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,597
killing me slowly every few seconds.

271
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:53,562
-Let's...
-Sul-hee, please.

272
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,316
...break up.

273
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,905
Sul-hee's world...

274
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,035
just crumbled.

275
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,341
KIM TAK-SU PRESS CONFERENCE

276
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:26,636
Today at this press conference...

277
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,057
I will reveal the truth about...

278
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:36,605
my fight against Ko Dong-man
back in 2007.

279
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:39,900
I wanted to...

280
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:46,239
hold back, cover it up
and get on with my life.

281
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,867
The money I gave as a favor...

282
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,954
turned into a bribe and compensation.

283
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:59,086
I played fair and square and yet,
I became a victim of a witch hunt.

284
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,130
In order to fix the false past,

285
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:06,468
I, Kim Tak-su, demand Ko Dong-man...

286
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:11,973
to accept my request for a fair match.

287
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,559
As soon as possible...

288
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,358
Don't be rash.

289
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,361
-I know what you're thinking.
-I won't do it.

290
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,948
-What?
-I won't fall for his games.

291
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,617
I won't let him sway me.

292
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,746
You're all grown up.

293
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,582
You told me dumb people
should rely and prove it will skills.

294
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:42,671
I'll train hard and take him next season.

295
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,006
Can you wait?

296
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,134
I know you're impatient.

297
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,844
You also have a temper.

298
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,637
Are you grown up now?

299
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,473
He thinks I'm a kid, too.

300
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,601
I'll train hard and show him.

301
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,605
I'm no longer a tiger cub.

302
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,109
I'm a tiger.

303
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:08,738
Sul-hee.

304
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:12,033
I shouldn't be saying this to you now.

305
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,953
But you were really cool.

306
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,331
It was the best of you I've seen
in over 20 years.

307
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,793
Why? Because I said we should break up?

308
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,212
No, about your dream.

309
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,549
It's cool that your dream isÂ to be a mom.

310
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:33,472
There's nothing more incredible
than a mom.

311
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:46,151
Sul-hee did my hair all six years
of my elementary school.

312
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:56,036
Sul-hee, school doesn't start this early.

313
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,663
Why are you here so early in the morning?

314
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,043
Sul-hee was my first female friend.

315
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,340
My dad didn't know how to dress me up,

316
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:11,801
and no one wanted to be a tomboy's friend.

317
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,096
Pink?

318
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,724
I don't like pink.

319
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,687
When Sul-hee found out
I didn't have a mom,

320
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,148
she came over an hour earlier
before school started.

321
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:30,237
She came to me with her sweet heart.

322
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:33,323
Since you don't have a mom,Â 

323
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:36,159
I'll do your hair for you.

324
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,578
Sul-hee was...

325
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,122
like the vast ocean.

326
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:54,010
Joo-man lost his mind.

327
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,387
Did they sleep together?

328
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,431
Do you think that matters?

329
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,102
-Did they?
-Hey.

330
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:07,607
Let's say for some unavoidable reason,
you spent a night at Hye-ran's.

331
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,568
And I slept only, like in the army?

332
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:13,405
Do you think I should let you off
or kill you?

333
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:14,948
Did I just sleep?

334
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:21,621
-Let's say that I slept out then.
-I'll kill you.

335
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,665
I'll punch your head.

336
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,419
Let's pay.

337
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:34,926
-Kim Tak-su must've been so stressed.
-I bet.

338
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,469
I'm his fan.

339
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,431
Poor guy.

340
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:43,810
You won't do it.

341
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:45,812
You won't, right?

342
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,984
I have to fight him one day.

343
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,570
Not even one day.

344
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,238
I hate it.

345
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,157
I hate Kim Tak-su.

346
00:26:57,365 --> 00:27:00,744
I saw what happened
during your last fight with him.

347
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,538
I hate it, okay?

348
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,710
I'll win.

349
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,962
I won't lose to him again.

350
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,717
Dong-man, am I a pushover to you?

351
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,595
Do you know how much I like you?

352
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:22,015
-What?
-I like you so much that...

353
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,517
if someone were to shoot you
three times,

354
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,479
I'd take two bullets.

355
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,149
Why not three?

356
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:34,069
Then I wouldn't be telling the truth.
That's a lie.

357
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:35,987
But I'm telling the truth.

358
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,366
I can't take all the burden for you,

359
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:45,580
but I'll take two out of three bullets
for you.

360
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:47,874
I'll protect you.

361
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:51,252
Hey.

362
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:55,590
Why are you so great?

363
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:59,177
I like you so much
and I don't want you to do it.

364
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,054
Can you not do it?

365
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:06,476
Ae-ra.

366
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:12,691
I don't want you to protect me.

367
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,485
I'm going to become so strong,

368
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,739
so that nobody can mistreat my girlfriend.

369
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,618
That's what I want.

370
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,080
Can you trust me?

371
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:32,335
IF DREAMS DISAPPEAR
AS YOU MATURE, THEN I'LL...

372
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:40,969
I'll take those.

373
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:47,976
Why did you come pick me up?
Don't you have work?

374
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:51,062
-I took a break.
-Dressed like that?

375
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,481
Sure, you did.

376
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,489
Wait for me.

377
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,366
Are we strangers?

378
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,790
Goodness, all you do is drink.

379
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:31,144
Is this a junk shop? Throw this away.

380
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:38,026
Aren't you going to work?
You're on a business trip.

381
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,736
What about you?

382
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,740
Why are you wearing track pants
during the day?

383
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:45,950
You don't work, right?

384
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,244
You stay at home, right?

385
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,413
I do work.

386
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,874
What do you do wearing track pants?

387
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,794
Why are you home during the day?

388
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:01,049
I came out to pick you up.

389
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,761
It's your first time here,
so you don't know where it is.

390
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,304
Aren't you going to get married?

391
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,598
There you go again.

392
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:09,641
Right.

393
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,978
If you wanted to get married
and feed your family,

394
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:18,066
you'd be doing all sorts of work now.

395
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:21,653
You're old enough to think and plan.

396
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,488
Dad.

397
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,573
I'm not going to get married.

398
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,450
So don't worry about such things.

399
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,327
Why won't you get married?

400
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,579
I have no house or a job.

401
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:35,083
Who would want to get married
to a thoughtless guy?

402
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:39,254
Not everybody starts off
with a huge house.

403
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,297
When I was younger,

404
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:44,801
unlike lazy guys like you,
complaining about your lives,

405
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,846
I went to construction sites
to lay out bricks.

406
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,766
You must have been so diligent,

407
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:55,478
but you never once paid
for my tuition or rent.

408
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,897
Don't tell me to live like you.

409
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,358
But still...

410
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:04,737
I had no money, but still managedÂ to
raise my children with everything I had.

411
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:08,908
Should I live like that
and have a child like me?

412
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,952
I'm not sure about that.

413
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,997
I'm afraid that my child might resent me
for being so poor.

414
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:16,374
What?

415
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,586
Who said you're poor?

416
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:21,504
Gosh.

417
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,518
FROM BAEK SUL-HEE

418
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:48,531
ORGANIC BALLOON FLOWER EXTRACT

419
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,478
Sul-hee, I'm sorry.

420
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,650
Can you pack my things?

421
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,613
Sul-hee, I made a mistake that day.

422
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,740
It was just a mistake.

423
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:34,744
It's not a mistake. It's not just one day.

424
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:39,374
You put your phone on silent mode
every night.

425
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:45,213
Whenever she texted you
and your phone lit up,Â 

426
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:49,801
my heart sank to the ground.

427
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:53,221
How do you think I felt
when I had to let you go...

428
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:57,392
even though I knew
you were going to see her?

429
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:02,438
She was in a car accident and was drunk
the other time...

430
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:03,856
You were bothered.

431
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:06,734
You couldn't ignore her.

432
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,656
Joo-man.

433
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,575
You...

434
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,870
let go of my hand.

435
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,709
Please, Sul-hee. Please...

436
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,754
You thought I'd always be here...

437
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:30,925
even if you let go of my hand
for a moment.

438
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,639
But I don't want to do that anymore.

439
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,893
I thought it would pass like the wind.

440
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,855
But cheating is still cheating.

441
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,149
It's either you cheated or not.

442
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,568
It wasn't about how big the problem was.

443
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,320
I was a fool.

444
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:55,116
Why are you doing this? This isn't you.

445
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,160
Why are you being so determined?

446
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:01,914
-You're doing this because you're mad.
-During our six years of dating,

447
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:05,918
I never said to break up out of anger.

448
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:12,008
I treated you the best I could,
so I have no regrets.

449
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,806
Regrets are all yours.

450
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:22,518
Leave my things outside.

451
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,220
What's that?

452
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:00,765
It's day one today. Congratulations.

453
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:04,769
It's day one of your independence.

454
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:08,147
Blow out the candle.

455
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,285
Hurry and blow it out.

456
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,871
Blow it and just forget about it.

457
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,581
Just don't do it.

458
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,627
Don't do things like this.

459
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,129
What?

460
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,214
I...

461
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,759
can't blow the candles.

462
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,928
You shouldn't have done this.

463
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,055
Sul-hee.

464
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:45,476
Joo-man...

465
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:50,439
How could he do this to you?

466
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:53,526
Joo-man cried.

467
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,738
Joo-man started crying.

468
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,088
Why did you do that?

469
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:17,800
You don't get swayed easily.

470
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,261
You love Sul-hee so much.

471
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,643
Don't pour yourself a drink.

472
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,742
Why did you make Sul-hee cry, you punk?

473
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,299
You crazy jerk.

474
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,843
You better beg her.

475
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,225
My goodness.

476
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,193
Hello?

477
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,070
Yes, Mom.

478
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:25,201
1.2 million? Dad spent 1.2 million won
at a bar?

479
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:27,286
Yes, he's not answering his phone either.

480
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,705
I wonder what's going on.

481
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,668
Your dad would never drink
an expensive alcohol.

482
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:38,256
I wonder if he got his wallet stolen.

483
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,841
Mom, does the text say the bar's name?

484
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,593
Can you send it to me?

485
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,387
Okay.

486
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:58,067
Ko Hyung-sik, you need to wake up.

487
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,403
Sir.

488
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,822
You were too drunk,

489
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,408
so I paid with my card instead.

490
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:07,910
Give me the receipt.

491
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:13,457
Mr. Ko, do you know why...

492
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:17,420
I cut off all young men,

493
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,131
and brought you in?

494
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,176
You've worked in the field for 30 years.

495
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:28,264
Then you need to use your network
for a good cause.

496
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:32,226
You still have too much pride left in you.

497
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:35,229
You're so detached from everything.

498
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,482
Mr. Ko.

499
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:40,818
Ko Hyung-sik.

500
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,781
Are you not going to answer me?

501
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,286
Yes, sir.

502
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,080
I'll try to correct it.

503
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,588
Why don't you just quit?

504
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,965
I won't beg you to stay.

505
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,343
I'm sorry, sir. I won't do it again.

506
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:09,388
You said you have to marry off your son.

507
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,142
You need to get things together.

508
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,102
Okay?

509
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,872
My dad has never...

510
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:37,917
kept the same pace as his family.

511
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:42,254
Wait for me.

512
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,632
Hurry up!

513
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,759
We need to hurry to get seats.

514
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,013
Are you okay?

515
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:55,434
-What's wrong with you?
-I'm sorry.

516
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:00,231
I'm sorry, my kid gets motion sickness.

517
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:03,609
Hurry up. Here, have a seat.

518
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,408
Hold tight.

519
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:13,911
Dong-man.

520
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,540
CLINIC

521
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:19,708
Excuse me, open the door!

522
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:24,839
Open the door, my kid has fever!

523
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,424
He might die!

524
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,301
Please call the doctor, please!

525
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,521
Dad.

526
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,027
Do you want to have a drink with your son?

527
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,382
What are you doing?

528
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,551
Where are you taking that?

529
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,845
Just trust me and follow me.

530
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,354
Hurry up.

531
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:33,782
Hey, what are you doing?

532
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,493
Are you out of your mind?

533
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,361
We're not cats.

534
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,321
Why would you drink outside?

535
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,282
Why are we here?

536
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,368
Just sit down.

537
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,246
There's no other place like this in Seoul.

538
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,295
I didn't know you could make eggs.

539
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,299
Gosh, of course I can.

540
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:35,636
I've been living alone for ten years.

541
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:39,807
Did you drink somewhere?

542
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,727
Don't break the mood.

543
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,396
Just try this.

544
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,528
Don't feed me.

545
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,488
I have hands, too.

546
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:17,761
Dad.

547
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:19,763
What was...

548
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:22,850
your dream?

549
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,479
What nonsense are you talking about?
I never had such a thing.

550
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:31,900
I'm sure you must have hadÂ a dream before.

551
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,404
Not really.

552
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:38,324
You did, I can tell.

553
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,618
What was it?

554
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,329
Tell me, what was it?

555
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:46,915
Well...

556
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:49,376
That...

557
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,670
A pilot.

558
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,297
A pilot?

559
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:57,593
There was a movie called The Red Scarf,
and I shouldn't have watched it.

560
00:43:58,093 --> 00:44:00,179
I suffered so much because of it.

561
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:02,056
I was dying to become a pilot.

562
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:05,184
That's really cool.

563
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,978
You should've tried it.
Why didn't you go for it?

564
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:10,606
We couldn't afford the Air Force Academy.

565
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,486
But now...

566
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:17,780
you guys are my dream.

567
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:27,998
Dad.

568
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,126
I thought...

569
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:34,922
you were always just a dad.

570
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:39,426
Now that I know you had a dream,

571
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:42,805
it feels kind of weird.

572
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:48,560
I feel bad for some reason.

573
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:52,189
My glass is empty. Enough with this,
just pour me a drink.

574
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:03,200
I worked so hard to raise you
and finally you're pouring me a drink.

575
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:04,660
Punk.

576
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,329
You're just like me.

577
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,957
You're so stiff, too.

578
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:14,586
Dad, just wait.

579
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:20,092
I can't help you become a pilot,

580
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:23,595
but I'll let you fly first class
on a plane one day.

581
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:27,307
That's the closest to the cockpit.

582
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:30,686
Crazy punk.

583
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,313
Mister!

584
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,191
Ae-ra!

585
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:39,903
I didn't think I'd get to see you
before I leave.

586
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,450
Can't you smile like that to me, too?

587
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,660
Do you like Ae-ra more than your son?

588
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:51,373
It's no fun when two boring guys drink.
I need to join to brighten up the mood.

589
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:55,127
Actually, he even scooped up
the egg yolk for me.

590
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:56,795
Really?

591
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:03,260
By the way, did you two...

592
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,221
do it?

593
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:14,521
Do what?

594
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:20,402
I told you two and Sul-hee
to start a money saving system.

595
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,989
This is the best way to save money.

596
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,744
Right, savings...

597
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,996
Saving money is the best--

598
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:32,372
Are you not going to do it?

599
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,753
What's this? Is it a warehouse?

600
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:41,423
I'm doing something here.

601
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,927
Hwang Jang-ho's Gym?

602
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,095
Isn't Hwang Jang-ho that man?

603
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,229
Sir, I'm the one that talked him into it.
It's not his fault.

604
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:57,147
Coach...

605
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:08,659
Sir, do you want to eat some snacks?

606
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,161
You can also watch his videos...

607
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,831
Dad, you must be surprised.

608
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,710
I think I'll just go.

609
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:37,104
I guess you were wearing trainers
because you're always here.

610
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:41,441
Dad, I may not make money right away,

611
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:43,819
-but if you trust me--
-Dong-man.

612
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:46,154
I didn't live like this.

613
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:51,785
I went to work early in the morning
and came home late.

614
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,454
I worked and slept. That's all I ever did.

615
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:58,667
I know that you worked hard all your life.

616
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:04,715
I know you must be unhappy
how I don't live like you, but...

617
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:06,008
But...

618
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,052
don't live like me.

619
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,055
What?

620
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,102
I thought it over, and...

621
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:23,025
if you wanted to live like me,
I don't think I would like that.

622
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,320
It's too late for me to become a pilot,

623
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:31,033
but you're young enough
to try something once.

624
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:33,952
So...

625
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,499
just live as you want.

626
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:43,253
Really?

627
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,174
Can I really live as I want?

628
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:48,675
Although you keep sighing?

629
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,303
It's because I'm pathetic.

630
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:58,810
It breaks my heart that you couldn't do
what you wanted for all these years.

631
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:04,942
Why does it break your heart?
I always had fun.

632
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:06,860
You know how I am.

633
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:11,657
Because your dad's business failed...

634
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:16,203
you had to sacrifice your youth
and take care of Dong-hee.

635
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,374
I feel like you bore all the burden...

636
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,127
and gave up on your dream.

637
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:29,883
When I look at you, my heart...

638
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,052
Darn it.

639
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,225
Stop talking nonsense.

640
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:43,021
But seeing you do this...

641
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:46,149
I feel like I can breathe again.

642
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:50,195
I'm so excited that my heart is racing.

643
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:56,076
I didn't give up on my dream
because of you.

644
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,037
You need to let it go.

645
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:04,418
Dong-man, you're family isn't poor.

646
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,422
Your dad is going to make money
for another 20 years.

647
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,215
I have your back.

648
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:12,968
So fly high.

649
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:18,098
Let me fly first class, thanks to my son.

650
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:22,269
You can't save your youth anyway.

651
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:25,856
Fight, take challenges,
and even if you get beaten up,

652
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:29,985
live your life how you want, okay?

653
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:37,492
Okay, Gyeonggi-do Bucheon...

654
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:42,372
Characters in TV dramas get sick all day
after a break up.

655
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,416
But as for me,Â 

656
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,170
I broke up yesterday
and I'm still smiling today.

657
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,840
I hope you have a great day.

658
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,468
-Okay.
-You too.

659
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,846
-Pardon?
-I hope you'll be happy, too.

660
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:26,458
I'm really sorry.

661
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:32,339
But my feelings for him are sincere.

662
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:36,426
I really want to go out with him.

663
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:42,891
I feel really bad and guilty.

664
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,227
Do as you wish.

665
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,105
It's not like Joo-man and I are married.

666
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,774
He can date you since I broke up with him.

667
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,692
There's no need to tell me as well.

668
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:55,403
Unnie...

669
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:59,866
-Still, I'm very sorry.
-But Ye-jin...

670
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:10,961
I'm allowed to throw water on you, right?

671
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:14,756
It was different when you didn't know,
but this time you knew, which makes you...

672
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:16,341
a pure...

673
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:18,802
evil wench.

674
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:22,722
Unnie, still this isn't...

675
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:28,270
I hope one day, you'll be in my shoes.

676
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:33,358
I hope tears pour out
from those innocent eyes.

677
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:36,570
Even if you're upset, how could you...

678
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:38,488
curse me?

679
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:40,615
Joo-man...

680
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,327
liked me a lot.

681
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:52,335
It wasn't that vague excitement
he feels toward you right now.

682
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:57,340
He liked me like crazy.

683
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:03,638
Those moments when I was immature
and pretty like you...

684
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,433
Those passionate moments...

685
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:12,439
Joo-man remembers them all.

686
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:19,154
If you go out with him...

687
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:23,783
I sincerely hope that...

688
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:29,122
those memories will haunt you forever.

689
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,264
He told me to wait for a bit.
Where did he go?

690
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:49,226
Dad!

691
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:55,148
Call me when you get home.

692
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,234
-Let's talk often, okay?
-Sure.

693
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:15,919
He won't look back once.

694
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,152
Gosh...

695
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,905
He's so lame.

696
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,366
Whom does he take after?

697
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:53,790
When did he clean up the room?

698
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:16,187
Buy a new chair.

699
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:25,238
My dad's so lame.

700
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:33,204
Fight, take challenges,
and even if you get beaten up,Â 

701
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:36,249
live your life how you want, okay?

702
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:51,097
What's with that face?
You're scaring me.

703
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:53,308
Coach.

704
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:55,685
What? What is it this time?

705
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:59,147
I'm going to stop pretending to be mature.

706
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:01,900
I want to do it my way.

707
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:04,527
What are you trying to say?

708
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:08,365
For the past ten years,

709
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:12,202
I thought about November 3, 2007,
every single day.

710
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:16,748
Whenever I saw Kim Tak-su succeed,

711
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:19,459
I regretted and clenched my teeth
in anger.Â 

712
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:22,504
My heart was in such frustration
every single day.

713
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:28,426
So don't tell me to wait more
or to take detours.

714
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:32,889
Hey, you said you knew
why he was doing that.

715
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:36,810
Coach, I may be unable to hit Doo-ho
when he's hurt,

716
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:40,063
but I'll take Kim Tak-su
even if he twists my ankle.

717
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:43,817
I may tap out when sparring against you,

718
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:48,071
but I'll fight until I die
against Kim Tak-su.

719
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:49,823
So please...

720
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:53,827
let me free myself from that day
ten years ago.

721
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,537
Let me...

722
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,707
just do it, please!

723
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:02,419
You'd better do it right.

724
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:06,131
Kill Kim Tak-su properly.

725
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:16,474
Ae-ra!

726
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:24,441
What is it now?

727
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:27,527
You're scaring me.
Why are you all worked up again?

728
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:31,030
Ae-ra, I'm going to do it.

729
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:33,450
I'm going to fight Kim Tak-su
no matter what.

730
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:36,703
You'll lose.

731
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,373
-He knows you'll lose, so--
-Who cares if I lose?

732
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,210
-What?
-I'm not doing this to beat him.

733
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:47,338
I'm finally doing
what I've been dying to do.

734
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:48,882
I'll just fly.

735
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,926
No one can beat someone who's having fun.

736
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:56,222
If your dream fades as you mature,Â 

737
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:58,975
I'll just give up on growing up.

738
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:01,019
What?

739
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:04,063
There's no need to pretend
to be grown up for others.

740
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:07,275
You save it, you lose it.

741
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:10,570
So that's why...

742
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,656
I ran to you like this.

743
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,117
What now?

744
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:19,662
To be completely blunt and...

745
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,624
-say what I want...
-Say what?

746
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:27,420
I love you.

747
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:32,091
I love you so much I could die.

748
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:36,429
Like crazy, like an immature kid...

749
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:38,765
I love you.

750
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:42,560
I love you, Ae-ra.

751
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:49,317
Me too.

752
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:00,328
I love you, too.

753
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:02,705
You immature punk.

754
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,044
Man...

755
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,299
Ae-ra, I...

756
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,763
I love you like crazy!

757
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,520
I love you, Choi Ae-ra!

758
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:54,257
Obba.

759
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:57,927
Hyung-sik obba.

760
