1
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,065
You can't do this when someone's sick.

2
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,902
That's cheating.

3
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,323
Then I'll cheat today.

4
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,344
Dong-man, this isn't what you think.

5
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:38,765
-Are you two dating?
-What?

6
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,351
Are you boyfriend and girlfriend?

7
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,019
No, not exactly.

8
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,771
Then why did you kiss her?

9
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:50,151
You should ask her to be your girlfriend
and make it clear before kissing her.

10
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,529
Why did you kiss her
without her approval first?

11
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:57,242
-Why did you kiss her like some scumbag?
-Why do you care?

12
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,954
You should stop acting like her friend
and be clear with me.

13
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:02,831
Why do you care?

14
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:04,958
Do you like Ae-ra?

15
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:09,629
Do you?

16
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,432
I...

17
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:25,979
I'm her guardian.

18
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,526
He's so reliable that I want to kill him.

19
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,696
Just have a fling
and don't cross the line.

20
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,656
Watch it before I lose my temper.

21
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,492
-Why would you lose temper?
-What?

22
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,203
Why are you crossing the line again?

23
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,873
Is there any reason why I can't date him?

24
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,503
He does all sorts of things to impress me.

25
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,424
-He says I'm a goddess.
-That's why he's a swindler.

26
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:58,136
To be honest,
you're not even close to a goddess.

27
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,555
I said she's a goddess because she's one.

28
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:03,391
See? He's a freak.
So make sure he doesn't flirt with you.

29
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,853
-No, I don't want to.
-What?

30
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,146
Excuse me?

31
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:12,901
He's a successful man and he's kind.
Also, he likes me like crazy.

32
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,945
So, why should I stop him from flirting?

33
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,280
Why?

34
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:23,953
-Did I say anything?
-Who are you to stick your nose in?

35
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,290
Do you like me?

36
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,046
I do like you!

37
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,756
You...

38
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,638
Sul-hee, Joo-man are all important to me.

39
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,602
-You're my friends.
-Since I'm your friend...

40
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,105
-you should congratulate me.
-For what?

41
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,649
We kissed,

42
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:56,361
and like you said, if friends do that,
he's a scumbag so...

43
00:03:58,529 --> 00:03:59,781
we're dating as of today.

44
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:05,912
Problem solved.

45
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,267
I'm so sorry.

46
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,060
Not at all. 

47
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:33,273
I was totally moved
by what you said earlier.

48
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,693
When you said we're dating,
my heart was pounding.

49
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,489
I'm sorry because...

50
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,618
it's not like I'm totally into you
or anything.

51
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,329
I was being impulsive when I said
we were dating.

52
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,249
Still, you can't take it back.

53
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,709
No backsies.

54
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,879
-What?
-Many people first kiss and then date.

55
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,008
Many started to grow feelings
after they start dating.

56
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,886
So please date me ten times.

57
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,598
I know I can get you to like me.

58
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:12,312
I'll make you a princess.

59
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,189
A princess?

60
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,734
-Me?
-Yes.

61
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:22,071
So whatever the case is, we're now dating.

62
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,337
Hey!

63
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,842
The taxi's waiting.
Didn't you say your stomach hurts?

64
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,886
We need to get in the taxi!

65
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,097
Did you throw a rock at me?

66
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:49,557
Is that a real rock?

67
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,559
You didn't get hurt, so don't complain.

68
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:54,520
I can't complain?
What kind of trash talk is that?

69
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,238
-My lovely Ae-ra.
-Lovely what?

70
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,617
Call me before you go to sleep.

71
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:12,205
Why? Do you have something to tell me?

72
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,583
Well, couples... usually...

73
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,878
I see, that's why you asked me to call.

74
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,423
It's been so long
since I dated someone new.

75
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:27,428
I dated Moo-ki for two years ,
so I think I forgot what dating is.

76
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,765
Why are you rambling on like an idiot?

77
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,227
I'll call you before I go to sleep.

78
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,896
-Okay, get home safely.
-Okay.

79
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,113
Hey, sit in the front!

80
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,876
Hey, IBS.

81
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,045
Hey, farty.

82
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,797
Are you really dating?

83
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,801
-Are you really?
-Why would I fake it?

84
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,761
Extra pork ears, please.

85
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,304
Extra liver for me.

86
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,474
Please?

87
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:20,231
I wasn't crazy about Moo-ki at first,
but I grew to like him more.

88
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:22,066
Once I start dating, I'll try my best.

89
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,360
I'll do my best not to hurt him.
He's a nice guy.

90
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,028
I told you, I'm against it. 

91
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,113
It seems shady.

92
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,199
Calling you a goddess is just weird.

93
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,660
How are you a goddess?

94
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,246
Have you ever been slapped while eating?

95
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,748
Hey, take this.

96
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,543
NATIONAL ATHLETE'S SAUSAGE

97
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,838
Ae-ra. If he asks you to lend him money,

98
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,715
tell him you're friends with a fighter.

99
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,968
The way he sweet talks people is fake.

100
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,304
My lovely Ae-ra? A goddess?

101
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,264
I need to date him.

102
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,809
Life is too bitter and exhausting,
so I need some sugar in life.

103
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,605
I don't need a stupid guy friend,
but someone that's mine.

104
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:04,192
Someone sweet and straightforward.
I need someone that's mine.

105
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:10,364
It's a shame you're not a dog
I can put a leash on.

106
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:25,046
-Sul-hee, this tastes really good.
-It's so good.

107
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,633
You really got a boyfriend?
You're going on a real date tonight?

108
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,720
Yes, it's black or white for me.
I don't like ambiguity.

109
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,598
How could Ae-ra date Moo-bin?

110
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,352
You and Moo-bin keep getting involved
with the same girls.

111
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,188
What girls?

112
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,232
Don't you remember from high school?
Jang...

113
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,901
-Jang Hee-kyung.
-Jang Hee-kyung? No.

114
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,362
Then Shim Min-young?

115
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,739
I told you, I never dated her.

116
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,909
The Choi Yun-mi?
The big mouth Yun-mi?

117
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,244
Jang Bo-ram.

118
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,746
One of the five princesses
from Chunbang High School.

119
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,209
Oh, that girl that dates the best ones?

120
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,961
I only date the best.

121
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,297
Moo-bin liked her.

122
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:09,924
-Really?
-Yes.

123
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,386
Why would my Moo-bin like someone
like that?

124
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,887
Did you just say My Moo-bin?

125
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,598
Yes, my lovely Moo-bin.

126
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,434
You have your Hye-ran, too.

127
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,231
BUS STOP

128
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,823
Hey, Ae-ra.

129
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,158
Don't do anything stupid
and come home early.

130
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,493
Why should I?

131
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,453
-Why?
-Is something going on?

132
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,749
Don't you want to watch TV?
Twice is on.

133
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,293
Twice is going to be on?

134
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,379
So you better come home early.

135
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,132
-I'll see.
-What? You'll see?

136
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:55,177
My roomie, you're not staying all night,
are you?

137
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,054
Will all the Twice members be on?

138
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,517
Wow, all of you have lost your minds.

139
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,438
Dong-man, there's your bus.

140
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,983
See you tonight.
No, actually see you tomorrow.

141
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,738
I think you look great with a ponytail.

142
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,365
-You look like Twice.
-Really?

143
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,950
Which member?

144
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,793
I'll kill him.

145
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,883
There's a new building over there.

146
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,302
It is going to be very profitable.

147
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,471
What about this gym?

148
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,849
This here? This is just a warehouse.

149
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,018
It isn't worth investing in.

150
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,648
I like this building.

151
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,149
What?

152
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:53,319
I fee like it's in a good location.

153
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,492
If the owner wants to put it
on the market...

154
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,372
contact me first.

155
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,917
Yes, sure. I got it.

156
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,002
BECOME AN ANNOUNCER
WITH BOOM UP ACADEMY

157
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,547
For a special case like you...

158
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,675
A special case?

159
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,261
You'd need to take
the premium intensive course.

160
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,347
You're not young.

161
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,559
Also, you have no experience. 

162
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,897
We just started a special course.

163
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:34,985
We'll have famous announcers come in
as your role model and a lecturer.

164
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,657
-You look so beautiful.
-You're my role model.

165
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,033
Can I take a photo with you?

166
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,038
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

167
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,456
Isn't she so pretty?

168
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,128
What an ill-fated relationship.

169
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,089
INTERVIEW FOR NEW ANNOUNCERS

170
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,676
What kind of an announcer
do you want to become?

171
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,724
I want to become just like Baek Ji-yeon.

172
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,769
I don't want to be like other announcers.

173
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,272
I'll make a name for myself
as Park Hye-ran.

174
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,402
Obba!

175
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:24,326
She used to always beat me
by calling Obbas then she upgraded...

176
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,832
Father.

177
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:35,087
When she called him "Father"...

178
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,216
I knew the game was completely over.

179
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,265
Are you really going to try it?

180
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:51,812
What do you mean?

181
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,732
I just think you're brave. 

182
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,151
If you can do it, why can't I?

183
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:01,655
-I'll just give my best--
-You sure do try your best in everything.

184
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:13,042
-Did you park?
-Yes, it's 2079.

185
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,168
Sure.

186
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,420
Ae-ra!

187
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,173
Moo-bin!

188
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,759
You're early.

189
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:25,179
Of course, it's our first official date.

190
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,600
Hello.

191
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,144
Yes, hello. 

192
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,650
Are you her fan, too?

193
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:41,737
No, she's our hospital's VIP,
so I met her before. 

194
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:51,121
You were worried, but it looks good.

195
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,623
Excuse me?

196
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:58,045
I see, our Park announcer.
You sure tried hard too, didn't you?

197
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,008
-Let's go, Moo-bin.
-Sure.

198
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,807
Let's say your opponent
has collapsed on the floor.

199
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,976
But he's trying to circle around
to stay in.

200
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,186
Then just circle around with him.

201
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,396
Just keep punching.

202
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,858
Keep on hitting until he falls.

203
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:23,028
Then chock him. This isn't
the Ultraman pose, it's a chock.

204
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,114
If he still has strength,

205
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,241
then punch him again.

206
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,909
There, and there.

207
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:32,872
When he's weak, take his left arm
and do an armlock. 

208
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,458
Armlock! This is the killer technique.

209
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,504
This technique is very dangerous
and you could kill people.

210
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:41,839
So, please don't use it.

211
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,050
Why would I ever need to chock anyone?

212
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,595
Come on, I think you will.

213
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,639
-Does your husband come home early?
-I don't know.

214
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,851
-I wish a dog would just snatch him away.
-Sorry?

215
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,562
The coach is the sexy type,

216
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,690
while he's young just like a son.

217
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,612
By the way, does Young-ki's mom
know about him?

218
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,906
She'll go crazy if she finds out.

219
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,198
Who's Young-ki's mom?

220
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,533
The landlord.

221
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,660
Since the coach can't pay the rent,

222
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,538
she'll be mad if she finds out
a new instructor was hired. 

223
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,417
We're behind on rent?

224
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,049
Press is all about timing.

225
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,677
They're going to release this
right after his debut match.

226
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,472
I got this in advance
and you are mentioned.

227
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:32,681
He's crazy.

228
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,143
He's out of his mind.

229
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,145
Sue him for defamation right now.

230
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:44,026
-Tak-su, how can we sue?
-Then what do you plan on doing?

231
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:48,906
Hold on, we need bigger issues
to cover this.

232
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:52,618
Like what? What's worse than this?

233
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,578
Do you even realize how bad it is?

234
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,831
-Instead of scheming something--
-Forget it.

235
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,626
I'm going to do things my way this time.

236
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,128
You all better keep your mouths shut.

237
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,046
Got it?

238
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:10,427
-I can't give you more time. That's it.
-Ma'am, I promise.

239
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,180
I promise I'll pay the rent next month.

240
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,474
I'm not a charity organization.

241
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:18,227
I have someone who wants to buy
this place right now.

242
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,270
Why should I be considerate of you?

243
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:23,649
Ma'am, don't be like that.

244
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,026
Don't you know I respect you all the time?

245
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,113
-I always bring you pork sausages.
-Why do you do that?

246
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,490
-I'm on a diet.
-You're on a diet?

247
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,159
Then you should be working out here.

248
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,162
Forget it. Anyway, I warned you.

249
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:41,166
Ma'am, how can I move out next month?

250
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,002
Please understand us.

251
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,046
Ma'am, we'll have a star born from here.

252
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,382
Hey, scholarship student.

253
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:55,556
Hey you, Hwang Jang-ho's favorite,
Ko Dong-man.

254
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,476
-What's wrong with you again?
-You be quiet. 

255
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:06,358
Why is our coach using his own money
to train you?

256
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,947
Why does he have to do this
for your dream?

257
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,950
Did you know he started working
lunch hours, too?

258
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,745
He said it's a busy season
for pork sausages.

259
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,914
How can there be a season
for pork sausages, you idiot?

260
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:36,138
Ma'am, hello. 

261
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:41,101
-Did you finish talking to him?
-Well, I told him...

262
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,490
I'm sorry.

263
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,618
The chief director came from Japan
all of a sudden.

264
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,828
I'll greet him and come right back.

265
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:04,124
It's okay, take your time.
I'll wait at a coffee shop inside.

266
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,001
Right?

267
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:09,463
You're my girlfriend now,
so you wouldn't mind waiting for me.

268
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,632
You're my girlfriend.

269
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,927
You're like...

270
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,972
-Like what?
-Like a little girl.

271
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,185
Didn't you say you were a year younger?

272
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:24,853
What?

273
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,982
TV series these days just ruin men.

274
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,527
What? A little girl?

275
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,697
My lovely Ae-ra is sexy
when she sounds like an old man.

276
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:40,786
It's just Ae-ra. Don't say "Lovely Ae-ra."

277
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,580
-Use your tongue properly.
-I will.

278
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,249
I'll be right back.

279
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:56,135
-What brings you here?
-I have to attend a meeting.

280
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,096
He even speaks Japanese.

281
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,349
Why is he so perfect?

282
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,270
NEW PATIENT REGISTRATION

283
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,374
Hello, how have you been?

284
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,544
I've been wanting to see you.

285
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,714
Why would you want to see me?

286
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:34,756
You see...

287
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,968
I wanted to officially apologize.

288
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,054
What? Same with me.

289
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:44,016
I want to officially apologize as well.

290
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,226
We heard from Moo-bin.

291
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:50,606
We didn't know this would happen.
Please excuse my manners.

292
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:56,361
So you think it's okay to treat a girl
you don't know the way you did?

293
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,073
I'm sorry.

294
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,869
We'll have to see each other, so...

295
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,580
-Don't sit down.
-Okay.

296
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,250
Also, we have to see each other
tomorrow night,

297
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,461
so it'd be better if we can make up
in advance. 

298
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,338
Why would I see you tomorrow?

299
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,966
Aren't you coming to the event
at 6 p.m. tomorrow?

300
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,010
The "People in Medicine" event.

301
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,762
Sorry?

302
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,597
I guess he hasn't told you yet.

303
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,683
He wasn't sure if he should ask you.

304
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,810
He didn't want to pressure you.

305
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,980
Everyone's bringing partners, but...

306
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:36,318
Moo-bin, that shy boy, always came alone
and stayed in the corner.

307
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:41,531
I think he really... likes you, Ae-ra.

308
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:45,244
I think he's in love with you already.

309
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,017
Is that a seafood stew?

310
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,311
You'll never make a profit doing that.

311
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,314
The sausages, too.

312
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,733
Do they have to be so well-stuffed?

313
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:20,612
Your debut match is two days away.
Why worry about my sausages?

314
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:22,948
Go back and train.

315
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,950
Did you do jujitsu move 100 times?

316
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,162
-I'll come with you.
-Where to?

317
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,792
-To sell sausages.
-Why would you follow me?

318
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,463
I'll help you from now on.

319
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,967
I'll be your intern for no pay.

320
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,184
Drive-in-cinemas are so old-fashioned
and boring.

321
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:57,858
One netizen had his first kiss
in a drive-in-cinema.

322
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:04,990
You should really stop
looking things up online.

323
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,784
Let's go to a cart bar after the movie.

324
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:15,334
In a movie, Jung Woo-sung and Son Ye-jin
drink soju together at a cart bar.

325
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,836
They're actors.

326
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,673
To me, you are prettier
than Son Ye-jin or Koo Hye-sun.

327
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,009
You're up there with Song Hye-kyo.

328
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,389
You must like Song Hye-kyo.

329
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,100
She's my ideal woman.

330
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,607
Can I ask if...

331
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:42,319
this is your first time dating?

332
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,613
What? What is?

333
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,240
When was your last date?

334
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,452
My last date...

335
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,247
When I did mandatory army service...

336
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,585
I liked a daughter of a galbi restaurant.

337
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:02,422
Now that I think about it, I don't know
if I liked her or the galbi.

338
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,760
Did you like each other?

339
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:16,728
That means you never really dated
someone...

340
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,897
I'm experienced.

341
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,233
I'm very versed.

342
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,623
You're really versed.

343
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:39,626
Watch your hand.

344
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,592
-What?
-Where's the salt?

345
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:49,803
What?

346
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:53,223
Where's the salt
that you took last August?

347
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:58,270
Why do you need salt so late at night?
You're a psycho.

348
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:03,442
-Not you, Moo-bin. I meant him.
-Right.

349
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:07,154
Are you still with that jerk?

350
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,322
It's none of your business.

351
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,451
Are you indoor or outdoor?

352
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,454
I really think you have problems.

353
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:24,171
-Moo-bin, I'll go out and talk to him.
-You can talk here.

354
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:33,388
Are you indoor or outdoor?

355
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,724
It can be both indoor and outdoor.

356
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,226
What nonsense is that? Where are you?

357
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,730
-In a car.
-What? A car?

358
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,026
-Why are you in a car?
-We're watching a movie.

359
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,362
Why would you watch a movie
in a car? To do what?

360
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:55,660
-We're at a drive-in-cinema.
-What? A drive-in-cinema?

361
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:58,872
Wait.

362
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,043
Are you... just watching a movie?

363
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:09,090
I haven't yet decided
whether I'll just be watching a movie.

364
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:13,845
If you keep calling me for nothing,
I will block you.

365
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,354
Hey, hang up.

366
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:26,358
Wait, what's this noise?

367
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,361
What is this lunatic doing?

368
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,780
-What's this noise?
-This?

369
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:35,033
It's the sound of kissing.

370
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,536
Hello? Hello?

371
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,419
Darn it!

372
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,758
No, wait. Let me think.

373
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,221
DRIVE-IN-CINEMAS IN SEOUL

374
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,063
Coach, are drive-in-cinemas different
from DVD rooms?

375
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,022
What?

376
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,360
-Drive-in-cinemas and what?
-Never mind.

377
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,946
How would you know?
You've never been to one.

378
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,450
I've been to one, I'm a huge fan!

379
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,327
Are drive-in-cinemas wholesome?

380
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,121
Of course not.

381
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:24,040
In a drive-in-cinema, I...

382
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,501
What is he laughing about?

383
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,128
LOL

384
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:30,213
Why is he laughing?

385
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,841
LOL

386
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,636
LOL

387
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,305
Gosh.

388
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,773
What are you doing?

389
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:52,152
-Get in right now!
-Why? What for?

390
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:56,906
-I need to put these away. Wait!
-We need to go now!

391
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,200
-We need to take these!
-Get in!

392
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,123
Talk to me, where are we going?

393
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,083
To sell sausages.

394
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:13,006
Hello, is that the Jamsil drive-in-cinema?

395
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,592
Are you showing a movie right now?

396
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,720
Movie sausages?

397
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:23,391
-We're selling in the cinema?
-Is that Namsan drive-in-cinema?

398
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,863
Hey, don't be so rough. 

399
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:39,991
Park properly.
Where are you going?

400
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,369
Hey!

401
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,537
Where are you going?

402
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,505
Why did it drop?

403
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,349
Choi Ae-ra!

404
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:10,480
You brat! I'm sorry.

405
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,190
Sorry.

406
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,945
Another couple's kissing.
I'm so mad.

407
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,030
This is so annoying.

408
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:21,324
Where is she?

409
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,381
-Hey!
-Why are you here?

410
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:37,507
I was just...

411
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,093
Just a moment, I...

412
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:56,860
Where did he go?

413
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:10,457
-Did you eat half the popcorn?
-Yes, I was hungry.

414
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,709
Ae-ra, fasten your seat belt.

415
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,798
-The movie's not over yet.
-It's a happy ending.

416
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:19,841
Pardon?

417
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,387
Where is he? Park Moo-bin!

418
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,726
Hey! Come back!

419
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,398
What did you just do?

420
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,276
I always wanted to pull a girl's ponytail.

421
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,743
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

422
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:03,843
It was worth the try.

423
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,640
There's something called
a business district.

424
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:12,018
If we sell sausages there,
what about the fish stands?

425
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,896
What?

426
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,816
Stands at drive-in-cinemas
need the business.

427
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:22,278
I don't want to steal their business
to sell sausages.

428
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,822
That's my business motto.

429
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:28,034
Okay, fine. I won't come up
with ideas anymore.

430
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,287
How many times do I have to tell you?

431
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:34,040
Your head isn't meant to churn out ideas.

432
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,813
What again? Why are you keep calling?

433
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:59,566
Hey, what are you doing?
Why didn't you answer earlier?

434
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,609
I went around looking for you.

435
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,027
What are you talking about?

436
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,573
What is it? Is it something urgent?

437
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,533
Never mind.

438
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:12,579
Just get me some ice cream
on your way home.

439
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:15,999
When did I ever get you an ice-cream?

440
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:21,296
-You never do, so you can get me one now.
-Stop calling for no reason.

441
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,508
Is it Ko Dong-man again?

442
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:29,679
I don't know what's wrong with him today.

443
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:35,351
What is she doing?
Why does she keep hanging up?

444
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,562
Gosh.

445
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:38,980
Dong-man.

446
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,236
I got grocery, so I can make you dinner.

447
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,447
You used to like carbonara.

448
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,576
I don't like carbonara.

449
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,411
I ate it because you liked it.

450
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:56,414
I guess there must be things
I don't know about you.

451
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,166
I bet you hardly know me.

452
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:01,044
When I was with you, I wasn't myself.

453
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:11,638
There she goes again.

454
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:14,474
Why isn't she getting off?

455
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,395
Ae-ra, hold on.

456
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,443
Have a seat here.

457
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,125
What is this?

458
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,670
Look at what the scumbag is doing.

459
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:48,174
Before we started dating,
I gave you sneakers.

460
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,842
But now that we're dating,

461
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,428
I wanted to give you something
more like Cinderella.

462
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,015
Cinderella?

463
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,020
Try it on. I remembered your shoe size.

464
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,022
And this.

465
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:04,857
I wrote you a card.

466
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:11,614
Aren't these real jewels?

467
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:13,324
What?

468
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:17,078
If you keep giving me gifts,
you'll make me uncomfortable.

469
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,746
These look expensive.

470
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:23,459
Then, I'll just be wasting 68,000 won.

471
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,128
What?

472
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,380
Sixty thousand something won?

473
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:32,176
The owner told me they were on sale,
so I can't get a refund.

474
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,221
The owner who sold you these shoes?

475
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,729
Wait, I'll take these,

476
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,605
and I'll get you a pair, too.

477
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,275
I can get you something
that's 100,000 won.

478
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,902
Let's exchange gifts like that.

479
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:54,073
You don't have to give something back.

480
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,869
Hey, move your car.

481
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,954
Move your car right now.

482
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,497
This is assigned parking only.

483
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,502
Is this your spot?
You don't even have a car.

484
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,673
You keep quiet.
Don't try to go between us.

485
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,010
Does this bother you?
Then you shouldn't come here.

486
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,845
-This is my territory.
-My goodness.

487
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,181
Didn't Ae-ra tell you to stay away?

488
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:23,603
A guy friend like you shouldn't
even talk to her official boyfriend.

489
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,938
You don't know anything.

490
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:29,734
I'm not any guy friend to her.

491
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:32,612
-What are you, then?
-Yes, what are you, then?

492
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:35,782
I am...

493
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,286
sort of...

494
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,206
her husband-like friend.

495
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,460
What... did you say?

496
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,128
Friends with common history.

497
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,590
Her owner, major shareholder
and her dad's proxy.

498
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,968
Did my dad say he gives you
the permission?

499
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,470
Are you taking his side?

500
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:59,764
Ae-ra, are you taking my side?

501
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:03,017
Why would he take your side?
You're ridiculous.

502
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,895
Why do you keep talking down
on my Moo-bin?

503
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,480
My Moo-bin?

504
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:11,484
Have I ever called your Hye-ran
this wench or witch?

505
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,029
-You haven't?
-Well, I did it behind her back.

506
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:16,948
Only behind her back.

507
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,786
CHIEF ADMINISTRATOR

508
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,204
They're calling you again.

509
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,498
You should go.
I'll call you tomorrow.

510
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,459
You should go, too.

511
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,169
I don't like carbonara.

512
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,548
My lovely Ae-ra, tomorrow...

513
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,426
Never mind.

514
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:41,931
My gosh!

515
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:52,275
Hye-ran was waiting in front of my house.

516
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,485
I didn't call her to come...

517
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,662
I DIDN'T TELL HER TO COME, FROM DONG-MAN

518
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,500
AE-RA

519
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,380
-Yes.
-Why are you telling me that?

520
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:19,468
Because you could have thought
I told her to come.

521
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,929
What was that about salt?
What about ice cream?

522
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,848
Why did you ask him to move his car?

523
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:27,101
-It's assigned parking only.
-It's not.

524
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:31,397
If you got home and if he parked,
you should get off

525
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,524
and say goodbye.

526
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,568
Why were you waiting inside?
To do what?

527
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,695
Hey.

528
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:42,575
Damn, she hung up again.

529
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,163
It really pisses me off.

530
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,759
He did all this by hand.

531
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,181
When we were in middle school,

532
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:08,434
we used to write love letters
to our crushes.

533
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:11,103
That's exactly what he's doing right now.

534
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,023
Is this me?

535
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:20,947
I want you to date someone like him,
not Moo-ki.

536
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,374
Ae-ra, you're so pretty. You're a goddess.

537
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,503
For a woman to be happy,

538
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,047
she's supposed to meet a man
that likes her more,

539
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,340
not the other way around.

540
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:47,556
Gosh, he liked all my photos.

541
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:49,809
Look at him.

542
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,481
Park Moo-bin is a total psycho.

543
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,317
There's hearts everywhere.

544
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,279
He's stalking on her social media as well.

545
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:18,296
Why did this punk like my photo?

546
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,924
You're ugly.

547
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,261
Gosh.

548
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:33,769
He says she's prettier than Son Ye-jin,
Koo Hye-sun and Song Hye-kyo.

549
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,771
Song Hye-kyo, my ass.

550
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,440
You mean Song-hae?

551
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,942
National Singing Contest!

552
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,945
He made her a scrapbook.

553
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,740
He also got her heels
like Cinderella's crystal shoes.

554
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:50,077
She never watched any princess cartoons
when she was young.

555
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:52,455
Zang Fei from the three kings
was her role model.

556
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,165
If Ae-ra was a princess,

557
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,500
she would have ridden a horse
and started a war.

558
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,253
Hey.

559
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:05,926
Are you going to that...
"People in Medicine" event today?

560
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,428
Of course she is.

561
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,263
He's so good to her.

562
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,432
I don't want to disappoint him.

563
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,310
I'm going to dress up insanely sexy...

564
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:15,936
Insanely what?

565
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:17,813
I'm going to boost his ego.

566
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:21,525
Ae-ra is so loyal.

567
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,652
If Ae-ra were a dog,

568
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,780
she won't be a Chihuahua or a Yorkshire.

569
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:30,242
She's more like a Shepard, a Jindo dog,
a Chow Chow,

570
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,620
a Tosa or a stray dog
from Mount North Korea.

571
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:35,748
-That's enough.
-Let it go.

572
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:37,541
I'll bite you.

573
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:45,216
Dolsan Kimchi getting delivered to homes.
That's the important point.

574
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,968
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes.

575
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,304
Are you familiar with Chun's Kimchi?

576
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:55,184
I did speak to their marketing team.
I'm trying to reach the owner, but...

577
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:58,104
No, I mean the family?

578
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,481
Do you personally know the Chun's family?

579
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:04,026
Of course I don't,
but I'll try to get to know them.

580
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,194
Then, how come...?

581
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,614
They picked you as the launch manager.

582
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:11,867
They wanted Kim Joo-man
from the sales team.

583
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,536
Pardon?

584
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,307
What's wrong?

585
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,186
This is awesome.

586
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:41,272
I got the contract for Chun's Kimchi.

587
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,441
Really? Were you able to contact them?

588
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,568
No, they picked me.
They wanted to talk to me.

589
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:46,819
That's awesome!

590
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:51,240
I'm trying to think, but I don't know
anyone with that last name.

591
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:54,535
I think it's because word got out
at how good you are.

592
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,621
The fishcake, the salted fish...

593
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,416
Everything you launched got sold out.

594
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,834
You have a point.

595
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,462
They said if you make this one a success,

596
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,589
you will be promoted for sure.

597
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:09,008
I'm so happy I'm about to lose my mind.

598
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:18,434
-Why is the door locked?
-Someone must be inside.

599
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:23,022
They would've opened the door, then.
I think the door is locked.

600
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:25,232
-Get the key.
-Okay.

601
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,235
It is becoming difficult
to gauge the effect...

602
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,405
this will have on the investment market.

603
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:35,326
In order to revive the market,
the government...

604
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,706
You're coming to the event
at 6 p.m., right?

605
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,792
It's an event for the people in Medicine.

606
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,171
Do I have to go?

607
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,090
Everyone brings their partner...

608
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,803
but Moo-bin always came alone
like a loner.

609
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:06,440
I think I'd be so happy.

610
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:09,777
It would be awesome if you surprise me.

611
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,364
Why is he so kind?

612
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,199
I feel so bad.

613
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,054
Hello.

614
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:50,818
-Did you sleep?
-Yes, I had food coma. 

615
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,658
-Did you have tempura for lunch?
-No, I had cold noodles.

616
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:01,161
Then why are you lips all shiny?

617
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,832
It looks like you're wearing a lip gloss.

618
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:10,004
If there was a girl, we would've thought
you were kissing here or something.

619
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,423
What brings you all here?

620
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,883
You didn't know about the meeting?

621
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,511
The Chun's Kimchi is scheduled
for a show.

622
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:23,350
So where should we start?

623
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,606
Chun's kimchi.

624
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:32,318
Hey.

625
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,362
-The gym got sold.
-What?

626
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,197
What are we going to do?

627
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,574
Are we out on the street?

628
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,327
But... they told us to stay.

629
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,287
Yesterday, they told us to move out.

630
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:46,123
The buyer from yesterday didn't buy.

631
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:47,666
A new buyer showed up.

632
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,043
Just like that?

633
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:53,005
But the new owner asked us
to operate the gym.

634
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:56,383
Why did that warehouse become so hot?

635
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,344
Is it redeveloping?

636
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:03,223
Darn it, the owner's daughter-in-law
is back.

637
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,433
Hey, Man-dong!

638
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,478
If you take the money again,
you're a dead meat!

639
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:11,857
Mister!

640
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:15,736
How could you do this
in front of our restaurant?

641
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:17,780
Move it!

642
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:30,167
Instead of doing what we always do...

643
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:33,337
isn't there a new, fresh idea?

644
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:38,676
Who's snoring?

645
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:48,894
Why don't we step out
and get some fresh air?

646
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:50,604
Let's have a smoke.

647
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,321
Ye-jin.

648
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,907
Why don't you use the restroom
or something?

649
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:06,578
-Mr. Kim.
-Ye-jin.

650
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,497
Don't say anything.

651
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:12,710
How about a smoke or get a snack--

652
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,587
How much must I show you?

653
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:18,799
What do you mean? What did I see?
Don't say that.

654
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:21,760
My heart. How much more
do I have to show you?

655
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,054
No, let's talk another time.

656
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:27,141
We even kissed by the copier machine.

657
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:31,270
Why won't you say anything about the kiss?

658
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:33,480
When did we ever...

659
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:35,816
You kissed me, I didn't kiss you.

660
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,235
Since we kissed...

661
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:40,237
there should be something else.

662
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,864
Why are you acting the same?

663
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:47,035
So, is a kiss nothing to you?

664
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,705
-Why do you keep talking about kissing?
-We had a kiss.

665
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:51,039
Stop it.

666
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:53,959
All we did was kiss!
Forget it.

667
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:05,846
Did you guys kiss?

668
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,990
I should've told him my real shoe size.

669
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:32,456
GUEST LIST

670
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:36,460
Only members are permitted
in our private lounge.

671
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:41,507
People not on the list
must be accompanied by members.

672
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,051
I see.

673
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:48,096
I'll call him and come back together.

674
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,278
I wanted to surprise him.

675
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,155
What's going on?

676
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,991
Who is she? Do you know her?

677
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,452
She's a patient of mine.

678
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:56,957
She got a nose job at our hospital.

679
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,126
I see.

680
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,005
Dad!

681
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:07,342
-I'll wait for you inside.
-Okay, go in first with the director.

682
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,053
Dad.

683
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,563
Hello, Mei.

684
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:22,691
I'm done with the consultation.

685
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,819
I'll be right in.

686
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:30,115
CHIEF ADMINISTRATOR

687
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:39,416
The chief that kept calling was...

688
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:42,210
the woman you're marrying?

689
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:48,091
She's your Mei and I'm your lovely Ae-ra?

690
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:50,928
That's why you love Japanese songs.

691
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:54,056
Ae-ra, my feelings for you were sincere.

692
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:56,767
I liked you more than Mei.

693
00:48:57,351 --> 00:49:01,855
-I could talk to you better--
-That's obvious, because I'm Korean.

694
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,733
And you're funny and spunky.

695
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:06,652
You're beautiful like a goddess.

696
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,237
You were my ideal woman.

697
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,282
So what?

698
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,994
You were trying to break off
your engagement?

699
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:20,248
-No... I'd be a horrible son.
-And this is good?

700
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:23,293
-They bought the tickets for the event.
-Anyway...

701
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:29,091
When were you planning to dump me?

702
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:31,426
Just before your wedding day?

703
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:34,638
I wasn't planning on breaking up with you.

704
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,808
Why should we break up
because I'm married?

705
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,688
-What?
-Nothing has changed between us.

706
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:46,942
When I'm in Korea, I can focus fully
on you.

707
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:49,277
You...

708
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:56,118
You're really are a piece of trash.

709
00:49:56,618 --> 00:50:00,163
Ae-ra, this costs ten times
more than 68,000 won.

710
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:04,710
I'll make it up to you by making you
a princess with other things.

711
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:10,924
So why...

712
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,385
did you come when I didn't invite you?

713
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:17,055
How can you lie about everything...

714
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,558
with that innocent-looking face?

715
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:23,228
I didn't lie. I was sincere.

716
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,565
And I told you...

717
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:29,234
to go out on ten dates with me.

718
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:34,489
Is that why...

719
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:37,909
you asked for ten dates?

720
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:45,792
It's so good to see you again.

721
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,753
How long has it been? Ten years?

722
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:50,547
Hey, we met once after graduation.

723
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:52,758
We did?

724
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:54,426
When?

725
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,803
Thanks to you, I finally grew up.

726
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,477
You know, I only date the best.

727
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:06,813
I'll introduce you to my boyfriend soon.

728
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:10,400
I haven't heard you say that in so long.

729
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,611
Where are we going anyway?

730
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:17,115
I ran into someone I haven't seen
in a while.

731
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:19,367
I wanted to show you, too.

732
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:26,416
Darn it, I just started eating.

733
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:28,960
Let's go.

734
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:31,713
-Hello.
-Hello.

735
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,591
-How much would you like?
-Fill it up.

736
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:35,634
Okay.

737
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:43,225
Excuse me.

738
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:45,769
-You don't need to clean my windshield.
-Yes?

739
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,354
You're so sweaty.

740
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:50,816
Wait a second.

741
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,361
Which high school did you go to?

742
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,488
Chunbang High, why?

743
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,782
It's you, Park Moo-bin.

744
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,869
It's me Ko Dong-man.

745
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:05,455
Bo-ram, do you know him?

746
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:07,582
He says he went to our school.

747
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,545
It felt like he dated me to show you

748
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,672
that he took something from you.

749
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:17,259
Ko Dong-man.

750
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:23,431
He adores you so much.

751
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:28,979
I think that's why I was so drawn to you
at first.

752
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:31,273
But...

753
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:35,235
my feelings for you are sincere now.

754
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,321
What does Dong-man have to do with this?

755
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:42,993
He's such a show off.

756
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:47,122
He has nothing, but he's always so happy.

757
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:50,417
That bothers me.

758
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:55,714
Even if he shows off
and even if he has nothing...

759
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,009
he's better than a piece of trash
like you.

760
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,554
Why won't she pick up?

761
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:12,063
He's still a scumbag.

762
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:14,357
What? He sent you what?

763
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:16,735
How could he send me
his wedding invitation?

764
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:27,078
You think...

765
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:32,042
You think the world is full of women
dying to ride on your white horse...

766
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:36,379
but those Cinderella stories
aren't popular anymore.

767
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:38,715
In the real world,

768
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:44,471
the world is filled with women
who work hard and succeed on their own.

769
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,473
So take your glass shoes...

770
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,020
and feed them to dogs.

771
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,924
KO DONG-MAN

772
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:27,931
Forget that Cinderella brat
who sold lies to girls.

773
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,725
The barefoot General Zang Fei
of the "Three Kingdoms,"

774
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,603
who commanded thousands of soldiers...

775
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:35,647
is much sexier.

776
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:44,114
You know Si-kyung is a prankster.

777
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,033
I understand.

778
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:51,454
I know how ugly an inferiority complex is.

779
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:56,459
I guess you wasted that money
for the suite for nothing.

780
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:58,837
The suite at the hospital?

781
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:01,089
I didn't pay for it.

782
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:03,508
What?

783
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:07,679
When I went to pay, someone already
had paid for it.

784
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:11,433
I guess Ko Dong-man paid for it.

785
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:15,770
Then you didn't lose anything.
Good riddance.

786
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,897
That girl was a total psycho anyway.

787
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:04,611
Hey.

788
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:08,198
What happened?

789
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:10,158
What are you doing here?

790
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,328
How did you know I was here?

791
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:18,333
Where is he?
Get up and take me to him!

792
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:21,628
Sit down. 

793
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,630
Just stay with me.

794
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:31,554
Look at me.

795
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,140
Did you get hit again?

796
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:36,768
Did he hit you?

797
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:40,021
Would I let a punk like that hit me?

798
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:43,066
I yelled and left.

799
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,318
Then why are you shivering?

800
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:48,822
Why are you here looking all pathetic?
It's annoying me!

801
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:54,327
Why do you keep losing your shoes?

802
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,707
It's not like he scammed me out of money.

803
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,044
It's not like I loved him.

804
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:07,257
I only dated him because I was impulsive.

805
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,184
I'm not pathetic
just because he looks down on me.

806
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:22,313
As long as I don't think I'm pathetic,

807
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:25,316
nothing matters.

808
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,279
What is she saying?

809
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:32,365
Just tell me where he is!

810
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:36,911
I was just unlucky, that's all.

811
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:41,332
So stop making a big fuss out of it.
You're annoying me.

812
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,254
If you get slapped by someone,

813
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:49,048
and if someone tries to console me...

814
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:54,220
it just makes you cry for no reason.

815
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,514
This is nothing to cry about.

816
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:37,430
Stop doing things like this.
Stay out of it!

817
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,517
Stop going around causing troubles.

818
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:43,269
Just stay home or something.

819
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:45,605
Just don't date any guys!

820
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,738
Why do you care if I date another guy?

821
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:55,990
Why are you hugging me?

822
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:03,248
I told you to stay out of it.

823
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:05,041
I told you you'd regret it.

824
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:08,878
If you did get hurt, why would I care?

825
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:14,592
It's all because you always get hit
and cry--

826
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,427
You make my heart flutter.

827
00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:21,307
What?

828
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,022
My heart flutters.

829
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:32,485
Every time you do that...

830
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:35,446
my heart flutters.

831
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:41,661
My heart flutters.

832
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:50,003
Something's wrong with me.

833
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:24,245
-That doctor is Moo-bin, right?
-Yes, it is.

834
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:27,832
-There's no justice in this world.
-Why?

835
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:32,045
-Never mind
-Do you know Dr. Kim?

836
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:35,882
-Personally?
-I really shouldn't say this.

837
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:38,301
It's so awful, I'm shaking.

838
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:39,886
-Did you hear?
-What?

839
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:41,638
Dr. Kim from plastic surgery.

840
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:45,224
He seduced a woman while he was engaged.

841
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:49,437
He asked her to see him
even after he got married.

842
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,689
-So?
-So...

843
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:53,691
So she...

844
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:57,362
I turned it into a huge myth
and made people gossip.

845
01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,781
She killed herself.

846
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:04,952
-The woman hung herself.
-What?

847
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:07,497
-She killed herself.
-Are you serious?

848
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:10,041
-She died?
-She died?

849
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,710
She died.

850
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:16,506
The wedding is off.

851
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:21,052
You can make this Kimchi project
a big hit,

852
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:23,388
get promoted and get married.

853
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:27,767
I can never forget about him
from my failed love stories.

854
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,477
My first true love.

855
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:34,357
Do you still think about your first love?

856
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:36,818
You're going out with him?

857
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:38,653
He's going to be my boyfriend.

858
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:41,781
Why are you doing this to me?

859
01:01:42,323 --> 01:01:44,784
He doesn't listen to me at all.

860
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:47,245
You don't like seeing me fight.

861
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:50,456
Is this your playground?
Why did you bring a woman here?

862
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,209
You're going to get knocked out
on your debut match.

863
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:55,253
Get it together, punk.

864
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:58,172
