1
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,998
RFC lightweight pro fight.

2
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,959
Please cheer for Kim Tak-su!

3
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,082
Coach.

4
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,211
Why are you being so cruel to me?

5
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,966
You're just being cruel to yourself.

6
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:33,885
Look.

7
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:35,720
Look at him.

8
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,431
Watch how he's living now.

9
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,899
You both are at fault.
Why do you have to feel guilty?

10
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:50,777
That's what you call winning!

11
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,658
Here are the fighters of the RFC
Lightweight Pro Fight. 

12
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,453
In the red corner, his height is 181 cm.

13
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,831
Weight, 70 kg.

14
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,668
Professional MMA record
with 23 wins and four losses.

15
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,795
Tiger MMA with a specialty
in Taekwondo.

16
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,880
The pride of Korean lightweight fighters.

17
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,175
Kim Tak-su!

18
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,429
Ready, fight!

19
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,102
Take your time.

20
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,563
Go! That's it. 

21
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,609
Right, right side!

22
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,529
Good job.

23
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,226
Nice one!

24
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,228
Another KO win for Kim Tak-su!

25
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,522
A KO win just one minute into the match.

26
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,774
The roundhouse kick is his specialty. 

27
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,736
I don't think anyone can defeat him.

28
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,779
Kim Tak-su is very impressive. 

29
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,865
He is so powerful.

30
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:21,993
That's your technique.

31
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,621
Of all the people...

32
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,832
he shouldn't be using your technique.

33
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,482
TAEKWONDO NATIONAL TEAM
SELECTION, 2007

34
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,279
Dong-man.

35
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:03,576
I don't want you to make it
tougher for yourself. 

36
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,580
If you get too tired during the match...

37
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,667
you don't have to get up. 

38
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,883
Why are you making things hard
for everyone?

39
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,094
If you give in,

40
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,846
we can all be happy.

41
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,227
No.

42
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,562
No one will be happy. 

43
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,776
No one in my family...

44
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,320
wants me to lose. 

45
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,908
If I win the gold medal,
I'll pay off my dad's debt,

46
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,160
and my Mom will live in luxury.

47
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,372
I'll also cure Dong-hee.

48
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,209
So, I won't lose. 

49
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,510
-Dong-man, are you nervous?
-What?

50
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,388
Don't be nervous, you trained hard.

51
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:09,183
Just easily take him down
and go to Beijing.

52
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,477
National team fly business class.

53
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,771
-Business class?
-Have you ever flown business class?

54
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,398
They have flat bed seats...

55
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,566
Dong-man.

56
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,151
Hello, sir. 

57
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,737
You never come to the tournaments.

58
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:21,821
Dad.

59
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:23,990
You must win.

60
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,743
I'll kill you if you lose. 

61
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,497
I won't lose. 

62
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,167
Your son never loses. 

63
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,668
Just watch, okay?

64
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,795
Ko Dong-man is going to Beijing! 

65
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,303
Fight!

66
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,722
Dong-man, you can do it!

67
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,352
Back off.

68
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,063
Hey, step back. Spin.

69
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,939
That's it!

70
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,401
Fight!

71
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:10,870
Cover.

72
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,124
Go!

73
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,342
That's it!

74
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,303
Dong-man, you can do it.
Finish the game. 

75
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,680
Dong-man, you can do it!

76
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,520
Let's go, Dong-man!

77
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,736
Concentrate!

78
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,654
One!

79
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,823
-What are you doing?
-Get up, Dong-man!

80
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,199
Get up!

81
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,242
Do it again.

82
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,827
Go for number three. 

83
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:07,718
I heard Dong-man's sister can walk

84
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,054
if she gets a surgery.

85
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,773
Cut and go it. 

86
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:30,450
Tak-su's dad paid the overdue hospital
invoices for Dong-man's sister.

87
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,098
Ko Dong-man.

88
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,601
-One, two...
-Get up!

89
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,978
-three, four...
-Hey, Dong-man!

90
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:01,105
-five...
-Get up!

91
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,733
-Get up!
-What are you doing!

92
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,235
-Dong-man, get up!
-Get up!

93
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,613
-Dong-man!
-If you don't get up, 

94
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,990
I'll never talk to you again!

95
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,075
I won't play with you!

96
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,452
Dong-man!

97
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,579
Dong-man!

98
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,797
We'll pay you back tomorrow. 

99
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,841
Give me your account number and leave.

100
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:33,095
If you let Tak-su win the spot
on the national team, 

101
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,223
Tak-su's dad will pay off
your husband's debt

102
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,516
and hospital bills. 

103
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,230
Would you have your own child do the same?

104
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,399
Would you tell your child to lose
 for money?

105
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,985
Get out! Get out of my house!

106
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,071
Get out, you jerk!

107
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,615
DONG-MAN HEADS TO BEIJING.

108
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,076
Win. I'll kill you if you lose. 

109
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,119
I won't lose.

110
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:00,164
Your son never loses.

111
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,295
Kim Tak-su wins!

112
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,982
We need to talk.

113
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,192
-Why?
-Something's wrong.

114
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,778
He just grazed him.

115
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,196
So, why...

116
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,950
It wasn't that he couldn't get up.

117
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,827
He just didn't get up.

118
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:23,205
PRESS CONFERENCE
ON NATIONAL TEAM QUALIFIER MIXING

119
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,087
-Is he now banned from competing again?
-Of course.

120
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,716
Why is a young kid so into money already?

121
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,010
Hey, Ko Dong-man. 

122
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,137
You go in there alone, okay?

123
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,723
-You have to earn the pay.
-Tak-su!

124
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,808
-What? Let go.
-Seriously.

125
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,269
We got caught because he was so obvious.

126
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,315
I'm going to be disciplined too
all because of him.

127
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,232
Hey.

128
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,194
What's up with his attitude?

129
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,072
Hey, what did you say?

130
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:59,784
You lack skills and paid your way up.
Now you hurt Dong-man. 

131
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,119
How dare you blame him?

132
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,246
Tak-su's father has an election coming up
next year.

133
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,540
He doesn't want Tak-su
getting attention this way.

134
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,376
So? So what?

135
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,629
You want Dong-man to get blamed
for everything?

136
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,756
Hey, you don't want to do that?

137
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,217
Then, give back all the money.

138
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,052
I won't go in,

139
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,429
so pay back your sister's hospital bills.

140
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,932
Hey, come over here.

141
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,558
Come here.

142
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,276
Coach.

143
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,446
I'm sorry. 

144
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,116
Shut up, you jerk. 

145
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,784
Hey.

146
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,370
How could you make your coach a fool?

147
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,872
How could you do this
without even telling me?

148
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:47,957
Darn it! 

149
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,293
Am I just a coach to you? Am I?

150
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,213
You didn't know what was going on.

151
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,299
You'll be blamed for nothing.

152
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,345
I'll go by myself...

153
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,599
You should just leave.

154
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,146
If your face gets in the papers,
you won't even be able to teach anymore.

155
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,109
You idiot, you think this is funny?

156
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,695
Come with me.

157
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,660
-There he is.
-Please tell us what happened.

158
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,579
-Is it true?
-Please look this way.

159
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,664
Please tell us...

160
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,753
Why isn't he coming?

161
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,173
Does he plan to watch the whole thing?

162
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,345
Darn it. 

163
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,478
You were great!

164
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:54,523
-You're awesome!
-Good job!

165
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,902
We'll make a public announcement later.

166
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,987
I'll post it soon.

167
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:02,907
What?

168
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,868
Aren't you Ko Dong-man?

169
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,038
-Ko Dong-man?
-Do you know him?

170
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,004
It's been a while.

171
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,590
Long time no see, Dong-man.

172
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,051
-What brings you here?
-Why are you here?

173
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,931
Someone gave me tickets to the fight.

174
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,016
So, why are you watching the fights?

175
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:32,728
Tak-su, he can watch fights
if he wants to.

176
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:33,896
Are you here...

177
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:35,940
to see me?

178
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:39,985
Why? Do you need more money?

179
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,322
Tak-su, people are watching.

180
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,074
Since I'm doing well...

181
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,202
are you hoping to get something out of me?

182
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:55,084
I see, your beggar mentality
will never change.

183
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,460
Right?

184
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,088
Dong-man...

185
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,173
anytime I see you, I have bad luck.

186
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,510
So don't hang around me, got it?

187
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,596
Don't even come near the Octagon.

188
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,807
If you show up and act out again, 

189
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,309
you'll mess up my life again. 

190
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,645
Tak-su.

191
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,232
Are you scared?

192
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:19,859
What?

193
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,779
Why are you rambling on and on?
How humiliating.

194
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:28,367
This jerk. Listen to him talk.

195
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,536
Are you afraid I'll make a comeback?

196
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,662
Hey.

197
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,540
You were an ace ten years ago.

198
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,835
-You still have some ego, don't you?
-There are cameras.

199
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,420
Let go. 

200
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,757
You need to crush these losers properly.

201
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,803
I almost forgot.

202
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,056
What about your sister? Can she walk now?

203
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,563
Kim Tak-su!

204
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,692
What did you say?

205
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,929
If you're going to copy my technique,
do it properly!

206
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,974
Is he insane?

207
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,227
Don't get scared already.
This is only the beginning.

208
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,270
Okay?

209
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,357
If we ever meet in the ring...

210
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,902
you're dead.

211
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,532
-Gosh, wait!
-Tak-su!

212
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,951
No pictures!

213
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,845
ID PICTURES FOR CABIN CREW
AND ANNOUNCERS

214
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,607
I think the black box is working.

215
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,067
What's happening around my truck?

216
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,446
I didn't do anything wrong.

217
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,789
-Excuse me, I have to go now.
-Are you the owner of this truck?

218
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,624
He's here.

219
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,294
Sir, is your car camera working?

220
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,797
Yes, why?

221
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,382
Please sell us the recording.

222
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,010
Why? Did something happen here?

223
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:54,805
Kim Tak-su got knocked out
in front of your truck.

224
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,726
NATIONAL ATHLETE'S SAUSAGE.

225
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,401
What?

226
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:09,987
Gosh.

227
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,572
That crazy jerk.

228
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,868
How did he do that?

229
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,500
KIM TAK-SU GOT KNOCKED OUT

230
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,070
I'm sorry, I'll improve myself.

231
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,949
Are you crazy?
Which unit did you serve in the army?

232
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,702
I was only...

233
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,997
I'll do better next time.

234
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,540
Where are you?

235
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,876
Are you kidding me right now?

236
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,711
Where are you?

237
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,965
Clench your teeth again.

238
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,510
Why don't you clench your teeth again!

239
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:19,181
Don't ever come near the Octagon.

240
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,688
I guess...

241
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,483
people really need to do what they love.

242
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,276
Are you happy now?

243
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,029
Are you living an intense life?

244
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,511
I don't think I can do a good job. 

245
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,892
You always tell me to quit
as if that's all I can do. 

246
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,312
But you see...

247
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:11,733
that's the best I could do
because I don't like that job.

248
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,069
So you know what?

249
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,909
I'm going to quit!

250
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,163
I quit!

251
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,873
I'm quit!

252
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,753
I don't care now, I'll go for it!

253
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,010
ROUND FOUR
JUST GO FOR IT!

254
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,388
NATIONAL ATHLETE'S SAUSAGE

255
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,816
-Coach!
-My gosh, you scared me.

256
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,611
Where were you after causing trouble?

257
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:56,820
Jang-ho!

258
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,447
You little jerk!

259
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,574
-I'm going to do it.
-What?

260
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,868
I really want to do it!

261
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,786
I'm going to do martial arts!

262
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,496
I'm going to do it!

263
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,708
Are you being serious?

264
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,628
I don't care about anything.
I'll just go for it.

265
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,504
You told me to give it a go!

266
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,633
You're not saying this
after getting drunk, right?

267
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,219
Okay, let's do it!

268
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,219
Ae-ra.

269
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:04,888
You scared me!

270
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:06,932
Are you a stalker?

271
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,351
I heard that women like
these kinds of surprises.

272
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:13,355
Women don't like it
when guys show up out of blue.

273
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:17,526
It's only because I miss you all the time.

274
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,696
I only have a three-hour break,

275
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,323
but I already used an hour
to wait for you.

276
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,200
I only have two hours left.

277
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,536
So, can you please get in the car?

278
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,713
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

279
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,549
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

280
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,219
Let's hear some speech
from the new recruits.

281
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:49,891
I'm Kim Chan-ho from sales team.
I'll do my best!

282
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:57,065
Hello, I'm a new intern Jang Ye-jin.
I look forward to working with you.

283
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,654
Excuse me, ma'am.

284
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,948
Please give us two bottles of soju,
three beers...

285
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,492
some more salad and wet tissues.

286
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,953
Sun-hee is quick with keeping
things in order.

287
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,497
My name is Sul-hee.

288
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,041
I know.

289
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,878
-I said Sul-hee.
-You called me Sun-hee earlier.

290
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:22,341
Did you say that your parents sell...

291
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,593
jokbal at a market in a countryside?

292
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:28,221
I guess that's why she's so good
at cooking meat.

293
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,809
We should always bring her
to all of our team dinners.

294
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,144
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

295
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,982
-Hey, Joo-man.
-Yes?

296
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,192
About that...

297
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,029
My goodness, you don't need to do that.

298
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:47,324
Who makes female employees
pour drinks these days?

299
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:51,370
I should be the one to pour you a drink.

300
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,455
No, I'll pour her a drink.

301
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,292
Let me pour you a drink.

302
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,794
Okay.

303
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,921
I don't drink well, so a drop will do.

304
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,422
Okay, I'll give you a drop.

305
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,635
My goodness.

306
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:12,057
Ye-jin's face's became red
after Joo-man poured you a drink.

307
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:25,237
You can't make female employees
pour alcohol these days.

308
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,948
You don't have a girlfriend, right?

309
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,533
You should get married.

310
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,078
I have to earn money. 

311
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:37,416
What do you think about Ye-jin?

312
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,085
I think she likes you.

313
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:44,673
If you start dating her,
you can quit right away.

314
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,217
Her family sells jokbal.

315
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,929
Granny Park's jokbal.

316
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,391
Her family owns that brand.

317
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,725
Really?

318
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,450
Hey, look at those two.

319
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,827
One is colorful
the other is monochrome.

320
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:32,721
I don't like the fact
that prince charming is...

321
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,974
driving me home.

322
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,981
You have arrived at your destination.

323
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:46,026
You should've dropped me at the station.

324
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:48,445
You didn't have to drop me off
in front of my house.

325
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,240
So, this is your place?

326
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,868
What does that mean?

327
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,369
Yes.

328
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,372
-I'll get going now.
-Already?

329
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,458
We just got here.

330
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:06,880
Then what?

331
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,717
-You want to eat some ramen at my place?
-Sorry?

332
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,846
Why do you look so scared?

333
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,973
I guess you like jjolmyeon instead.

334
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,686
I like both very much.

335
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,397
You're funny.

336
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:30,362
It's very fun to tease you, Moo-bin.

337
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,906
You must've had a hard time at school.

338
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,533
What do you mean?

339
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,077
You're cute.

340
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,961
I'm not cute.

341
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,214
I won't be cute.

342
00:25:56,846 --> 00:26:00,225
You have deviated from the route.

343
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,810
I got it, you wench.

344
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,318
I guess shoe thieves are still active
these days.

345
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:12,779
Why did this thief only steal an odd shoe?

346
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,198
Is he a pervert?

347
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:19,869
-Who's the owner of vehicle 0824?
-That's me.

348
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,705
-You called for chauffeur service?
-Yes.

349
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,999
Ye-jin, that's your car?

350
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:28,962
Oh, your car is fancy. Right?

351
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:34,009
-I'll get going.
-Okay, see you tomorrow.

352
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:36,219
Joo-man.

353
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,682
Didn't you say you live in Oksu?
I pass through there.

354
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,184
Should I drop you off on the way?

355
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,020
Get on, hurry! Get in the car.

356
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,731
No, that's fine.
I have other plans after this.

357
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,024
I see. 

358
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,820
You should go. 

359
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,697
You're very stubborn.

360
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,658
I'll feel relieved when I see you go in.

361
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:03,204
I live right here, there's no need.
You're very sweet.

362
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,958
If you live right there,
are those shirts...

363
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,340
No, I live over there.
All the way there.

364
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,800
All the way there.

365
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,094
I see.

366
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:21,723
It seems like you like gold a lot. 

367
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,229
Why did the landlord put that thing there?

368
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:35,528
Ae-ra, don't say "Hi" to the tenant
on the second floor.

369
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,407
I have a bad feeling about that man.

370
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:44,788
Why do you think that a man lives there?

371
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:46,456
Ae-ra!

372
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,710
Gosh, you startled me.

373
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,046
Why did you have to come now?
Wait...

374
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,301
Crazy jerk! I told you not to do
things like this.

375
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,969
I quit my job.

376
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,930
I'm going to do mixed martial arts.

377
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,099
What? Are you serious?

378
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,309
With this career, I'm going to make
my mom, dad,

379
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:11,231
Dong-hee, coach, and you
to live a luxury life.

380
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,650
I'm going to turn my life around!

381
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,991
-Who is he?
-He is...

382
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:25,203
-He's my friend.
-Hey, Moo-bin.

383
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,331
Why are you here?

384
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,710
-Our house?
-No, no.

385
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:32,836
He lives across from mine.

386
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,213
We don't live together.
He live right across.

387
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,007
By the way, do you know each other?

388
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,759
-We're high school alumni--
-Apparently.

389
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,180
But, why are you in front of my house?

390
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,894
I dropped her off.

391
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,606
I'm going to officially date her. 

392
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:56,609
We don't...

393
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,487
necessarily have to date officially
right away.

394
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,907
So, don't hug her like that.

395
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,954
Moo-bin,

396
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:10,123
I think you got the wrong idea.

397
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,751
Dong-man and I are like...

398
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,337
We're best friends.

399
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:19,674
Ae-ra.

400
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,302
Boys and girls can't be friends.

401
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:23,678
It's just an excuse

402
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,890
to keep the other one in your reach
because you don't want to date.

403
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:31,060
I don't want you to be friends with him.

404
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,815
We're not just friends.

405
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,028
We're like siblings.

406
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,321
We're not...

407
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:44,407
siblings.

408
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:48,036
-What?
-We aren't siblings.

409
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:53,833
I don't like it, too.

410
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,086
I don't want you...

411
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,589
to date him, official or not.

412
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:05,637
You've never meddled
with my dating life before.

413
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,013
I don't know.

414
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,642
But I don't like it now.

415
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,823
ADMINISTRATION MANAGER

416
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,159
Shouldn't you get going now?

417
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,330
-I...
-Bye.

418
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:36,251
-I'll have that ramen.
-What did you say?

419
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,378
You asked me if I wanted ramen before.

420
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,130
Are you insane?

421
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:44,759
I said it to tease him.

422
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,178
When I go back to the emergency room,

423
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,306
I won't get to eat anything
and I'll be really hungry.

424
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,434
We can have ramen together, can't we?

425
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,689
Let's go up together.
I'll cook you ramen.

426
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,649
I'm really good at cooking ramen.

427
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,862
I can't let this fly.

428
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,990
I'm going to tell your dad.

429
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:07,949
What?

430
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,159
I'll tell him since you live alone,

431
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,204
you're about to have ramen with a guy.

432
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,415
I'm going to tell him everything.

433
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,918
-Where is his number?
-What's wrong with you today?

434
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,589
-Are you drunk?
-Are you going to cook him ramen?

435
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:27,176
Why do you care if I cook him ramen
or a meal with 18 side dishes?

436
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,219
My goodness.

437
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,388
I understand.

438
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,434
It's too early to go to your place.
I was rude.

439
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,562
You think so too?

440
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,523
I thought you were a womanizer.

441
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:44,193
Please invite me to your place later.

442
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:47,280
Today, let's eat ramen over there.

443
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,239
It's on me.

444
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,041
What's the matter with you two?

445
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,544
-I want to eat ramen, too.
-What?

446
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,257
I want to eat ramen!

447
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,309
Thank you, Moo-bin.

448
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:21,731
If you went to the same high school,
were you two close?

449
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,149
-No.
-Not at all.

450
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:28,988
I don't friend with just anybody,
especially with jerks who kept chirping.

451
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:32,200
I didn't friend with mere athletes.

452
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,327
He got punished by teachers a lot. 

453
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,049
It's hot.

454
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,968
Did you want ramen this bad?

455
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,552
Ae-ra.

456
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:54,847
I tried so hard to to meet you today.

457
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,432
I might get fired when I go back.

458
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,561
Why did you do that?
We could've met another time.

459
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,815
I wanted to see you.

460
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,401
From the first day I met you,

461
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,736
I think about you like 50 times a day.

462
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,409
I think about you about 50 times a day.

463
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,412
If I don't see you, I can't do anything.

464
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,957
Gosh, this is so hot.

465
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:26,754
Why are you so straightforward?

466
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,174
Ae-ra, let's go on a date tomorrow.

467
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,635
I'll plan the entire evening. Full course.

468
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:36,848
My goodness, full course?

469
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,104
Now that I think about it,
you like pulling surprises.

470
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,070
You startled me.

471
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,280
What is it?

472
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:56,075
Hey, your ramen is getting soggy.

473
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,453
Stop chatting and eat up.
Let's go home soon.

474
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:02,081
Why did you pull my chair?

475
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,542
You didn't have to pull my chair.

476
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:28,858
You startled me.

477
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:31,360
Why were you startled?
You didn't know I'd be here?

478
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,320
What?

479
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,031
I was thinking about something.

480
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,118
You're right, there might be people
from our workplace.

481
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,538
Why are you eating ice cream
after eating meat?

482
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,457
You spilled again.

483
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:45,583
I was hungry.

484
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,919
I was too busy grilling meat to eat any.

485
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,509
Do you have to wear a uniform?

486
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,385
Aren't these hard to clean?

487
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,180
We can wear casually if we want to.

488
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:02,225
Then why do you wear a uniform?

489
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,851
Don't you want to look pretty?

490
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:07,146
Then I'd have to rotate at least
three outfits a week.

491
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,398
I can't afford it.
I prefer wearing a uniform.

492
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,485
I can buy you some clothes.

493
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,321
Why don't you ever ask me for something?

494
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:18,533
I got a raise and I can spend it
all on you.

495
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:22,328
No way. You earned it by buttering up
your superior

496
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:25,206
and working so hard.
I can't spend it on clothes.

497
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:29,877
Do you want that?

498
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,881
That's really expensive.

499
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:37,093
-I'll buy you.
-No, it's really expensive.

500
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,777
I don't think the color suits me.

501
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,864
Your skin's so white that
the dress suits you perfectly.

502
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,825
No, the size I meant.

503
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:04,078
I think this dress is tailor-made for you.
Don't you look so slim?

504
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,961
I don't think it's my style.

505
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:14,005
I'll pay for it.

506
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:16,716
But, it's too...

507
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,968
Oh, no.

508
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:26,517
I didn't want it.
Why did you pay?

509
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:30,271
Where would I go wearing this?

510
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,940
To work! Wear it to work!

511
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,860
Wear your favorite color pink
and act prim and proud.

512
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,446
Don't let others look down on you
and don't grill meat for them.

513
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:41,407
-Why are you shouting!
-I told you to just get it!

514
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,534
I didn't want the dress.

515
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:45,661
It's not even my style.

516
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:46,829
What's your style?

517
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:51,042
-What?
-Something cheap is your style!

518
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,379
I'm aware that you ended up like this

519
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:58,716
trying to support a guy like me
for six years.

520
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,302
I'm so grateful for that.

521
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,973
But now, it's almost suffocating.

522
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,567
I'm sorry, Sul-hee.

523
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,487
I think I lost my mind.

524
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:21,530
Sul-hee.

525
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,241
Sul-hee!

526
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:29,330
Sul-hee!

527
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,360
Sir.

528
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,821
-Yes?
-Can you...

529
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:06,909
drop me off at the nearest subway station?

530
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:47,241
Mr. Kim, why are you still here?

531
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:48,576
Hi.

532
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,578
You won't get a taxi here. Get in.

533
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,707
-No thanks, I'll--
-Get in before we cause traffic jam.

534
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,375
Hurry up.

535
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,467
Now, can you please leave?

536
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,135
You first.

537
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:08,637
I wanted to see you go in safely.

538
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:11,557
Okay, then.

539
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,100
I'll get going.

540
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,020
-You should get going, too.
-Okay.

541
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:21,650
Bye.

542
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,111
I'll call you.

543
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,758
What are you doing?
Why go further up?

544
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:50,054
I don't want him to know where you live.
We can come back down later.

545
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,309
Okay, lead the way then.

546
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:56,894
Let's go.

547
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,236
You should get going.

548
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:08,864
Go.

549
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,241
Bye.

550
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,500
I said go. 

551
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:22,837
Bye.

552
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,673
You're being so weird today.

553
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,174
Are you in a beauty pageant?

554
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,093
Shut up.

555
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:32,638
Follow me. 

556
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:51,615
SUL-HEE

557
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,075
What's this?

558
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,453
-It looks like a woman's clothing.
-Oh, this.

559
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,581
It's pink.

560
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,624
Yes.

561
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,004
Mr. Kim.

562
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:09,508
I like pink a lot, too.

563
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,302
See?

564
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:14,430
It's pretty.

565
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,268
Am I pretty?

566
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,104
I meant your nail art.

567
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,777
Let me off here.

568
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,946
Why don't you get off
in front of your house?

569
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,325
I want to get some tteokbokki.

570
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,244
Can I join you?

571
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,122
I can call another driver
and I'm feeling hungry, too.

572
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,124
-Ye-jin, I...
-Yes?

573
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,792
Some other time.

574
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,754
I'll gather all the interns
and treat you all next time.

575
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,130
Let's eat then.

576
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:50,799
Oh, okay.

577
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,551
Anyways, thanks for the ride.

578
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:54,470
Take care.

579
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:55,763
Thank you.

580
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,606
Mr. Kim.

581
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,442
No.

582
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:09,985
What?

583
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,491
Don't call all the interns.

584
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,702
Treat just me.

585
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,548
Why just her?

586
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:01,787
Yes!

587
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:12,923
Hey, cunning girl.

588
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,259
-Since when did you--
-Cut it out.

589
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,428
Why did you quit your job?

590
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,555
-To get into MMA?
-Yes.

591
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:23,517
I was so happy until I saw you
and you ruined it.

592
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,186
So you'll quit a job
that pays you a salary...

593
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:28,230
and instead beat people in a ring?

594
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,274
It's an actual art of fighting.

595
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:31,483
No.

596
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,819
I said no. Don't even try.

597
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,946
Why do you think you have a say in this?

598
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,240
You haven't exercised in ten years.

599
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,367
You'll get beaten up.

600
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:42,411
Hey.

601
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,663
I really don't like the way you talk.

602
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,416
You can be announcer after years,

603
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:49,126
and I can't be a fighter?

604
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:53,464
You'd been mentioning MMA
every now and then, so I researched.

605
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:56,133
People get punched in the eye.

606
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:58,636
They also get broken noses and bleed.

607
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:02,097
Why do you assume I'll get beaten up?

608
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,224
I could win.

609
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,060
You still get hit.

610
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,271
-What?
-I saw it all.

611
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:12,066
You get hit despite you winning or losing.

612
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:13,942
I can't let you get hit.

613
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:27,122
Oh, so...

614
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:31,210
Are you saying this out of concern?

615
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,754
Who said I'm concerned?

616
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,673
I just don't want you to get hit.

617
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,592
Would you like it
if Baek-hee got beaten up?

618
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:40,302
What?

619
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,221
Are you comparing me to a dog?

620
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:46,433
If your pet got hit,
you'd be furious.

621
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,310
My goodness.

622
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:51,814
You're so lucky you're a girl.

623
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,692
If you were a guy, I would've...

624
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,985
I would beat you up.

625
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:58,529
Darn it.

626
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:00,447
Forget it.

627
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:01,990
Anyway...

628
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,493
get ready to get a job tomorrow.

629
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,662
Or I'll get you one.

630
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,267
Where are you going?

631
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,561
Let's... talk some more.

632
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,067
Why you...

633
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,237
This doesn't make you a tough guy.

634
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:43,365
It makes you a jerk.

635
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,535
What's wrong with you?

636
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,580
I told you not to touch me! Don't touch!

637
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:54,960
Whatever, I'm going to do what I want.

638
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:57,713
Hang out with me.

639
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:03,552
Don't go on some full course
or whatever with that punk.

640
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,637
That punk?

641
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,015
Why is he a punk?

642
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,975
He just is, that's why.

643
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:12,102
Why did you follow us
when we went to eat?

644
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:25,032
Because I was hungry.

645
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:28,285
Why were you acting so weird?

646
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:29,995
Why were you so immature?

647
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,124
Why do you care if I date someone?

648
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:38,504
Then what? Should I not care at all?
Are we strangers?

649
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,297
Yes, we are. Total strangers.

650
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,424
How could you say that? I'm hurt.

651
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:43,592
Hey, immature kid.

652
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,346
Look at me.

653
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,101
Darn it.

654
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,689
Listen carefully.

655
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:00,943
You may have no clue what I'm saying,

656
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,654
but in the adult world,
your behavior is unacceptable.

657
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,948
Get it together.

658
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,117
Don't confuse a simple-minded
country girl.

659
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,079
I swear I'll kill you.

660
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:31,265
Darn it.

661
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:35,894
Darn it, that beast.

662
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:44,278
What's up with him?

663
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,673
She used to look like Chewbacca.

664
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,851
My goodness.

665
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:18,478
Is he going through a puberty
or something?

666
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:22,608
Darn it.
Why does she keep on getting prettier?

667
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:27,070
Why are his hands so big?

668
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:34,786
You are so pretty.

669
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:38,540
I got it cleaned right away,
so the stain is all gone.

670
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,047
Forget it, you can't wear this.

671
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,757
It makes me look short, right?

672
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,467
It's too stunning.

673
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:51,762
It shows off your stunning figure
way too much.

674
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:54,598
-You can't wear it.
-Exactly, I look short.

675
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,647
I'll help you.

676
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:08,737
Are you going to sleep downstairs again?

677
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:10,072
Let go.

678
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:14,076
I'm sorry, I told you I'm sorry.

679
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:17,913
What are you sorry for?

680
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,290
I'm sorry for everything.

681
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:23,335
Everything what?
What are you sorry for?

682
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:27,047
I'm sorry for buying you the dress...

683
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:31,093
-and I'm sorry for raising my voice.
-And?

684
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:33,971
That's it?

685
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:37,015
Is that all you did wrong?

686
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,101
What?

687
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:42,020
-You don't even know what you did wrong.
-Sul-hee.

688
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:43,855
Forget it, we need to talk.

689
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,273
What's with your skin today?

690
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,151
-What about it?
-Did you do something?

691
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:49,861
The usual glow...

692
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,781
It's more than the glow.

693
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:54,658
It's on fire.

694
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,371
You know fire is better than water, right?

695
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,248
Fire is the best.

696
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,417
Your skin is on fire.

697
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:04,501
On fire!

698
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:09,131
Was this too much?

699
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:12,634
On fire?

700
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:33,780
Mister.

701
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:37,200
I guess security isn't so great
in places like this, right?

702
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:42,330
How much would a place like this cost?

703
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,375
Are these all monthly rent?

704
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:49,755
Gosh.

705
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:52,674
You were a woman.

706
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:56,303
-Do you want to live here?
-Pardon?

707
00:50:57,012 --> 00:51:00,974
You have over ten million won draped
over your body.

708
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,143
Why are you asking about rent
of a place this?

709
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,854
I never said I'd like to live here.

710
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:08,899
And who are you to ask me
if I want to live here or not?

711
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:10,942
I'm...

712
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:13,737
the owner of a place like this.

713
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:22,037
I don't take in pretty girls.

714
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:26,625
-Sorry?
-Pretty girls are noisy.

715
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:31,004
Their fates are noisy
and so are their lives.

716
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,761
I know that from an experience.

717
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:40,055
My fate is pretty good.

718
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:42,307
Divorce is nothing in this day.

719
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,561
Did you get a divorce?

720
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:53,276
This villa has to be quiet, wholesome...

721
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:56,446
and peaceful.

722
00:51:58,323 --> 00:51:59,866
I'm wholesome.

723
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:06,748
Hello.

724
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,545
No sleepovers allowed.

725
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,175
We sleep separately time to time.

726
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:19,427
-Why are you telling her that?
-Gosh.

727
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,018
Hello.

728
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:29,271
Aren't you Dong-man's friends, right?

729
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:31,982
It's you, right? Dong-man's...

730
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:35,777
Yes, I am. I came to see him.

731
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:42,325
What are you doing?

732
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,828
Ae-ra.

733
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:47,080
Ae-ra!

734
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:48,582
Ae-ra!

735
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:08,476
How dare you come here?

736
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,437
You said he got married and left town.

737
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:11,730
Why did you lie?

738
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,482
I felt like it.

739
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,860
Would you have told me the truth?

740
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:22,115
-I can't hear you.
-What?

741
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,242
I need to talk to her, so be quiet.

742
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:26,828
Okay.

743
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,915
-Let's just go.
-Wait.

744
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,669
You're stuck to Dong-man like gum.

745
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,631
Dong-man isn't your beck and call.

746
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,883
You come back after dumping him,

747
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:41,635
and you think he'll take you back?

748
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,762
Yes, I think he will.

749
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,891
To be honest, you think the same.

750
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,894
Oh, my goodness.

751
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,313
I can hit girls now.

752
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:58,193
Dong-man.

753
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:06,326
So annoying. There she goes again.

754
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:10,872
Dong-man.

755
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:16,878
Stop calling his name
with that nasally voice.

756
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:19,047
Stop it!

757
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,554
-The air is so nice here.
-Hey.

758
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:30,183
This is the scent of society.

759
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,727
This is the perfect soul food.

760
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:38,650
Dong-man.

761
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:45,699
Dong-man, I broke up with him.

762
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:49,619
Why...

763
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:51,454
Why that crazy girl.

764
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,457
How was your blind date?

765
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,710
Was she pretty?

766
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,421
She looked like Kim Hyo-jin.

767
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:02,048
-That's awesome!
-Awesome!

768
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,134
She's totally hot.

769
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:07,095
No, not that Kim Hyo-jin.

770
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,056
My gosh.

771
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:14,477
She must be cute.

772
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:24,070
Dong-man.

773
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:32,662
This loser.

774
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:34,331
-Zero.
-Zero.

775
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:35,790
-Seven.
-Bang.

776
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:39,502
-007.
-Bang.

777
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:41,755
-Get over here.
-Come here.

778
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,131
-Drum roll!
-Drum roll!

779
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,342
Drink up!

780
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,344
-Drink up!
-It's here.

781
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,512
The food is here.

782
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,682
We have a couple for a...

783
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:53,975
Dong-man.

784
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:02,150
Dong-man.

785
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:11,868
Why do we have to hide?

786
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:14,245
Then do you want us to walk out?

787
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:15,997
Crazy girl.

788
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:18,750
Did you just curse right now?

789
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,210
Me?

790
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,342
Hye-ran was like a poison to Dong-man.

791
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:32,847
And we wanted to feed her the poison.

792
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:35,892
Put it back on.

793
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,229
-Why are you taking off your vest?
-This is annoying.

794
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:41,064
I'll go for today.

795
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:42,690
Answer my calls, okay?

796
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,443
Why can't he talk?

797
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:49,572
I'm think he's stunned.
What is this, so early in the morning?

798
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,659
I'll see you again.

799
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:57,455
Hey, Park Hye-ran.

800
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:01,459
Dong-man may be a moron.

801
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:04,003
But you know I've got his back
and I'm tough.

802
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,131
Me too.

803
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:11,344
Ae-ra.

804
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,847
Please keep your nose out of it.

805
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:17,100
I'm always going to be nosy.

806
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:19,936
If you want to get him,
take me down first.

807
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:21,938
Me too.

808
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,984
You'll have to shoot me first.

809
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:30,029
Ae-ra, good luck.

810
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:32,407
Try your very best.

811
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,703
I'll get going.

812
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:57,515
DICTIONARY ON CONVERSATION
BETWEEN FRIENDS.

813
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:12,363
Do you...

814
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:15,492
want to eat ramen and go?

815
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:22,916
What?

816
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:25,585
Sure.

817
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:30,757
What was that?

818
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:33,551
-Come on, that's an offside.
-I know.

819
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:35,637
-Go get me some rice.
-You get it.

820
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:37,847
-You get it!
-Okay!

821
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,517
Fine.

822
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,268
-I'll get it.
-Hurry up.

823
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:48,525
Goal!

824
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,385
Dong-man.

825
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:17,679
-Let's have him start tomorrow.
-What?

826
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:19,514
This is the last match.

827
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:20,473
We won't.

828
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:21,933
Trust me.

829
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:23,726
-I said no.
-Why not?

830
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,353
Even local kids compete.

831
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:28,606
Your coach said no, so no!

832
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:29,691
Ko Dong-man!

833
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:33,027
I know why you're doing this.

834
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:37,657
-You talked to him, didn't you?
-I didn't.

835
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,117
Train your employees properly.

836
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:43,871
With the amount of money I spend here,
I have a right to make her kneel.

837
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,873
She quits as of today.

838
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:46,791
Hey.

839
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:50,169
You have no right to make her do that.

840
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:53,715
