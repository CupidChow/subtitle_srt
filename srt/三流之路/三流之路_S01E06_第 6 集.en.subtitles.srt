1
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:36,953
What do we do?

2
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,546
What should I do?

3
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,593
You're embarrassing me.
Stop crying.

4
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,186
I'm not dead.

5
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,063
Don't do it. 

6
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,231
Don't ever do it.

7
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,567
I'll never see you again if you do.

8
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,820
If you do it again, I'll never see you.

9
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,989
Don't you dare.

10
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:16,910
Hey, does that punk know?

11
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:18,870
Know what?

12
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,916
You look like a baboon when you cry.

13
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,336
And that you're a crybaby.

14
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,546
Shut up. 

15
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,674
Don't you dare tell me
you'll do that again. 

16
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,598
Why are you crying so much?
You're tiring me. 

17
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,980
-Gosh, don't eat your hair.
-Don't.

18
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,774
Don't eat it.

19
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,835
What are you doing here?

20
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,086
Are you okay?

21
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,297
Why do you keep showing up?

22
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,551
Since I'm here, you can go now.

23
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,387
Who are you to tell me go?

24
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,180
You...

25
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,558
I pity you.

26
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,686
Who do you think you are?

27
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,106
Please go.

28
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,567
Just go.

29
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,485
No, you should go.

30
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,237
What?

31
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:42,954
You should go.

32
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,708
Don't text me or call me.

33
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,585
Don't come looking for me.

34
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,296
You make me sick.

35
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,642
I'll go for today, since you're okay.

36
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,478
I'll have more chances in the future.

37
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,982
Are you trying to pick a fight?

38
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,985
I told you not to come near Dong-man.

39
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:15,862
Ae-ra.

40
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,615
You should know your place.

41
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,116
What?

42
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,494
I'll make it clear,
since you looked puzzled.

43
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,081
The reason why he's holding
your hand right now is...

44
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:32,503
not because he wants to,
but just to show me.

45
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:36,174
Hey, what do you know?

46
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,344
Pick up the phone when I call.

47
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,765
If you don't, I'll take it as a sign
that you want me to visit.

48
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,572
Why are you staring at me?

49
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,493
Did you really hold my hand
for her to see?

50
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,080
Why did you hold my hand?

51
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,540
I don't know.

52
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,587
I'm hurt.

53
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,052
Is she some kind of evil?

54
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,972
How could she even think
about coming back to you?

55
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:30,061
Still, she waited for me for two years
when I was serving in the army.

56
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:36,067
What makes you think she waited for you?

57
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:39,862
I told you, I saw her in a karaoke room
with some other guy.

58
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,533
-She likes to sing.
-I see.

59
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:50,248
Is that why she was singing a duet song
 with a guy at midnight?

60
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,668
It's all in the past.

61
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:59,382
It looks like it isn't all in the past.

62
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,801
It's so obvious

63
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:06,639
what she'll do and how big of a loser
you will be to her.

64
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,850
What's so obvious?

65
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,893
Do you know everything about us?

66
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,604
What? Us?

67
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:20,069
What's wrong with you?
That's not what I meant.

68
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,740
You're right, I shouldn't get involved
in your relationship.

69
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:27,618
I shouldn't care if you do something
stupid and get hurt.

70
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,626
Sir!

71
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,503
Go kill him!

72
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,091
Wait, I was going to tell you.

73
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,760
Hold on, please calm down.

74
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,471
My brow's all ripped up.

75
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,765
I'm injured!

76
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,642
I'm glad you're alive.

77
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,145
You're lucky you didn't die.

78
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,694
STREET FIGHTER'S TRUE IDENTITY

79
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,198
It's so salty.

80
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,494
So you did punch him, right?

81
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,829
I don't remember. I was getting beaten up.

82
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:12,997
Look.

83
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:16,334
He stumbled a bit after your punch.

84
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,128
People are so quick.
When did they even film this?

85
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,254
It's embarrassing.

86
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,049
It was probably Tae-hee.

87
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:26,803
Mr. Yang?

88
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,305
Why are you calling him Mister?

89
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:33,351
Those jerks completely duped you.

90
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,853
That's why they didn't film
Karel's face.

91
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,855
-Those scumbags.
-Karel?

92
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,858
You know the guy I fought?

93
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,235
Look here.

94
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,987
This tattoo is their symbol.

95
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,740
Thank you.

96
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,702
Your wife will be okay.

97
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,079
And...

98
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,290
yes, money go.

99
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,376
I'll transfer you the money...

100
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,669
What am I saying?

101
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,255
Tell him that I sent money
for his wife's hospital bills.

102
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:03,548
You...

103
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,425
he already knows. 

104
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,218
He checked that right after the game.

105
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,221
-Hey, Tak-su.
-Yes, what? What is it?

106
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,014
Try your best to avoid him...

107
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,851
because you'll lose.

108
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,728
Wow, what did he say?

109
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:19,564
Carlos.

110
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,232
He's not exposed to the public.

111
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,776
He just coached his nephews at home.

112
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,778
But do you know about his family?

113
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,449
Brazilian jujitsu champions
for three generations straight.

114
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,368
The guy you fought is his second son.

115
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,955
The nephew that he trained at home is...

116
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,875
the UFC legend, John Carlos. 

117
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:44,881
It's like a three year-old succeeded
in punching a college student.

118
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,425
You won.

119
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,894
Tak-su, here's your protein-mixed coffee.

120
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,064
Coach.

121
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,818
Looks like you bought him
a business class ticket.

122
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,946
You're so generous
with other people's money.

123
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:12,533
Should I have someone with a broken rib
fly economy class to Brazil?

124
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,453
He broke a rib? Why?

125
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,872
Dong-man landed an attack
58 seconds into the fight.

126
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:21,417
It broke two of his ribs.
And it wasn't even a kick, it was a hook.

127
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,383
-Play the video again.
-Okay.

128
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,219
You heard what Karel said, right?

129
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,429
How would I know what he said?

130
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,806
He said do all you can to avoid Dong-man.

131
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,100
-What?
-He said you'll lose.

132
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,063
I gave him the money and now
he spews out nonsense.

133
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,649
So, will you go to the hospital
or to the gym?

134
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:45,733
Hospital?

135
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,568
Are you sick? Are you hurt?

136
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,654
He wants to get a Botox retouch.

137
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,163
Go to the gym.

138
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,710
It's delicious.

139
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,380
Sul-hee, just say hi and leave, okay?

140
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,049
I don't want you staying there.

141
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,260
The cookie was overbaked.

142
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,887
You're not even listening.

143
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,223
See you later.

144
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,808
Earn lots  of money.

145
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,518
Make lots of money!

146
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,270
Dong-man.

147
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,900
Why are you running the neighborhood
early in the morning?

148
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,279
He needs to get more beaten up
so he could give up MMA fighting.

149
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,990
He hasn't gotten beaten up enough.

150
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:34,991
Hey.

151
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,118
The swelling's gone.

152
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,329
Sul-hee, are you going
to the baby's birthday party?

153
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,372
Yes.

154
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,040
How do I look? Am I pretty?

155
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,336
-That's what you like.
-What?

156
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,671
Cheongdam daughter-in-law look.

157
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:52,174
-You know that luxurious look.
-I know.

158
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,011
You can just wear trainers.

159
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,846
You look like an ideal daughter-in-law.

160
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,766
Adults like the puppy type like you.

161
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,019
Really? What about you?

162
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,522
You're the kitten type that guys love.

163
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:07,898
Really?

164
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,651
I am like a kitten?

165
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,411
Why aren't you saying anything?
I'm offended.

166
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,372
Why would a human talk
while animals yap?

167
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,335
Dog, enjoy the birthday party.

168
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,129
Cat, let's eat brunch.

169
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,048
Why would I eat with you?

170
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,592
Eat with your Hye-ran.

171
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,226
Why is she acting different?

172
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,271
Why is she getting all sulky?

173
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,025
She's acting like a girl.

174
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,235
Wait for me!

175
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,348
EBC ANNOUNCER RECRUITMENT

176
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,484
YOU HAVE PASSED

177
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,196
What?

178
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,198
What should I do?

179
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,784
I passed. 

180
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,036
You passed? Passed what?

181
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,163
I don't see anything.

182
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,458
I passed round one for the announcer job.

183
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:50,751
You did?

184
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,005
They want to interview me!

185
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,092
Gosh, that's great! 

186
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,054
What should I do?

187
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,516
What should I wear?

188
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,436
Hold on.

189
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:12,690
Hey.

190
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,985
-Do you...
-What?

191
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,156
Why do you go around like that?

192
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,992
I know we are right by home, but still...

193
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:26,495
What?

194
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,592
I'm going crazy, why won't she pick up?

195
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,096
What's the use of a phone
if she's doesn't pick up?

196
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,934
Sul-hee, hang up.

197
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,645
You drive me crazy.
You said you don't have much to carry.

198
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,106
-Give it to me.
-Don't get it on your clothes.

199
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:58,527
You should've take a cab
if you have so much stuff to carry,

200
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,862
not the subway.

201
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,781
I worried there might be a traffic.

202
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,950
-Do you have liquid in here?
-Yes, some sweet rice drink.

203
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,953
You told me you made a little bit of food.

204
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:12,124
How can I only send some food
to our future in-law's party?

205
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:17,546
There's a bit of japchae and some jokbal
because that's my specialty. 

206
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,013
How could you forget to wear that?
Are you out of your mind?

207
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:29,016
Still, this isn't necessary. 

208
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,268
I know.

209
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:34,146
You don't really have to wear because...

210
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,190
What was that?

211
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,784
Are you two close?

212
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,078
Hello.

213
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,412
Who is she?

214
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,207
She lives on the fifth floor.

215
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,334
She's our landlord
and she recently moved in.

216
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,294
I'm not married. 

217
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,421
I'm Ganako Hwang.

218
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:00,923
Hello.

219
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,303
Do you wallpaper the rooms yourself?

220
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,139
Why should I waste my money?

221
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:14,895
I dislike people who don't work
and play all the time. 

222
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,484
Pay your rent on time.

223
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,028
One more thing.

224
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,073
Even though you guys are close,

225
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,117
you can't sleep in the same room. 

226
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,206
Why would we even do that?

227
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,751
I shut out and block all possible sources.

228
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:42,006
Our floor is more innocent
than monks living in a temple. 

229
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,507
What is he saying?

230
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:48,220
I like how you have an iron-willed
determination.

231
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,520
Make me some coffee.
I like it sweet.

232
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,734
You aren't coming in here.
I'm blocking you out!

233
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,365
Why does she get all sulky all the time?

234
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,704
I told you not to act like a real woman!

235
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,502
I guess you're ready to get married.

236
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,922
I can't believe you baked cookies.

237
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:26,550
Only because I was bored after work.

238
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:30,137
Why do you work so hard anyway?

239
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,640
Quit when you get married. 

240
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:38,103
Your dad turns off the TV whenever
he sees a home shopping channel. 

241
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,857
He can't stop thinking about his daughter
always on the phone,

242
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,360
taking orders and complaints
over the phone.

243
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,862
He says it makes him feel angry. 

244
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:51,033
I just have to sit down and pick up calls.

245
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,244
We're here. 

246
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,040
Do you want to come in and say hi?

247
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,042
No, of course not. 

248
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,712
-I'm not dressed up.
-I think you look just fine.

249
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,715
-I told you to get bangs.
-Don't touch my hair. 

250
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:11,553
When you see your future mother-in-law,
ask her when our families should meet. 

251
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,430
Okay, I will. 

252
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,473
I'll get going.

253
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,809
You have a lot to carry.

254
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,269
-Are you really going?
-See you.

255
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,523
Take care and please answer your phone. 

256
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,919
To solve the North's nuclear issue,

257
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,506
President Donald Trump decided to put
a pressure on...

258
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,971
Should I just nuke her?

259
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,855
How dare she show up
at Dong-man's again?

260
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,650
And he's about to fall for her again.

261
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,551
Get your coffee from that temple
you talked about. 

262
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,808
Share a coffee with Hye-ran. 

263
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,560
Your Hye-ran!

264
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,312
Talking about me?

265
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:44,855
You...

266
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,984
Hello.

267
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:52,154
Is this how you live?

268
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,370
Do you want to become an announcer again?

269
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,664
Me as a role model?

270
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,337
Do you have a habit of coming here now?

271
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,882
I dropped by to see you
before I visit Dong-man.

272
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,094
-To tell you something.
-Whatever. I don't care.

273
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,678
I'm not going to do you a favor.

274
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,764
-Ae-ra.
-What?

275
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,851
Do you know your way of communication
is really immature and childish?

276
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,104
What do you expect?

277
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,690
Do you want me to sit here with you
and talk over coffee or something?

278
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,532
Okay, I'll get to the point.

279
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,035
Dong-man and I will start over. 

280
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:42,663
What?

281
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,104
Why would he?

282
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:08,939
Did he say he will?

283
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,151
Hey, he's never been...

284
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,486
married yet. 

285
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,991
Does it have to be a man
who makes a comeback?

286
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,784
I have everything now.

287
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:24,037
Money, connections and name value.

288
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,083
Now, I just really need Dong-man.

289
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,128
I told you never to show up
at his place again.

290
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:34,798
I'm not here for a permission.
It's a notice. 

291
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,260
-He is mine--
-And I should stay away?

292
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,012
No.

293
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,268
Don't make yourself anymore pathetic.

294
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,271
What did you just say?

295
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:52,232
Are you calling me pathetic?

296
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:56,195
You pretend to be his loyal friend
when you can't even be the one.

297
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,362
It's hilarious.

298
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,949
It's better to be a psycho
than a pathetic girl.

299
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,827
Hey.

300
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,664
I told you I can hit a woman. 

301
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,499
Think about it.

302
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,462
Was there ever a time when you beat me?

303
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,215
Excuse me, Ae-ra. 

304
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:22,638
I take back what I said about
you and a temple. 

305
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,725
Why do you keep getting on my nerves...

306
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:28,810
by getting all sulky?

307
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,982
Why are you acting different?

308
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,986
Are you acting different?

309
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,491
Why? That's so sad.

310
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:54,044
Your Hye-ran's here. Take her away.

311
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:56,880
Dong-man.

312
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,509
Dong-man.

313
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,761
What are you doing here?

314
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,014
I got worried and wanted to see
how you're doing.

315
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:11,395
-Should I be grateful?
-I told you to answer your phone.

316
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,818
Hye-ran.

317
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,114
When I heard about your divorce...

318
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,368
honestly, my heart sank. 

319
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,372
When you called me...

320
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,000
I thought I could barely breathe.

321
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,422
His heart sank?

322
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,466
That idiot is doing it again. 

323
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,971
Sure, that idiot and the witch
are made for each other. 

324
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:50,350
I won't care about neither of them
anymore.

325
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,107
You're moved by my call. 

326
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,694
Yes.

327
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,071
In case you're like this again.

328
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,410
I got afraid you'd put me through a replay
of our horrifying five years again.

329
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,582
Do me a favor. 

330
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,419
Please go and get lost.

331
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,724
What's all this you brought?

332
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,312
This is sweet rice drink
my mom made herself. 

333
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:40,317
People who tasted it ask her
to send them bottles of it and...

334
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,902
she sent us two bottles.

335
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,279
Why did she send so much jokbal?

336
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:48,408
This is what my family sells
at the restaurant.

337
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,411
My mom didn't add any artificial flavor.

338
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,789
She broiled the jokbal
with medical herbs only.

339
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,251
Cover it up, it reeks of pork. 

340
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:02,672
Everyone has morning sickness.
Don't make a big deal out of this.

341
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:07,094
They are pork.
That's why it smells like pork.

342
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:11,264
Thank you so much
for the thought and effort.

343
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:14,393
But we're going
with a brunch party theme. 

344
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,812
I'm afraid jokbal doesn't fit as a menu.

345
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,148
What's in the luggage? Are you traveling?

346
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,236
These are...

347
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:29,991
I made it myself for you to give out
to the guests today.

348
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:34,496
My goodness, this is incredible.

349
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,165
Weren't you busy at work?

350
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,252
I took a day off. 

351
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,963
I had to do something
for Min-seo's birthday.

352
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,174
Did Joo-man say he can't make it today?

353
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,679
Did you try talking to him?

354
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,983
Mr. Kim, what should I do now?

355
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,192
All of a sudden, it...

356
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,279
I need to make 100 copies.

357
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,658
I think I broke it.

358
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,334
What should I do?
I think I broke it again. 

359
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,212
Why do I keep causing troubles?

360
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,841
Why do I keep causing troubles?

361
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,432
Step aside.

362
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,392
Mind your clothes.

363
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,151
Hey.

364
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,738
Open the door, let's talk.

365
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,870
MOO-BIN

366
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,877
Hello, Moo-bin.

367
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,298
You're at the department store?

368
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,260
Why are you there?

369
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:16,181
You're going to wait for me
until I'm done?

370
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,686
You should just curse at me.

371
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,898
Why are you keep getting sulky unlike you?

372
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:32,155
You hang around pretending
you're his friend. 

373
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:33,823
That's hilarious.

374
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:39,746
Sure, let's meet.

375
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:52,050
Let's talk. Where are you going?

376
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,555
Let go of me.

377
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,932
Where are you going?

378
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,270
Why do you care where I go?

379
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:05,981
Well...

380
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,942
I didn't tell her to come.

381
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:13,113
-She came on her own.
-Why are you telling me that?

382
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:14,656
Do you like me?

383
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,121
Or do I like you?

384
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,668
Let's not cross the line.

385
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:30,422
I don't want that witch to pity me.

386
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,884
Let's behave ourselves.

387
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:51,901
It's working now.

388
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,031
The printer gets jammed often.

389
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:59,951
When you print double-sided,
you should insert paper separately.

390
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,789
You have ink on your face.

391
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:08,960
Mr. Kim,

392
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,630
Thank you.

393
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,049
I have to buy you a drink today.

394
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:18,595
There's this new grilled skewers place
and it tastes really good.

395
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,389
The atmosphere's great as well.
Let's have a drink today.

396
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,516
I...

397
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:27,562
I have a lot of work to do,
so I might have to work tonight.

398
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,231
Then, do you want to watch a movie
this weekend?

399
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,777
I have family plans this weekend.

400
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,821
-What about tomorrow night?
-Tomorrow...

401
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,158
I need to watch a soccer.

402
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,374
I said I wanted to thank you.

403
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,876
Let's just have drink together.

404
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,003
Why are you making things complicated?

405
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,057
DEAR, DON'T KISS HER

406
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,607
I don't know why you're mad,
but I'm sorry.

407
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:15,944
Sorry.

408
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,794
Come on, why are you not keeping up?

409
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,426
What's this? Why did you put down
my shoe size?

410
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,389
-What?
-Why is it so detailed?

411
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,474
SYDNEY OLYMPIC SILVER MEDALIST

412
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:51,396
I don't know if women in this neighborhood
find you attractive.

413
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,065
As an instructor, I mean. 

414
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,570
This is very strategic.

415
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,742
I don't even know why I asked him to help.

416
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:05,827
Come here.

417
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,583
-Hello.
-Welcome.

418
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,334
-Did you eat?
-Yes.

419
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,795
-I wanted to meet the star fast.
-The star?

420
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,006
-Hello.
-Hello.

421
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,257
Look at me.

422
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:26,097
Go to the restroom and wet your hair
for a photo shoot. 

423
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,349
What's this? What's it for?

424
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,353
Counterattack.
We're preparing a revenge.

425
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,231
-What?
-We need to give a response.

426
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,985
-Sir, have you confirmed everything?
-Yes.

427
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,279
I have Karel Carlos' hotel
check-in information

428
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:45,033
and his departure information
right after the match.

429
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:49,245
Kim Tak-su's scheme is quite messy.

430
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:50,997
This will make a story.

431
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,128
You thought I'd let it go?

432
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:01,299
Look at you, you look so cold,
but actually very warm-hearted.

433
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,176
Get ready to die.

434
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,554
-I have your debut match scheduled.
-Really?

435
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,307
You're the one who needs to counterattack.

436
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:13,311
You didn't look too bad fighting
that Brazilian. 

437
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:17,398
Coach, can I now call you my brother?

438
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:18,525
-You...
-Guard.

439
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,736
-Guard.
-You little...

440
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,739
Look here, lift one arm.

441
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:28,034
Here we go, good.

442
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:31,538
That's good, now another pose.

443
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:34,916
All right, here we go.

444
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:39,462
Sorry, do you mind moving to the side?

445
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:43,132
You too, thank you.

446
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,426
-Last one, here we go.
-I'm Sorry.

447
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,887
Here we go.
That's good.

448
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,348
Please stand up.

449
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,018
That's very nice. Looking great. 

450
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,271
Great pose, here it is.

451
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:02,735
-I think this is enough.
-Yeah, let's go smoke.

452
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,696
-Good job.
-Thank you.

453
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,534
-Be my sparring partner.
-Sorry?

454
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,160
You don't want to?

455
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,079
No, I will.

456
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:23,214
Hey, why would you get an interview?

457
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,633
It's for something.

458
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,219
I see. Is it because you got beaten up?

459
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,637
I saw that.

460
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,890
You got beaten up and I cracked up.

461
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:34,684
If I were you, I would have quit
from the embarrassment. 

462
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,979
That's not it, I got duped. 

463
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,316
Don't talk back.

464
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:46,362
In this gym, you're just a sandbag. 

465
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,656
Whose sandbag? My sandbag.

466
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,325
All right, Dong-man?

467
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,327
Take my punches. Here I go.

468
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,587
I almost forgot. 

469
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,590
I forgot the most important thing.

470
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,134
Oh, gosh. I'm tired.

471
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,639
Mother, you can just leave it.
I'll clean it up.

472
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,487
-Sul-hee, I'm sorry...
-Yes?

473
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,699
-Could you please set up this table, too?
-Sure, I'll do it now.

474
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,873
She makes me feel so uncomfortable.

475
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,376
She even baked these cookies.

476
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,295
Is she the one your brother dated
back in college?

477
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,589
-Her mom sells jokbal, right?
-For a man to succeed,

478
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:49,092
he needs to look at the girl's family.

479
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,635
He's such a moron.

480
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,846
We call her the crawling Sul-hee. 

481
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,723
Her family has nothing,

482
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,725
so she crawls in front of us.

483
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,602
-Goodness.
-Hey.

484
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,562
It's better that way.

485
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,357
Your sister-in-law is going
to be disciplined.

486
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,234
She's not my sister-in-law.

487
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,653
You don't know who's going
to walk down the aisle. 

488
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:13,241
Then, should I cancel
Joo-man's blind date?

489
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:16,828
What does her family do?

490
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,746
They own a restaurant.

491
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,832
They own a restaurant in Garosugil.

492
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:55,867
Ae-ra.

493
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,999
How come you could meet today?

494
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,334
I got the day off.

495
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,128
I made a surprise visit. 

496
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,089
You love surprises, don't you?

497
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,217
-Why aren't you wearing your uniform?
-Pardon?

498
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,637
Well, that's because...

499
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,975
I have a stomachache,
so I was going to leave early.

500
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,061
Get in.

501
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:27,690
Ms .Hwang, are you leaving already?

502
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:30,443
You should look around more.
There are many new products.

503
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:35,114
-This place has bad rumors.
-Rumors?

504
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,242
You need to control
some of your customers.

505
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,535
Excuse me?

506
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,663
King's chairman's second wife. 

507
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:46,501
She's notorious for shoplifting. 

508
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,252
On top of that...

509
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:55,134
I heard an innocent staff had to kneel
and apologize. 

510
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,302
Pardon?

511
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:59,639
About that incident?

512
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,558
You're pretty bold.

513
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:06,187
These days, that kind of incident
could lead to a store closure.

514
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:10,900
You guys need to take care
of things properly.

515
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:16,614
What I want is pretty simple. 

516
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,742
No matter which department store it is,

517
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,703
no VIPs should abuse their power. 

518
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,832
Are you telling me to expel her?

519
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,460
It's simple and just.

520
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:35,883
That's how a successful department store
should handle such matters.

521
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:43,474
You must really love Japanese music. 

522
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:49,397
Ae-ra, how's your stomach?
Does it hurt often?

523
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:53,568
I have a minor irritable bowl syndrome.

524
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,279
Today, I had a few things happened to me.

525
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:59,157
It has a huge psychological influence.

526
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,367
You shouldn't stress out.

527
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:09,625
Having you show up like this
isn't that good either. 

528
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,253
Did I make you feel uncomfortable?

529
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:15,298
I just missed you a lot. 

530
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:19,343
If I keep visiting you
at the hospital unnoticed,

531
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,387
it could make you feel uncomfortable, too.

532
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,431
I think I'd love that.

533
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:27,685
If you came to visit me spontaneously,
I'd be so happy.

534
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,231
I'll make sure to call next time.

535
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:39,447
Moo-bin.

536
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:45,786
I was just embarrassed that I wasn't sure
if I should tell people this or not but...

537
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,915
I quit work.

538
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:53,961
I see.

539
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,839
There's something else
I really want to do.

540
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,591
What is it?

541
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,136
It's embarrassing to say.

542
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,014
What is it? Can't you tell me?

543
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,016
Well...

544
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,352
An announcer.

545
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,437
Announcer?

546
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,272
Really?

547
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:16,817
I passed the first round,
so I'm going for an interview.

548
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,655
I'm not just saying this,
but I think it suits you very well.

549
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,075
-Really?
-Yes.

550
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,620
Why do I feel so happy though?

551
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:32,166
I think it's cool that you quit your job
and it's exciting that you passed.

552
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:36,796
But I'm most thankful that you told me
everything honestly.

553
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,508
Why are you so thankful?

554
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,717
I don't know.

555
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:46,514
You weren't sure if you could tell others,
but you told me.

556
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:51,644
That means we're not total
strangers anymore.

557
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:10,162
Unnie!

558
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,375
Did you clean this up?
I could've done it.

559
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:18,254
-No, it wasn't me.
-Really?

560
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,968
Sul-hee, you're working so hard.

561
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,807
By the way, mother.

562
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,686
When should we...

563
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,690
have the parents meet?

564
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:41,068
Right, we should set the date.

565
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,447
I recently hurt my knee, remember?

566
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,824
It's been really hectic getting treatment.

567
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:51,746
Why? Are you parents rushing you?

568
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,206
No, I was just asking.

569
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,712
My baby.

570
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,762
My pumpkin.

571
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:14,393
Min-seo, look. There are flowers.

572
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,229
KIM TAK-SU

573
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:21,108
Fifty-eight, 59.

574
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:30,701
Eighty, 81...

575
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,579
Why are you looking him up?

576
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:37,166
Fifty-six, 57...

577
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,794
Aren't you going to train?
Did you do your 100 punches?

578
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,963
How can I do 100 punches?
I'm not like this kid.

579
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,802
-Also, Tak-su's having fun at a club.
-What?

580
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,638
-What did you say?
-He's not training.

581
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,809
Why do you care if he's at a club?

582
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:58,687
I mean, the more I think about it...

583
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,524
it makes me upset that they fooled me.

584
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,818
-I'm speechless.
-How come?

585
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:07,071
You were always fooled
since middle school.

586
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:17,206
Hey, what are you thinking about?

587
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,251
Stop thinking.

588
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:24,171
Your brain isn't there to be used.

589
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,391
Sonya...

590
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:38,811
I don't even know who Alice is.
How can I have her number?

591
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:41,021
Fine, just show me then.
Let me look.

592
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,023
Sonya.

593
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:46,110
Do you want to die? So it's true.

594
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,862
You texted her first, didn't you?

595
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,238
No, I didn't.

596
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,533
Then why won't you show me your phone?

597
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,535
Just show me proof.

598
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,704
This is a matter of trust.

599
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,414
Do you really want to die?

600
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:01,208
Seriously, should I just show it to you?

601
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,752
I could, but...

602
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:09,300
what really bothers me right now
isn't about the false rumor.

603
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:17,641
I'm upset because you don't trust me.

604
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,727
Enough lies, just show me the text.

605
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,104
Sonya, watch your mouth.

606
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:27,109
Sonya, I'm a sportsman.
I would never act like a thug.

607
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:32,698
Hey, Alice and I are in the same group.
You really are a thug.

608
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:48,214
We know that already.

609
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,341
You don't have to worry.

610
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:54,970
We already took care of all the press.

611
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,181
Of course.

612
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,726
Also, please don't call me anymore.

613
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,478
Mr. Yang!

614
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:07,733
One moment, please.

615
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:12,613
Dong-man, what brings you here?

616
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:15,616
-He must be downstairs.
-Pardon?

617
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,289
Aren't you going down?

618
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:27,503
I think I have to finish this call first.

619
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,880
I'm too busy.

620
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,598
Sonya, I'm going to the restroom.

621
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,896
Why are you taking your phone
to the restroom?

622
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:52,653
Hey, Dong-man!
What are you doing here?

623
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:05,791
I'm okay, don't worry.

624
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,337
Tak-su.

625
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,466
I didn't know anything about jujutsu,
but I got to learn it, thanks to you.

626
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,137
Thanks for helping me train
with a famous Brazilian coach.

627
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,931
I wasn't ready for it, you thug!

628
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:23,017
You attack drunk people?

629
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,728
-Tak-su.
-You jerk!

630
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,742
Try your best.

631
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:44,079
No matter how hard you try...

632
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,915
you'll end up on the ring with me.

633
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:00,512
Kim Young-su, Kim Kyung-ah...

634
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:02,306
There's one from a guy.

635
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,849
Cheon Ha-yun.

636
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,768
Unnie!

637
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:07,394
CONGRATULATIONS FROM SUL-HEE'S MOM

638
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:08,812
Sul-hee's mom...

639
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:11,732
Did her mom come by?

640
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,527
She must've given it to Sul-hee.

641
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,283
There's 300,000 won.

642
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,952
The jokbal-in-law overtaxed herself.

643
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,413
Hey, she isn't our in-law.

644
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:32,086
Joo-man, I thought you had to work late.
How did you come?

645
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,089
-Where's Sul-hee?
-Over there.

646
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:48,394
Honey.

647
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,438
I thought you couldn't make it today.

648
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:57,111
What is it? Let go.

649
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:00,781
Mom, sis, all of you.

650
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,617
Don't look down on Sul-hee.

651
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,620
If you do, I won't forgive you.

652
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,122
Honey...

653
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:11,125
Sons are all useless.

654
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,210
Sul-hee.

655
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,879
Did you call him?

656
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,382
No, I didn't. I'm sorry.

657
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:19,758
What's wrong with you?

658
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:22,386
You don't even go to your in-laws
during the holidays.

659
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,681
So why does Sul-hee have to clean up
after your son's party?

660
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:30,436
She's a precious daughter
in her family, too.

661
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:33,522
-Get your act together.
-Hey, you tell us.

662
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,149
Did we ask you to work?

663
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,860
No, I did it because I wanted to.

664
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:40,904
Joo-man, I wanted to do it.
Stop it.

665
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:45,284
Treat Sul-hee well.
Don't look down on her.

666
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,619
-My goodness.
-What's wrong with you?

667
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:49,705
Am I that great?

668
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:51,415
I was born in a poor family.

669
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:54,418
I went to a local college
and I am only an assistant manager.

670
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,378
And whom do I thank for all that?

671
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:59,923
During college, she worked
and paid for my rent.

672
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:04,261
When I was looking for jobs,
you guys didn't support me.

673
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,181
It was Sul-hee who supported me.

674
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:10,350
You should bow to her and thank her.

675
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,938
-Don't do this to her.
-What a great boyfriend.

676
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,899
Are you even going to marry her?

677
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,568
You're not so...

678
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,154
Sure, I may not marry her.

679
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:27,785
But, if I don't marry her,

680
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:29,495
I'm not marrying anyone.

681
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,503
Joo-man.

682
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,006
Joo-man.

683
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:43,133
My belly.

684
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:59,316
You're going to watch me go in, right?

685
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:01,360
No.

686
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,904
I'm going in with you this time.

687
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,162
Why would you go in with me?

688
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:16,416
Why do you keep saying
you'll go into a woman's home?

689
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,752
Are you that...

690
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:21,672
uneducated?

691
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:25,425
I heard this is how Ahn Jae-hyun
won over Koo Hye-sun's heart.

692
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,726
You should stop surfing the web.

693
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:41,024
In my eyes, you're prettier
than Koo Hye-sun, so I put more.

694
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,485
You always massage your legs.

695
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,906
When did you see me do that?

696
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:51,577
Pardon? I wasn't staring or anything.

697
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:56,790
Fine, I'll say you didn't stare.

698
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,668
You're not well, right?

699
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:02,504
I'll help you carry it and leave.

700
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,882
No, I can carry it.

701
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:08,427
You can't carry this to fifth floor.
Let's go.

702
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,639
I can carry it.

703
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:21,106
I can take it from here.

704
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:27,279
-I'll drop this off and then go.
-I can really take it from here.

705
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:31,491
-I'll just drop this off.
-I'll take it.

706
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,078
Moo-bin, wait.

707
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:36,663
I need to tell you something.

708
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:48,258
Moo-bin, wait.

709
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:51,762
Moo-bin, I need to tell you something.

710
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:53,889
-What's happening?
-Pardon?

711
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:56,266
Why are you going up?

712
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,478
Why are you going up?

713
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:01,104
That's not it.

714
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:08,445
-Ae-ra!
-Miss!

715
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:10,447
Hey, hey!

716
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:12,866
-Ae-ra!
-Hey, wake up!

717
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,092
Don't go to my house again.

718
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:33,637
Were you worried
that I'd be working too hard?

719
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:35,263
You didn't like that?

720
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,057
Did you get annoyed?

721
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:42,020
You are always too submissive.

722
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:43,981
You don't lack anything.

723
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,774
It's not because I lack something.

724
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,985
It's because I like you.

725
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:52,114
It's because I like you so much

726
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:53,782
that I want you to like me.

727
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:56,493
That's why I want your family
to like me, too.

728
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:00,455
-Do you like me that much?
-Yes.

729
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:07,671
You know, earlier,
when you got all mad yelling,

730
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,008
I thought you looked kind of sexy.

731
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,892
Are my lips here?

732
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:30,068
I was so happy that you came.

733
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:32,446
I thought you had to work late.

734
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:35,157
Did you leave early
because you were worried about me?

735
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:38,368
Your mother texted me, so I left early.

736
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:39,953
-My mom?
-Yes.

737
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,872
My mom texted you?

738
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:42,873
Yes.

739
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:48,462
It was the first time she texted me,
so I was shocked.

740
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:51,048
She doesn't know how to send
text messages.

741
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:58,597
-A suit, okay?
-Okay.

742
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,140
Okay!

743
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,063
Let me benefit from my friends.

744
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:14,613
-Look at him, he eats so well.
-How adorable.

745
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:16,865
You should eat slowly.

746
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:20,410
-He takes after me.
-You must've been hungry.

747
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:26,249
That moron, that idiot!

748
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:29,252
She always shows off in front of her mom.

749
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:31,922
She's such an idiot.

750
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:34,883
That jerk!

751
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,303
That disgusting family.
I'm going to...

752
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,265
Where is it? 

753
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:45,143
Forget getting married.

754
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,896
Do not show up in front of Sul-hee again.

755
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:51,691
I won't let a family like that
have my daughter!

756
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:21,179
Joo-man, how are you doing?

757
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,640
Long time no see.

758
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:28,103
Sul-hee went to the birthday party
by herself.

759
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:32,315
Sul-hee likes you very much.

760
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:36,778
Please be good to my girl.

761
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:44,744
What's wrong, What is it?

762
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:52,836
My mom cleaned up all the garbage...

763
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:55,797
What garbage?

764
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:02,262
I think my mom saw everything.

765
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:04,097
She must've seen everything.

766
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:11,229
Don't cry.

767
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:12,898
Mom...

768
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:26,369
SUL-HEE'S JOKBAL

769
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:32,209
So, when are we meeting
Joo-man's parents?

770
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:35,295
This month sometime?

771
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:37,589
What about Sul-hee?

772
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:39,382
Is she doing well?

773
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:42,969
-Honey.
-Yes?

774
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:48,475
Should we close the jokbal shop
and open a restaurant?

775
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:52,229
-What are you talking about?
-Just...

776
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:54,940
I don't like...

777
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:59,611
people saying Sul-hee's parents run
a jokbal place.

778
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:08,912
It's IBS. Irritable Bowl Syndrome.

779
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:13,917
-Really? Is it serious?
-Yes.

780
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:16,753
Her stomach was full of gas.

781
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:21,883
-She fainted because of gas?
-That's not common.

782
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:26,221
I think she fainted from the pain
caused by the gas.

783
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,349
She was extremely stressed.

784
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:33,395
What did you do to stress her out
that she fainted during a date?

785
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:38,358
-She's okay now, right?
-You saw her release the gas, right?

786
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:41,111
I want to die.

787
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:43,280
Yes, twice. 

788
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,115
One was a long fart.

789
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:48,576
I can never open my eyes again.

790
00:54:58,336 --> 00:54:59,587
Are you sleeping?

791
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:01,548
Are you ignoring me?

792
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,092
Hey.

793
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:08,263
She's really bothering me.

794
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:19,065
Hello.

795
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:23,069
Why...

796
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:28,408
Are you en route to Ae-ra
or the announcer who came back?

797
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:29,617
Sorry?

798
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,954
Ae-ra...

799
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:37,083
-fainted and she was taken to a hospital.
-Who? Ae-ra?

800
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:40,587
-Ae-ra is in the hospital?
-Yes.

801
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,381
Severance hospital, Room 2701.

802
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:45,633
The Royal Suite Room.

803
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:04,194
Not again.

804
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,953
I'm awake now.

805
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,706
Are you awake? Are you okay?

806
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:18,083
Sorry?

807
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,379
You fainted.

808
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:26,591
You stomach was filled with gas
because of your IBS.

809
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,719
Thank God, the gas came out.

810
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:32,597
It's nothing serious,
but the gas had to come out.

811
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:34,557
Please stop.

812
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:37,894
Please stop talking about gas.

813
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:40,063
I see.

814
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:46,903
Can you please take this out for me?
I want to go home.

815
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,864
You should just sleep here tonight.

816
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:58,998
I want to go home.
It's uncomfortable.

817
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:04,921
Why do you always want to go home
when you're with me?

818
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,427
KO DONG-MAN

819
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:16,641
Why doesn't she pick up?

820
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:19,769
She's strong enough to knock down a cow.
Why did she faint?

821
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,605
KO DONG-MAN

822
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:25,442
Don't answer.

823
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:30,864
Ae-ra, can't you please look at me?

824
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,534
-Sorry?
-The truth is...

825
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:37,912
this room is really expensive.

826
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:41,749
I wanted to do all I could
to earn some points.

827
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:43,543
That's why I requested for this room.

828
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:48,131
I didn't even get this room for my mom
when she had her appendectomy.

829
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:51,593
Why are you telling me this...

830
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:54,554
And actually, I'm off today.

831
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:59,726
But, I went and got my white gown
to look cool.

832
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:04,314
I want to do anything I could
to win your heart.

833
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,984
But, why do you find me uncomfortable?

834
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:12,447
Why does your stomach hurt
when you're with me?

835
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:16,993
Why is a guy so sweet?

836
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,245
This is so sweet.

837
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:23,041
I think about you all day long
and I'm not even lying.

838
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:28,796
I think of any excuse possible,
like the massage machine, saying I'm off,

839
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:31,174
just to see you once more.

840
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:33,176
Please stop.

841
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,929
I'm feeling weak right now.

842
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:39,224
A person's heart gets soft
when they're sick.

843
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:42,769
To me...

844
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:44,854
you are...

845
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:54,322
like a goddess.

846
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:01,538
Even when I look at you
and even if you don't say anything...

847
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:07,627
Even just by looking at you...

848
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:13,383
my heart...

849
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,095
goes crazy.

850
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,606
You can't do this when someone's sick.

851
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,901
That's cheating.

852
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,364
Then, I'll cheat.

853
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:59,596
Dong-man, this isn't what you think.

854
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:50,313
I'm scared.

855
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:07,622
Who farted?

856
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:09,082
I think it was Ae-ra.

857
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:20,760
-Dong-man stinks.
-Did he poop?

858
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:30,853
You pretty thing, good job. 

859
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:32,689
It's all yours.

860
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,980
