1
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,730
I'll see you all again.

2
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:25,942
Hey, Park Hye-ran.

3
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,904
Dong-man may be a moron.

4
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,532
But you know I've got his back.
And I'm tough.

5
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,492
Me too.

6
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:40,040
Ae-ra.

7
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,250
Please keep your nose out of it.

8
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,920
I'm always going to be nosy.

9
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,465
If you want to get him,
take me down first.

10
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,508
Take me down as well. 

11
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:54,429
You'll have to shoot me first.

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,723
Ae-ra.

13
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:58,308
Good luck.

14
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,810
Try your best.

15
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,106
I'll get going.

16
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:34,427
Dong-man, I've missed you.

17
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:39,224
Darn it.

18
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,190
COACH

19
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,448
Dong-man that moron.

20
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,283
What if he falls for it again?

21
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,791
KIM TAK-SU KNOCKED OUT

22
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,671
So many people are out of their mind.

23
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,756
Why would they beat up anyone?

24
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,261
Wait.

25
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,263
This is!

26
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,392
Coach.

27
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,187
You didn't have to pick me up.

28
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,772
Let's go for your morning workout.

29
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:30,441
We have to work hard for you
to debut next year.

30
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,027
Why are you whispering?

31
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,739
You told me the crazy girl lives here.

32
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,992
-The microphone psycho.
-Oh, Ae-ra?

33
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:44,122
Hey! Ko Dong-man!

34
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,382
Hey, explain this.

35
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,593
Are you a gangster?

36
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,678
Why would you go around
beating people?

37
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,430
Are you really doing MMA?

38
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,183
However it turns out,
I've decided to go for it.

39
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,686
-The life of a martial arts master--
-A master?

40
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:12,525
Now I know the reason
why you're into an absurd idea.

41
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,113
You lured him in, didn't you?

42
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,616
I didn't. I only lure woman.

43
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,784
You did lure me.

44
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,581
He's so disloyal, don't you think?

45
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,339
You better not follow that man around.

46
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,466
Come to the department store
by lunch no matter what.

47
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,801
Why do you always order me around?

48
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,805
Remember we're attending
a Jujutsu lesson at lunch.

49
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,810
If I tell you to come, you better come.

50
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,979
If you don't come, I'll go to you.

51
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,775
I'll make it to his studio then.

52
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,277
Go, you should go see her.

53
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,904
You have to eat lunch anyway.

54
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,706
Yes.

55
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,334
Yes.

56
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,170
It's just a small happening.

57
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,757
You know better, people will forget soon.

58
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,426
You shouldn't do business emotionally.

59
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,845
Isn't it time I get my roots dyed?

60
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,555
I have a magazine shoot today.

61
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,642
Contour my face to make
my face smaller.

62
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,728
You lost all your shoots.

63
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,188
Darn it.

64
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:36,317
There's no time for you
to get your hair done everyday.

65
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,987
-Aren't you going to train?
-Stop nagging.

66
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,447
Just tell me how to put out the fire.

67
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,449
Let me think about it, okay?

68
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,496
Here you go, Tak-su.
Here's a straw.

69
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,916
The public is...

70
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,502
The public is going crazy right now.

71
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,714
Should we start a new training schedule

72
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,799
for a revenge match?

73
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,219
We can analyze your opponent's techniques.

74
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:04,887
Hey.

75
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,973
Will you ever wake up?

76
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,018
I guess not.

77
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,106
It's hot! I only drink cold drinks.

78
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,860
To be honest,

79
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,154
I don't think this requires my action.

80
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,239
It's really just a minor happening.

81
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,616
However, many are requesting
a revenge match.

82
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,702
-Do you plan on doing it?
-Come on.

83
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:31,205
I don't think a pro like me should fight
a neighborhood gangster.

84
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:35,418
Also, I'm not in a place
to get into a match like this.

85
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,670
Fool, he's scared.

86
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,885
People are interested in him
calling a street fighter or something.

87
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:47,889
However, he's nothing but a gangster
from the streets.

88
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,017
Also, if people like him get up
to the Octagon...

89
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,937
they will come with two feet
and crawl out on all four.

90
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,190
Okay, fine then.

91
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,943
If that guy wins just once
at an amateur game,

92
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,779
I'll let him challenge me.

93
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,073
I told you no already.

94
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:11,162
Stop watching garbage and skipping.

95
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,166
Why not?

96
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,210
Let's fight a game right away.

97
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,379
You took a break for ten years.

98
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,256
You need to build more muscles
and train more.

99
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,175
I never took a break.

100
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,053
I was a mover and a courier man.
I trained my strength.

101
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:30,264
Unlike Tak-su who lazed around
in an air-conditioned gym,

102
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,768
my muscles were built on my hard work
and sweat.

103
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,479
Taekwondo and MMA are different.

104
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,773
You can't do ground fighting.

105
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,775
I can kick them.

106
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:45,613
Spin kick, high kick
then flying kick!

107
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,198
I won't lose. 

108
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,242
Stop yelling at me, you punk.

109
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:53,788
If you enter the ring in this condition,
you'll end up with injuries.

110
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,416
We can see whether or not
I can do it.

111
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,960
You told me I should take the risk
and try.

112
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:03,131
Why did I bring this dumb head here?

113
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,968
If your coach says no, that means no!

114
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,809
Stop watching TV and run ten laps
around the field.

115
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,770
Darn it.

116
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:30,450
KBC JOB APPLICATION

117
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,915
SUBMIT APPLICATION

118
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,336
YES

119
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,050
APPLICATION SUBMITTED

120
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,892
Are you a flight attendant
or an announcer?

121
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,144
Pardon?

122
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,062
They're slightly different.

123
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,772
Do I...

124
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,317
look like an announcer?

125
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:08,196
Aren't you? That's what I thought
when you walked in.

126
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,698
You're right.

127
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,159
Make me look like an announcer.

128
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,661
Okay, like an announcer.

129
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,872
Here we go. One, two...

130
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,169
What are you doing?

131
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,253
Sorry?

132
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,422
I was just looking at something.

133
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,429
Here.

134
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:36,724
What is this?

135
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,351
I found it on my way here.

136
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:47,318
If the in-house broadcaster position
opens up again,

137
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:50,238
I'll recommend you for sure.

138
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:57,119
From what I see, that new girl is...

139
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,038
pretty.

140
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,625
She's very pretty.

141
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,253
She'll probably get married soon.

142
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:08,297
You're trying to console me, right?

143
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,882
If she quits,

144
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,969
-I'll support you all the way--
-There's no need.

145
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,515
A horse who decides to run in the wild
doesn't return to the barn.

146
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,475
Run where?

147
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,894
If you feel guilty for what happened,

148
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,563
you should show it through action.

149
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,398
Sure, what do you want?

150
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,693
Then I'll buy you lunch today.

151
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:29,986
What do you want?

152
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,280
Seonjiguk? Pollack soup?
What do you want?

153
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,575
Well, actually...

154
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,829
Introduce me to the head of security.

155
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,581
Hey.

156
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,377
He's a married man.

157
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:54,010
-The sausage truck opens from 7 p.m.
-I see.

158
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,177
Sir.

159
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,306
Aren't you Ko-dong man?

160
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,182
-Who are you?
-Me?

161
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:05,605
I'm Yang Tae-hee from of Tiger MMA.

162
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,984
I see, nice to meet you.

163
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,405
But what are you doing here?

164
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,325
Wait, how do you know my name?

165
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,452
HIRING SECURITY GUARD

166
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,621
What? He has black belt in taekwondo?

167
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,790
Not only he's good at taekwondo,

168
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,043
he has an upright character.

169
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,004
He's kind of dumb, but he's kind.

170
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,007
He has slow wits, but doesn't have
an underlying motive. 

171
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,384
Is that a compliment or an insult?

172
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,803
Most importantly...

173
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,475
he's pretty good looking.

174
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:47,521
It'll be nice if our security guards
look good in their black suits.

175
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:49,690
Fine.

176
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,317
Tell him to come in for now.

177
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,571
Why do you need to see his face?

178
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,283
What are families all about?

179
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,286
I owe her something...

180
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,455
Please help me out. 

181
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,750
Fine.

182
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,420
It'd be good for us to hire someone good.

183
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,338
Hold on.

184
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,799
Which floor? Speak up.

185
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:20,179
First floor is luxury brands.

186
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,272
RFC AMATEUR TOURNAMENT APPLICATION

187
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,399
Coach.

188
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:35,277
Let's have Dong-man debut tomorrow.

189
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,530
What?

190
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,867
Let's win the amateur fight tomorrow
that Tak-su mentioned.

191
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,620
Let's win there and win your ticket
to the revenge match.

192
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:48,457
But still, tomorrow is a bit too rushed.

193
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,919
If not tomorrow...

194
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,380
you'll never be able to make your debut.

195
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,842
-What?
-Tak-su knows Dong-man's skills.

196
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:01,053
Why would he set such condition?

197
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,140
Don't ask me, just show your cards.

198
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,935
He'll cut off Dong-man's arms and legs.

199
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,271
Forget Seoul.

200
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:13,733
Now even small towns will accept
Dong-man's application to compete.

201
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,986
Tak-su's dad is a sponsor in this field,
so there's no way.

202
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,238
What about you, then?

203
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,658
I believe that birds of a feather
flock together.

204
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,201
To be honest...

205
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,999
I used to be Tak-su's waiter at a club.

206
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:34,420
For several years,
I cleaned up all his messes...

207
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,547
I've learned too much about Tak-su.

208
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,468
Of course, he didn't want me to become
arrogant.

209
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,846
He's the type to make enemies.

210
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:48,893
Tomorrow's amateur game is last one
I can help out.

211
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,606
Let's create a new stage together.

212
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:57,193
I understand why you want
to join our side...

213
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:01,530
but I don't trust traitors.
Moreover, tomorrow is ridiculous.

214
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,365
Why?

215
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,994
What do you mean why?
What else can you do other than kick?

216
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,372
Let's win his ticket to the revenge match
before it's too late.

217
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,041
We can train later--

218
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,503
Look, I promised to take responsibility
for his life.

219
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,215
I'm going to be extra cautious
with everything.

220
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,051
We won't do it. We won't.

221
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,889
Gosh, he's so inflexible.

222
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,267
Dong-man, I don't bet on a losing fight.

223
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:34,146
You're Ko Dong-man,
the one who knocked out Kim Tak-su.

224
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,482
That's why I'm betting my life on you.

225
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,069
Trust me and come with me.

226
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,826
Where are you? Get over here.

227
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,494
I'm not going.

228
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:49,870
I'll kill you.

229
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,997
Play it slowly.

230
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,166
That's it.

231
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,585
Stop!

232
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,213
You're right. She did it.

233
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,924
It disappeared when she passed by.

234
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,635
That watch costs ten million won.

235
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,476
Welcome.

236
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,439
-Enjoy your shopping.
-Enjoy your shopping.

237
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:23,362
I said to rush over.
Why are you showing up now?

238
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,739
What now? Why did you call me here?

239
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,701
Just go up to the security room
on the ninth floor.

240
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,912
-Tell them I sent you.
-Why would I go to the security room?

241
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,831
Get a job at the security team here.

242
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,958
Tell them you can start working tomorrow.

243
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,335
You don't listen to a word I say.

244
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,462
I told you I'm going to do MMA.

245
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,215
Stop talking nonsense.

246
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,551
Live as you have been so far.
Why suddenly--

247
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,428
You loved it when you grabbed the mic.

248
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,055
You said people must do what they love.

249
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,309
Rather than ending my life
in a vicious cycle,

250
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,227
I'm going to do something stupid.

251
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:59,023
Are you going through puberty?
What's wrong with you?

252
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,650
-I'm leaving, bye.
-Hey!

253
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:04,361
That lady.

254
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,532
She can't leave.

255
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,705
-Ma'am, did you enjoy your time here?
-Yes.

256
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,001
Did you find everything you wanted?

257
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,046
What is it?
Do you have something to tell me?

258
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,506
Ma'am, did you by any chance...

259
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,135
forget to pay for anything?

260
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,346
What?

261
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,557
If you forgot...

262
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,311
Ma'am, would you like
a cup of coffee or tea?

263
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,604
Move.

264
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:43,359
Did you by mistake drop
something in your bag...

265
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:51,033
Look. Is there anything in there?
Is there?

266
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,161
I'm sorry, I mistook you for someone else.

267
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,829
Are you out of your mind?

268
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,666
I'm sorry.

269
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,542
Put them back in.

270
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:02,878
Pardon?

271
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,005
Yes, of course.

272
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,178
Look carefully, do you see a watch?

273
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,984
Ma'am, I never said it was a watch.

274
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,364
You just made a big mistake!

275
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,241
What's your problem?

276
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,216
I don't think I made a mistake.

277
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,428
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

278
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,139
Our employee insulted you.
She didn't know anything.

279
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,683
I'm not letting her get away with this.

280
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:02,563
Please apologize to her.

281
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,106
Excuse me.

282
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,860
Sorry for butting in but...

283
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,822
why should she apologize
when she caught a thief?

284
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,575
What? A thief?

285
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,203
Shall we go inside, ma'am?

286
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,372
Come in.

287
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,088
Stay out here.

288
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:29,590
Does this make sense?

289
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,258
Stay here.

290
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,844
I don't want to feel ashamed
in front of you.

291
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,480
My goodness.

292
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,275
Don't you know me?

293
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,028
I'm King's chairman's second wife.

294
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:55,824
Do you want to check how much
I spend here a month?

295
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,577
I apologize, ma'am.

296
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:02,122
My employee didn't recognize you
and crossed the line.

297
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,291
I was going to show my husband
the watch

298
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,752
and then pay for it later.

299
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,170
Yes, of course.

300
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,005
I apologize, ma'am.

301
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,758
It's our employees fault. 

302
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,220
You're quite proud for someone
who named me a thief.

303
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,516
Why did you hide it under your hat
if you meant to pay?

304
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,935
-How dare you?
-Forget it.

305
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,355
I'll tell my members not to shop here
anymore.

306
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,649
Let's see how you do
without the VIP customers.

307
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,902
I won't spend money at a place
with untrained staffs.

308
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,404
Ae-ra, apologize immediately.

309
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,532
Let's see how you manage.

310
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,033
Ma'am.

311
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,787
Come on, why won't you apologize?

312
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,092
I'm sorry.

313
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,430
Ma'am, she's still very young.

314
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,224
Please let it go.

315
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:06,895
I feel even worse because
a young girl treated me so badly.

316
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,356
What should I do with her?

317
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:12,568
What should I do to make myself
 feel better?

318
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,706
They should reward her
for catching a thief. 

319
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,749
Why scold her?

320
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,300
Thank you, ma'am.

321
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,802
I was merciful to let it off at this.

322
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,263
Anyone else would've made a big fuss.

323
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,350
Train your employee properly.

324
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,771
The money I spend here
includes her salary, service...

325
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,692
and the right to make her kneel,
doesn't it?

326
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,694
I'll make it right.

327
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,491
-My goodness.
-Hey!

328
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,410
What are you doing?

329
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:07,873
My goodness.

330
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,918
She quits as of this moment.

331
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,461
Hey!

332
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,298
Does the tiny salary you pay her
give you the right to do this?

333
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,091
What you spend...

334
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,594
doesn't include the right to abuse!

335
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,429
You have no right to do this.

336
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,307
VIP or not, you're just a thief!

337
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,727
She's just an employee
who caught a thief!

338
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,199
That hurts.

339
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,119
Why do you cause trouble all the time?

340
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,121
You just lost me my job.

341
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,082
Were you going to stay after that?

342
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,211
Kneeling doesn't wear my kneecaps down.

343
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:55,587
What?

344
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,173
I just close my eyes
and take a deep breath.

345
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,593
Then, I just pretend nothing happened.

346
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:06,306
I can just go back to working
at the information desk.

347
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,686
It'll be like nothing happened...

348
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,815
and no one will find out
that I knelt in front of her.

349
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,484
It'll just...

350
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,535
It hurts.

351
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,704
They hurt so much.

352
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,546
Back in my locker...

353
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,632
there's my slippers, bag...

354
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:45,512
clothes and everything else.
I need to get them all.

355
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,895
This is so embarrassing.

356
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,233
Why did you stay out there?

357
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,862
Because of you...

358
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:04,448
Because of you...

359
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,118
That was really nothing.

360
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,360
IT'S OKAY EVEN IF YOU'RE JOBLESS

361
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,661
Gosh.

362
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,753
Are you still at work?

363
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:01,671
Yes.

364
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,186
Here!

365
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,729
You didn't tell me...

366
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:19,815
Ye-jin.

367
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,442
I heard you're working late.

368
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,584
Isn't work too hard or anything?

369
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,921
It's hard.

370
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,882
The hardest part is waking
early in the morning.

371
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,175
Why do you work then?

372
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,261
What?

373
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:52,556
You don't have to work, right?

374
00:23:54,975 --> 00:24:00,147
Well, everyone here thinks I work here
just for fun.

375
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,191
I want to continue working here.

376
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,736
I love coming to work.

377
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:11,825
Are you born to be a career woman?

378
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,746
Not really.

379
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,460
It's because of you.

380
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:27,924
I get up at six every morning
to curl my hair.

381
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,056
I'm sorry.

382
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,397
Pretend you didn't hear that.

383
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,983
That was hilarious.

384
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,359
Hello.

385
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,702
Hello, Sul-hee.

386
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,456
Hello, I left something behind.

387
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,919
We're wearing the same hoodie.

388
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,714
Yes, it must be a popular item.

389
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:09,925
I should've bought a fake one, too.

390
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,426
What?

391
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,387
I bought it overseas
and had it shipped over.

392
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:18,016
The logo looks so similar,
you can't tell the difference.

393
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:19,518
It's a waste of money.

394
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:20,810
I had no idea.

395
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,939
I just got it because it was pink.

396
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,983
I love pink as well.

397
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,610
Where do you usually shop, unnie?

398
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:32,781
-Unnie?
-We think we have similar tastes...

399
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,116
and you look much older than me.

400
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,743
So, can I call you unnie?

401
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,328
Sure, why not?

402
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,705
I don't think I'm much older.

403
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,251
It's my mom.

404
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,213
-I have to go.
-Okay.

405
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,799
-See you tomorrow.
-See you.

406
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,259
-Bye.
-Bye.

407
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,099
Why are you still waving?

408
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,643
She's very cheerful, isn't she?

409
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:08,108
-Why did you bring food?
-To surprise you.

410
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,568
What was so funny?

411
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,861
You were laughing really loudly.

412
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:14,906
-Me?
-Yes.

413
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:17,659
I wasn't.

414
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,623
Please wire you rent.

415
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,753
Look what you put us into.

416
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,339
Do you want both of us to be homeless?

417
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,842
Why do you keep causing trouble?

418
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,430
I'll take care of you.

419
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:40,807
How are you going to do that?

420
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,686
You can be my manager.

421
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:47,522
Did I hear something wrong?

422
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,525
Do I have to reply?

423
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,612
You'll be a sports manager.
It's a professional job.

424
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,655
You got the job though connections.

425
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:56,823
Really?

426
00:26:57,073 --> 00:27:00,827
You got me fired and what did you say?

427
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:05,874
You're a loser. Are you out of your mind?

428
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:11,671
Manager?
Shut your nerveless mouth right now.

429
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:16,968
Is that what you want?

430
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:27,604
Please help me out.

431
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,564
Thank you so much.

432
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:34,986
So, please fill in for a few more days. 

433
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,821
Why did Ae-ra quit all of a sudden?

434
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,239
I'm glad she left.

435
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,574
What?

436
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,869
He threw the hat and they ran off.

437
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,663
Good riddance.

438
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:49,918
I think whatever she does, she'll do well.

439
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,837
And I hope she does.

440
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,554
You were looking for Ae-ra last time.

441
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:02,931
Yes.

442
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,308
I guess she's not here again?

443
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,144
She quit.

444
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,897
Sorry, she quit?

445
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:14,526
Why? Since when?

446
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,155
Do you want a drink
since we're both unemployed?

447
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,574
I have a couple of soju bottles
in my fridge.

448
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,078
-I can't.
-No way, is this real?

449
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,372
Did you turn down soju?

450
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,290
My face will get puffy.

451
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:32,794
Who cares? You're unemployed.
You have nowhere to go.

452
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,338
I do have somewhere to go.

453
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,632
Where are you going?

454
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,762
Where are you going?
Why aren't you telling me?

455
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,640
You're seeing that punk, right?

456
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,979
-Don't call him a punk.
-What are you going to do with him?

457
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,399
Something kids don't know.
That's what we're going to do. 

458
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:01,114
Baby, you should sleep early.

459
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,240
Sleep tight.

460
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:12,751
You crazy punk.

461
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,796
Is he really a kid or what?

462
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,965
INTERN JANG YE-JIN

463
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,593
INTERN JANG YE-JIN

464
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,688
I WON'T LIKE IT IF YOU IGNORE ME

465
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,492
Mr.Kim, let's go to Yeouido this Saturday.

466
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:49,078
Please help me find some information
at the library.

467
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:54,626
I can take you to the fireworks
and treat you rib eye with wine.

468
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:58,755
You're not going to ignore me
like last time, right?

469
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:13,186
Honey, let's take a selfie stick
to the fireworks.

470
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,272
I haven't posted photos of us lately

471
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,525
so people on my blog are wondering why.

472
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,401
They're just saying that.

473
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,863
It's going to be so crowded.

474
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:29,744
-Should I wear the dress you bought me?
-Sure, wear anything you want.

475
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,334
Joo-man, should we just not go?

476
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,336
What?

477
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:42,340
I mean, if you're busy,
we don't have to go.

478
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,719
To be frank...

479
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,642
I do have to work this Saturday.

480
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,853
What? What is it for?

481
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:01,025
Please don't lie to me, please don't.

482
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:03,903
You see...

483
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:10,702
The intern keeps asking me to help.

484
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:16,082
If this goes wrong,
my hard work goes to waste.

485
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:22,380
The intern said if I helped,
I'd be treated with rib eye and wine.

486
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,424
That's not what I wanted.

487
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:30,763
People like that intern, who are bright
but clueless are troublesome, right?

488
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,893
Be nice.

489
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,728
Stop criticizing.

490
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:40,815
This is when Mr. Kim from the sales team
has to step in.

491
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,736
Let's go on a date next week.

492
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,613
Let's go for good food.

493
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,239
Okay.

494
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,955
This is all because of Kim Chan-ho.

495
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:00,752
Who?

496
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:04,380
It's this new scrawny intern called
Kim Chan-ho.

497
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,050
This is all his fault.

498
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:37,163
Let's sleep.

499
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,160
Someone who plays recreational soccer...

500
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,287
doesn't become a pro with new cleats.

501
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,459
Should I tie my hair?

502
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,628
Or should I let it down?

503
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,339
Of course you have to tie it.
He has to see your neckline.

504
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,383
What about the move I taught you?

505
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:34,595
-Right, the one Joo-man fell for?
-Yes.

506
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,265
Try, let's do it.

507
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:40,852
Other way.

508
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:44,647
Turn your neck completely.

509
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,107
Is it true?

510
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,235
I pretended to fall for it.
She did that all day.

511
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:53,406
-You're really incredible.
-That is a killer move.

512
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,700
Who won't fall for it?
Any guy will.

513
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,870
Even I would fall for it.

514
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:04,542
Guys, stop sharing such information.

515
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:07,128
I think you should just look it up.

516
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,756
What's the date plan?

517
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,926
Well, we'll watch a movie,

518
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:17,263
have some tea and grab a drink.
That should be it.

519
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,224
-I'm jealous.
-Hey!

520
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,852
-Why are you wearing a perfume?
-You scared me!

521
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,105
-Why are you yelling at me?
-You punk!

522
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:28,357
Come home before the sun sets.

523
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,278
-Am I a kid?
-Get back by 7 p.m., okay?

524
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,823
Who are you to tell me what to do?

525
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:38,785
Hey, get this straight.
I'm Choi Ae-ra.

526
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,703
Let me tell you our level.

527
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:43,915
If I'm here, you're down there.

528
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:48,795
You used to hold my school bag for me.
How dare you!

529
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:52,673
Come home by 7 p.m.
If you're late, I'll tell your dad.

530
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:56,344
I'll tell him that you wore a perfume
and went on a date with some dude

531
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,054
and will come home late. 

532
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,307
What's wrong with you?

533
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:03,476
Why are you overreacting?

534
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:13,069
-What do I do? He's almost here.
-Get ready.

535
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,124
Excuse me.

536
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,960
Yes? Who are you?

537
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:30,920
Me?

538
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,382
I live on the fifth floor.

539
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:38,553
I'm the new landlord and the owner
of this villa. 

540
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,388
I see.

541
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,766
Hello, nice to meet you.

542
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,394
Didn't you see my text message yesterday?

543
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:50,731
Well, I saw it, but...

544
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,109
I'm going through some changes.

545
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,862
Can I pay the rent
by the end of the month?

546
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:57,905
Did you lose your job?

547
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,449
If that's the case...

548
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,161
pay me what you can for now.

549
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,745
You can pay me cash.

550
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,087
I don't think I have any cash.

551
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:17,592
Take out what you have.

552
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,722
Is she trying to steal money from me?

553
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:29,270
Do girls really find men who can
 reverse attractive?

554
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:34,108
Yes, make sure to reverse with one hand.

555
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,652
Hold the passenger seat
with your right hand.

556
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,155
Left hand is there to assist.
Good luck.

557
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:40,948
Like this?

558
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,159
Right hand on the passenger seat.

559
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,703
Left hand is here to assist.

560
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:49,373
This is the point.

561
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,300
Ae-ra!

562
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:06,057
Why did you come so early?

563
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:15,024
-Get in. We have a busy day today.
-Okay.

564
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,498
I'm glad you're on holiday.

565
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,917
We can go on a date together
on my day off.

566
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,379
That's right.

567
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:40,383
I should just take a long holiday.

568
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,136
You can look forward to today.

569
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,889
I've planned the best date.

570
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,226
You have a silky hair.

571
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,363
I've never seen anyone reverse like this.

572
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,282
I'm sorry.

573
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:13,207
-You're taking a day off?
-I already did.

574
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,252
I know you can't go because of work.
I can't miss it. 

575
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:20,089
I told you not to go.
I don't like you going there alone.

576
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,758
I have to. It's the first day
of your cousin's baby.

577
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,010
I'll just drop by.

578
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,237
-Why aren't you checking your messages?
-What?

579
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,283
This is our work group chat.

580
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:48,951
It's annoying to check.

581
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,329
Who's in the chat?

582
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,331
-Is Kim Chan-ho in the chat?
-Who?

583
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,082
Intern Kim Chan-ho.

584
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,960
How do you know Chan-ho?

585
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,547
Right, I mentioned him yesterday.

586
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:05,676
Yes, he wanted you to help him
this weekend. 

587
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:06,927
Right.

588
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,889
He promised to treat you
rib eye and wine.

589
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:13,809
The weakest looking among the interns.

590
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:18,856
-I should tell him when I meet him.
-Tell him what?

591
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:22,151
That he should do the presentation
on his own, without your help.

592
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:36,332
Instead of cabbage, it'd be nice
to use radish.

593
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:40,294
Hey, did you get my text from yesterday?

594
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:43,089
-You didn't reply...
-Sure.

595
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,341
We can prepare it together
this weekend.

596
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:46,717
We have to do well.

597
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,260
Really?

598
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:51,806
Then I'll reserve a really nice restaurant
for dinner.

599
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,933
We can watch the fireworks
after we're done--

600
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,017
Let's order dinner.

601
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:56,477
Pardon?

602
00:39:56,977 --> 00:40:00,398
Instead of going out so far,
we can work at the office.

603
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,691
As for dinner, we can order jajangmyeon.

604
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:03,943
Well...

605
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,822
Let's also invite Chan-ho and Min-jung.

606
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,115
I'll contact them.

607
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,659
Am I...

608
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,453
being dumped right now?

609
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,122
What?

610
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,249
The presentation...

611
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,669
I'll work on it myself.

612
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:33,139
I broke up with my ex-boyfriend
because he cheated on me.

613
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,307
I see. 

614
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:41,730
I'm not sure why, but seeing you shut me
like that makes me trust you even more.

615
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,482
I'm sorry?

616
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:46,402
I think you'll do the same to other girls.

617
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,612
That's why I...

618
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:50,906
You...

619
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,117
I like you even more.

620
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,243
I want to date you.

621
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:56,495
Mr. Kim.

622
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,706
You don't have a girlfriend, do you?

623
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,293
I...

624
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:13,804
I heard the dish today is hangover soup.

625
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:17,141
I drank so much
until I threw up last night.

626
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,896
Just burping makes me feel drunk.

627
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:24,940
Hey, give me a bowl.

628
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,282
Have you tried your trick yet?

629
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:41,790
I thought the movie would be good,
but trailer was all there was.

630
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,509
Yes, you're right.

631
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,943
Why are you staring at me like that?

632
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,570
-What's wrong?
-I'm sorry?

633
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:16,075
You look like a giraffe.
Does your neck hurt?

634
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,621
-No, I...
-Is it here?

635
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:24,708
I can see your that
your cervical spine is protruded.

636
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,418
Here, what is this?

637
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:27,836
It's my trapezius muscle.

638
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,590
I see, trapezius muscle.

639
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:35,177
-You must work out a lot.
-Yes.

640
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,194
Who are you eating lunch with?
Eat with me.

641
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:55,364
-I'm full. I'm not going to eat.
-Why?

642
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:11,046
CUSTOMER SERVICE ON BREAK

643
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,707
Mr. Kim, what do I do with this?

644
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:49,627
-Can you give that to Chan-ho?
-Okay.

645
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:51,962
Thank you.

646
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:58,427
-Hot!
-It's hot!

647
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,929
-I'm sorry, Mr. Kim.
-Gosh.

648
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,056
Chan-ho, the ladle...

649
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,141
-It was hot, right?
-It's okay.

650
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:05,976
-Let me clean this.
-Ye-jin, hold on.

651
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,770
-You should see a doctor.
-Hang on.

652
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:10,648
You shouldn't rub there like that.

653
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:14,943
It looks like love is blooming.

654
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:21,617
Sul-hee, what brings you here?

655
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:27,122
I should know what it tastes like
to sell them.

656
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,584
She's a professional.

657
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:35,673
What are you doing, Chan-ho?
Give her a bowl.

658
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:36,924
Yes, sir. 

659
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:39,176
Chan-ho?

660
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:44,765
-Are you Kim Chan-ho?
-Yes, I'm Chan-ho.

661
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:59,196
Kim Chan-ho intern.

662
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:01,573
Yes?

663
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:08,038
What is it?

664
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,958
I was a fan of Park Chan-ho. 

665
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,960
Park Chan...

666
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,838
Are you talking about the baseball player?

667
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:20,300
I'm Kim Chan-ho.

668
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:23,178
Yes, I know. 

669
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:25,973
He's our hero during IMF.

670
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:30,519
Yes, sure.
He was a hero.

671
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:34,648
I used to eat Park Chan-ho's ice cream
a lot.

672
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:38,485
I see, I didn't eat his ice cream.

673
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,405
You didn't?

674
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:45,659
-Did you have something to tell me?
-Chan-ho!

675
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:48,328
-Chan-ho.
-Yes, Mr. Kim.

676
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:49,413
There you are.

677
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,623
I was looking for you.

678
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:55,335
Shouldn't we go prepare our presentation?

679
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:56,503
Yes, we should.

680
00:45:56,587 --> 00:46:00,466
Mr. Kim, we should meet up this weekend
to prepare for it, right?

681
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:02,801
Yes.

682
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,763
-We have to meet this weekend.
-Oh, right.

683
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:08,515
Ye-jin said she'll do it all.

684
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,434
Did you hear?

685
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,609
She must be interested in me.

686
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,696
Pardon? What did you say?

687
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,117
Well, she knew me and started talking
about Park Chan-ho.

688
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,828
She was kind of cute.

689
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:34,625
-You're very funny.
-Sorry?

690
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,710
About the presentation material...

691
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:39,797
Gather them and bring them to me.

692
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,716
-Right now?
-Right now.

693
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,052
But...

694
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,972
One, two, spot. 

695
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:52,768
Jab! One, two, spot. 

696
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:56,063
Get it together, punk!

697
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:58,982
Don't check the time while training!

698
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,403
If you're not going to do right,
just leave.

699
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,030
Wait down there.

700
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:06,448
I'm leaving.

701
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,743
Why? Why won't you let me?

702
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,371
I looked up who was competing. 

703
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:15,707
There's an old man who started boxing
to lose weight...

704
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,668
there's even high school students.

705
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,504
-Why won't you let me compete? Why?
-Hey.

706
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:26,969
It's because you're worse
than a high school kid in judging things.

707
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:28,679
What was that?

708
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,432
Was that a hook?

709
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,268
That was a hook, not a kick.

710
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:41,316
My goodness, what a great gym.

711
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,861
Hello, coach.
How have you been?

712
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,737
What are they doing here?

713
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,823
We came to discuss something.

714
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,033
Can we talk?

715
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:52,286
You're making me nervous.

716
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:57,207
I heard he came by.

717
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:01,420
Tae-hee lives right here, you see?

718
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:04,756
I know everything he does.

719
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,133
Hey.

720
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:08,886
Do you even know what he used to be?

721
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,763
-Do you?
-Tak-su. I'm busy.

722
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:14,224
-Why? Are you preparing to make a debut?
-Yes.

723
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:18,437
You're still so naive, aren't you?

724
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:21,398
And you're still just a big jerk.

725
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:23,650
Why is he here?

726
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:27,362
I wanted to discuss something good
for everyone.

727
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:29,323
Whatever, it'll only be good for him.

728
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:35,287
The truth is, it's not going to look good
if Tak-su and Dong-man get involved again.

729
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:38,498
If their past gets brought up again,
they'll both be hurt.

730
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:43,545
Tak-su's dad still feels responsible
toward Dong-man.

731
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:46,173
The old man is so warmhearted.

732
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:51,887
His dad wants to make Dong-man
the company warehouse manager.

733
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:54,598
He'll guarantee his retirement fund, too.

734
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:57,601
You benefit so much because of me.

735
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:01,855
Your sister was able to get a surgery,
thanks to me.

736
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,232
Why would you bring up his sister?

737
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:07,736
I think you should just leave.

738
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:11,615
Dong-man, you stupid and easy boy.

739
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:16,078
The lead and supporting roles
are already set.

740
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:18,830
The caterpillar who knows his place is...

741
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:22,751
grateful for the generosity.

742
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:25,128
And be able to eat the leave, you know?

743
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,546
-Hey.
-Yes?

744
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,423
Do you train him to run his mouth?

745
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:31,218
Look at that head.

746
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:32,594
Hey, you. Get over here.

747
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:35,138
-Coach, come down.
-Hey, you.

748
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,724
-Please stop.
-How dare you!

749
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:08,964
Since you paid for the movie,
I'll pay for dinner.

750
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:11,049
No way.

751
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:13,427
I told you, it's all on my today.

752
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,638
Plus, this place is really expensive.

753
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:21,351
Next time, you can buy me
chicken and beer.

754
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,939
I can pay for steak, too. 

755
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,278
That's not what I meant. 

756
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,782
-Ae-ra.
-Yes?

757
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:38,452
Why are you so uncomfortable
around me?

758
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,204
Who cares who pays here?

759
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,583
I'm pretty sure you're not like this
around Dong-man.

760
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:48,170
That's because Dong-man is Dong-man.

761
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:52,382
To be honest, I don't like that
you're close to him,

762
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,801
that he lives across from yours.

763
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,054
I feel like that neighborhood isn't safe. 

764
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:00,057
There are many good studio apartments
near my place.  

765
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,641
Can't you move there?

766
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:06,104
Sure, I can move there, but...

767
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,565
I'm attached to my house. 

768
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:17,532
How's working at the department store?
Isn't it hard?

769
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,411
It's not bad. 

770
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:27,876
They say you can know a woman
from her mom. 

771
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,712
Do you take after your mom, too?

772
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,509
I do not.

773
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,928
And I don't want to. 

774
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,889
Because I want to live long. 

775
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,934
Tell me more about your mom.

776
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:46,978
I feel like you'd be a lot like her. 

777
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:51,483
Well...

778
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:53,902
It's the same.

779
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:58,740
We fight all the time like other
moms and daughters do.

780
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:02,327
She nags like crazy, makes me food...

781
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:04,496
Same old. 

782
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:09,876
It's obvious that you were raised
with so much love. 

783
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,212
I like you because you're bright.

784
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:14,464
Really?

785
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:18,468
-I need to use the restroom.
-Sure.

786
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:40,157
Why did I lie?

787
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:46,079
I'm such a loser. 

788
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,293
I feel so uncomfortable,
it's giving me a stomachache.

789
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:55,797
Sul-hee.

790
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:01,052
Why did you have to check my phone?

791
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:02,762
Don't you trust me?

792
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:05,640
Is checking your phone the problem here?

793
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:09,352
No, I trust you, so I don't check yours. 

794
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:11,146
Then go ahead and check.

795
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,440
I have nothing to hide.
I don't lie to you. 

796
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,526
I lied because you'd be worried.

797
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:20,155
In case you'd let your imagination
run wild and stress you out. 

798
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:24,242
I told Ye-jin that I can't
and I won't go to Yeouido.

799
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:25,535
You must talk to her a lot. 

800
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:28,914
It was a white lie for your benefit. 

801
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:31,583
A white lie. 

802
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:33,668
How could a lie be white?

803
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:37,005
-Who are you to call it white?
-I told her I won't go this weekend, too.

804
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:39,216
-Just meet her.
-What?

805
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:42,886
That would be better.
Meet her and tell me the truth. 

806
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:46,389
I was worried you'd be bothered
I got a text from a girl at night.

807
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:48,892
More than the fact that
Ye-jin texted you at night,

808
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:51,686
that she asked to treat you rib eye,

809
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:53,104
that...

810
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:57,234
that you lied
about Ye-jin being Chan-ho...

811
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:59,277
To me, that really...

812
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:02,739
really...

813
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,075
was like a bullet through my heart.

814
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:10,747
Sul-hee.

815
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,584
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

816
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:20,507
Let go. You've never lied to me before.
It's true that you're being weird. 

817
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,926
I made a mistake. 

818
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,513
I'm a jerk. 

819
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,266
I must've lost my mind.

820
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:34,104
I was shot. 

821
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:36,940
You weren't shot. 

822
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,484
It's just...

823
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:42,696
a white lie. 

824
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:44,906
All lies are black. 

825
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,742
They're all dirty.
They're all rubbish. 

826
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,372
They're all fake.
Don't try to fool me.

827
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,958
-Don't try to fool me.
-Sul-hee.

828
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,795
I'm sorry, it's all my fault. 

829
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:03,675
But Sul-hee, you should stop playing
with Ae-ra.

830
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:11,891
Dong-man, today's amateur tournament is
at 8:30 p.m. at Road Gym in Cheongdam.

831
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:20,442
Dong-man, you stupid and easy boy.

832
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:25,447
The lead and supporting roles
are already set.

833
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:37,042
Tae-hee, can we really turn things around?

834
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:49,137
Finally, Ko Dong-man makes his debut
as an amateur.

835
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:52,974
Come to Road Gym in Cheongdam
by 8:30 p.m. 

836
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:58,730
Ae-ra, where we're headed now
is the highlight of tonight. 

837
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:01,107
The view of the city lights is incredible.

838
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:02,984
Is it?

839
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,490
Hurry up, my manager.

840
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:10,992
I'm kind of scared. 

841
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:18,249
I'm really sorry, Moo-bin. 

842
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,710
Can we go there another time?

843
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:23,505
-Why is something wrong?
-No.

844
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:26,216
My friend wants to meet urgently
in Cheongdam. 

845
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:29,928
I see. 

846
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:32,555
Would you just drop me off there?

847
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:36,518
Sure, we can do the rest another time. 

848
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:43,900
I'm not warmed up enough. 

849
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:46,319
You'll be fighting a Brazilian man. 

850
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:49,614
There's no information on him whatsoever.
He seems like a newbie.

851
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:52,575
You have to avoid injuries. 

852
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:54,285
Okay.

853
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:56,579
Are you nervous?

854
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:58,957
Should I ask your coach to come?

855
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:05,588
No, he'll probably stop me
if he finds out.

856
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:07,424
I'll call my manager.

857
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:10,468
You have a manager already?

858
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:15,473
You're supposed to eat hot dogs
while watching MMA.

859
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:18,017
I want two. Buy me two hot dogs.

860
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:20,728
I'll eat one now and another
while watching the fight. 

861
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:22,897
Didn't that punk buy you dinner?

862
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:24,816
-I'll take two.
-Okay.

863
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:28,570
I ate a steak the size of a chicken's head
for the price of ten whole chickens.

864
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,322
So hurry, I'm starving.
Let's get chicken feet and soju.

865
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,783
Hey, I have a question.

866
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,453
Is it your first time watching MMA live?

867
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:41,791
Are you worried about me or more nervous
than I am or something?

868
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:43,418
This is not the first time. 

869
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:47,338
Also, it's an amateur game.
One kick from you and it's over.

870
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:48,631
I knew it. 

871
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:52,927
Hey, you have a lot of faith in me,
don't you?

872
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:56,890
You refused steak and came
to watch me win. 

873
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:03,021
I came here today because this is
your debut and also a retirement fight. 

874
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:05,899
You have to try it once
before you give up.

875
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:09,611
Insolent little brats need to burn
their hand on the frying pan

876
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:11,946
so they learn never to do it again.

877
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:15,825
You're lucky you're born as a girl. 

878
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:17,577
Your hot dogs are ready.

879
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,662
Okay, thank you.

880
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:22,081
Here.

881
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:32,091
You'll get the best view from here.
Sit here and watch. 

882
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,349
Are you fighting that foreigner?

883
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:41,476
He looks small. 

884
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:45,355
Yes, he's shorter.
This is going to be an easy game. 

885
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:50,860
-Fighter, please enter.
-Okay.

886
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:58,034
I'll be back. 

887
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,579
Good luck!

888
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:11,673
Ready?

889
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:13,258
Ready?

890
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:16,469
-Okay.
-Let's go!

891
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:19,722
-Let's go!
-Move quickly.

892
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:24,310
-Attack waist.
-Attack.

893
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:27,063
-That's it.
-Yes.

894
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:28,147
Attack!

895
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,031
-Hang in there.
-Let's go!

896
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:43,329
-Good.
-That's right.

897
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:47,000
Yes, good!

898
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:06,477
Doctor!

899
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:08,605
Doctor!

900
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:22,952
I got the video.
I'll send it to you, so post it online.

901
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:24,287
Okay.

902
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:30,084
You're such a great actor. 

903
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:34,505
I chase Dong-man and you pull him in.

904
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:39,093
-Our teamwork was fabulous.
-Did you send an ambulance?

905
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:00,823
What are you doing?

906
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:05,787
What are you doing?

907
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:09,999
-Do you work here?
-No, I'm unemployed.

908
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:11,334
What?

909
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:14,671
Unemployed. We're unemployed. 

910
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:16,255
We're both unemployed. 

911
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:19,884
-Have a nice day.
-Have a nice day.

912
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,053
Where did we park our car?

913
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:25,181
Hold on.

914
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:28,976
-Run.
-Hey, stop!

915
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:34,649
If you go around stealing again,
you're out. 

916
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:37,610
Get in the car.

917
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,738
THIEF!

918
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:43,282
Who did this!

919
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:46,411
What is this?

920
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:49,455
-A thief?
-Who did this?

921
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:01,968
Don't look down on Sul-hee.

922
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:04,137
Why should she work for the party?

923
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,764
You tell me, did we make you work?

924
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:09,267
I won't forgive you
if you look down on her. 

925
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:11,602
Are you even going to marry her?

926
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:14,981
-Do you like coming here now?
-I'll get to the point.

927
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:18,735
Stop pretending to be his friend. 

928
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:21,362
A psycho is better
than a pathetic girl. 

929
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:24,157
Do you like me?
Let's not cross the line. 

930
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,118
I don't want to hear the psycho
call me pathetic. 

931
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:30,496
Let's be careful how we act
toward each other. 

932
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,126
