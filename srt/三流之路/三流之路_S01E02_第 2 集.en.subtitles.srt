1
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,188
Dong-man, Sul-hee!
Hurry up!

2
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,440
Okay!

3
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:30,864
You're drunk, aren't you going to work?

4
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,034
I need to go do the news. 

5
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,494
That's not how you wear a tie. 

6
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,873
This is more stylish. 

7
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:41,666
Honey, my wife. 

8
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:45,587
-Things are a mess up there.
-What?

9
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,590
North Korea's leader Kim Il Sung stated

10
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:51,718
that they will break
the Non-Proliferation Treaty,

11
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:54,262
causing tension
with the Clinton administration.

12
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:58,349
KBC News, I'm Baek Ji-yeon.

13
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,229
I told you not to say things
that I can't understand. 

14
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,148
We aren't playing news broadcasting.

15
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,610
Playing house is boring for me!

16
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:15,617
No, it's fun! Very fun. 

17
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,748
Honey, I'm going to the studio now. 

18
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,752
Our kids need to eat
and go to kindergarten. 

19
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:28,421
Taekwondo!

20
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,010
Ko Dong-man!

21
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,387
You made Sul-hee cry again!

22
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,431
Why do you keep breaking everything?

23
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:42,894
Mom, Ae-ra hit me again. 

24
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:46,356
Sorry! I'm sorry!

25
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,025
NAMIL VILLA IN SEOUL, 2017

26
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,027
Sorry.

27
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,821
I'm sorry. 

28
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,656
Please do this for me. 

29
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,284
For old times' sake. 

30
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,746
You annoying brat.

31
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,250
Thanks.

32
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,215
Seriously.

33
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,224
Thanks again, Dong-man.

34
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,393
Are you immigrating?

35
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,937
Jun-man forgot his luggage again.

36
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,523
-See you later.
-Come home rich, honey!

37
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,318
Honey, you should throw them away. 

38
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:33,361
Honey?

39
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,572
Don't call me honey, I'll kill you.

40
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:38,199
Fine, honey. Thank you. 

41
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,161
What a shameless girl.

42
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,375
ROUND 2
WHATEVER THEY SAY, WE'LL GO OUR WAY

43
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,343
Going somewhere?

44
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,929
To a classmate's wedding.
How do I look?

45
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,764
Do I look like a career woman?

46
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:05,101
Does it show that I'm living a good life?

47
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,312
You're like Australopithecus.

48
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:08,688
What?

49
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:11,608
Thanks to you, I witness evolution
on a daily basis. 

50
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,110
How could you change
so drastically in an hour?

51
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,029
Do I look that pretty?

52
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,033
Don't try to act pretty.
I haven't eaten yet. 

53
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,826
I'm annoying if I act pretty, right?

54
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,787
It's such a dilemma for me, too.

55
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:28,625
I'm not acting pretty.
I was born pretty. 

56
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,424
I can hit a girl. 

57
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:40,887
But people say I'm acting pretty. 

58
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,890
So, it's so hard for Ae-ra. 

59
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,685
She's giving me stress. 

60
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:49,812
Wait for me. 

61
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,069
Hey.

62
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,947
You must like this bag.
You're carrying it around. 

63
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,949
Yes, it's so convenient. 

64
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,827
Do you want me to get you one more
if a new one comes out?

65
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:10,041
Will you buy Ae-ra another bag?

66
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:16,589
Stop it. 

67
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,050
I told you to stop it!

68
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,469
How could you choke a girl?

69
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,056
How did you find Grandpa's tteokbokki?

70
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:28,268
It sold out for five shows
since it was launched.

71
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:33,690
People think I'm chubby because
I eat anything. 

72
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,108
But actually, I'm an epicure. 

73
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:38,528
When I first tasted it
in Gyeongdong market,

74
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,947
I thougtht it was delicious,
I felt a sense of duty.

75
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,574
I thought people needed to taste this. 

76
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,494
You're awesome. 

77
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,539
We sold 200 million won
worth of rice cakes,

78
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,542
which cost 2,340 won for 100 packs.

79
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,503
-200 million won?
-Yes.

80
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,214
That was a big hit. 

81
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,552
-Then what about my commission?
-Of course, you'll get it.

82
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:07,724
After taxes, your commission will be
around 195,000 won. 

83
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,018
You are such a valuable employee. 

84
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,145
Thank you.

85
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,195
AWAITING APPROVAL

86
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,572
MOVIE TICKET

87
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:37,295
Waiting by elevator car number eight
on the first floor. 

88
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,829
I packed your shaver
inside the front pocket.

89
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,624
Just in case, I also packed
a first-aid kit.

90
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,000
Did you?

91
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,253
How could you not pack
for your business trip?

92
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,881
You're more absentminded than I am. 

93
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,591
You're pretty bold. 

94
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,677
-When did you come to my desk?
-What?

95
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,137
I heard Yong Ja is really good.

96
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,223
Young Ja? Is that out already?

97
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,517
-What?
-When?

98
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,562
-Come on!
-I mean it.

99
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,989
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes?

100
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,410
I heard Yong Ja is really fun.

101
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:52,870
Sorry?

102
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,540
I heard the movie is really good. 

103
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,500
They say it's difficult to get tickets.

104
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,551
-See you.
-Bye.

105
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,432
Excuse me, you forgot your luggage. 

106
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,684
That's not mine.

107
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:26,487
You must like pink.

108
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,202
Is he the one Ye-jin's in love with?

109
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,246
Yes, that's him.

110
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,832
But what's Yong Ja?
Did she give him movie tickets?

111
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:38,749
I guess so.

112
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,720
This is made in Germany.

113
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,139
The parts are extremely expensive. 

114
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,435
Don't you train them properly?

115
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:02,148
Don't you know the motor breaks
if you don't clean the filters?

116
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:05,943
I told you many times already
to clean it. 

117
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,403
Is it you again?

118
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,739
Why do you always cause trouble?

119
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,366
It wasn't me. This isn't mine.

120
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,411
Wow. Did you drink again last night?

121
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,956
-I had a beer, but--
-Look, it's yours.

122
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,125
You're borderline alcoholic.

123
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,419
Forget it, get to work now.

124
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,713
Have a nice day.
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:31,802
Sir.

126
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,097
This is your machine.

127
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,726
Did you not serve in the army?

128
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,355
You act like you never served in the army.

129
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,398
You're so frustrating.

130
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:45,942
You don't want to work?

131
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,985
Then quit, I won't stop you. 

132
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,073
Clean up.

133
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,996
Get lost. 

134
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,333
You went already! It's my turn now. 

135
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,002
It's our last chance, so I should do it. 

136
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,344
Step aside. I'll earn you another round.

137
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,304
Why should we let you?

138
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,390
Seriously, these kids. 

139
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:18,766
Okay, fine.

140
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,893
Here, happy now?

141
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,063
I'll do it, okay?
You'll get a bonus round anyway.

142
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,566
Wow, he's so full of himself.

143
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,163
There you go. 

144
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:44,125
Can't you read?
It says no kicking!

145
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,378
-He's awesome.
-I'm sorry.

146
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,800
He's incredible.

147
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,970
I told you. I'll win you another game.

148
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,138
Have fun.

149
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,433
-Unbelievable.
-Is he a cyborg?

150
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,562
-He's incredible.
-It's been a while since I warmed up.

151
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,772
KYUNG-KOO

152
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,567
Hello, Kyung-koo?

153
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,945
Right now? I'm free. 

154
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,032
Why? Do you have a blind date
set up for me?

155
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:21,579
My legs. 

156
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,790
Why is the wedding held
so far from town?

157
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,225
Here comes the bride. 

158
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,028
She looks so happy. 

159
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:57,114
All that dating since high school
pays now. 

160
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,077
-Thanks.
-She's finally marrying a doctor.

161
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,748
-What's his specialty?
-Plastic surgery.

162
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,883
I heard Ae-ra's coming. 

163
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,385
-Where?
-Would she want to come?

164
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,303
Long time no see. 

165
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:23,599
-Ae-ra.
-Gosh, is that you, Ae-ra?

166
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:27,353
It's been so long.
I didn't think you'd show up. 

167
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,022
I wanted to come earlier, but I was busy.

168
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,776
We'd have understood
if you couldn't make it.

169
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,569
-Yes.
-I had to come.

170
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,947
I missed you guys so much. 

171
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,659
-I'm glad you're here.
-It's good to see you.

172
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,664
-Dong-man!
-Kyung-koo.

173
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,791
-The weather's great today.
-Isn't it?

174
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,000
-We have to go.
-Now?

175
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,544
-We're late.
-Like right now?

176
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,754
-Let's hurry.
-Just like that?

177
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:58,134
I came because you asked,
but can I appear on the show?

178
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,137
You're replacing a random guy
that didn't show up. 

179
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,723
We won't ask you anything.
You just have to stand there. 

180
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,725
-Okay?
-Sure.

181
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:09,770
No place has a mountain, clear water
and blank. What's the missing word?

182
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:15,401
One, water veins. two, pavilions
and three, house price.

183
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,904
We'll ask player number 12
to tell us the answer. 

184
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,574
Which do you think is the answer?

185
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:26,287
Number one sounds a bit superstitious.

186
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,371
Number two is...

187
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:33,043
I don't think this word is suitable
for broadcast.

188
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,130
What is he talking about?

189
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,590
Why isn't that word suitable?

190
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:41,594
I think the answer is number three. 

191
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:47,975
I thought this question was selected
to reflect the current housing situation.

192
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,394
I think he's very smart. 

193
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,397
The housing price within Seoul is crazy. 

194
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,317
I chose number three. 

195
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,486
The correct answer is...

196
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,156
number two, pavilion. 

197
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,951
I'm sorry, but you're out. 

198
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,661
Who brought him?

199
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,290
He's not a bad guy. 

200
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,250
Sorry.

201
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,336
Number two, two percent. 

202
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,880
Number three, seven percent. 

203
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,926
This question will decide if
we have a winner. 

204
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,928
Select your answer. 

205
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,013
The answer is...

206
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:29,934
Number one, one percent. 

207
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,561
We have the final winner. 

208
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,064
-Congratulations!
-One percent!

209
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:47,451
Park Hye-ran joined KBC
as an announcer in 2013. 

210
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:51,664
She is known for her good looks
and she hosted various shows,

211
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:54,208
gaining the trust and love
from the public. 

212
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,045
You forgot to take your drink. 

213
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,506
It's fine. I don't drink coffee milk. 

214
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,467
Would you mind if I take yours as well?

215
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,637
-Sure.
-Thank you.

216
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:09,974
Excuse me.

217
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,021
It's you, the smart kid. 

218
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,691
I recognized you right away. 

219
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,526
Who are you?

220
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,404
I'm Dong-man from high school.

221
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,321
Who?

222
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,157
-What?
-It's Moo-bin. 

223
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,994
-Hello, I'm producer Jang Kyung-koo.
-Hello.

224
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,079
-Would you like to join us?
-Sure.

225
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,790
It's been so long. How have you been?

226
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,668
-You're a legend.
-Thank you.

227
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,881
Okay, so you see...

228
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,718
we're doing a year-end special
with all the winners. 

229
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,928
We'd love you to be on it. 

230
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,098
You don't remember me?

231
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,601
I'm Dong-man, your classmate. 

232
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,227
I'm not too sure. 

233
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,480
Think harder. I'm that Ko Dong-man.

234
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:01,483
You sponsored me your t-shirt one day. 

235
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,320
You also came to cheer me. 

236
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,740
I won and celebrated my win
in front of the crowd. 

237
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,243
-Don't you remember?
-Not really. 

238
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,872
-You're making him feel uncomfortable.
-But...

239
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,206
I need to make a call.

240
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,626
Sure, take your time. 

241
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,045
What is wrong with you?

242
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,589
He's not happy. 

243
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,136
Dong-man, I'm sorry. 

244
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,473
We usually give guests gift certificates.

245
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,975
But this one's registered
in the other guy's name.

246
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,602
I'm afraid you can't have it. 

247
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,647
By the way, do you know that doctor?

248
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,358
-Doctor?
-Today's winner.

249
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:49,448
Could you ask him to appear
on the year-end winners' special? 

250
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,992
-Never mind.
-What?

251
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,496
I don't think you two are that close. 

252
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,081
Forget it.

253
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:00,626
We weren't that close. 

254
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,294
Also, here you go. 

255
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,964
-You should take this.
-It's fine. 

256
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,131
I called you over.

257
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,927
Okay, thanks. Bye. 

258
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,355
I'm a fan. 

259
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,026
I think she's working again. 

260
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,695
She's so pretty.

261
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,539
In a moment,

262
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,501
we'll begin the second part
of the wedding.

263
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,796
Please stop walking around...

264
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,258
and take your seats. 

265
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,595
Come over here. 

266
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,098
When can your aunt sing pansori?

267
00:16:56,223 --> 00:17:00,310
-She's about to fall asleep.
-Mother-in-law, does she have to sing?

268
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,688
-Could you please wait a bit?
-Hey.

269
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,566
Why are you hosting your own wedding?

270
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:06,692
Where's the host?

271
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,987
-She needs to sing soon.
-Come here. 

272
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,158
What are you doing right now?

273
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,119
Where's your announcer friend
who said she'd host?

274
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:20,581
You're the bride. You should be hosting. 

275
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:21,915
I don't know. 

276
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,376
She works in Hong Kong
and her flight got delayed.

277
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,962
She's not answering her phone.
I don't think she'll make it. 

278
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,172
What?

279
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:32,342
You told your in-laws
you had an announcer friend. 

280
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,553
This is so embarrassing.

281
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,431
Why did you call a friend from Hong Kong?

282
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,475
She speaks fluent Korean. 

283
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,602
She's a foreign friend
that'll make me look good. 

284
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,937
That makes sense, but...

285
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,065
do you have a replacement?

286
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,566
Like who?

287
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,611
Ae-ra, how have you been?

288
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,239
-Do you have a boyfriend?
-Do you?

289
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,076
I'm just...

290
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,744
really busy with work. 

291
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:01,538
Next time, we'll come over
to where you are. 

292
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,500
Let's have our next gathering there.

293
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,960
-We will treat you.
-Sure.

294
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,129
Come over, I'll treat you. 

295
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,964
Really?

296
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,760
Oh okay, sure. 

297
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:18,180
-You can buy.
-Try not to miss our gatherings. 

298
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,641
We should see each other more often. 

299
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,268
Yes, what are friends for?

300
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,145
We'll let you pay half
the membership fee. 

301
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,231
-Sure.
-Why?

302
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:29,316
Why do I only pay half?

303
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,236
-Sorry?
-Watch your words!

304
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,827
What are you doing?

305
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,746
Are you being considerate
or trying to insult?

306
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,583
If I don't have a boyfriend
and didn't study abroad...

307
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,670
don't have a fancy job,
am I so unfortunate I need charity?

308
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,882
I'm doing fine.
I enjoy my life just fine.

309
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:58,011
Why do you look down on me
when I'm fine with my life?

310
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,263
This is ridiculous.

311
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,349
-That's not it...
-We only meant...

312
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,600
Then...

313
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:11,275
This is when I should
go to the restroom, right?

314
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:16,738
Wait.

315
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:22,703
-You won't go home straight, right?
-Hey.

316
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,497
I'll tell you when I leave. 

317
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,296
My goodness. 

318
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:43,056
Choi Ae-ra, how lame.

319
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,641
You're twisted. 

320
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,853
I should have just let it go. 

321
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,108
Whatever, stop embarrassing yourself
and just leave. 

322
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,068
They won't notice if I'm gone. 

323
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,153
Ae-ra!

324
00:19:58,655 --> 00:19:59,865
Please save me. 

325
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,496
I'm Choi Ae-ra, not Cindy Jung.

326
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,707
No, I won't do it.
Ask somebody else. 

327
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,418
You like speaking in the microphone.

328
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:14,379
If not the second Baek Ji-yeon,
who would be the host?

329
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,342
I don't even know who Cindy Jung is.

330
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,302
All our friends know I'm not her. 

331
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,888
I'll make sure they don't say a word. 

332
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:26,642
Also, nobody knows who Cindy Jung is.

333
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,393
What?

334
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,395
Have you watched Hong Kong news
in your life?

335
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,982
Cindy is an anchor in Hong Kong
and she was raised abroad. 

336
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,276
Nobody will recognize her. 

337
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:40,239
If you agree, you'll be Cindy Jung
for tonight.

338
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,991
Forget it, I don't want to! I won't!

339
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:44,660
Hey.

340
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,621
You owe me something.
You stole my boyfriend from me. 

341
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,417
Hey, do you really want to say
such a thing on your wedding day? 

342
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:57,464
If you don't help me out,
my wedding will be ruined. 

343
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,675
Please save me. 

344
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:05,514
Why do you have to make me
feel uncomfortable?

345
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,182
If you agree to help me out...

346
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,315
you get to wear this. 

347
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,818
It was for Cindy Jung. 

348
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:19,528
You'll wear it.

349
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,298
I'm pretty sure the innocent Cinderella
fell in love...

350
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:43,802
with the beautiful dress...

351
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,013
instead of the prince charming. 

352
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,279
-I'm late.
-It's okay. 

353
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,700
I'm wearing that dress...

354
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:10,287
and at the end of this aisle,
there is a microphone. 

355
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,291
Everybody is looking at me. 

356
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,752
I'm supposed to say I'm nervous. 

357
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,796
But I feel so happy!

358
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,219
As soon as I wrapped my hand
around the microphone,

359
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:29,389
the world became mine. 

360
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:39,566
Here's an announcement for all the guests.

361
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,235
We'll be starting the second part

362
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:46,615
of Young-gyu and Chan-sook's wedding
very shortly.

363
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,785
Please don't remain seated

364
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,789
and show us that you can party. 

365
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,791
Let the party begin.

366
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,710
Who is she?

367
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:05,509
Before we get to the performance
by the groom's aunt...

368
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:11,848
let's find out if you really
can't get married if you can't sing. 

369
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,601
We'll find that out right now. 

370
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,063
You can do everything you want. 

371
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:22,609
But I just need one thing. 

372
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,196
Let me sing. 

373
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,073
Make it as smooth as you can. 

374
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,535
Where's our beautiful bride? 

375
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,328
-Chan-sook.
-Oh, dear.

376
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,832
Why is she doing that?

377
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,417
-Go.
-Please come up. 

378
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,755
She's an anchor from Hong Kong. 

379
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,132
She was raised abroad. 

380
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,759
Her name is Cindy Jung. 

381
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,095
She's a global talent. 

382
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:16,121
She's singing a song
as if she had stories to tell.

383
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,165
It's so emotional. 

384
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,002
She never studied, right?

385
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:26,339
I noticed at first sight. 

386
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,925
Why didn't he hook up
with a girl from his class?

387
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,148
Young-gyu's bride is so talented. 

388
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,400
-She's good at singing.
-Yes.

389
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,366
Why is she singing a song
about giving up on her wedding day?

390
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,207
Cut it out. 

391
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,635
Please give the bride
a round of applause. 

392
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,519
I can't believe Chan-sook
is getting married.

393
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,896
It's a miracle.

394
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:28,026
I never imagined Chan-sook
would get married before me. 

395
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,864
When we were in Pungmul band together,
she was extraordinary. 

396
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,868
She must be crazy. 

397
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,954
Is she going to talk about that guy
from the band?

398
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:42,040
Our Chan-sook...

399
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,098
only knew how to strike a gong. 

400
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:02,394
She never knew how to hang out
with guys. 

401
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:05,605
I can't believe that innocent girl
met a guy. 

402
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:10,569
She met a reliable lifetime partner

403
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:13,280
and she's getting married today. 

404
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:17,492
I'm so touched
that I'm going to shed tears.

405
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,956
A precious daughter from a family...

406
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:27,294
now becomes a precious daughter-in-law.

407
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:33,341
Our bride is still young and softhearted.

408
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:37,637
But I hope that road to her new life
is filled with care and guidance.

409
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,807
We'd now like to invite a person
of great influence...

410
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:44,311
the groom's aunt,
to give us a performance.

411
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,938
-Me?
-Yes.

412
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:55,447
Hey, I think I'm going to change
my host to Ae-ra, too.

413
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,074
She's the Ae-ra we know
as soon as she grabs the microphone. 

414
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,160
Baek Ji-yeon is back. 

415
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,051
I never stole your boyfriend.

416
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,927
But, I paid back what I owed anyway. 

417
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,304
Be happy. 

418
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:22,349
Thank you so much. 

419
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,267
-Hey.
-My goodness. 

420
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:28,188
You still make me feel uncomfortable. 

421
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,359
She's so smart. 

422
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:37,614
-Don't you see a halo around her?
-She's so charming. 

423
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,284
I need to meet a luxurious person
like her.

424
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,845
Why did you buy this?

425
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:04,015
You should buy something for yourself.
This is unnecessary. 

426
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,270
I wanted to eat out. 

427
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,523
Why would you prepare your own
birthday dinner?

428
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,235
Stop saying that your back hurts. 

429
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:19,155
This is really effective. 

430
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:22,075
As soon as I put it on,
it feels like my back pain is gone. 

431
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:26,329
But isn't this really expensive?
How much did you spend?

432
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,581
You're so talkative. 

433
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,333
We're eating. 

434
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,629
Stop yelling at Mom. 

435
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,297
She's 60 soon. 

436
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,217
Where did you get the money
to buy that? 

437
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,263
I earned it. I didn't steal it. 

438
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:45,140
Do you even work?

439
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:48,184
You have a part-time job, right?

440
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,520
You're starting over. 

441
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,314
He won't come home because of you. 

442
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,233
I don't mess around. 

443
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,152
I work. 

444
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,864
Don't waste your time.
Become a taekwondo instructor.

445
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:04,784
You need to work in your field. 

446
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,578
Why would you do anything else?

447
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:10,039
Just look for an instructor job. 

448
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,291
Dad.

449
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,003
If you look up my name on the web...

450
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:18,715
the news articles from November 3, 2007
still pop up. 

451
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,760
Who would take lessons from me?

452
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:25,555
Stop being so sissy.
Does that still bother you?

453
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,768
You're so pathetic.
How will you live a proper life?

454
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,644
You're right. I can't live a proper life. 

455
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:36,149
I just take each day as it comes.

456
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:39,903
All I'm capable of doing is taekwondo.

457
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:42,030
It's not easy to earn money
by doing something else. 

458
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,490
Of course, it's pathetic!

459
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,659
You want me to become an instructor?

460
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:52,290
I won't go near it.
So, don't ever say that to me again. 

461
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,375
Just let it go. 

462
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:57,670
-Why are you still so angry about--
-It's not because I'm angry!

463
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,718
I'm scared that I might want
to do it again.

464
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:07,305
I'm scared I might really want
to go back to it.

465
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,892
That's why I don't even want
to think about it. 

466
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,272
If I were able to use your connections
back then...

467
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,817
I wouldn't have gotten eliminated. 

468
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,570
If your business didn't fail,

469
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,323
I wouldn't have entered
that competition at all. 

470
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:27,992
Dong-man.

471
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:31,538
-Dong-hee will hear you.
-You're the one...

472
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,378
who should've protected Dong-hee, not me.

473
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,714
Why did it have to be me?

474
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,635
Why me?

475
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,429
Why is it always me?

476
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:29,721
-Here.
-Hey.

477
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:32,015
Why did you bring so many bottles?

478
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:35,560
You completely saved me today. 

479
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,273
-You brought so many bottles.
-You can drink it all here. 

480
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,901
This is cheese from France. 

481
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,362
They should be serving shark fin soup.

482
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,363
Hey.

483
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,532
Try to pronounce it more softly. 

484
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:50,450
Cheers.

485
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,577
Bottoms up. 

486
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:54,454
My goodness.

487
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:59,292
-So many people are watching you.
-Okay, fine.

488
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,127
Let's drink this. 

489
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,296
I'm so happy today. 

490
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,089
Pour me a glass. 

491
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:08,509
Honey, we should greet our guests.
You shouldn't be drinking right now. 

492
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,639
-Honey, do I reek of alcohol?
-Yes.

493
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,477
Gosh, you're such a jolly person. 

494
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,688
Please take care of my friend, Cindy. 

495
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,071
Hello, Cindy. 

496
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:29,656
Let's drink together. 

497
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,199
Okay.

498
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,392
-My gosh.
-That's incredible. 

499
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:01,020
I never saw a woman
pull this kind of trick before. 

500
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,898
How should I put this?
Seeing a woman do this...

501
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,150
How should I put this in words?

502
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,529
-Do you mean--
-Unique.

503
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,030
I'm an unique woman.

504
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:15,034
Unique! You just spoke English. 

505
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,704
Drink as punishment!

506
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,914
-Drink!
-Why am I the only one who's drinking?

507
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,376
You should go slow.
You've had a lot to drink.

508
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,546
Cindy, I'll drink that for you.
Give me your glass. 

509
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,549
Why should I give you my drink?
Alcohol is precious.

510
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:32,552
Cindy, I'll drink it for you.

511
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:35,346
Instead, my wish is to drive you home.

512
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,474
Cindy, I'll drink it for you
and take you home. 

513
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,644
No, I said it first.
I'll drive you home. 

514
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:45,064
-What are you saying?
-My goodness, what's with you guys?

515
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,692
-I have high tolerance, don't worry.
-Cindy, tell us. 

516
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,695
Which one of us will you choose?

517
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,740
-It's me right?
-It's me. 

518
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,074
I'm just asking for fun.

519
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:58,327
Then...

520
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:03,750
I'll ask this guys to drink for me.
He's been the quietest.

521
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:05,752
Me?

522
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,545
You can't give it to him.

523
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,547
He can't drink. 

524
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:12,050
-Hey!
-No!

525
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,760
It's too late. He did it.

526
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,055
Damn, we're in trouble. 

527
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,807
Please give us a glass of ice water.

MOM

531
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,994
Give your dad a call. 

532
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,038
If you leave like that,

533
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,415
he won't be able to sleep.

534
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,584
Also Dong-hee...

535
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,003
will feel upset. 

536
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,676
Wow, he has a great kick. 

537
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,638
He doesn't. He has a weak hook. 

538
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,473
His kick is just better than his hook. 

539
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:03,726
Gosh, you're so stingy with compliments.

540
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,394
He's not satisfied with anyone.

541
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:10,191
What are you talking about?
He's very generous with his first love.

542
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,028
Coach.

543
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:15,488
Is he that good?

544
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,323
Is he better than me?

545
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,952
You think too highly of yourself. 

546
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:24,914
On the other hand, he underestimates
himself way too much. 

547
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,960
By the way, you jerk,

548
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:33,422
I heard that you still go around
fighting people like a dog these day.

549
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,174
I guess it's because I am a dog.

550
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:38,511
This is my last warning.
Don't fight, okay?

551
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,193
Mom packed a lot of food for me,

552
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,237
so I came to drink with my coach. 

553
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,866
It's been ages since your coach
opened up a restaurant.

554
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,535
It took you so long to drop by
and say hello. 

555
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,330
-I heard you had a legendary kick.
-Stop talking nonsense.

556
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,209
Let's have a match. 

557
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,795
I'd love to learn some moves from you.

558
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,214
That's funny. 

559
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:19,510
I'm curious to see how talented you are
because our coach wants you so bad.

560
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,554
I want to see it with my own eyes.

561
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:24,182
-I'm really jealous.
-Are you drunk?

562
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:27,560
Oh, right...
he doesn't fight for nothing, does he?

563
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:33,941
Then, let's bet 100,000 won.
Let's just have one light match. 

564
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,736
Go and sleep if you're drunk. 

565
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,988
Okay, fine. Forget it. 

566
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,366
You probably aren't proud to say
you did taekwondo.

567
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,705
I guess you're just a normal person. 

568
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,749
It's not fair to fight a pro like me. 

569
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,419
Let's do it. 

570
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,174
Let's fight.

571
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,262
Dong-man.

572
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,806
You haven't worn this in ten years, right?

573
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,183
I wonder if it'll still fit you.

574
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,435
I don't want to wear it. 

575
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:11,812
You're going to fight with no protection?

576
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,148
I guess you think you can easily beat me.

577
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,901
You're right.
It's not like you're an amateur.

578
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,277
You won't need this. 

579
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:22,031
Just think of this as a warm up, okay?

580
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:29,080
This is the first and final round. 

581
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,292
Let's see how good you are.
Come on!

582
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:53,813
Coach.

583
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,691
You told me he's good.
I'm not even doing my best right now.

584
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,028
Ready.

585
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,557
Stop it!

586
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:31,434
Get out!

587
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,854
I'm going to go and sell sausages.

588
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:43,195
That guy's useless.

00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:15,186
Coach, you're on your way
to my neighborhood, right?

591
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:16,520
Can you give me a ride?

592
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,148
I'm not going near your neighborhood
anymore.

593
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,529
YOu see? I'm hopeless.

594
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:29,325
I could never fight again.
I'm a moron now. 

595
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,409
Hey.

596
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,414
Wipe your mouth and stop upsetting me.

597
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,216
It was nice, though. 

598
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:49,053
It was nice being beaten up. 

599
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,642
I feel so good getting beaten up!

600
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:56,602
Seriously.

601
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,272
I told you to leave!

602
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,316
Go!

603
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:08,531
If you can't drink, you should've refused.

604
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,283
What are you, a kid?

605
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,701
This is so uncomfortable.

606
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,718
-Because of the wish.
-Sorry?

607
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,514
I really can't drink.

608
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,809
But I risked my life to drink for you.

609
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:38,853
Gosh.

610
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,148
Was that the first time
you drank for a girl?

611
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,276
I'll use my wish now. 

612
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,570
Go ahead, what is your wish?

613
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:51,157
You see...

614
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,618
You're going home later, right?

615
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,121
Of course, I'm going home.
Where else would I go?

616
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,708
Wake up and stop talking nonsense.

617
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,085
Take a bus home alone later. 

618
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:05,921
Sorry?

619
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:10,634
Take a bus by yourself. That's my wish.

620
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,095
But...

621
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:16,265
your friends insisted on taking me home,

622
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:17,975
so why would I take a bus home?

623
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:20,603
No, just take a bus by yourself. 

624
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:23,856
It's all about one million won.

625
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,738
Gosh.

626
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,199
Look at this.

627
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,783
What is it?

628
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,869
This is Cindy Jung?

629
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:40,873
-Then who is she?
-She's a fake one. 

630
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:44,877
She must've wanted to become
Cinderella today. 

631
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:48,339
That's not going to happen
in modern times.

632
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:49,798
I'm sure she had a reason.

633
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,175
Okay.

634
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:54,220
Then, we should all bet on her.

635
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,097
She needs to be punished for this.

636
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:01,143
-I'm in.
-Come on, you don't even know anything.

637
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:06,190
Okay, depending on whose car
that fake Cindy gets into...

638
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:08,067
that guy wins one million won.

639
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,652
Let's play fair.

640
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:12,029
One, two, three. Let's go!

641
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,990
Getting her into your car
gets you one million won. 

642
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:17,326
If you take her to a hotel,
you get two million won.

643
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,995
She's not classy enough to go to a hotel.

644
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,540
-Let's say motel.
-Proof shot is a must.

645
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,833
She is going to be Cinderella for tonight.

646
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,759
Please go first, I'll be right out.

647
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:35,261
Okay.

648
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,596
I'll wait outside. 

649
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:16,302
KO DONG-MAN

650
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:26,478
Hey.

651
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:28,939
Could you pick me up?

652
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,485
Just come.

653
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,865
I feel so humiliated...

654
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,495
I can't leave by myself, so come.

655
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,581
Hey, I'm not your driver.

656
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,666
I don't even have a car!

657
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,213
What's wrong? Is something wrong?

658
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,758
It's that microphone moron.

659
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,343
Speak clearly!

660
00:43:58,552 --> 00:43:59,762
Where are you?

661
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:01,555
Okay, bye.

662
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:06,477
I'm leaving.

663
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:11,231
Of course...

664
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:14,443
only that microphone moron
can awaken the sleeping Hulk.

665
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:19,907
Cindy, I apologize on behalf
of my weak friend.

666
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,369
Cindy, did you wash your face?

667
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,206
Yes, I wanted to wake myself up.

668
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:29,416
It's okay if you get a little drunk.

669
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,294
I'll take you home safely anyway.

670
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,962
I'll go home by myself. 

671
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,297
Cindy.

672
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,341
I'll drive you home.

673
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:39,885
I won't go with you.

674
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,680
I just got a new car.

675
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:44,765
It's super amazing.

676
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:46,934
Do you know what it is?

677
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,104
-What is your car?
-It's right there.

678
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,356
-Isn't it awesome?
-Cindy, get in my car.

679
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:55,651
-A classic luxury car is the best.
-Cindy,

680
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,653
-my car is--
-What do you drive?

681
00:44:57,736 --> 00:45:00,572
-Mine is... Pardon?
-So, there are...

682
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:01,824
one, two...

683
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:03,826
three cars.

684
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,133
Oh, no!

685
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:23,887
Stop it! No!

686
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:30,352
No, stop it!

687
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,738
Listen carefully, I won't repeat myself.

688
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:45,868
I'm not Cindy Jung, I'm Choi Ae-ra
of the Lucky Department Store.

689
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:49,663
Bring me your invoices to fix
your side mirrors.

690
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,749
I'll give you your beloved
one million won.

691
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:54,626
I'll pay you back.

692
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:57,755
Make sure to bring me invoices
and come to get revenge.

693
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,550
You are... a wack!

694
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,971
A "wack"?

695
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:11,310
You can't even talk properly.

696
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:17,107
If we meet again, I'll be a real "wack". 

697
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:20,611
Let's bet our lives for one million won.

698
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,697
Let's meet again. 

699
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:30,537
You crazy wack.
Where do you think you're going?

700
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,875
-Hey, let go of her.
-You let go.

701
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,335
Are you insane?

702
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:40,339
How dare you cheap swindler make a fuss?
I guess you have some pride.

703
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:44,092
If I'm a swindler, you're vulgar.

704
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:45,928
Two million won if you take me to a hotel?

705
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:50,015
Only because it's a bet among us.
You're not even worth 200,000 won.

706
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:54,353
I wouldn't sleep with you
for 20 billion won.

707
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:58,065
You can't get a girl to sleep with you
if you have no money.

708
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:00,317
-They're fighting.
-You loser.

709
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,194
What did you say?

710
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:04,071
-Hey.
-Get up!

711
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,739
Hey.

712
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:09,868
You need to learn a lesson.

713
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,996
You can pay for my side mirrors with this.

714
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:14,581
Hey!

715
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:38,856
Get in your car and lock the door.

716
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,941
Hey, call the cops.

717
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,609
Get in the cars now. 

718
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:04,882
Hey, what are you?

719
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,885
He just hit my hand.

720
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:15,267
He slapped me.
He just slapped me.

721
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,563
-That hurts!
-It does, right?

722
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,900
Then, why did you hit her?
Why did you slap a girl's face?

723
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:24,359
You jerk!

724
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,112
Why did you hit her?

725
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,156
You went for my head.

726
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,950
-I can't breathe...
-Why did you hit her?

727
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:35,579
That hurts.

728
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:38,957
That's enough, let's go.

729
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,377
Did you call the cops?

730
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:44,379
-I did.
-Yes.

731
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:47,674
You pathetic losers!

732
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:52,930
If you want to live, shut your mouth.

733
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:56,224
She needs to get beaten up
to learn a lesson!

734
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,518
I said to shut your mouth!

735
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,562
-That crazy jerk.
-Oh, my goodness.

736
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:07,861
He suddenly ran towards me and kicked me.

737
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:10,155
I can't move my wrist.

738
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:13,116
I didn't hit him back because I didn't
want to be a moron like him.

739
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:17,412
Why is he the only one locked up
when they hit each other?

740
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,915
Look, how was this mutual?

741
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:23,043
Look at the situation first. 

742
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,128
They deserved to be beaten up. 

743
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:28,924
Also, if Ko Dong-man hits a person,
that becomes an attempted murder.

744
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:32,594
Why would a former Korean taekwondo
national team hit civilians?

745
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,763
See? I knew it. 

746
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:37,265
I'm not used to street fights.

747
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:38,976
I'm not going to settle.

748
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:42,020
Officer, you should arrest her, too.
She's a gold digger. 

749
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,647
No, she's not.

750
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:45,774
She just broke our side mirrors.

751
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:48,652
-Be quiet.
-Here, coach.

752
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:51,154
Is he here to settle things?

753
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:55,867
I'm sorry to call you, but I didn't know
who else to call. 

754
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,704
I'm not settling. 

755
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,625
-Are your ribs broken?
-What?

756
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,378
I think so. 

757
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:08,171
How did you get hit?
Was it a punch or kick?

758
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,799
-What?
-What about your teeth?

759
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,260
Are they okay? Open your mouth. 

760
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:16,179
I have a few loose teeth.

761
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,181
I'm not going to settle. 

762
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:20,809
Did it just take one punch
to break two teeth?

763
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:22,936
-Yes.
-Are you sure?

764
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:25,397
What are you doing?

765
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:27,190
Where did you come from?

766
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,487
In his heyday,

767
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,490
he knocked out two teeth with one punch.

768
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:37,993
He also broke three ribs with one kick.

769
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:42,247
I guess... he can still do it. 

770
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:43,415
Does he have a criminal history?

771
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,710
-It's not on the record.
-He's still very powerful.

772
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:49,171
Are you here to check his strength?

773
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,174
They are all insane!

774
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,592
Officer, I don't need money.

775
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,261
Just put him in jail.

776
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:59,681
How dare a dumb head athlete hit me?

777
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,892
What did you say?

778
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:05,145
A dumb head what?

779
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,439
You picked on the wrong person.

780
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:08,732
Do you know who I am?

781
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:11,860
My uncle is a judge

782
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:14,154
at Jeonju Prosecutors' office.

783
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,363
My gosh. 

784
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,618
Fine, put him in jail.

785
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:23,455
But do you know who I am?

786
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:26,583
Who are you? What do you have?

787
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:31,505
A nephew of the judge at the Prosecutors'
office can't mess with me.

788
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:36,093
-I'm a real "wack"!
-What?

789
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:41,098
If he goes to jail,
I'll go to your hospital everyday.

790
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,350
I'll print out your dirty chat logs

791
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:46,394
and hand them out at the entrance
of your hospital every morning.

792
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,397
I'll follow you until the day I die. 

793
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:50,732
Your wedding day?

794
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,234
Of course.

795
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:56,071
I'll follow you on your children's
school orientation.

796
00:51:56,196 --> 00:52:00,408
Fine, let's do this for life.

797
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,287
How did you find her?

798
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:22,305
Did you do something wrong?
Why are you looking down?

799
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:26,643
-I'll pay you back.
-I was supposed to pay the damages.

800
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:28,854
Let's just say that was
your settlement money.

801
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:30,355
You saved that up...

802
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,192
to get married.

803
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,948
I'm not getting married.
Hurry up, I'm hungry.

804
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:48,165
By the way...

805
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,543
wasn't that your first spinning kick
in a long time?

806
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:53,879
Did you like it?

807
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:56,882
Of course.

808
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:02,596
I held the mic after a long time.

809
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:05,348
Did you like it?

810
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,227
You're unbelievable when you kick, right?

811
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,855
I'm the same when I hold the mic.

812
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:13,106
Ouch.

813
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:18,570
Let me see.

814
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,822
Is it swollen?

815
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:24,117
I should've killed that crazy jerk.

816
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,869
Let me see.

817
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:33,084
You can't even look after yourself,
but you try to defend others.

818
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:36,087
Hey, we're not strangers.

819
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:38,131
Hey!

820
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:41,968
I can live an embarrassing life,
but you shouldn't.

821
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,471
Don't let others look down on you!

822
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:50,018
Why's your life so embarrassing?

823
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:58,777
Remember...

824
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:03,073
when he said I was a dumb head athlete?

825
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,326
That's me.

826
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,123
Hey, Ko Dong-man.

827
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:17,254
You're a dumb head, but you're not lame.

828
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:21,675
What?

829
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:24,386
You'll make it big. I can tell.

830
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:29,808
Everybody thinks I'm lame.

831
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:31,518
They don't even know you.

832
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,937
I've known you for 20 years.

833
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,356
Nobody knows you more than I do.

834
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:37,482
Trust me.

835
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:41,736
Regardless of what people say...
you'll make it happen.

836
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:45,490
And you're still so young.

837
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:47,659
You'll become something!

838
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:49,995
You will. I promise you.

839
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,416
My goodness.

840
00:54:58,044 --> 00:54:59,296
Let's go.

841
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:01,423
Let's go home and order chicken feet.

842
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:07,887
What are you doing?

843
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,058
You made me cry.

844
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:18,398
You give Sul-hee a hug
when you make her cry.

845
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:22,152
-Are you crying?
-Come on.

846
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,654
You...

847
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:32,579
you fed me kimbap when I was starving.

848
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,877
I was really hungry today.

849
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:45,091
You...

850
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:49,095
you are not really crying, right?

851
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:52,932
Pat me. 

852
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,314
When did you get so big? 

853
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:12,452
Is this your butt?

854
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,372
It's my waist.

855
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:19,667
Please stop hanging out with jerks.

856
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:21,252
Don't piss me off.

857
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:23,171
Seriously.

858
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:28,843
You just got dumped by Moo-ki
and came home crying!

859
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:32,222
-Get up, let's go!
-Gosh.

860
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,599
You hit me so well,

861
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:37,435
so why do you let other people hit you?
I don't get it!

862
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,145
Don't go around crying!

863
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:42,565
Don't go around breaking people's
side mirrors!

864
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:49,197
Just hang out with me.

865
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,910
Hang with me.

866
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,121
I'll hang with you.

867
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:00,250
What do you mean?

868
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,460
Are you drunk?

869
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:09,384
Let's go and have chicken feet with soju.

870
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:10,385
Let's go!

871
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,056
It's on me today!

872
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:18,685
Soju and chicken feet are on me!

873
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:20,562
Yes, it's on you!

874
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:27,152
Hey, what are you guys doing?

875
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:28,403
Go away!

876
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:33,032
I can't even work in fields...

877
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,578
because of you!

878
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:43,626
Gosh, why do you even learn taekwondo?

879
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:47,422
I was supposed to be the prince

880
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:50,925
and they started to hit me.

881
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,806
Hey, look at this.

882
00:57:57,765 --> 00:58:00,059
This smallest guy is you.

883
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,604
You're a crybaby and a bed-wetter
who's weaker than me.

884
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:07,108
But sometimes, you're my cute Dong-man.

885
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:10,612
If you hide this,

886
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:13,740
nobody will know that you're weak.

887
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:21,122
So, open your eyes wide and say
you'll never cry. 

888
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:25,043
Think you can beat everyone
and punch them.

889
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,295
Got it?

890
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:33,968
But I still won't marry you.

891
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:37,472
I won't marry you either!

892
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:42,185
I won't marry you!

893
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:20,974
People have to do what they love.

894
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:23,268
Are you happy you got to do
what you wanted?

895
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:26,396
If I do mixed martial art...

896
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,147
will I make a lot of money?

897
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,108
If you want to make money,
stay away from here.

898
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:32,318
I made myself clear.

899
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:35,947
I said I'd kill you if I saw you again.

900
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,662
