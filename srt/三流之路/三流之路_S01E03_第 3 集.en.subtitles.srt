1
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:58,850
DON'T TOUCH

2
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,645
The 2017 KBC Announcer...

3
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,065
-Sit and wait, it won't take long.
-Thanks.

4
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:09,486
Share your creative future with KBC and--

5
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,531
It will be slightly colder than yesterday.
Wrap up with warm clothes.

6
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,908
A thin cardigan will do...

7
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,452
Why don't you wrap up a bit more?

8
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:20,872
Thismorning calls for showers
caused by a trough of low pressure.

9
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,791
Ae-ra, open your mouth.

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,126
Let's look at the current temperature.

11
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:29,881
-Go for it. Just do it.
-Do what?

12
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,842
I know you're all touchy
with the announcers' recruitment thing.

13
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:33,802
Forget it. 

14
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,011
Why not?

15
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,057
If I were you, I'd apply and see
if I could reach my dream.

16
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:41,893
Do you think...

17
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,062
I can achieve my dream?

18
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:45,647
Yes.

19
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,733
It's tofu soup, not bean sprout soup.

20
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,318
Have it with Dong-man.

21
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,987
See you later.

22
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,282
You two went to prison yesterday.

23
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,454
It wasn't a prison.

24
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,790
I'm off to make money.

25
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:14,592
Open up.

26
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:25,019
I love you

27
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,022
Comes out at times...

28
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,651
What's wrong with him?
He'll be embarrassed when he comes out.

29
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:38,116
Like a lost butterfly

30
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,285
I cried and begged...

31
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,913
I can't hit the high notes today.

32
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,290
Why are you...

33
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,917
I told you not to come in here
without permission.

34
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,588
You should've changed the passcode.

35
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:54,007
0070 is so easy to remember.

36
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:25,788
My goodness.

37
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,333
Which body lotion do you use?

38
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,628
Are you trying to be Song Seung-heon?

39
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,754
Your eyebrows...

40
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,508
It tastes good.

41
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,429
It's so itchy.
Is it because I didn't wash my hair?

42
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:42,597
Hey.

43
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,351
Let's try not to meet in the morning.

44
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,186
Why?

45
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:52,857
I just prefer seeing you in the evening.

46
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,275
That's weird.

47
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,196
Why do you want to see me in the evenings?

48
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,456
Who is it?

49
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,041
Why are you ignoring the call?

50
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,918
It's a spam call.

51
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,798
Why are you being so nosy?

52
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:18,800
Did she call you?

53
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,094
She didn't call, so eat up.

54
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,680
I told her clearly back then
that I'd kill her

55
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,516
if she showed up again.

56
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:30,103
Wait and see if I really do it.

57
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,822
Hello, how have you been?

58
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,783
I miss everyone.

59
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,243
Yes.

60
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,621
Do you know what she's doing right now?

61
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,999
I think her name was Ae-ra. 

62
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,420
Yes, that's right.
Choi Ae-ra.

63
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,881
No, we weren't close. 

64
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,509
I thought she'd be in broadcasting. 

65
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,762
What? At a department store?

66
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,099
So...

67
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:11,978
you got back from changing
and found this here?

68
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,606
What could it be?

69
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,400
Who'd leave this here?

70
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,195
Did a terrorist leave it?

71
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:23,990
What do you think?

72
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:28,536
-Should we open it?
-Don't.

73
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,831
Why not? Do you have a bad feeling, too?

74
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,376
This was packed by an expert.

75
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,421
The packaging alone
must have cost 20,000 won.

76
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,466
What if the owner comes back
and demands compensation?

77
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,843
Let's leave it, then.

78
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:48,306
I'll broadcast to see if someone lost it.

79
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,227
Let's leave this here for now.

80
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:55,813
Here?

81
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,649
BLOCKED CALLER

82
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,413
Answer your phone.
Or else, I'll go to your place. 

83
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,189
One kimbap, please. 

84
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,365
Hey, Ae-ra. 

85
00:06:56,582 --> 00:07:00,795
Park Hye-ran is eating 1,000 won kimbap.

86
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,004
Is this real?

87
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,551
Aren't you going to eat?

88
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:07,969
I'm on a diet.

89
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,720
Then why are you here?

90
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,056
I bought it for someone.

91
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,435
But coincidentally, I met you here.

92
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:16,727
It's good to see you.

93
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,690
Was it really a coincidence?

94
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,901
Park Hye-ran, a conglomerate family's
daughter-in-law

95
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:27,447
happened to show up at a 1,000 won
kimbap place near my work,

96
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,490
especially during my lunch hour. 

97
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,200
Is that a coincidence?

98
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,078
For you, nothing happens by coincidence.

99
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,498
Since we met, can you give me
Dong-man's number?

100
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,584
Or his address. 

101
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:41,794
Why look for Dong-man?

102
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,506
I have no reason to tell you.

103
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,049
You know his number, right?

104
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,010
No, I don't.

105
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,304
You don't?

106
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,557
We don't keep in touch anymore

107
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,476
ever since he got married and moved away.

108
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,020
It feels weird to call a married man. 

109
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:00,855
That's the proper etiquette.

110
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:03,357
I see, is that right?

111
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,318
Etiquette.

112
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,987
You know what an etiquette is, right?

113
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,417
Leave Dong-man alone.

114
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,669
Don't think about him
and stay away from him.

115
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:27,173
You're presumptuous as always.

116
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,345
This is so heavy.

117
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,554
Gosh.

118
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:41,729
If you exterminate the mites,
I'll work on the bidets and filter...

119
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,648
Me?

120
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,650
You want me to do the fumigation?

121
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,653
You're in charge of it.

122
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,405
We need to do our parts
to finish quickly. 

123
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,657
You like to divide duties?

124
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,994
But, you know, in Korea,
we follow hierarchy.

125
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:00,039
Do you know the order of ranks?

126
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,167
So, are you telling me...

127
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,712
to do everything all by myself?

128
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,464
Why do you ask?

129
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:12,552
You sound as if you've never
served in the army.

130
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,679
Does it work?

131
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:15,763
Sorry, my bad.

132
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,601
They're so stingy. 

133
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,145
Why are they making us eat the cherries?

134
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,107
I like it, it's like break time. 

135
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,569
-It tastes good, though.
-We need to shoot people eating cherries.

136
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,530
-Eat cherries with relish.
-Okay.

137
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:36,742
Also, mix the cherries with salad
and yogurt, too. 

138
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:37,868
Yes, sir. 

139
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,954
-Enjoy.
-Okay.

140
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,206
I said not the yogurt.

141
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,136
Smile more, please.

142
00:09:58,889 --> 00:09:59,890
YOGURT

143
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,405
What are they talking about?
Why are they smiling?

144
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,784
Me too what?

145
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:27,585
What's wrong with her?

146
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,505
-Oh, no.
-Are you okay?

147
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,176
Someone help! She's choking. 

148
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,769
Step aside. 

149
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,492
Can you do it, Dong-man?

150
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:45,579
Why does Sul-hee get to play Snow White?

151
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,541
Because she is!

152
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,919
-Got a problem with that?
-You're just a tree. 

153
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:56,090
I'm a special tree. 

154
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,761
You just have to kiss Sul-hee now. 

155
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:24,285
I don't like Sul-hee's runny nose.

156
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:32,126
What's wrong with you?
Just kiss her. 

157
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,045
Kiss her!

158
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:41,051
My fantasy was always being Snow White.

159
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,977
And now, finally,

160
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:55,483
I felt like I became Snow White. 

161
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:05,242
Why would you put cherries in yogurt!

162
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:08,120
You eat cherries, not with yogurt!

163
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,581
You can dip it if you want to!

164
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,042
Just dip it!

165
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,346
I'm sick of my irritable bowel syndrome.

166
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:30,851
The person who left their spare battery

167
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,145
on the third floor,

168
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,772
please come pick it up immediately.

169
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,315
What's that? Is that Mr. Kim?

170
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,692
Why is he making the announcement?

171
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,611
Why does he talk like that?

172
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:45,366
The announcer suddenly took
 three months off.

173
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,826
Why?

174
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,661
She's getting married.

175
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,464
Mr. Kim, here you go. 

176
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,633
You scared me. What is it this time?

177
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,469
I thought you'd be extra tired today. 

178
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,721
You have your own job and also announcing.

179
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,057
What is it? What do you want?

180
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,852
It's what I've been asking you
for a while ago already. 

181
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:16,897
To give me a heads up
if the announcing position opens up.

182
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,735
You are very ambitious. 

183
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,448
You must've been flustered
with the sudden resignation.

184
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:30,411
People like me need to act quickly
in these situations. 

185
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,331
-People like you?
-People on your side. 

186
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,041
Gosh.

187
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,921
Our Mr. Kim...

188
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,424
we should recognize your duty.

189
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,511
It looked like your own wife was dying.

190
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:52,182
I learned the heimlich maneuver
during training.

191
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,392
Sure.

192
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:57,813
I hope you'll work harder
on cleaning up, too. 

193
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,066
Oh, my head.

194
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,696
What the...

195
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,032
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes?

196
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,827
You were super cool. 

197
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,039
I wish I could eat that cherry.

198
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,291
What?

199
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,270
It's not that difficult.

200
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,105
Just don't burp into the microphone.

201
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,567
I'll hold interviews
no matter who applies.

202
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,195
You can also give it a shot then. 

203
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:50,449
If you do well then,
you can make this seat yours.

204
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,575
Really?

205
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,171
How dare someone who was a simple soldier

206
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:07,257
lecture a sergeant
about respecting order of rank?

207
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,969
Seriously.

208
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,137
AE-RA

209
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,186
You have such bad timing, Ae-ra.

210
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:21,772
What do you want?

211
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,274
Why are you calling me?

212
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,528
How dare you order me to come?

213
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,780
What? There's a big news?

214
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,826
So, you're going to do the in-house
broadcasting today?

215
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,290
Wait, why did you ask me to come over?

216
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,627
You should be here to witness
the historical moment. 

217
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,212
You also need to do something for me.

218
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,256
My first broadcast starts at 3:30 p.m. 

219
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,383
It'll be my debut,
so please record it for me.

220
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,051
You want me to record it?

221
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,430
You always want me to do
stuff for you.

222
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,474
We only have 20 minutes left
until the live broadcast.

223
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,518
I should hurry and wait
in front of the speaker.

224
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,105
You really know how to impress me.

225
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:04,982
Okay, let's go. 

226
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,658
Here's an announcement for our customers.

227
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:19,204
Outdoor wear is on sale.

228
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:23,167
If you're interested, please make a visit
to the eight floor event hall. 

229
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,628
I'm Choi Ae-ra
and that's it for the announcement.

230
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,967
Wow, she did a great job!

231
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,887
She's as good as Baek Ji-yeon, right?

232
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,728
My gosh, what should I do?

233
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:55,908
Hey, did she just say her name?

234
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,829
Gosh, why would she say her name?

235
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,081
My gosh. 

236
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,708
Put on your gloves, you'll burn yourself.

237
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,752
Outdoor wear is on sale.

238
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:13,842
If you're interested, please make a visit
to the eight floor event hall. 

239
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:17,429
I'm Choi Ae-ra and
that's it for the announcement.

240
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,433
Wow.

241
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,186
What should I do?

242
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,815
Why? Is there something wrong?

243
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,692
It sounded perfect to me. 

244
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:33,654
What should I do?

245
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,990
I'm...

246
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,536
so happy.

247
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,746
I'm really happy. 

248
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,669
I guess people really need to do
what they love. 

249
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,257
Now that you've done what you love,
are you that happy?

250
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,050
I could die. 

251
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:10,065
An unknown box is at the information desk
on the first floor.

252
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,359
Where's the girl
from the information desk?

253
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:16,071
You mean Ae-ra?
She's the one talking right now.

254
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,449
I'm Choi Ae-ra, and that's it for now. 

255
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,956
Let's have spicy pork feet with soju.

256
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,405
I'm not Cindy Jung.

257
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,949
I'm Choi Ae-ra from
Lucky department store.

258
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,203
Make sure to bring the invoice
and come to get revenge. 

259
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,282
Take your hands off me, you pervert!

260
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,784
Don't follow me!

261
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,202
You jerk!

262
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,501
Gosh, let's go. 

263
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,261
My goodness.

264
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,642
I'm sorry for cursing at you earlier. 

265
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,811
Why were you following me?

266
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,604
It's just that...

267
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,402
I got this for you,
but it was in the Lost and Found. 

268
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,447
What is it?

269
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:36,586
Ae-ra, once you get off work,
wear these shoes and come to the gate.

270
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,630
I'll be waiting. From Moo-bin. 

271
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,884
Last time, when you kicked
the side mirrors...

272
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,761
your heel broke. 

273
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,723
I got you these so you can walk
comfortably...

274
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,976
the next time when you have to kick
anything.

275
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,603
These are air sneakers. 

276
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,441
Do you think this is funny?

277
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,569
Are you guys betting on shoes this time?

278
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,988
No, that's not it. 

279
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,366
I feel extremely uncomfortable
to look at you. 

280
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,578
So, please stop joking around
and let's not see each other again. 

281
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,955
I want to hang out with you. 

282
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:13,749
What?

283
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,585
I missed you.

284
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:22,341
After I saw you that night,
I kept thinking about you. 

285
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:28,138
I spent so much time coming up
with this idea so I could see you tonight.

286
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,016
So...

287
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:34,936
this is a brand new jacket,
and I even got a haircut today. 

288
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,149
I made a reservation at a restaurant,
and I even filled my car with gas. 

289
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,739
That was a bit cute. 

290
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,952
Why did you fill gas?

291
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:55,540
Well, just in case you wanted
to go for a drive...

292
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,168
or go to the Seoul Tower. 

293
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,630
That's so lame. 

294
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:06,343
By any chance, do you have a boyfriend?

295
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,809
What will you do if I don't have one?

296
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,813
Then, try going on ten dates with me.
I'm confident.

297
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,860
I'll do my best.

298
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,154
I do my best in everything.

299
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:31,284
Gosh, why are you so straightforward?

300
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,788
Well, it's because you're pretty. 

301
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,707
Other guys might also be after you.

302
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,211
Whatever.

303
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:45,590
Ae-ra. Try these on and see if they fit.

304
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:48,260
I think you're around size 6, right?

305
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,931
I'm size 6.5.

306
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,350
Then they'll fit you perfectly.
Please try them on.

307
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,612
Try them on.

308
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,031
Just like Cinderella tried on
her glass shoes. 

309
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,160
I'm size 7.5.

310
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,956
Should I try squeezing my feet
inside these sneakers?

311
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,157
MIXED MARTIAL ART

312
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,051
THE PATH OF MARTIAL ARTS

313
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:15,180
Now that you've done what you love,
are you that happy?

314
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,352
I could die. 

315
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,323
Go, go. 

316
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:39,955
NO YO-YO EFFECT

317
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,206
Coach!

318
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,168
Why does he keep making sudden visits?

319
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,171
That jerk is here again. 

320
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,551
Let me ask you just one question.

321
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:57,806
By any chance, if I decide to start
martial arts...

322
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:00,600
What?

323
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,854
Yes? Go on. 

324
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,817
Will I be able to make a lot of money?

325
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:13,530
Can I make enough money to live well
even if I get old and can't fight?

326
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,284
Why do you keep bringing up money?

327
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,202
Is money all that matters in life?

328
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:22,747
Instead, you should be thinking
of your dreams, efforts, your heart...

329
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,584
to give your best shot at life. 

330
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,669
I must have money to dream
and care about others.

331
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:32,007
Gosh, you're still young to be tainted
by the world. 

332
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,552
I want to buy a house for my mom.

333
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,054
I want to get a brand new car for my dad.

334
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:41,057
These are all my wishes, but I need money
to fulfill those wishes.

335
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,979
People always say money isn't important,
but it is.

336
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:51,109
I'm asking because I can't do this
just to fulfill my dream.

337
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:54,529
Besides, I have to protect
Dong-hee forever.

338
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,740
I can't give this a shot
if I were to fail.

339
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:57,991
Darn it!

340
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:00,785
So, can I make a lot of money
doing mixed martial arts?

341
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,374
If you want to make money,
stay away from here. 

342
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,918
Don't even come and visit me, you jerk.

343
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,182
I'm worried I might want to do it.

344
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,684
I'm afraid that this is something
I really wanted to do.

345
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,311
Forget about it.

346
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,188
You're a man. 

347
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,482
How can you still not be over it?

348
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,276
I won't do it.
Do whatever you're supposed to do. 

349
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,488
-Tak-su.
-Why is he being such a jerk?

350
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,886
Dad, I really did make
announcements today.

351
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:00,845
I did!

352
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:05,975
Of course.

353
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,895
I'm Choi Ae-ra,
and that's it for the announcement.

354
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,981
That's what I said.
I'll send you the recording.

355
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:15,568
So you are going to do it tomorrow
and the day after?

356
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,781
If that's the case,
I'll visit you tomorrow.

357
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,367
I'll close the restaurant and go.

358
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,744
Ae-ra might be doing something.

359
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:25,745
I don't know.

360
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:29,332
How can I not go?
My daughter finally made announcements.

361
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,335
Why don't we do this?
Let's have lunch tomorrow.

362
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,881
I'll open for the morning and be there.
I'll hang up for now.

363
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,676
I'm so proud of her.

364
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,095
Hey!

365
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:45,390
-Bring us sea bream sashimi.
-You had sea bream?

366
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,226
Why didn't you serve us earlier?

367
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,771
Don't even try to pay for this.

368
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:55,191
Everything including
the sea beam is on me. 

369
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,193
Why? Is Ae-ra getting married?

370
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,196
That's not important!

371
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:03,992
I'm now the father
of an in-house announcer.

372
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,369
Gosh, he drives me crazy.

373
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,788
Why is he coming all the way to Seoul?

374
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,998
Hey, you weirdo.

375
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:55,126
Gosh, are you a gangster?

376
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,712
-Stand up.
-Gosh.

377
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,341
Darn it.

378
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,349
This is nice.

379
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,060
An anchor shouldn't be standing.

380
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:18,942
What?

381
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,705
Sul-hee.

382
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:35,458
Is that tteokbokki?

383
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,836
Is that from the three-way intersection?

384
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,296
Do you have beer inside?

385
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,506
Do you have soju, too?

386
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,886
-Soju, beer and tteokbokki.
-Seriously.

387
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,805
I have to check if you are on drugs.

388
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:53,184
-Drug test.
-Are you guys insane?

389
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,143
Seriously.

390
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:55,770
Where's Joo-man?

391
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,439
At work, he won't come home.

392
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,192
Joo-man succeeded.
He's working late. 

393
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,986
He really looks like a businessman.

394
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:06,281
Anyways, that's why I'm free tonight.

395
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,949
Let's go to Namil Bar.

396
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:13,037
-Sul-hee, it's pronounced "free."
-Free.

397
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,572
This is so refreshing.

398
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:53,036
I can't leave this place
because of this Namil Bar.

399
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:57,874
By the way, do you think the new landlord
already knows about this place?

400
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,210
But, did you guys see the new landlord?

401
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,963
I haven't seen the landlord
on the fifth floor either.

402
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,550
She's Nam-il's mom.
It's the name of the villa.

403
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,344
-Like Sul-hee's jokbal?
-Yes.

404
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,805
So, the real landlord of this villa
moved in.

405
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,599
That's what the laundromat lady told me.

406
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,686
-By the way, she's a bit weird.
-What?

407
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,230
The new landlord is a bit weird.

408
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,360
Is she a ghost?

409
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,405
No one has seen her coming in or out.

410
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,366
It's weird that she suddenly moved in.

411
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:09,362
Why do I keep hearing people talk?

412
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:17,245
-That's a lot of soju.
-It tastes better this way.

413
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,080
Here we go.

414
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,876
-Thank you.
-Give me the bomb shot, too.

415
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,421
-Really?
-Don't give it to her.

416
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,840
If she gets drunk, I get tired.

417
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,967
One shot of soju makes her crawl.

418
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,927
Let me just take a sip.

419
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,976
Is something wrong?

420
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,520
-Did you fight with Joo-man?
-No.

421
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,355
It's not that.

422
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,401
Isn't it funny to attach jewelries
on your nails?

423
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:52,030
-Why? Who did that?
-The new intern at work.

424
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:55,658
Yesterday, her sleeves had laces

425
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,785
and she wore a princess outfit.

426
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,288
Today, she wore a pink dress.

427
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:01,581
Is she pretty?

428
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,542
Don't you think she's trying to show off?

429
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,627
She's ridiculous.

430
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,296
So, is she pretty?

431
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,382
Why? Did she hit on Joo-man?

432
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,260
He won't fall for her even if she does.

433
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,138
Forget it, she's just someone from work.

434
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,807
Please answer me. Is she pretty?

435
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,310
Am I invisible to you guys?

436
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,187
So I have a question to ask.

437
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,815
Women don't like to watch...

438
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,151
mixed martial arts, do they?

439
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,320
-Mixed martial arts?
-Yes.

440
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,363
Isn't that where fighters bleed?

441
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,575
Well, not really. They don't bleed.

442
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,826
-Hey.
-What?

443
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,162
What are you up to these day?

444
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,705
What are you doing?

445
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,584
Don't act like my grandmother.

446
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,961
You jerk.

447
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,005
I'm sleepy.

448
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:54,634
Sul-hee, are you going to call Joo-man?

449
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,636
Sul-hee, try playing hard to get.

450
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,679
I won't call him.

451
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:03,017
If you're interested...

452
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,603
please make a visit to the event hall.

453
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,981
I'm Choi Ae-ra,
and that's it for the announcement.

454
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:13,319
I'm Choi Ae-ra,
and that's it for the announcement.

455
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,030
I'm Choi Ae-ra.

456
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,282
Are you that happy?

457
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:22,620
Doesn't my voice resemble Baek Ji-yeon?

458
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,789
How did you manage to live
without being an anchor?

459
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,917
You should give it a shot.
Try it even if you might fail.

460
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,836
I think they are recruiting anchors now.

461
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,921
I won't.

462
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,762
Hey, you told me you love being
in front of the microphone.

463
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:43,349
That's why you're using microphone
at the information desk. 

464
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,853
-I won't do it.
-Why not?

465
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,189
I don't want to be a prop.

466
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:52,567
A prop?

467
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,528
They say degrees and age aren't important.

468
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:57,572
But, that's all lies.

469
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:03,703
Don't just tell me to chase my dream.
What about yours?

470
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,288
Mine?

471
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:07,832
My dream is...

472
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,170
to become rich.

473
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,714
What a stupid dream.

474
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:20,553
It sounds so stupid,
but I can relate to it.

475
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,892
How dare you.

476
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,943
If you become rich,
will you make me rich, too?

477
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:37,737
Hey.

478
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,698
Hey, this is why I can't become rich.

479
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:41,741
Hey.

480
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,911
-Relax your arm.
-I'm relaxed.

481
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:48,206
When we were in school...

482
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,791
we had to write down our dreams.

483
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,002
The teachers said we could be anything.

484
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,379
Now that I'm all grown up...

485
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:59,175
The adults tricked us in many ways.

486
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:04,138
I wrote everything from winning
Miss Korea to becoming the president.

487
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:08,142
Back then, my dream changed
almost everyday.

488
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,897
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

489
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,981
Rice cake skewers.

490
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,650
What?

491
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,236
I'll be a rice cake skewers
when I grow up.

492
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,614
-Dong-man.
-Darn it.

493
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,741
Please sit down.

494
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,826
Darn it.

495
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,998
I'll become Yoon Do-hyun!

496
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,209
The national competition is coming up.

497
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,336
Send me to Seoul!

498
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,884
So, Mr. Rice cake skewers,

499
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:43,844
what's your dream now?

500
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,013
Let's say I don't have one.

501
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,224
What do you mean?

502
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,726
It's better to pretend
not to have a dream.

503
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,354
Having one will only make you
feel pathetic.

504
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:59,110
You're right, what's the point
when reality takes over?

505
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,988
Dreaming of reading the news
only angers me.

506
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,574
I won't dream anymore.

507
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,536
We don't need to have dreams.

508
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:12,248
The Earth evolves just fine
when someone like me doesn't have a dream.

509
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:25,720
Don't sleep.

510
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,055
I'll just leave you here.

511
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:33,185
You could freeze to death
if you sleep here.

512
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:36,731
You might end of having a twisted lips.

513
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:44,947
Hey, you...

514
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,243
you have small nostrils.

515
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,248
You have great skin for someone so ugly.

516
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,667
It's so...

517
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,378
soft and smooth.

518
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,091
Don't do that.

519
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:05,801
Do what?

520
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,058
I let you off last time.

521
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,145
When?

522
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:20,107
You hugged me on the way back
from the police station.

523
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,193
-I remember it clearly.
-Oh, that?

524
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,154
You don't have to remember it clearly.

525
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,116
I'm warning you.
Don't touch me.

526
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,662
This is just unbelievable. 

527
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:38,918
Someone would think
I molested you or something.

528
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,211
I'm...

529
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:43,756
from the countryside, so I may get
the wrong idea.

530
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:48,219
You don't think much
since you're practically a dumb head. 

531
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,846
Puberty barely hit you and ran off.

532
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:54,308
So, I can do this or this.

533
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,062
I could do something like this,

534
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,273
or hug you like this.

535
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,568
And you'll feeling nothing, but I...

536
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,240
feel dizzy.

537
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,410
Don't make me want to vomit.

538
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,248
Don't touch me. Don't cross the line.

539
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:37,435
How could she just touch me like that?

540
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,733
Why is it so hot?

541
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,527
It's so hot.

542
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:50,573
I'm burning.

543
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:10,217
NOTICE TO NAMIL VILLA RESIDENTS

544
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,203
What's that?

545
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,829
A bag for your laptop.

546
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,248
It was finally delivered yesterday.

547
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,542
Honey.

548
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:48,172
It's made with Italian cowhide
and it's extremely light.

549
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,007
I got it online for a bargain.

550
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,426
-How much?
-300,000 won.

551
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:54,512
-300,000 won?
-Yes.

552
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,306
Successful businessmen all have one.

553
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,600
You need to have one, too.

554
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,101
It's pretty, right?

555
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:05,814
-Why do you keep acting like my mom?
-What?

556
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:10,027
If you carry a fake, torn leather bag
then buy me an Italian cowhide bag,

557
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:11,779
do you think I'd like it?

558
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:16,408
You meet a lot of people and sign deals.
It helps if you look smart.

559
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,078
I don't want to be a son to you.

560
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:22,706
Let's not be like a family.
Can't we enjoy our life?

561
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,124
Please?

562
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:27,211
Honey, don't you like me anymore?

563
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,714
I say this because I like you. 

564
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,967
You're making me so frustrated.

565
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,344
Kiss me.

566
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:46,522
It's been a while since we kissed.

567
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,039
Hey, here comes your wife.

568
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:06,208
NATIONAL ATHLETE'S SAUSAGE

569
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,501
Dong-man's fan.

570
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,296
-His best friend.
-That's me.

571
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,840
You're Dong-man's best friend?

572
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,551
-Is it you then?
-What?

573
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,679
We're all best friends to each other.

574
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,683
Go, he's waiting for you.

575
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,436
-Go.
-He's such a nuisance.

576
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,276
Hello, morning sausage!

577
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:36,071
Do you sell sausages early
in the morning, too?

578
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:40,367
You told me not to come and see you.

579
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,453
After all that yelling,

580
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,663
you came to see me the very next day.

581
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,833
What did you say?

582
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:52,004
You're actually quite clingy.

583
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,217
-Ouch.
-Move.

584
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:01,722
Don't pretend you're working.

585
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:02,931
What do you want?

586
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:08,020
-Will you do it for me?
-Let me hear it first.

587
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,772
Will you do it for me if I tell?

588
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,024
Coach.

589
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,444
Have a great day.

590
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:20,074
Go! Get lost!

591
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,950
What's wrong with you?

592
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:24,703
I bought those tickets
for 198,000 won each to go with you.

593
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,872
Throw them away or sell them.
I don't care. 

594
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:35,798
Gosh, you're such a nuisance.

595
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,467
You won't even grant me a simple wish.

596
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:43,138
-You're a jerk! A traitor!
-What time does it start?

597
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:46,809
It's says it on the ticket!

598
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,070
Testing for the morning broadcast.

599
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:01,323
Testing for the morning broadcast.

600
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:05,869
It can be tough, I'll come over
and help you out time to time.

601
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,248
My goodness.

602
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:13,001
-You're here early, Ae-ra.
-Who is she?

603
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,254
Well, you see...

604
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:16,839
I'm the new in-house announcer.

605
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,052
What's going on?

606
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:23,637
What happened?

607
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,433
Let's go out and talk.

608
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:29,518
-We'll talk outside.
-But...

609
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,312
What's all this fuss?

610
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:36,316
A recommendation from
the former announcer

611
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,944
and the announcer academy...

612
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:41,697
For many complicated reasons, 

613
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,991
I had to hire her as the new
in-house announcer.

614
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:47,119
You said there would be an interview.

615
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:50,038
It's unfair if you're not giving me
a chance.

616
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,624
This is about trust
between labor and management.

617
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:55,085
Labor and management?

618
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,881
Is there a labor union in our company?

619
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:00,591
What?

620
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:08,974
This could trigger a major labor issue.

621
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,770
-Be quiet.
-Why are you so thoughtless?

622
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,773
Let's do the interview to be fair. 

623
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,191
Let's go.

624
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,360
Thank you.

625
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:27,409
I'm so tired.

626
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,828
Sir.

627
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,207
If you suddenly pass on your job to me...

628
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,541
Are you mad?

629
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:37,085
I'm not, but...

630
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,630
Look, my girlfriend wanted to break up
with me.

631
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:41,882
Do you think I want to kill mites
right now?

632
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:44,968
You did that to me last time, too,
and you're doing it again.

633
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:48,680
She wants to break up with me.
How could I not drink?

634
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:51,308
Sure, you can drink.

635
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:56,146
But, if we get double-booked
and the customer complains like last time,

636
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,106
our branch will look bad.

637
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,191
Pull over.

638
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:01,276
-Pardon?
-Pull over.

639
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:07,032
DOCTOR FOR YOU

640
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,583
Do you feel nauseated?

641
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:18,877
-Why did you ask me to pull over?
-Dong-man.

642
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,841
Are you lecturing me?

643
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:27,928
I'm sorry.

644
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,557
You clenched your teeth.

645
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:39,147
Do I need to get your permission
to clench my teeth?

646
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:44,111
-I don't.
-You jerk.

647
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,113
Hey.

648
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:48,615
Say it again.

649
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,076
Are you mad?

650
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:53,245
Are you?

651
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,872
Clench your teeth again.

652
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,541
Clench your teeth again!

653
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,300
I'm sorry, I'll fix it.

654
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,427
Just quit then.

655
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:11,013
Please quit.

656
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:12,764
I won't stop you.

657
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:24,568
I don't know, that jerk!

658
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:28,155
I came because I was hired.
This is so annoying.

659
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,783
So you talk to that jerk again!

660
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:34,745
Your husband got scared
once she brought up labor law. 

661
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:37,247
What's the use if he owns the store?

662
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:39,166
You take care of it!

663
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:52,304
With the U.S increasing
their gasoline production,

664
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,640
everyone is wondering

665
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:59,603
how this will affect
gas prices here in South Korea.

666
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:03,732
Your enunciation is really good.
Of course you're an academy graduate.

667
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:07,736
What about you?
Do you have something prepared?

668
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,659
Please check the food section
at ground level.

669
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,953
Domestic oxtail is on sale right now.

670
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:20,040
Domestic oxtail is only 19,800 won per kg.

671
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:23,627
If you're planning a trip abroad
with your friends,

672
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,713
hurry and get yours today.
Don't miss out, the offer finishes soon.

673
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:35,639
I'd like to go and buy that oxtail.

674
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:39,726
Well, she lacks professional feeling...

675
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:41,895
I don't think gas prices will be useful

676
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:45,899
in making announcements
at a department store.

677
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,860
I believe knowing the store is
more important.

678
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:52,948
How old are you?

679
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:56,159
I'm 23 years old.
Twenty three.

680
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,161
I see.

681
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,872
I believe there were no age limit.

682
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:05,460
After adding up various scores...

683
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,089
we'll go with Yun-ji.

684
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:15,137
Ae-ra, you should return
to your information desk and work hard.

685
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:21,059
Yes, sir.

686
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,687
I should go back.

687
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:28,400
I'm not an academy graduate,
nor am I young with any connections.

688
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,154
Of course, I have to step down.

689
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,538
You never should've bothered saying...

690
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:47,252
you'd give me a chance to interview.

691
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:09,399
What are you looking at?

692
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:16,031
May I have your attention please?

693
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:20,243
We're having a special event
on housewares on the ninth floor.

694
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:24,498
If you're interested,
please head to the event hall. 

695
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,083
Dad.

696
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:28,293
You don't have to come.

697
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,005
How may I help you?

698
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,091
Where's the restroom?

699
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:36,343
-This way, ma'am.
-Thank you.

700
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,909
Why did you come?

701
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,370
I didn't ask you to come this time.

702
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:07,666
Is something wrong?

703
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,711
I was just passing by
and wanted to grab lunch with you.

704
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,217
You wear this to make announcements?

705
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:21,346
Did you announce today?

706
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:28,728
To be frank,

707
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,897
I can't sit still all day long.

708
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:34,192
I started getting really stiff
and felt so trapped.

709
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:38,446
I couldn't handle it. So I quit.

710
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,747
My dad's too busy to come anyway.
It's for the best.

711
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:05,724
Why did you turn around?

712
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,603
This is a fortress.

713
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:12,939
My back is so wide.
No one can see you.

714
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:15,859
So what?

715
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,113
Just cry.

716
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,410
Whatever.

717
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,121
It's not cool to act tough...

718
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,124
when you want to cry.

719
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:36,129
It's cool to cry if you want to cry.

720
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,799
Who said I wanted to cry?

721
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:45,305
Why are people such jerks?

722
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:48,225
How could they give then take it away?

723
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:54,105
You were so happy.

724
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:58,818
You were so happy you could die.
How could they cut you?

725
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,377
Cover me well.

726
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,838
If anyone I know sees me,
I'll just die.

727
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:46,449
I really want to do it.

728
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:50,245
Why can't I ever get what I want?

729
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:20,483
It tastes good.

730
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:25,947
You know how I buy you sausages
all the time?

731
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:29,075
Did you tell your mom about this?

732
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:31,703
I did, but she still wants me to quit.

733
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:34,581
-How come?
-I don't know.

734
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:41,087
Did you get hit again?

735
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,305
Go and do 100 kicks.

736
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:57,729
Stupid.

737
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:08,156
You keep coming by.

738
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:10,742
Coach, I got hit.

739
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,495
You got hit? By whom?

740
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:16,247
A jerk who was once in the army...

741
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,875
kicked me in front of many people.

742
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:22,379
I got hit here four times by a tiny fist.

743
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,255
Gosh.

744
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:25,840
Why...

745
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:29,511
why are you both getting beaten up?
I'm so upset.

746
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:36,518
Here.

747
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,109
Is that why you came here?

748
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:51,491
-You can go if you want to.
-Who was it?

749
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:52,784
You want me to beat him up?

750
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:55,912
That's not what I meant.

751
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:00,500
You said it's at 8 p.m.

752
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:05,296
You'll go? Really?

753
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:09,134
Sure, you said it's your wish.

754
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,637
You're not on the bus, right?

755
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:16,057
There's no need to come.

756
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:20,311
I quit because the room was too stuffy.

757
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:22,647
Dinner?

758
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:25,608
I'm eating right now.

759
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,906
Why are you asking what I'm eating?

760
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,700
Like you know if I say it.

761
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:39,122
Why do you always ask what I eat?
That's really annoying.

762
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:46,045
You're the one who's annoying me.

763
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,090
Do you think I starve all the time?

764
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:51,468
You're always asking if I'm eating well.

765
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,471
That's all you ask.

766
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:18,953
NATIONAL ATHLETE'S SAUSAGE

767
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:39,641
This is going to be our last chapter
of our martial arts career together.

768
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:42,602
Let's have fun and end it in good terms.

769
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:46,523
You sound like you'll never see me again.

770
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,526
Let's stop seeing each other
as coach and player.

771
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:51,236
Let's be friends now.

772
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:52,904
I think I saw something.

773
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:56,866
No, we can never be friends.
Let's go.

774
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:59,410
He's so stubborn.

775
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:16,094
What do you think? Isn't it fun?

776
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:17,971
Isn't it fun?

777
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:21,849
Isn't your heart racing?

778
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:24,143
Aren't you getting worked up?

779
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:26,312
When will is end? It's so long.

780
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:27,981
Fine.

781
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:30,024
There's just one fight left.

782
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:34,904
This guy dominated the ring
after just two years.

783
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:36,614
He's got great legs.

784
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:39,367
Anyway...

785
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:42,912
he does have great legs.

786
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:47,166
Hey.

787
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:49,961
Just watch, okay?

788
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,006
Okay, fine.

789
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,446
Now for the main event.

790
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,823
Here comes Kim Tak-su!

791
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:00,365
Look at him.

792
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:02,492
Watch.

793
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:04,702
Watch how he's living now.

794
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:10,625
You both are at fault.
Why do you have to feel guilty?

795
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:16,589
Coach.

796
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:21,177
Why are you being so cruel to me?

797
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:52,834
CONVERSATION BETWEEN JUST FRIENDS

798
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:58,923
What are you doing?
I told you not to touch me.

799
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:01,134
You're so ugly.

800
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,057
Darn it.

801
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:11,394
Hey, what's the smell from your hair?

802
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:13,187
Did you have pork ribs?

803
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:15,648
You smell like a hog.

804
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:20,361
Hey, stop touching my hair.
I don't like it.

805
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:21,487
I'll kill you.

806
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:24,574
Do I really have to know what you ate?

807
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:26,951
Gross. I'm going home.

808
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:35,793
Ae-ra, let's go on a date tomorrow.

809
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:38,171
I'll plan our date. 

810
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,381
Are you here to see me?

811
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:41,841
Are you afraid I'll be back?

812
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:43,301
You jerk!

813
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:44,886
Kim Tak-su!

814
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:48,431
If I see you in a ring,
you're dead.

815
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:51,350
I feel relieved if I see you go in.

816
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:52,894
Ae-ra!

817
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:54,145
Hey.

818
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,690
Why are you in front of my place?

819
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:58,983
I'm going to date her.

820
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:01,319
Boys and girls can never be friends.

821
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,237
We're like siblings.

822
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:06,365
We aren't... siblings though.

823
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:11,370
