1
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,982
I also love you. I love you a lot.

2
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,693
That's why I hate it.

3
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:30,613
Can't you just support me?

4
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,534
Kim Tak-su isn't an ordinary jerk.

5
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,455
They say he's good.
I heard he's a good fighter.

6
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,790
So what if I lose?

7
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,626
I'd rather lose than to avoid him.

8
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:47,672
I feel like I'll regret it again
for the next ten years.

9
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,384
Even if I get completely wrecked,
I want to give it my best.

10
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,804
You wont just lose.

11
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:56,806
They say you'll die.

12
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,517
Everyone's saying you'll lose.

13
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,353
I looked up the comments.
They're all saying that.

14
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,023
They say that you'll be destroyed,

15
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:07,108
and will be taken away on a stretcher.

16
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,360
They say as a newbie,
you're no match for Kim Tak-su.

17
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,491
Then do you agree with them?

18
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:21,706
You told me before
that people don't know me like you do.

19
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,751
You've seen me for 20 years.

20
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,170
You said you knew me the best.

21
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,589
So do you agree with them?

22
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:33,510
Do you think I'm no match for him?

23
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,221
Do you not think about the people
that worry about you?

24
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,848
It's good enough that you started.

25
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,518
You don't need to fight Kim Tak-su.

26
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:47,232
Ae-ra, after those dreadful ten years,

27
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,652
I feel like my heart is at ease
and I can finally run again.

28
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,696
Can't you just trust me now?

29
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,266
Work is work, and this is personal.

30
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,059
We should eat tteokbokki together.

31
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:29,107
How is this any different
from when we were friends?

32
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,650
You still don't listen to me.

33
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,488
-What did you say?
-Why date me if you won't listen to me?

34
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:38,408
Why kiss me? Why say you love me?

35
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,706
Hey, are you...

36
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,168
talking to yourself right now? 

37
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,506
You'll regret it after I dump you.

38
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,676
You'll be at a karaoke singing sad songs.

39
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,725
Are you really going to dump me?

40
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,687
You're really going to dump me?

41
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:12,609
Get lost.

42
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:16,696
I told you to get lost.

43
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:21,910
You were a tiny kid that used to
carry my shoe bag for me.

44
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:25,288
Even if we're dating, I'll still
teach you manners.

45
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:29,417
As for our ranking, if I'm up here,

46
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,795
you're still down here.

47
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,130
Do you understand?

48
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,222
-Hey.
-What?

49
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,849
You're good at eating tteokbokki now.

50
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,393
Is your stomach fine?

51
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:50,897
No stomachache?

52
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,859
I guess not.

53
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,541
Am I still down here?

54
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:15,421
You were just my errand boy...

55
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,871
I won this stuffed toy.

56
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:50,832
It's pink...

57
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,128
Okay.

58
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,547
What's that?

59
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,175
I have to look for new place.

60
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,846
We dated for six years.

61
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,348
It'd be weird
to suddenly act like strangers.

62
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,683
But...

63
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,811
it doesn't make sense to live so close.

64
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,730
I'm looking for a new job, too.

65
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,065
Sul-hee, why are you rushing?

66
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,652
If this is pain
that we need to go through anyway,

67
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,656
let's not drag this out like a coward.

68
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,866
Let's just...

69
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,455
take the pain in one go.

70
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,582
Sul-hee.

71
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:46,554
You don't listen to me,
but your arm is awesome.

72
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,892
I feels like a wood pillow.

73
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,276
Don't fall asleep.

74
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,320
It'd be awkward if Sul-hee finds out.

75
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,947
I'm going to leave soon.

76
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,954
Hey, instead...

77
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,082
can you sing me a song?

78
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,792
The song you sang at Daecheon.

79
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,047
-Kim Wan-sun's song?
-Yes.

80
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,592
But how do you know that song?

81
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:29,097
Dad used to sing it to me
as a lullaby.

82
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:30,973
I see.

83
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,643
I guess your dad's a fan.

84
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,895
There's no way.

85
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,316
I bet Mom sang it for him.

86
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,540
It's okay.

87
00:06:56,874 --> 00:07:00,086
My dad loved me twice as much.

88
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,172
And since Sul-hee and you were there,
it wasn't so bad.

89
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,385
You guys always let me be the leader,

90
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,470
and you two always saved the best for me.

91
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,183
I don't think you ever talked about her.

92
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,436
You wouldn't know how to miss her

93
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,354
since I've never met her.

94
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:22,233
She was never there to begin with.

95
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,612
It's just, you know...

96
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,402
Why did I bother bringing you side dishes?

97
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,280
Did she make all of these for you?

98
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,699
Did something happen?

99
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,367
It's early for a visit.

100
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,412
I came because I was worried. 

101
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:20,041
Did we do something wrong?
Why won't you answer your phone?

102
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,836
Sul-hee's also not picking up my calls.

103
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,463
Did you call her?

104
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,466
She's the one that begged to come
to your sister's housewarming!

105
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:31,594
Why did you invite her?
To make her do dishes again?

106
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,096
When did we ever make her do that?

107
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,432
Of course, you don't say it,
you just make her do it.

108
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:42,271
The more you protect her like that,
the worse it will be for her.

109
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,569
You said you'd just drop off side dishes.
Why are you cleaning the sink?

110
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,239
I'm doing it since I'm here.

111
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,785
This is why I hate it when you visit.

112
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,078
My goodness...

113
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,457
Why does that have its arms raised?

114
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,879
Just, it's getting her punishment.

115
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,090
Isn't it from Joo-man?

116
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,301
Did you two fight?

117
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:18,766
All men are the same.

118
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:22,937
You might think this one is
better than the other one.

119
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:27,358
Just be thankful he's not any worse.

120
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,318
As long as he doesn't cheat.

121
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,614
As long as they don't cheat on you,
all men are the same.

122
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,743
At least you know Joo-man
would never cheat.

123
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,664
He's very fond of you, am I right?

124
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,835
Next time, don't just come here.
Call me before you come.

125
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,713
Why? Do you think your Sul-hee
will be uncomfortable?

126
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:53,092
Does she always come to your house
and you to hers, is that why?

127
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,887
It's only your loss, your loss.
Don't go to each other's homes.

128
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:57,847
Hello.

129
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,643
How come you're here?

130
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,688
Have you been well?

131
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,523
Well, we've all been well.

132
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:16,949
Sul-hee must be very diligent.
She works and...

133
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,328
she keeps Joo-man's fridge fully stocked
with side dishes.

134
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,122
Ah, yes, yes.

135
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:28,127
Sul-hee seems to like Joo-man a lot.

136
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,672
Joo-man seems to like Sul-hee a lot, too.

137
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,216
Yes, that's right.

138
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,181
Anyway, we should have the families meet--

139
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,141
There's no rush.

140
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:45,728
But still, we have to consider
Sul-hee's age.

141
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:50,232
It's not only Sul-hee that's aging.
They're the same age.

142
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,610
Sul-hee.

143
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,988
You know Joon-hee's housewarming
is on the last day of the month, right?

144
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,574
Well, I...

145
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,243
Why would Sul-hee go there?
She's not going.

146
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:05,164
They asked her to come
because she's like family--

147
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:08,084
She's not family,
so don't order her around.

148
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:13,964
When did I ever do that?
Why would you say it like that?

149
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,093
We broke up.

150
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,393
I am sorry, Mother.

151
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:27,978
It's all my fault.

152
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,575
It's for the best.

153
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,994
You weren't all that into her. 

154
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:47,039
That's why you stalled the marriage
for six years.

155
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,418
How could I make her live
in a tiny studio?

156
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:51,794
Why should she suffer like that?

157
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,716
Is that why you couldn't get married?

158
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,970
-Did she say she wanted a house?
-Like she would.

159
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,182
I told you I won't get married
if it isn't with her.

160
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,476
My sisters must like it
since they don't get a sister-in-law.

161
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:14,233
Did Sul-hee really say
that you two should break up?

162
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,862
It's better for Sul-hee.

163
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,406
Although I won't be able to meet
someone like Sul-hee again...

164
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,577
Sul-hee is going to be
loved by any family. 

165
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,162
You know that, too.

166
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,624
Gosh, why did you guys break up?

167
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:35,421
Because I am trash.

168
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:37,673
I am.

169
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,634
Joo-man.

170
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,852
Do you want to go home?

171
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,270
It's okay.

172
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,440
I placed an air conditioner in the room.

173
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:59,153
I'm totally fine. I'm not a kid.
I won't die from a break up.

174
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,823
No wonder you weren't talking about
Joo-man.

175
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,325
What?

176
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,660
You're all about him.

177
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,080
"My Joo-man likes mixed grains drink.

178
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,208
My Joo-man gets hot easily."

179
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,794
It's always about Joo-man.

180
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,087
I did not.

181
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,804
Now, don't think about Joo-man
all the time.

182
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,683
Instead, think about yourself.
Think about what you like,

183
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,978
and what you want.
Live like that, okay?

184
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,066
You're the queen of your life.

185
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,401
Go. Hurry and go.

186
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,529
Don't cry and make sure you eat, okay?

187
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:42,988
Go.

188
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,492
Call me.

189
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,707
Hello.

190
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,709
Mom, it's our landlady.

191
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,180
Hello, ma'am.

192
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,105
Mom, aren't you going to say hi?

193
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,193
How have you been? I mean...

194
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,320
Hello.

195
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,577
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

196
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:45,885
Hey!

197
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,013
Why are you tiptoeing?
We didn't do anything.

198
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,307
Why are you acting like we did something?

199
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,559
Still, what if someone sees?

200
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,144
So what?

201
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,229
We did nothing.

202
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,441
Just say we're like army roommates.

203
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,067
What do I tell Sul-hee?

204
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,861
You should've woken me up!

205
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,780
You said you'll lie down
for just a minute.

206
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,159
You said you can't sleep
if it's not your bed.

207
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,661
I couldn't sleep.

208
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,041
Just wipe your drool.

209
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,836
Are you a dog? You sleep anywhere.

210
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,840
It's not drool. I didn't sleep.

211
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,429
Hello.

212
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,264
Hello.

213
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,102
Golden Foot and Unit 102, 

214
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,146
why are you together early in the morning?

215
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,984
You didn't come out
from Unit 102 together, right?

216
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,779
I didn't wear the Golden Foot t-shirt
today.

217
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:47,696
You're right.

218
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,823
Don't stick together
so early in the morning.

219
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,453
Are you okay?

220
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,122
Do you feel sick?

221
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,171
Why did you go alone to get LASIK?

222
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,381
Where is Nam-il today?

223
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,176
Why do I need anyone?

224
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,553
I am my own guardian.

225
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,736
Take a seat here.

226
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,405
Thanks.

227
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:38,789
Have all your things not arrived yet?

228
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,794
What's the use of things?
This is how I live.

229
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,297
You look so fancy on the outside,

230
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,634
but your house is too empty.

231
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:56,432
A house usually takes
after how the owner lives.

232
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,605
Can you even cook?

233
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,066
I'll be fine soon.

234
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,444
They said it'll hurt
only in the beginning.

235
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,512
I'm saying it's that woman!
That Rose Photo Studio woman!

236
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,850
That woman is living above the kids!

237
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:44,188
What? Rose Studio's Hwang Bok-hee?

238
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:45,981
Are you sure it's that woman?

239
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,858
I know her face!

240
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,735
I won't get confused with another face.

241
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,361
I'm sure, I tell you!

242
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:59,870
When you slept over at Dong-man's before,

243
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,414
did you really go to see Dong-man?

244
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,750
Hurry and help me put this
on the backside of my head.

245
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,461
Did you really go to see Dong-man?

246
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,381
Why are you suddenly dying your hair?

247
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,843
What are you saying?
I said help me put this on.

248
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,430
You didn't see someone?

249
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,849
Who would I see?

250
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,852
Why are you staring at me like that?

251
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,938
Hwang Bok-hee.

252
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,272
Who?

253
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,527
Rose Studio's Hwang Bok-hee.
You saw her, right?

254
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,113
Hwang Bok-hee?

255
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:38,450
Why? Did she call our house?

256
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,327
Is she looking for me?

257
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:43,997
By any chance...

258
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,209
Did Nam-il live in Seosan
when he was younger?

259
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:50,671
Why?

260
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,136
Doesn't he look familiar?

261
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,223
All babies look the same
because they have no hair.

262
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,350
Is that it?

263
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:08,188
But this person seems more familiar to me.

264
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,860
Is this you when you were young?

265
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,491
Dong-man.

266
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:35,757
You guys...

267
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,512
make me some cup ramen before you go.

268
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:42,973
Okay.

269
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,774
EXERCISE TO PREVENT BREAST CANCER

270
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:01,491
She seems all fancy on the outside,

271
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:04,244
but she's like a lonely,
old woman on the inside.

272
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,089
Why are you coming down from there?

273
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,926
-Excuse me, Mr. Kim.
-Don't.

274
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,678
Please look after your mom. 

275
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,805
On the day your mom has LASIK surgery...

276
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,100
you shouldn't be out eating chicken alone.

277
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,311
That's true, you should look
after your mom.

278
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,233
I run a chicken place.
I worked all night.

279
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,236
Oh, you sell chicken.

280
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:40,614
Why do you two care about my mom?

281
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,908
Why were you upstairs?

282
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:46,662
-We prevented her accidental death...
-Don't exaggerate.

283
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,288
And we made her a cup ramen.

284
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,500
You two must be really kind people.

285
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,503
Super nosy and so sympathetic.

286
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:59,007
You say thank you in such a rough way.

287
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,467
Let's go.

288
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,394
Be careful. 

289
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:16,275
NAM-IL LIVES IN NAMIL VILLA

290
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,529
Hey, does that guy
keep talking to you and stuff?

291
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,322
Did you tell him I'm a martial artist?

292
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,701
The way he looks at me
is a little suggestive.

293
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,035
Are you sure?

294
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,289
Last time, just for no reason, he...

295
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,124
Are you sure he was looking at you?

296
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,500
He saw you? You?

297
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:35,877
Why you little...

298
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,594
Hey, it's me.

299
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,305
Why? I'm driving right now.

300
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,683
Listen, someone saw something.

301
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,728
What are you saying? Who saw what?

302
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,731
You know,
at the place where the kids live.

303
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,941
Just get to the point!

304
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:01,653
Don't call me at work
and beat around the bush.

305
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,280
Hwang Bok-hee!

306
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,742
Rose Studio's Hwang Bok-hee!

307
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,996
Yes.

308
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,966
Did you get LASIK surgery?

309
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,428
Why don't you just wear glasses?

310
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,639
I'm not pretty with glasses.

311
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,685
I want to be pretty till the day I die.

312
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,355
Don't eat things like cup ramen.

313
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,945
Stop thinking about that kid.

314
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,198
What?

315
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:49,201
I feel upset and I want to lash out.

316
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,916
The real Nam-il...

317
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,004
lives in Namil Villa.

318
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:03,423
Right?

319
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,896
Get your head on straight.

320
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:21,483
Why are you messing up
something this simple?

321
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,154
I can't get my head on straight.

322
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,491
What? What are you talking about?

323
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,788
Oh, excuse me, your coffee's spilling.

324
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,334
Sorry.

325
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:43,004
Sul-hee's the only one missing...

326
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,384
and my whole life is falling apart.

327
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,973
Can you pick a base color
and one point?

328
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:57,686
Can you make the base pink
and the point...

329
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,689
-Make the point black, please.
-Sure.

330
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:05,485
Oh also, can you put a lot of gems on top?

331
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,446
Make it super sparkly.

332
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,865
Would you like to choose?

333
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,660
They're all priced differently.

334
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,456
Just use the most expensive ones.

335
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,415
Okay.

336
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,710
Oh, isn't this the newest model?

337
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,255
Yes,  I got it recently.

338
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:29,634
I got a new phone, so I can fill it
with new things.

339
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,858
I've scheduled you a coach
for fighting low.

340
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:48,278
So you just have to get him to fight low,
and you have a guaranteed win.

341
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:49,863
You know for certain that...

342
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,990
Dong-man only has Coach Hwang
to train with, right?

343
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,367
They both did taekwondo.

344
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,453
How would they be able to
prepare for this?

345
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,580
They have no ground skills.

346
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,583
They will probably just keep sparring.

347
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,251
Okay.

348
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:08,882
I think I'm going to die.

349
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,306
Coach, you're probably going to die
while teaching me.

350
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:21,186
No. I'll just get you a coach who
specializes in teaching how to attack low.

351
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,813
I will try to look for a part-time person.

352
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,191
You must earn a lot
from selling sausages.

353
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,985
It's peak season for sausages.

354
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,696
Since when do sausages
have a peak season?

355
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,823
Don't look for another coach.

356
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,367
Hey, stop making me talk.

357
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:41,289
I'm going to look into jiujitsu
and wrestling, so stop talking

358
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,707
and just do as I say.

359
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:51,591
How did you come here?

360
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,677
Are you here to learn
how to lose weight...

361
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:04,062
If you subscribe for three months,
we can give you a discount...

362
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,361
Hey, Byung-joo, let's end your workout
here for today.

363
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,780
Well done. 

364
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,579
So...

365
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,291
did you spend some money?

366
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,130
I tried to bribe people, but RFC's
new representative is a stickler.

367
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:33,925
He grew up abroad and I can't seem
to communicate with him

368
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:34,884
Then...

369
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,556
make him get the message.

370
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,309
Make him want to talk to me.

371
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,311
Give him something big, in large sums.

372
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,815
You're turning into a real scoundrel.

373
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:57,198
Why are you overreacting all of a sudden?

374
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,868
Lose or win. Just choose one.

375
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,704
Don't act like a scoundrel.

376
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:07,667
If a guy I trained for 15 years goes down
as scoundrel, I'll look bad.

377
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,088
Coach.

378
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,343
You should watch your words.

379
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,598
Though we're in a respected
teacher-student relationship,

380
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:25,101
we're also in an employer-employee
relationship.

381
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,519
Hey.

382
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,730
Fire me if you want.

383
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:32,776
Hey!

384
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,531
Fine, let him go. Just fire him.

385
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,367
I never liked Coach Choi.

386
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,869
-Then you leave.
-What?

387
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,287
You're replaceable. 

388
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,580
But Coach Choi...

389
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,626
isn't replaceable.

390
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:54,589
That hurts and you can always
find another coach.

391
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:58,301
Do you know why Hwang Jang-ho
is an Olympic silver medalist?

392
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,764
It's because that guy won gold.

393
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,978
John Carlos.

394
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,192
Do you know him?

395
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,824
This tattoo is their seal.

396
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:24,494
One of the best jujitsu
Brazilian families.

397
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,038
You fought the second son.

398
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:33,670
The nephew he coached at home
is John Carlos, the UFC legend.

399
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:46,307
I'm Karel. My father lost
all our family's money gambling.

400
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:51,062
We needed money for my wife's surgery,
so we had an embarrassing fight. 

401
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,732
I'm ashamed and heartbroken.

402
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,776
I will sacrifice my body to pay you back.

403
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:00,280
My nephew is better than me. Good luck.

404
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:01,781
Do you think...

405
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:06,619
UFC legend, John Carlos is going
to teach you?

406
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:07,996
I think so.

407
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,999
It's a working visa.

408
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,001
Two months.

409
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,045
Guess what, Jang-ho...

410
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:19,340
I think I might just win.

411
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,761
-Thank you.
-Thank you! Thank you!

412
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:44,282
Wow. Pink phone, pink nails,
and pink face all look like a set.

413
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:45,700
Yes.

414
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:51,623
I had a fingernail infection.

415
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,666
Of course, I don't have it now.

416
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,460
I see.

417
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,213
It made my nail a bit dented.

418
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:03,259
It was a bit embarrassing to show
 my hands when I was working.

419
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,220
-Oh, I see.
-Yes.

420
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,723
So I don't go often, but sometimes...

421
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,268
Can you...

422
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,730
keep it a secret?

423
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,693
We don't need to pinky swear.
I won't tell.

424
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:24,489
But it's awkward to leave
my hand hanging.

425
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:30,119
Then I won't tell anybody

426
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:34,916
you got your nails done
because of nail infection.

427
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:38,586
I don't have the infection anymore...

428
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:40,129
I just...

429
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,507
I know how that feels.

430
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,385
My nails are short and ugly, too.

431
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,387
That's not true. You're pretty...

432
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,347
like your hands.

433
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:50,431
Sorry?

434
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:54,018
Everything is pretty.

435
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,898
It's kind of nice that a person
who is pretty all over...

436
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:03,862
remembers my name.

437
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,574
You think I'm pretty?

438
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,077
Didn't you know?

439
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:15,540
You are really pretty.

440
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:39,647
When?

441
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,414
I'm sorry, Mr. Kim.

442
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,335
That day, it was my fault.

443
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:04,047
Ye-jin, do you want to go for a drink?

444
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,019
Come on, get up! Is that all you've got?

445
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,157
Wait...

446
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,867
Tap, tap.

447
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,535
Tap.

448
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,496
No tap, Dong-man, no tap. 

449
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,247
No tap when you're with me.

450
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:41,125
John tap, John tap. Yes, tap for me.

451
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,335
Yes, tap!

452
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:47,215
Stop, stop. Coach, help me.

453
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,512
I am...

454
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:59,519
Coach, John continues even if I say tap.

455
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:02,522
He'll kill me. He won't go easy.

456
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,899
If it's that bad, try saying it
in English.

457
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:06,317
What did you say?

458
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:09,445
If you don't know English,
you have to deal with it.

459
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,613
I can't help you.

460
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,910
Why didn't they make athletes
study back then?

461
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,788
This country really should
compensate you for that.

462
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:19,789
Dong-man.

463
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:23,292
You'll master three finishing techniques
in two months.

464
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:28,548
Three? Three? Okay.

465
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,387
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thank you.

466
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:43,646
Anyway, I am responsible
for your break up.

467
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,940
And you were swayed by me, too.

468
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,778
It'll be hard for you right now...

469
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,072
but I'll wait.

470
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,450
Ye-jin.

471
00:33:57,326 --> 00:34:01,664
After a while, I might be able to meet
someone other than Sul-hee.

472
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,876
But even then, it won't be you.

473
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:07,587
Sorry?

474
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,089
Why not?

475
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:14,052
You'll keep reminding me of her,
so how could I date you?

476
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,345
What do you mean?

477
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,475
It's not like I couldn't date you
because of her.

478
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,602
I was swayed by you
because of Sul-hee.

479
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:26,064
You reminded me of Sul-hee in the past.

480
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,149
When you broke the copier,
got into an accident 

481
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,568
and got your skirt ripped
when you were drunk...

482
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,863
I couldn't ignore you completely.

483
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:38,618
I think I broke it again.

484
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,412
Why do I always cause trouble?

485
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,249
Why do I always cause trouble?

486
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:48,711
I like you you more and more!
I want your attention!

487
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:53,091
I like you you more and more!
I wanted you to look at me!

488
00:34:57,303 --> 00:35:02,100
So you're saying that you never liked me.

489
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,352
It was my mistake.

490
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:12,985
I broke up with Sul-hee,
but I have no intention of dating you.

491
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,488
I wanted to meet you to say this.

492
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:45,935
You shouldn't date at the sausage truck.

493
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,695
The date has already been set.

494
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,991
I'm turning 30 next year...

495
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:04,370
I think I should finish my 20s
with passion.

496
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:12,336
There is no guarantee
that I'll fight better next year...

497
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,634
Let's just go for it.

498
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,933
Ae-ra doesn't like it!

499
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,894
I don't want you to do it.

500
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:31,814
Don't talk about passion
or anything nonsense.

501
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,367
Dong-man is upset.

502
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:49,999
Ae-ra keeps telling Dong-man not to fight.

503
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:53,920
I makes me really, really upset. Upset!

504
00:36:54,503 --> 00:37:00,259
HE'S MAD AT AE-RA BECAUSE
SHE WON'T LET HIM FIGHT

505
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,016
Dong-man, I'm holding a knife.

506
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,451
RESULTS OF CHEONGJU
KBC ANNOUNCER INTERVIEW

507
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,040
YOU HAVE PASSED THE FINAL INTERVIEW

508
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,376
What?

509
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,879
Why did they pass me?

510
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,174
I caused a scene, so why?

511
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,099
Ae-ra.

512
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,769
What is it?

513
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,771
No, I mean...

514
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,274
What is it?

515
00:37:56,357 --> 00:38:01,112
The address was on the GPS.

516
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:07,201
That was because Dong-man was on the show,
and I didn't give him the gift card.

517
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:11,038
I got his address to send him by mail.

518
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,875
So I wanted to talk to him.

519
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,544
Talk about what?

520
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,254
He won't be on your show.

521
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,467
Take this first.

522
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:26,095
These are fruits. There are strawberries.
You like strawberries.

523
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,440
Since that day, I don't eat strawberries.

524
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:41,610
Ae-ra.

525
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,864
I'm not the same Jang Kyung-koo anymore.

526
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,366
I really wanted to see you and Dong-man...

527
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:51,037
I don't believe that people change.

528
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,164
Don't ever come here again.

529
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,550
This is so annoying.

530
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,145
Hey, let's push for the show to air.

531
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:19,690
I'll take responsibility,
so just go ahead and do it.

532
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:24,779
Seriously, don't cry.

533
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,739
I'm going to make fun of you

534
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:29,408
until your third grandson
becomes an adult.

535
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:32,536
Why?

536
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,955
What? Why?

537
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,208
Do you feel like you're going to die?

538
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,043
Are you heartbroken?

539
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,837
You know how people say
you have a diaphragm...

540
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,340
but you don't feel or have any problems
with it.

541
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,759
So, you don't know it's there.

542
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,887
It's like that's suddenly gone.

543
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:52,556
I can't breathe...

544
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,850
What's with this diaphragm talk?

545
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,602
Did you go to medical school?

546
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,854
If you lose your diaphragm, you'll die.

547
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,314
It's a scary thing.

548
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,197
-Diaphragm...
-Don't act like you know it.

549
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:12,576
I know how that feels.

550
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,580
No, he doesn't know.
He's been single since birth.

551
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,292
Can't use? What? I can use it, too.

552
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,919
I can use it, too. I'm a total fan.

553
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,170
I meant...

554
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,424
See, he doesn't have a clue.
He was always single.

555
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,552
Let's drink.

556
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,303
Let's drink.

557
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:39,645
He really likes sausages.

558
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,489
What are you doing?

559
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:53,701
I'm hungry.

560
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,789
Can't you be more like yourself
and be bold?

561
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,292
Be cool and give me your support.

562
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,842
I was never cool.

563
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:13,095
When I think about you getting beat up
by Kim Tak-su,

564
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,181
my insides squirm.

565
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,476
Can't you just not do it?

566
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:22,146
You had moved on and you forgot
about him.

567
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,232
Don't fight Kim Tak-su again.

568
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,651
I never forgot about him,
not for a single day.

569
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,112
What?

570
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:33,866
I acted like I forgot,
doing the many odd jobs.

571
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,785
Even when I was dead tired...

572
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:40,873
I kept dreaming about November 3rd, 2007.

573
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:45,085
I'm always in that same arena...

574
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:49,173
and I always lose to Kim Tak-su.

575
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,926
I'm always on the ground,
and I don't get up.

576
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:54,553
Hey.

577
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:55,846
And when I wake up...

578
00:41:57,264 --> 00:42:00,559
I pretend to forget
and just get up to go to work.

579
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:05,064
I've been circling around in a fish tank
like a goldfish.

580
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:11,195
I acted like I wasn't thinking,
just killing ticks everyday.

581
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,823
You're the simplest person I know...

582
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:17,076
Why didn't you tell me you were suffering?

583
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:22,122
It took me ten years to stand
in the ring again.

584
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,710
Just let me do it, please?

585
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,673
You're such a pain.

586
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,426
Why did I have to move to Seosan
when I was six?

587
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,595
I should've moved to Dangjin.

588
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:48,232
If you want to quit, just walk out.

589
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:50,526
Come out and call me.

590
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:53,195
No matter where you are,
I'll find you in an hour.

591
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,323
I wish you were a man.

592
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:01,203
Hurry up.

593
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,833
But Ae-ra...

594
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,753
You two shouldn't date.

595
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,048
-What?
-All men and women change.

596
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:16,343
I don't want you two to end up like us.

597
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:21,265
To me, you guys look really cute.

598
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:32,860
Open up.

599
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:48,167
Don't mess around.

600
00:43:55,341 --> 00:44:01,639
Hurry, hurry.

601
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,060
What about Sul-hee?

602
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,354
She went to work.

603
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,105
Is she okay?

604
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:11,815
Of course not.

605
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:16,945
I feel so bad for her,
I can't tell her about us.

606
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,865
I couldn't tell Joo-man either.

607
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,498
But what are you going to do
about Jang Kyung-koo?

608
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:31,085
I'll talk to him and decline the offer.

609
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,213
Then what about Kim Tak-su?

610
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:40,260
I didn't ask for a kiss.

611
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:45,557
So you have the interview today?

612
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:47,893
Is it really what you want to do?

613
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,145
Don't change the subject.

614
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:52,856
If you really fight him,
I won't see you anymore.

615
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:56,068
Don't even dream about kissing. Got it?

616
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:02,533
I don't need you to do anything for me.

617
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:11,625
Get in.

618
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,713
-Pardon?
-I'll take you.

619
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:19,174
You don't know where I'm going.

620
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:22,386
Wherever you're going, I'll take you.

621
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,055
Why?

622
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:28,058
I'm interested in you.

623
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,395
It's bothering me...

624
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,065
but it's also interesting.

625
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:38,402
My boyfriend is a martial artist.

626
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:39,653
I see.

627
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,321
And I'm a psycho.

628
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:45,242
Oh, a psycho.

629
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:48,579
And I hate handsome and rude guys.

630
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,247
Am I handsome?

631
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:54,001
Anyway, I'm not interested in you at all.

632
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,753
You never know.

633
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,090
You might end up seeing me forever.

634
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,634
Have you been drinking?

635
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,687
Ladies and Gentlemen.

636
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:19,443
In a few minutes, Korea's MMA Tournament
is scheduled to begin here.

637
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:22,571
Welcome and thank you for attending.

638
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:26,450
Everyone's hearts race
after a tournament ends.

639
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:29,119
The announcer who says the first words,

640
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:32,164
must be passionate like no other.

641
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:57,397
My things, please.

642
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:38,689
This bamboo salt spray is really good
for rhinitis.

643
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:40,983
This has bamboo salt only, right?

644
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,530
Ouch! Seriously!

645
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:48,532
What is it?

646
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,451
-It stings.
-Does it hurt?

647
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:48,425
I just want to enjoy the small things
with you,

648
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,510
-and love--
-Small things?

649
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,182
Small things...

650
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:00,103
Why does happiness have to be small?

651
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:29,091
The small things that Sul-hee said,
and that kind sacrifice...

652
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:34,137
after all was not small,
it filled the house.

653
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:56,159
-Explain this.
-What?

654
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:59,621
We lived together for so long,
yet these are all your belongings?

655
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:03,125
All the clothes are my t-shirts
and you have boxes of my razors stocked!

656
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:06,044
But why do you only use free samples?

657
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:09,548
I hate how you're like this!

658
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:12,843
Seeing you do this
made me want to get promoted,

659
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:16,304
and work even harder,
so you won't act so poor.

660
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,724
Did I ever ask for that?

661
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,142
Did I say that mattered?

662
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:22,102
It didn't matter to you, but it did to me!

663
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:25,230
Yes, I'm sure it did.

664
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:31,486
Your fellow bloggers all live
in nice houses with nice kitchen sinks.

665
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,156
They bake cookies in a good oven,

666
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:36,199
and you leave comments
that their houses are nice.

667
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,870
So did I ever say I was jealous?

668
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:41,955
I just hated that!

669
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:45,459
That's why I found all those businesses
with popular items,

670
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:48,545
and worked hard to make commission.

671
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:52,507
To you, I must be just a burden.

672
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:55,761
Is that why you delayed our marriage
for six years?

673
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,597
Sul-hee.

674
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,809
How could I make you live in a studio?

675
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:12,903
Even if I can't give you luxury...

676
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:16,323
I wanted to at least give you the average.

677
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:21,328
It hurt my pride so much,

678
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:25,749
to say something this pathetic.

679
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:30,587
But I just wanted to have a small lease
to start with.

680
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:31,505
But...

681
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,552
even though I worked for six years,
that average...

682
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,726
That average is too hard to reach.

683
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:41,658
Is it Nam-il?

684
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,790
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

685
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:52,043
-Thank you.
-That should be right.

686
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:57,465
Why don't you ever pick up the bowl
from upstairs?

687
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:01,136
-I always have.
-What?

688
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,764
-She orders everyday.
-I see.

689
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,183
Why do you ask?

690
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,480
If you know her, it'd be better
if you ordered together.

691
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,024
She always orders just one bowl.

692
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:17,402
Have you ever seen her?

693
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:21,364
She pays on the app and says to leave it.

694
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:23,909
She hasn't been ordering
the past few days.

695
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,037
Let's go in.

696
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:32,042
-Enjoy!
-Thank you!

697
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:38,840
Obba.

698
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:49,059
What is this?

699
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:52,229
You said you'd never return.

700
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,397
What are you thinking?

701
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:56,900
I never planned to come back.

702
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:01,780
Can't you see how desperate I am?

703
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:21,258
I got a text from Cheongju KBC
for the final round of interviews.

704
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:24,261
RFC also contacted me
that I made the final round.

705
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:28,181
Maybe we should've celebrated tonight.

706
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:31,351
But then, both are on Friday.

707
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,521
What are you going to do?

708
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:38,441
I don't know. I have to think about it.

709
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:43,947
Is that for Sul-hee?

710
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:45,323
Sul-hee doesn't feel well.

711
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:48,868
-Then Joo-man?
-Why would I give this to him?

712
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:51,121
Don't tell me...

713
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:56,876
Yes, to the lady upstairs.

714
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,717
Obba.

715
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:20,025
What do you think you're doing?

716
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:23,069
What brings you here?

717
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:37,292
Who is it this time?

718
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,085
Ma'am.

719
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:46,843
Maybe she's out.

720
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:51,556
Do we need to act like no one's home?

721
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:53,224
No.

722
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,937
She's here, the lights just went out.

723
00:55:58,855 --> 00:55:59,814
You're right.

724
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:02,776
You idiot!

725
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,495
Is the doorbell broken?

726
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:18,083
Ma'am! Delivery!

727
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,422
Why? What is it?

728
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,092
Let us bring this in.

729
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:28,802
-No!
-Excuse me.

730
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:32,555
What's wrong with you guys!

731
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:35,809
It's awkward to just order one bowl.

732
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:38,686
-I never asked for this.
-Do you dip or pour the sauce?

733
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:40,897
-Pour.
-I see.

734
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:48,321
But is there anybody else here?

735
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,658
What are you talking about?

736
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:54,702
Isn't Nam-il home?

737
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:58,832
Nam-il? Yeah. Is it Nam-il?

738
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:10,301
What's going on? Why are they here?

739
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:19,602
Why?

740
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,647
It seems like someone else is here.

741
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:30,905
Why do I have to hide in here with you?

742
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,532
It hurts my pride.

743
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,827
I feel the same way.

744
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:40,540
You should leave.

745
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:41,583
Just stay here.

746
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:47,213
Last week, the next neighborhood
also got robbed.

747
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,656
Pull your toes in.

748
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:55,365
You have a really strong
survival instinct.

749
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,792
Why couldn't she go home to sleep?

750
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:08,086
Why is she torturing me?

751
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:12,882
How does she fall asleep
so easily anywhere?

752
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,652
Aren't you going to go home?

753
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:34,404
Wake up!

754
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:37,031
You'll get mosquito bites!

755
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:48,626
Ouch!

756
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:24,996
