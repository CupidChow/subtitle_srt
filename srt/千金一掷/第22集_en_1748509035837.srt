How to manage your contacts

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,480
Open the services menu

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:26,860
biological

4
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,220
Plus, they're ones of Gen AMY and Sisant.

5
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,960
How much socialized Sister obstacles we know?

6
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,040
Not to mention any dreams and ambitions,

7
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,900
the dreamt decent ones.

8
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,080
Let's make it Chor-Ã¤ll.

9
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,560
Yes, tres.

10
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,780
Hey.

11
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,060
Gen.

12
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,060
Episode 16

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,500
Young Master Mo, it's him.

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,060
He ruined our plan last time.

15
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,260
Sorry, Young Master Mo.

16
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,380
As the saying goes,

17
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:06,780
we should never fight.

18
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,060
If there was no misunderstanding last time,

19
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,220
I wouldn't have known

20
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,780
that we have a common enemy.

21
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,620
You mean,

22
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,380
a golden finger?

23
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,860
I said it with open arms.

24
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,060
I'm here today

25
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,660
to support you.

26
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,660
I know you're going to take part in the charity poker game.

27
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,260
You also want to win the right to run the Sun Family's casino.

28
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,460
If you can help me get the right to participate,

29
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,260
I'll be happy to help you.

30
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,460
I'll be happy to help you.

31
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,260
I'll be happy to help you.

32
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,260
I, Mu Kun,

33
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,260
can win the game.

34
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,260
There are rumors in the world that you once won the gambling god.

35
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,060
But I've never seen your ability.

36
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,060
Why should I believe you?

37
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,860
Do you still have a choice?

38
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,260
Since I can make the gambling god lose once,

39
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,860
I've never won

40
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,060
until the explosion.

41
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,060
Not to mention, I've never seen any

42
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,060
of your skills.

43
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,260
Young Master Mu,

44
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,460
I'm the only one who knows the weakness of the golden finger.

45
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,060
You help me get the right to participate.

46
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,260
I'll help you get the golden finger.

47
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,660
Let's get to know each other.

48
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,260
I've already killed the old man of the Naiwen family.

49
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,460
I have all the property under their family.

50
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,060
If I help Young Master Mu win the game

51
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,860
and get the right to run the casino of the Sun Family,

52
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,660
then in the whole world,

53
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,060
the gambling industry

54
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,660
will be only you and me.

55
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,860
Good.

56
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,860
I can make up for the money and people you lost.

57
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,860
As long as you help me win the golden finger,

58
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,860
I can satisfy you with anything you want.

59
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,860
I'm not wrong.

60
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,860
See you.

61
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,860
Young Master Mu,

62
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,860
do you really believe him?

63
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,860
Is it that important to believe or not?

64
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,860
It's just spending some money to buy a insurance.

65
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,860
Little Pengsai,

66
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,860
you have a lot of problems today.

67
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,860
Did you get scared by the golden finger

68
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,860
and wait to go to him

69
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,860
to report it?

70
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,860
Young Master Mu, you're thinking too much.

71
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,860
It's definitely not like that. I swear.

72
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,860
Come on.

73
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,860
Of course I believe you.

74
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,260
How about this?

75
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,860
You can't go to the casino.

76
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,860
You can't go to the casino.

77
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,860
How about this?

78
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,860
You leave Laiwan immediately

79
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,860
so that the golden finger knows

80
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,860
that you are a traitor to me.

81
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,860
If you are thrown into the sea,

82
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,860
it will be difficult to escape.

83
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,860
I'll listen to you, Young Master.

84
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,860
I'll go back and pack up today.

85
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,860
I'll leave here tomorrow morning.

86
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,860
Ye Changmengduo,

87
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,860
you leave now.

88
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,860
Now?

89
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,860
Don't worry.

90
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,860
My people will escort you

91
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,860
and leave you safely.

92
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,860
No.

93
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,860
Young Master Mu, you...

94
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,860
Where are you taking me?

95
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,860
Young Master, you can't go to the casino,

96
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,860
right?

97
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,860
Tell K to bring the key.

98
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,860
Come in.

99
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,860
Miss.

100
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,860
Uncle Pasha, sit down.

101
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,860
I have something to tell you.

102
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,860
I can't sit and wait anymore.

103
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,860
Mu Panpi has attacked me twice.

104
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,860
But

105
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,860
before I find him

106
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,860
and transfer the assets,

107
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,860
I'll take action

108
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,860
and lose more.

109
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,860
Then you shouldn't be in a hurry.

110
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,860
Didn't you hear the doctor?

111
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,860
You are not in good health.

112
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,860
There's a big fluctuation recently.

113
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,860
So you must have a good rest.

114
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,860
I've found the murderer

115
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,860
who killed my parents.

116
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,860
What?

117
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,860
Yes.

118
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,860
That person is

119
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,860
Mu Kun.

120
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,860
Mu Kun?

121
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,860
Good luck.

122
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,860
Thank you.

123
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,860
You came to me

124
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,860
because you remembered who I am?

125
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,860
Miss Sun,

126
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,860
I'm here to cooperate with you today.

127
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,860
I received the news

128
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,860
that Mu Kun and Mu Panpi have joined hands

129
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,860
and decided to participate in the charity poker contest.

130
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,860
They achieved the goal of controlling the whole Sun Group.

131
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,860
Mu Kun is the real murderer who killed my master.

132
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,860
Now we have the same enemy.

133
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,860
So

134
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,860
it's the best choice

135
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,860
for us to cooperate.

136
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,860
How do you want to cooperate?

137
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,860
I want to get the shares of Sun Group

138
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,860
so that I have the right to enter the game.

139
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,860
I want to defeat him in the charity poker contest

140
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,860
and make him famous.

141
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,860
So you came to the casino of Sun Group.

142
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,860
The price is reasonable.

143
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,860
You can go.

144
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,860
I won't give you the shares.

145
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,860
I have a piece of evidence

146
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,860
that can point you to the illegal transfer of assets in the group.

147
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,860
Miss Sun,

148
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,860
you forced me to do this.

149
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,860
Now

150
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,860
I want all your shares.

151
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,860
What?

152
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,860
If you don't give me the shares,

153
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,860
you'll be caught

154
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,860
and kicked out.

155
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,860
Mr. Jin,

156
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,860
you are the third member of Sun Group.

157
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,860
You are upright and not evil.

158
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,860
Now

159
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,860
I want you to help me verify

160
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,860
whether there is illegal transfer of assets in the group.

161
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,860
Yes.

162
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,860
When necessary,

163
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,860
you can transfer the shares I gave you to the closed line.

164
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,860
Okay.

165
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,860
I'll give you the authorization later.

166
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,860
The surveillance camera was deleted.

167
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,860
Go to the president's office computer

168
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,860
and check if there are any traces.

169
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,860
I don't know.

170
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,860
I don't know.

171
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,860
I don't know.

172
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,860
I don't know.

173
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,860
I don't know.

174
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,860
I don't know.

175
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,860
I don't know.

176
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,860
I don't know.

177
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,860
I don't know.

178
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,860
I don't know.

179
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,860
I don't know.

180
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,860
I don't know.

181
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,860
I don't know.

182
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,860
I don't know.

183
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,860
I don't know.

184
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,860
I don't know.

185
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,860
I don't know.

186
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,860
I don't know.

187
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,860
I don't know.

188
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,860
I don't know.

189
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,860
I don't know.

190
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,860
I don't know.

191
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,860
I don't know.

192
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,860
I don't know.

193
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,860
I don't know.

194
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,860
I don't know.

195
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,860
I don't know.

196
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,860
I don't know.

197
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,860
I don't know.

198
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,860
I don't know.

199
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,860
I don't know.

200
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,860
I don't know.

201
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,860
I don't know.

202
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,860
I don't know.

203
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,860
I don't know.

204
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,860
I don't know.

205
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,860
I don't know.

206
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,860
I don't know.

207
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,860
I don't know.

208
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,860
I don't know.

209
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,860
How can he unlock my computer?

210
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,860
How did he get my fingerprint?

211
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,860
My Qianqian

212
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,860
I used your computer and your ì¸ organay to sell company assets.

213
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,860
Once this case is found

214
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,060
I'll see how you come to beg me.

215
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,260
Hello, Pachashu.

216
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,460
You call all the directors to the group now.

217
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,780
I got the evidence of Mo Panbi's transfer of assets.

218
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,020
We must stop him immediately.

219
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:35,980
Miss.

220
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,700
Where are the other directors?

221
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,700
Where's Qianqian?

222
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,940
Are you waiting for someone?

223
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,500
Don't wait.

224
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,580
They won't come.

225
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,940
Mo Panbi?

226
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,260
What's going on?

227
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,900
You should explain it to me.

228
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,380
K.

229
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,780
I'm sorry, Miss.

230
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,980
Pachashu.

231
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,620
Mo Panbi bought you off too?

232
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,460
Now you finally know

233
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,540
why I can handle every step you take in advance.

234
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,260
You...

235
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,020
Come back.

236
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,180
Mo Panbi.

237
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,260
You're a traitor.

238
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,060
Have you ever thought about

239
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,220
what others can do?

240
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,660
Why should I think about them?

241
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,460
I've been handling these years.

242
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,500
But I have to share the money

243
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,980
with those old men.

244
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,300
Why are you so obsessed with

245
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,380
making money that you shouldn't make?

246
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,980
Money that I shouldn't make?

247
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,500
What's money that I shouldn't make?

248
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,100
Because I'm not like Sun?

249
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,460
If I'm not like Sun,

250
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,020
should I be trampled by you?

251
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,100
So much trouble to get to know you.

252
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:45,940
So I got behind

253
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,060
all the evidences.

254
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,060
I'm sorry.

255
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,060
Since you've already sold the cards,

256
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,060
then sign it.

257
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,060
Give up the group's casino management,

258
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,060
so I don't have to go around the circle

259
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,060
to gamble with you.

260
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,060
I'm done.

261
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,060
Damn it!

262
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,060
You're right.

263
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,060
K,

264
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:31,060
you're the daughter of our Sun family.

265
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,060
If you come again,

266
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,060
I don't want to see you again.

267
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,060
You're right.

268
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,060
Thank you, bro.

269
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,060
Take a rest.

270
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,060
Come on.

271
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,060
Come on, bro.

272
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,060
Come on.

273
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,060
Come on.

274
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,060
K,

275
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,060
K,

276
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,060
K,

277
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,060
Just listen to me.

278
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,060
Don't move.

279
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,060
I'll let you go in a hurry.

280
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,060
I'm sorry.

281
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,060
I'm sorry.

282
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,060
I'm sorry.

283
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,060
I'm sorry.

284
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,060
I'm sorry.

285
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,060
I'm sorry.

286
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,060
I'm sorry.

287
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,060
I'm sorry.

288
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,060
I'm sorry.

289
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,060
I'm sorry.

290
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,060
I'm sorry.

291
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,060
I'm sorry.

292
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,060
I'm sorry.

293
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,060
I'm sorry.

294
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,060
I'm sorry.

295
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,060
I'm sorry.

296
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,060
I'm sorry.

297
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,060
I'm sorry.

298
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,060
I'm sorry.

299
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,060
I'm sorry.

300
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,060
I'm sorry.

301
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,060
I'm sorry.

302
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,060
I'm sorry.

303
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,060
I'm sorry.

304
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,060
I'm sorry.

305
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,060
I'm sorry.

306
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,060
I'm sorry.

307
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,060
I'm sorry.

308
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,060
I'm sorry.

309
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,060
I'm sorry.

310
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,060
I'm sorry.
