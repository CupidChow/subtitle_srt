hot glue

00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,820
I fill in the model

End.

00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,800
Dead person can't make a sound

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:01,800
Brother, how about we change place and chat?

13
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,800
Change what place? Isn't this place pretty good?

14
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,800
The child is beside us.

15
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,800
The child looks more exciting.

16
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,800
You...

17
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,800
Stop!

18
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,800
It's not safe here. Let's go!

19
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,800
Le Le, let's go!

20
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Let's go!

21
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,800
Dad, you're hurt!

22
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,800
Thank you, Le Le.

23
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,800
You're hurt!

24
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,800
Sit down first. I'll get you some gauze.

25
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,800
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,800
Go and watch the cartoon first.

27
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
Why did you lie to me? Who are they?

28
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
Why did they kill you?

29
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,800
I didn't lie to you.

30
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,800
My name is Xia Zhi. Your name is You Hou Yuan.

31
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,800
But I'm not that man.

32
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
Le Le is not my daughter.

33
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,800
Believe us.

34
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,800
We never wanted to lie to you.

35
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,800
We just wanted you to help us leave Laiwan.

36
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Because...

37
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,800
Because you're the only one we can rely on.

38
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Dad, don't you want us anymore?

39
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,800
Don't worry. I'll take you to leave Laiwan safely.

40
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Thank you, Dad.

41
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,800
Thank you for saving us.

42
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,800
You're still badly injured.

43
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,800
I'll change your clothes and take a bath later.

44
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,800
You must know my true identity, right?

45
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,800
I think you don't know it well.

46
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Hello?

47
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Miss, where are you now?

48
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
I'm at Lao Jian.

49
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Why are you there? Why didn't you tell me?

50
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,800
I asked around.

51
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,800
The Mokuan address Mo Panbi found is here.

52
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Miss, you don't have to participate in the charity competition, do you?

53
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,800
Since good luck can't be used for us, we can only look for Mokuan.

54
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,800
Miss, come back soon. It's too dangerous.

55
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
Qianqian.

56
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,800
You're here.

57
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Why are you here?

58
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,800
Because I didn't find Mokuan.

59
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,800
I gave you a fake address on purpose to trick you.

60
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
Boring.

61
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Let's go.

62
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,800
Mo Panbi, you're so good.

63
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,800
You actually bought through the people around me.

64
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Since you're here,

65
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,800
then sign the marriage agreement.

66
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,800
I'll let you go back after signing it, okay?

67
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,800
I'm afraid you forgot your previous appointment.

68
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,800
Don't mention the marriage agreement again.

69
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,800
Besides, I already have a fiance.

70
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
Stop pretending.

71
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,800
Who doesn't know that he has a wife?

72
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,800
How could he be your fiance?

73
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
What if I don't sign it?

74
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,800
I'll give you a face, right?

75
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,800
Do you have a choice?

76
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
Qianqian.

77
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,800
Qianqian.

78
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,800
I'll have a chance today.

79
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,800
I'll go change some cash.

80
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
Be careful.

81
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,800
Qianqian.

82
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
You're following me again.

83
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
Help me. Someone is chasing me.

84
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
Stop. Don't run.

85
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
This way.

86
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
What are you doing?

87
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
What are you talking about?

88
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Don't run.

89
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,800
Stop.

90
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Stop.

91
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
Stop.

92
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
This way.

93
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
What path did you choose?

94
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
You chose this path, too.

95
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
Run.

96
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Run.

97
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
You go that way.

98
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,800
You two follow me.

99
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,800
Go.

100
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
Follow me.

101
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,800
Take off your clothes.

102
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
What?

103
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,800
Are you crazy?

104
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,800
If you don't take off, I'll take off.

105
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,800
Where is he?

106
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
Where did he go?

107
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,800
This way.

108
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,800
Why does this picture look familiar?

109
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,800
Yes.

110
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,800
Stop.

111
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,800
Miss Sun.

112
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,800
Sir, what's wrong?

113
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,800
Sorry, we got the wrong person.

114
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Sorry.

115
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,800
Miss, do you have time to make an appointment?

116
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
Go.

117
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Keep chasing.

118
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
Sorry.

119
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
Go.

120
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,800
Go that way.

121
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,800
Go.

122
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
It's safe now.

123
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
You can come out.

124
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
I saved you just now.

125
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
Why did you hit me again?

126
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
You saved me, so you should see what you should see.

127
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
Be careful, I'll dig your eye.

128
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
I had no choice just now.

129
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,800
Okay, I have something else to do.

130
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,800
I'll draw it back.

131
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Let me see.

132
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800
Stop it.

133
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,800
If you hit me again, I'll hit you.

134
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,800
Then you swear.

135
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,800
If you see other women's bodies in the future,

136
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,800
you'll dig your eyes.

137
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,800
Okay, I swear.

138
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,800
If I see other women's bodies in the future,

139
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,800
I'll dig my eyes.

140
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,800
That's more like it.

141
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,800
Let's go back and change.

142
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,800
Wait.

143
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
Wait.

144
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,800
Something's wrong.

145
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
This is the boat ticket for this afternoon.

146
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
These are for the boat.

147
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,800
You and Le Le should pack up.

148
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
No hurry.

149
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
We still have time before departure.

150
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,800
It's better to leave early.

151
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,800
Where's Le Le?

152
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,800
Didn't you always want to find your memories?

153
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,800
I'll take you to a place.

154
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,800
It's up there.

155
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,800
Wait.

156
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,800
What's wrong?

157
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
This is for you.

158
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,800
What's this?

159
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,800
Didn't Le Le always want to eat this?

160
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
Although I'm not Le Le's father,

161
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,800
after getting along with her,

162
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
I like Le Le very much.

163
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
What's wrong?

164
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,800
Nothing.

165
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,800
Let's go.

166
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
Let's go.

167
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,800
The sky is clear, all for me

168
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
Falling like a hot sword

169
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,800
The midnight smoke gently changes

170
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,800
Become the last winner

171
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:12,800
Before dawn, use a machine to turn the night

172
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,800
I walk in the sky to see the sky

173
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,800
It's a mirror, it's my tenderness

174
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,800
I was going to leave the power to break through

175
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,800
But fate took it all for me

176
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,800
The sky is clear, all for me

177
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,800
Falling like a hot sword

178
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,800
The sky is clear, all for me

179
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Falling like a hot sword

180
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,800
The midnight smoke gently changes

181
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,800
Become the last winner

182
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:58,800
Before dawn, use a machine to turn the night

183
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
The night is over

184
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
The night is over

185
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
The night is over

186
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,800
The night is over

187
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,800
The night is over

188
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,800
The night is over

189
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,800
The night is over

190
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,800
The night is over

191
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
