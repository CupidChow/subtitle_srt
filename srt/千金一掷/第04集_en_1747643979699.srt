1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
It is very smooth

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:26,360
If the

3
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,120
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,840
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:59,320 --> 00:00:59,960
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,680
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,480
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,280
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,120
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,960
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,040
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,080
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,800
So you're No Yi.

15
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,680
Why are you interested in

16
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,080
playing in my casino today?

17
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,360
I'm not here to see you.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,880
I'm here

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,560
to see him.

20
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,880
No Yi,

21
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,400
what do you think?

22
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,360
This car is a present

23
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,680
for you

24
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,760
from our casino.

25
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,720
How about

26
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,240
this?

27
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,920
I heard that Miss Sun's fiance

28
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,480
is a disciple of the gambling god.

29
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,600
I'm here to have a match with him.

30
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:11,960
How about this?

31
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,280
Let's have a bet.

32
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,520
If I win,

33
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,720
Miss Sun will

34
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,040
transfer this casino

35
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,800
to the name of Mopan.

36
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,640
If you win,

37
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,080
I can give you a casino.

38
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,920
Or do you want something else?

39
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,120
I...

40
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,920
I...

41
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,760
Thank you, No Yi.

42
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,240
But No Yi,

43
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,840
compared to the casino,

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,240
I hope you can help my fiance

45
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,680
reveal the lie

46
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,480
that he claims to be a disciple of the gambling god.

47
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,840
If you're not a disciple of the gambling god,

48
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,440
then you're lying to my fiance.

49
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm going to pull your tongue out.

50
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,000
Wait,

51
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,800
why did you drag me into this again?

52
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,440
Don't go.

53
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,600
Mopan,

54
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,080
who is your fiance?

55
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,000
You're not my fiance.

56
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,080
You're not my fiance.

57
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,480
You just want to get

58
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,880
our casino, right?

59
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,120
Fine.

60
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,560
Let's have a bet today.

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,640
But if you lose this time,

62
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,920
from now on,

63
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,400
don't use the so-called engagement to make things worse.

64
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,200
Come on, let's go.

65
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,240
What are you doing?

66
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,000
If you win this game for me today,

67
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,200
I can agree to any conditions.

68
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,080
I said

69
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,480
I can beat you up.

70
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,320
But I can't.

71
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,840
If you win this game for me today,

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,520
I'll give you the whole street.

73
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,080
No way.

74
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,160
Haoyue,

75
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,480
I heard that

76
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,440
the one who hates you the most is Du Bo.

77
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,800
You don't want him to know

78
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,520
that you're in the casino, do you?

79
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,640
Look.

80
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,200
The people in Mopan

81
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,880
will send all the photos out tonight.

82
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,560
Tomorrow,

83
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,400
everyone will know that you're in the casino.

84
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,360
Including Hao Jingjing.

85
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,160
Miss Sun,

86
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,480
you're making me jump.

87
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,640
I don't know what those reporters want.

88
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,680
But if you help me win this game,

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I can make all the reporters

90
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,840
shut up.

91
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,840
Boss,

92
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,360
the oil bomb before

93
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,800
is still alive.

94
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,760
Did the man who dumped the bomb

95
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:41,840
and Thrashtop

96
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,840
This person cannot come back alive.

97
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
Yes.

98
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,840
Get up.

99
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,840
Get up.

100
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,840
Sign this and you can leave.

101
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,840
Okay.

102
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,840
This...

103
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,840
This is a strange agreement.

104
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,840
Since you don't want to sign,

105
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,840
Come on.

106
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,840
Take him back to the dead room.

107
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,840
My money! My money!

108
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,840
My money! My money!

109
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,840
Tell me, what do you want to play?

110
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,840
You just swung the dice and won so much money.

111
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,840
Just play the game.

112
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,840
You look down on me.

113
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,840
Okay.

114
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,840
Then I'll play the game.

115
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,840
Miss, we can't win this time.

116
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,840
You just came back.

117
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,840
If you lose the casino, it will be hard to explain.

118
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,840
What do you mean?

119
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,840
Luo Yi belongs to the technical team.

120
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,840
I'm afraid he's a little more dangerous this time.

121
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,840
He's the one I chose.

122
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,840
I've been through everything.

123
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,840
Think of a way later.

124
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,840
Yes.

125
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,840
It's a firefly.

126
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,840
It's your turn.

127
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,840
Open it.

128
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,840
Open it.

129
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,840
He can really do it.

130
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,840
Yes.

131
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,840
What a pity, Luo Yi.

132
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,840
Didn't let Luo Yi continue to win this game.

133
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,840
He's the second uncle.

134
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,840
Prepare the car and send Luo Yi back.

135
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,840
Yes.

136
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,840
Wait.

137
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,840
What?

138
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,840
Luo Yi wants to go back?

139
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,840
Qianqian, don't worry.

140
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,840
I remember Luo Yi said she would lose if she left.

141
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,840
But Luo Yi didn't lose.

142
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,840
So no one left.

143
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,840
Hao Yun, I haven't lost yet.

144
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,840
Some people want to send me away.

145
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,840
You were lucky just now.

146
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,840
We were bigger.

147
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,840
You won 6-6.

148
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,840
How about we win this game?

149
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,840
Maybe Luo Yi wants to use the dragon earth orb.

150
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,840
Dragon earth orb is Luo Yi's best job.

151
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,840
There are not many people who can do it.

152
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,840
It seems that Hao Yun is going to lose.

153
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,840
What is dragon earth orb?

154
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,840
Dragon earth orb is to put all the dice on a line through the centrifugal force.

155
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,840
It's not that hard.

156
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,840
It's not hard to put it on a line.

157
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,840
But the second dice on it.

158
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,840
The number of points of the second dice must be one.

159
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,840
Because only the hole with one point can make the dice on the top spin.

160
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,840
If you put it on any side, it means there is no point.

161
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,840
No point?

162
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
Yes.

163
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,840
This is why Luo Yi chose to be smaller.

164
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,840
Because no matter how lucky you are, there is no point.

165
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
Oh, no.

166
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,840
Please.

167
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,840
Please.

168
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
Why don't you shake it?

169
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,840
Are you afraid you can't shake it?

170
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,840
Let me go.

171
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,840
Let go, Hao Yun.

172
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,840
Jingjing, why are you here?

173
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,840
They didn't do anything to you, right?

174
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,840
I'm fine.

175
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,840
I'll be back in a minute.

176
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,840
You are gambling?

177
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,840
Jingjing, let me explain.

178
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
I'm so stupid.

179
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,840
I'm still telling you to stop gambling.

180
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,840
Jingjing.

181
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
And you are gambling.

182
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,840
Let me explain.

183
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,840
Give me back my glasses.

184
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,840
You want my glasses?

185
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,840
You can gamble with me.

186
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,840
You forced me.

187
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,840
That's right.

188
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,840
Be good.

189
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,840
You lost.

190
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,840
I cannot accept the reward from you.

191
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,840
She can kill you.

192
