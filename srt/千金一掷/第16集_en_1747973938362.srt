1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,700
Let's show our new

2
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:22,740
Customizing inside

3
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,740
The first step is to make the first hole in the box.

4
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:32,740
The first hole is to make the second hole in the box.

5
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,740
The second hole is to make the third hole in the box.

6
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,740
The third hole is to make the fourth hole in the box.

7
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,740
The fourth hole is to make the fourth hole in the box.

8
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,740
The fourth hole is to make the fourth hole in the box.

9
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,740
Sorry, Lele is in their hands.

10
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,740
I've already brought the person according to your request.

11
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,740
Where is my child?

12
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,740
Don't worry.

13
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,740
I'll hide you all together later.

14
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,740
You'll meet soon.

15
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,740
You don't believe me.

16
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,740
Where did you hide my child?

17
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,740
You really don't think that

18
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,740
you can give the disciples of the ancestors to us?

19
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,740
You can live.

20
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,740
No way.

21
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,740
Stop it.

22
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,740
Don't move.

23
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,740
Don't move.

24
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,740
Thank you.

25
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,740
If you really want to thank me,

26
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,740
then get divorced quickly.

27
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,740
If you want to be my son-in-law,

28
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,740
then you're the one who should be the one to come.

29
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,740
How can you lie to me?

30
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,740
The child suddenly disappeared.

31
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,740
His behavior is very abnormal.

32
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,740
I'm not a fool.

33
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,740
Can't you see that?

34
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,740
You'll know when you get there.

35
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,740
Is Lele in danger?

36
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,740
Where did you hide Lele?

37
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,740
Tell me where Lele is!

38
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,740
How dare you?

39
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,740
You don't even want to know where your daughter is.

40
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,740
I beg you.

41
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,740
Where is Lele?

42
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,740
I can't lose her anymore.

43
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,740
I beg you, okay?

44
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,740
Get up first.

45
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,740
I beg you.

46
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,740
Get up.

47
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,740
Leave it to me.

48
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,740
What are you looking at?

49
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,740
I'm telling you.

50
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,740
You can't get any news from me.

51
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,740
Don't worry.

52
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,740
It's as simple as eating.

53
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,740
You're a fool.

54
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,740
Go.

55
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,740
Go.

56
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,740
Go.

57
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,740
Go.

58
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,740
Here.

59
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,740
It's gone.

60
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,740
Put me off.

61
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,740
In case Mu Kun finds it later,

62
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,740
you'll have to kneel and beg for forgiveness.

63
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,740
Don't be so busy.

64
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,740
We're here to mess with you.

65
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,740
We're talking about the meaning.

66
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,740
I told you.

67
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,740
I can't tell you anything.

68
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,740
Or...

69
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,740
Or you can sleep with me.

70
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,740
It's not a big deal.

71
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,740
I might tell you something.

72
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,740
I usually treat criminals with three ways.

73
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,740
The first is the way to torture the spirit.

74
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,740
For example, you drop it.

75
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,740
You grab it and let it sleep for days.

76
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,740
You'll have to test it when it's the most fragile.

77
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,740
It's usually a long time.

78
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,740
I can't wait.

79
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,740
The second way is my favorite.

80
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,740
For example, you torture it with your body.

81
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,740
It'll feel the pain of the body.

82
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,740
It'll make the criminals feel bad.

83
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,740
But this method is usually more difficult to handle.

84
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,740
It's hard to tell.

85
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,740
This method is really ugly.

86
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,740
I don't like it.

87
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,740
I'll give you a brief introduction.

88
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,740
Do you know that the blood pressure is about 7%?

89
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,740
It's about 8% for a muscle like you.

90
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,740
You might not know that

91
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,740
if the blood pressure is 1.3%, it'll die.

92
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,740
I'll let you understand

93
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,740
the pain of the dead.

94
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,740
What are you doing?

95
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,740
I'm preparing the O-shaped blood.

96
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,740
I'll put blood on one side and write it down.

97
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,740
But before that,

98
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,740
I'll add a procedure for you.

99
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,740
When you write it down,

100
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,740
I'll let it cool down and give you a warm-up.

101
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,740
If you can hold it for an hour,

102
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,740
even if I'm a man,

103
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,740
you...

104
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,740
Don't say that.

105
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,740
I haven't started yet.

106
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,740
That's boring.

107
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,740
Xin Li, I'll leave it to you.

108
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,740
Yes.

109
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,740
Let's go.

110
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,740
Miss Nuoyi,

111
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,740
I was not a good person before.

112
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,740
I was too rude.

113
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,740
I was too gentle.

114
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,740
What's wrong? You were scared?

115
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,740
Don't worry. I can't bear to see you.

116
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,740
Can you ask me a question?

117
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,740
How did you know

118
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,740
that you're a girl?

119
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,740
I studied in the hospital.

120
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,740
He's so fast.

121
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,740
Interesting. He just got it.

122
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,740
Save the child first.

123
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,740
Okay.

124
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,740
Mom!

125
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,740
My child!

126
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,740
Let me see if you're hurt.

127
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,740
It's okay.

128
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,740
It's okay.

129
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,740
Here, Lele. Sit here.

130
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,740
Hao Yan.

131
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,740
Thank you.

132
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,740
It's okay.

133
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,740
Thank you.

134
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,740
It's okay.

135
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,740
It's good that you're safe with Lele.

136
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,740
You're not a real couple.

137
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,740
Just a little bit.

138
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,740
I can't bear to see Lele.

139
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,740
I haven't brought her any good food these days.

140
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,740
If you really can't bear to see Lele,

141
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,740
you should give her a birthday present.

142
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,740
Thank you.

143
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,740
Oh, Hao Yan.

144
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,740
I have to say

145
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,740
that I'm sorry

146
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,740
that you're a girl.

147
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,740
I'm sorry.

148
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,740
Can you tell me everything now?

149
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,740
Actually, I'm not sure.

150
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,740
I just know that you're very good at gambling.

151
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,740
Hao Yan, leave here.

152
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,740
And go somewhere else to live.

153
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,740
Lele, let's go.

154
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,740
Bye, dad. Bye, auntie.

155
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,740
Dad! Dad!

156
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,740
Listen to me.

157
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,740
Dad! Dad!

158
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,740
They're really useless.

159
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,740
You're now a treasured gold snake.

160
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,740
How can I catch them?

161
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,740
Dad, I have a way.

162
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,740
I can get the gold paper out.

163
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,740
Say it.

164
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,740
There's a guy called Hao Yan.

165
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,740
He's a bad guy.

166
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,740
He always comes to our bar to play and loses gold.

167
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,740
So...

168
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,740
Hao Yan is in their place.

169
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,740
And Hao Yan is very close to his daughter.

170
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,740
If we can get his daughter out,

171
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,740
we'll definitely get her out.

172
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,740
Okay.

173
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,740
Let's change our ways.

174
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,740
We should be together.

175
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,740
When we get her out,

176
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,740
Hao Yan will of course bring her to us.

177
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,740
Hao Yan, I'm sorry.

178
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,740
I'm sorry.

179
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,740
I'm sorry.

180
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,740
I'm sorry.

181
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,740
I'm sorry.

182
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,740
I'm sorry.

183
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,740
I'm sorry.

184
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,740
I'm sorry.

185
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,740
I'm sorry.

186
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,740
I'm sorry.

187
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,740
I'm sorry.

188
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,740
I'm sorry.

189
