1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,740
So I'm turning down this gift for you...

2
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,580
LOL

3
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,960
Why don't you tell me that you're heading back with all the presents?

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Why don't you say it?

5
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,160
No.

6
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,600
Why are you here at this time of night?

7
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,920
Now everyone knows

8
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,920
you are the perfect son-in-law of our Sun family.

9
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,840
You are a playwright.

10
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,160
But you have to be a full-time actor.

11
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,680
Otherwise, the ink tablet

12
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,600
will be stuck in your mouth like a dog's skin.

13
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,360
So?

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,880
So,

15
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,720
you pretend to be my husband

16
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,880
and move to my house.

17
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,640
That's impossible.

18
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,240
I will never leave here.

19
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,760
Okay.

20
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,080
Then help me to participate in the poker competition.

21
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,960
I don't want to choose either of them.

22
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,040
You don't want to choose either?

23
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,360
Okay.

24
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,400
Then,

25
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,080
I will leave some traces here

26
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,080
to make your husband

27
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,880
think you have another woman.

28
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,160
No.

29
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,080
Why are you all like this?

30
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,120
You?

31
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,240
No.

32
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,440
You can't stay here.

33
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,160
Okay.

34
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,400
If you don't choose either,

35
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,000
I will go back

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,240
and get the property rights of this restaurant back.

37
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,040
How can you do this?

38
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,720
Didn't you promise me

39
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,720
to give me the restaurant back?

40
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,920
How can you go back on your word?

41
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,040
What's wrong with me going back on my word?

42
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,360
Didn't you say

43
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,240
you don't like the things you got back?

44
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,960
You...

45
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,680
You...

46
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,440
You...

47
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,400
You...

48
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,920
If there's nothing else,

49
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,880
I'll go first.

50
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:36,960
Okay.

51
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,960
I promise you.

52
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,480
What promise?

53
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,440
Promise to bet with me.

54
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,840
What are you thinking?

55
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,000
Of course I will pretend to be your husband.

56
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,000
Don't mention it anymore.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,600
I will never touch you.

58
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,480
Okay.

59
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,400
You won't touch me?

60
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,720
Didn't you promise me to bet with me?

61
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,680
You promised me?

62
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,080
I'm trying to deal with him.

63
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,840
Who are you trying to deal with?

64
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,120
Enough.

65
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,120
What do you want me to do?

66
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,320
Haoyun.

67
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,080
You're not a shallow person.

68
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,640
You're the one who's always

69
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,800
in a rush to date someone.

70
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,200
Aren't you afraid of being killed by a demon?

71
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,880
Haoyun.

72
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm not talking about you.

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,120
Miss Sun is so rich

74
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,320
that she wants to marry you.

75
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,200
You only care about Jingjing.

76
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,040
How can you let her marry you?

77
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,600
You know that

78
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,560
you're not the one she loves.

79
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,000
You even stole her from someone else.

80
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,720
You...

81
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,000
Are you ashamed?

82
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,160
Who said I stole her?

83
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,160
Say it again.

84
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,920
I'll say it again.

85
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,640
You stole her.

86
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,240
Enough.

87
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,720
Don't argue with your sisters here.

88
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,680
When Jingjing comes back

89
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,520
and sees you here,

90
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,080
how can I explain?

91
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,800
Shut up.

92
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,680
Tell me.

93
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,520
Are you lying to her or me?

94
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,840
Of course I'm lying to you.

95
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,120
People say they don't bet.

96
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,560
How dare you lie to me?

97
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,120
I'm not lying to you.

98
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,200
Then you're lying to me.

99
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm not lying to you.

100
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,760
You're playing tricks on us.

101
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,800
Are you betting on me

102
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,200
or pretending to be a couple with her?

103
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,880
How about we talk somewhere else?

104
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,880
No.

105
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,600
You have to give me an explanation today.

106
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,760
Or I won't leave.

107
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,680
Why are you so taciturn?

108
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,320
Don't interrupt me.

109
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,320
I'm talking to you.

110
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,480
Brother Chaoyue, are you here?

111
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,400
Oh no.

112
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,920
Jingjing is really back.

113
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,520
Why don't you hide in the toilet first?

114
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,120
I don't believe you.

115
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,120
I don't believe you either.

116
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,120
Okay.

117
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,200
I promise you.

118
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,760
Then make it clear.

119
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,920
What do you promise?

120
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,920
I promise to be your husband.

121
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,960
I promise to bet with you.

122
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,960
Okay.

123
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,440
Something's wrong.

124
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,360
Okay.

125
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,360
Don't bother me again.

126
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,120
Okay.

127
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,640
Hurry up.

128
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
Okay.

129
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,880
Brother Chaoyue.

130
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,640
I'm going to the toilet first, Jingjing.

131
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,640
Hurry up.

132
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,640
I want to go to the toilet too.

133
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,840
I'm having a stomachache.

134
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,400
I think it's smelly after using it.

135
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,080
Don't be silly.

136
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,240
Don't worry.

137
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,240
I'll wait for you.

138
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,640
What do you mean?

139
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,840
Nothing.

140
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,040
It's not like some people

141
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,080
are irresponsible

142
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,640
to achieve their goals.

143
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,640
It's really boring.

144
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,640
Don't say that.

145
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,240
Just say I'm lucky.

146
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,240
Good luck is here.

147
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,240
You ask him.

148
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,240
Do you have it?

149
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,240
No.

150
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,240
I'll ask Jingjing.

151
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,240
Don't talk.

152
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,240
You're the only one who's irresponsible.

153
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,240
I'm not.

154
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,240
I'm not.

155
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,240
I'm not.

156
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,240
I'm not.

157
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,240
I'm not.

158
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,240
I'm not.

159
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,240
I'm not.

160
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,240
I'm not.

161
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,240
Don't talk.

162
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,240
Brother Chaoyue.

163
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,240
Brother Chaoyue.

164
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,240
What's wrong?

165
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,240
Actually, I want to

166
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,240
make it clear to you.

167
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,240
You've been

168
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,240
in contact with Miss Sun?

169
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,840
No.

170
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,840
Absolutely not.

171
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,240
Actually, I want to say

172
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,240
Miss Sun is a good person.

173
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,840
If she has any chance to find you,

174
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,240
you must hold on to her.

175
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,240
Yes.

176
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,840
Miss Sun is a good person.

177
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,840
But I still want to

178
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,240
keep my business away from her.

179
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,840
But you have to think about it.

180
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,440
Miss Sun is a good person.

181
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,440
We worked so hard to get this restaurant.

182
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,440
She gave it to us directly.

183
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,440
She even gave us

184
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,440
such a good house behind the restaurant.

185
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,440
It's hard for us to get in touch

186
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,440
with a top-class person like her.

187
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,440
So,

188
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,440
you have to hold on to her.

189
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,440
It's not good to gamble.

190
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,440
But I believe

191
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,440
you have the ability to control yourself.

192
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,440
You won't be like my father.

193
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,440
I understand, Jingjing.

194
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,440
Actually, I don't want to gamble.

195
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,440
I have my own reasons.

196
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,440
I will support

197
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,440
Brother Good Luck's decision.

198
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,440
As long as there is a better future,

199
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
Brother Good Luck will always

200
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,440
be by my side and help me.

201
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,440
Right?

202
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,440
I only have Brother Good Luck.

203
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,040
I only have Brother Good Luck.

204
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,640
Only Brother Good Luck.

205
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,640
Don't talk.

206
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,440
What's that sound?

207
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,440
I'm fine.

208
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,240
Can I ask Brother Good Luck a question?

209
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,640
What do you think of me?

210
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,640
Very good.

211
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,040
What's good?

212
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,040
So diligent, hard-working, and cute.

213
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,840
Is it good?

214
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,840
Yes.

215
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640
What about

216
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,640
Miss Sun?

217
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,240
I know.

218
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,240
Miss Sun is a good housekeeper and a beautiful person.

219
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,240
Will Brother Good Luck still think I'm pretty?

220
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,240
Of course.

221
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,240
Why are you yelling so loudly?

222
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,240
Don't you believe me?

223
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,240
Then,

224
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,240
among the girls I've seen,

225
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,240
which one is my ranking?

226
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,240
First.

227
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,240
First.

228
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,240
You.

229
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,240
I...

230
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,240
Then I'm second and third.

231
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,240
That's not what I meant.

232
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,240
Is that so?

233
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
Don't hit me.

234
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,240
Stop hitting me.

235
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,240
Stop hitting me.

236
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,240
Hush.

237
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,240
What's that sound?

238
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,240
No sound.

239
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,240
Is there someone else inside?

240
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,240
No.

241
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,240
Brother Good Luck, why did you lock the door?

242
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,240
The door lock seems to be broken.

243
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,240
I can't open it.

244
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,240
Then, wait.

245
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,240
I'll go find the key to save you.

246
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,240
What should I do?

247
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,240
Jingjing is getting up.

248
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,240
Hurry up and find a place.

249
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,240
Hurry up.

250
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,240
Jingjing is getting up.

251
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,240
Please hide.

252
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,240
It's so small here.

253
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,240
How can we hide?

254
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,240
Brother Good Luck, I'm coming.

255
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,240
Come on, my lucky star.

256
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,240
Use it to get back the big fire.

257
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,240
Let this golden paradise

258
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,240
burn down for me.

259
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,240
The midnight smoke is gently changing.

260
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,240
Become the last winner.

261
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,240
Before dawn,

262
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,240
use the magic of the magic circle.

263
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,240
The magic circle is full of the color of the night.

264
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,240
Stop me.

265
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,240
Look at the sky.

266
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,240
It's a mirror.

267
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,240
It's the gentleness of the armor.

268
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,240
I was going to use my power to break through.

269
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,240
What if fate takes me down?

270
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,240
The night is still young.

271
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,240
Let's get back the big fire.

272
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,240
Let this golden paradise

273
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,240
burn down for me.

274
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,240
The midnight smoke is gently changing.

275
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,240
Become the last winner.

276
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,240
Before dawn,

277
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,240
use the magic circle.

278
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,240
The magic circle is full of the color of the night.

279
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,240
The midnight smoke is gently changing.

280
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,240
Become the last winner.

281
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,240
The midnight smoke is full of the color of the night.

282
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,240
The midnight smoke is full of the color of the night.
