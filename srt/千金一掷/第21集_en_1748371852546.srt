1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Ahh that's Gods language

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,080
I hope you enjoy this video

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,120
Keep craving

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,200
A few minutes to be old

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,600
Tony Insta

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,520
academy

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:15,780
anidot

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:26,800
and

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,980
accepting foolish and reckless action

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,000
is not obviously a payment

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,680
However,

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,020
she prepared herself

13
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,180
but she could be too someone for people

14
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,480
who can't be tried

15
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,860
So I tried to witness

16
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,280
a vile act

17
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,240
ç¨±teness

18
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,760
As for the other visited

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,760
is the golden finger.

20
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,760
Golden finger?

21
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,760
I'm just giving you an example.

22
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,260
You're bragging, but you don't even look at the occasion?

23
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,260
You guys are really interesting.

24
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,260
You invited me over

25
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,760
and you're asking me to go back?

26
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,260
Who would invite you here?

27
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,260
And look,

28
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,260
today, Miss Sun isn't here.

29
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,260
No one is going to wipe your ass.

30
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,260
If you can't get the invitation,

31
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,260
get out of here.

32
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,260
The invitation for the golden finger?

33
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,760
Why is it with you?

34
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,760
Is it really the golden finger?

35
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,260
Impossible.

36
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,760
Her invitation must be faked.

37
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,760
A low-class worker like her

38
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,760
would do such a despicable thing.

39
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,760
But what is her purpose?

40
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,760
To destroy your relationship with Jin Jin.

41
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,760
I'll scare her to death.

42
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,760
She's a real French-born white-collar.

43
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,760
Of course.

44
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,760
Seine-Hoe.

45
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,760
Seine-Hoe. I've been there.

46
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,260
Isn't this the village's son-in-law?

47
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,760
Yes.

48
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,260
In order to get into the family,

49
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,260
he lied to people that he was the golden finger.

50
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,760
He's shameless.

51
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,260
He's here.

52
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,260
Isn't he afraid of being exposed?

53
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,760
I'll pay you back when I get there.

54
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,760
Don't touch it.

55
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,760
This is the gift for the golden finger.

56
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,260
What will you pay me with?

57
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,760
My life.

58
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,760
How is it?

59
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,760
Not bad, right?

60
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,760
The price is just a number.

61
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,260
I can afford it.

62
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,760
Let's not be so familiar with that old man.

63
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,760
I guess he's never seen these gifts in his life.

64
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,260
Of course.

65
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,260
That's right.

66
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,260
Tonight, all the guests are rich and wealthy.

67
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,260
I think you'd better be a good waiter.

68
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,260
Otherwise, I'll break your legs.

69
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,260
What are you going to do?

70
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,760
Take him away.

71
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,760
Otherwise, it's too embarrassing.

72
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,260
Leave him alone.

73
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,260
He likes to pretend.

74
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,260
Let me see how he'll die today.

75
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,260
That's right.

76
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,260
It's not a big deal to be rich and wealthy.

77
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,260
You little bastard.

78
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,260
Do you believe I won't let you out?

79
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,260
I said I was leaving.

80
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,260
Okay, I'll teach you a lesson.

81
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,260
You'll be the one to kowtow.

82
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,260
How dare you!

83
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,260
Who dares to do that?

84
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,260
Sister Nuoyi.

85
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,760
I think you should be the one to kowtow.

86
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,760
Sister Nuoyi.

87
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,760
Even if she's Nuoyi's girl,

88
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,760
she can't be rude to us.

89
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,760
We're from Laiwan.

90
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,760
We have our identity and status.

91
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,760
That's right.

92
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,760
Even if we don't break her legs,

93
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,760
she can't be so rude to us.

94
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,760
Of course.

95
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,760
If you don't want to do business in Laiwan,

96
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,760
you can try.

97
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,760
Why is there another woman?

98
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,760
She's lucky to have a good life.

99
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,760
I...

100
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,760
I'm leaving.

101
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,760
Let's go.

102
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,760
Let's go.

103
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,760
I think this is Miss Nuoyi.

104
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,760
I'll remember your kindness today.

105
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,760
Haoyun, where have you been?

106
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,760
Our casino was blown up.

107
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,760
Even my father...

108
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,260
Even my father died?

109
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,260
Yes.

110
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,260
Miss Nuoyi, please accept my condolences.

111
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,260
Haoyun, what's wrong?

112
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,260
I heard that Miss Nuoyi is very passionate.

113
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,260
We just met for less than a minute.

114
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,260
We don't have to be so close.

115
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,260
Haoyun, are you pretending to be a?

116
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,260
I don't know what you're talking about.

117
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,760
I was hurt a few days ago.

118
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,760
If we had a relationship before,

119
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,760
I'll tell you when I'm done.

120
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,760
Haoyun.

121
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,760
Mokun.

122
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,760
Haoyun,

123
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,760
why are you like a different person?

124
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,760
Stop.

125
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,760
Where are you going?

126
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,760
I'm going to leave this stage to Jin Shouzhi.

127
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,760
Don't make trouble here.

128
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,760
Hurry up and go.

129
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,760
I'm talking to you.

130
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,760
Tonight is very important to me.

131
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,760
I don't have time to be here with you.

132
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,760
Where are you going to stay?

133
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,760
Fine.

134
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,760
Let the host come to me today.

135
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,760
Big Gongcai.

136
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,760
Did I give you a face?

137
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,260
Don't be so mean.

138
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,260
He even faked Jin Shouzhi's invitation.

139
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,260
You have to teach him a lesson.

140
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,260
Haoyun,

141
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,260
apologize to them.

142
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,260
Miss Hao,

143
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,260
please remember.

144
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,260
First, I'm not Haoyun.

145
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,260
My name is You Haoyun.

146
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,260
Second, I'm not a waiter.

147
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,260
I'm the disciple of the God of gambling.

148
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,260
I don't care what you call Haoyun.

149
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,260
Come on.

150
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,760
Come here.

151
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,760
Nuoyi,

152
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,760
your father is dead.

153
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,760
You still have time to do this?

154
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,760
My father died of an accident.

155
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,760
But my family is still alive.

156
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,760
I want to see who dares to do it today.

157
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,760
I'll see if you can save him today.

158
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,760
Break his arms and legs.

159
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,760
Throw him out.

160
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,760
Go.

161
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,760
Go.

162
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,760
Wait.

163
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,760
This is a legal document

164
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,760
that has already signed the name.

165
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,760
It can prove

166
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,760
that Haoyun is the disciple of the God of gambling,

167
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,760
Jin Shouzhi.

168
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,760
After this legal document was signed,

169
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,760
he has inherited all the assets of the God of gambling.

170
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,760
My name is You Haoyun.

171
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,760
I'm the disciple of the God of gambling,

172
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,760
Jin Shouzhi.

173
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,760
I officially announce

174
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,760
that I'm back.

175
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,760
Look.

176
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,760
This young talent

177
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,760
looks so cool.

178
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,760
We were so blind just now.

179
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,760
I didn't know you were Jin Shouzhi.

180
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,760
I prepared all these gifts for you.

181
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,760
You can give me whatever you want.

182
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,760
That's right.

183
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,760
I don't want

184
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,760
these things.

185
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,760
We don't want these things.

186
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,760
We prepared other things for you.

187
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,760
I want you to disappear.

188
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,760
Then we'll go.

189
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,760
We'll go.

190
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,760
Go home.

191
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,760
We'll go.

192
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,760
This is the cash you asked me to prepare.

193
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,760
I'll give you the money.

194
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,760
Thanks to your help,

195
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,760
I was beaten,

196
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,760
beaten to death,

197
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,760
and I had to help you, you evil ghost.

198
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,760
It doesn't matter.

199
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,760
But you

200
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,760
look down on me.

201
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,760
No, no.

202
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,760
You don't believe me.

203
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,760
Now the money is here.

204
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,760
Do you want it

205
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,760
or not?

206
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,760
Yes.

207
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,760
It's so hard.

208
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,760
It's not suitable.

209
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,760
From today on, my daughter, Hao Jingjing,

210
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,760
is the woman

211
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,760
who is the golden finger, You Haoyun.

212
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,760
Dad.

213
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,760
You're a good girl. Don't eat the meat.

214
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,760
Hao Yinggang,

215
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,760
I'm sorry for being rude.

216
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,760
Money.

217
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,760
Money.

218
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,760
Money.

219
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,760
Luo Youqian, get up.

220
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,760
It's embarrassing.

221
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,760
Leave me alone.

222
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,760
Golden finger is my brother.

223
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,760
Misunderstanding.

224
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,760
Actually, I always

225
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,760
treat Jingjing as my little sister.

226
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,760
I was just being rude.

227
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,760
You're not as good as me.

228
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,760
Look, right?

229
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,760
Who is your brother?

230
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,760
You can ask me not to care about you.

231
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,760
You can ask me not to care about you.

232
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,760
You can ask me not to care about you.

233
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,760
You can ask me not to care about you.

234
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,760
I want you to get out

235
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,760
with Hao Jingjing.

236
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,760
Otherwise, you will know

237
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,760
the consequences.

238
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,760
You're so careless.

239
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,760
You're so careless.

240
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,760
I'll take them away tomorrow.

241
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,760
I'll take them away today.

242
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,760
Go.

243
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,760
It's all mine.

244
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,760
I'm so happy.

245
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,760
I came back

246
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,760
for one thing.

247
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,760
I'm going to make it clear.

248
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,760
My master, Dusen,

249
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,760
didn't lose to anyone.

250
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,760
It's Mu Kun who slandered me

251
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,760
and killed my master.

252
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,760
So, I will

253
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,760
defeat Mu Kun

254
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,760
in the charity competition

255
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,760
of the Sun Group

256
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,760
and prove my master's innocence.

257
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,760
He's really a thug.

258
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,760
He's really a thug.

259
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,760
But I found out that he lost his memory.

260
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,760
Look, No Yi and Jingjing

261
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,760
don't know each other.

262
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,760
Is it possible that Sun Yiqian

263
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,760
doesn't remember him?

264
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,760
I don't care who he remembers

265
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,760
and who he doesn't remember.

266
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,760
I just want to ask him why he

267
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,760
slandered Mu Kun

268
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,760
in the charity competition of the Sun Group.

269
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,760
Do they have the right to do that?

270
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,760
If you want to participate in the competition,

271
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,760
you must have

272
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,760
1% of the shares of our group.

273
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,760
But now Sun Yiqian

274
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,760
doesn't transfer the shares.

275
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,760
What's going on?

276
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,760
Young Master Mo, someone outside the door wants to see you.

277
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,760
No one is here.

278
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,760
He said he could help you

279
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,760
to deal with Jin Shouzhi.

280
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,760
Who?

281
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,760
Young Master Mo, it's him.

282
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,760
He ruined our plan last time.

283
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,760
I'm here to take back the rules.

284
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,760
Let this golden heaven

285
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,760
fall down

286
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,760
for me.

287
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,760
The fifth month

288
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,760
is coming to an end.

289
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,760
I'm the last winner.

290
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,760
Before dawn,

291
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,760
I'll use my skills

292
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,760
to turn the night

293
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,760
into a bright color.

294
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,760
I'm the one who

295
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,760
can see through the

296
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,760
sky.

297
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,760
I'm the one who

298
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,760
can control the world.

299
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,760
I'm the one who

300
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,760
can control the world.

301
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,760
I'm the one who

302
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,760
can control the world.

303
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,760
I'm the one who

304
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,760
can control the world.

305
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,760
I'm the one who

306
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,760
can control the world.

307
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,760
I'm the one who

308
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,760
can control the world.

309
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,760
I'm the one who

310
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,760
can control the world.

311
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,760
The fifth month

312
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,760
is coming to an end.

313
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,760
I'm the last winner.

314
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,760
Before dawn,

315
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,760
I'll use my skills

316
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,760
to turn the night

317
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,760
into a bright color.

318
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,760
Thank you for watching!
