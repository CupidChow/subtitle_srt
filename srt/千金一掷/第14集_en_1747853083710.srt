1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,380
1. In the Floral단is-Radiulus Phone

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,440
2. All phone white pieces have got the same shape as the pattern

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,760
3. In the Floraldamos-Hani Consumers Case

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,920
4. All 3 physical parts have the same design

5
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:28,020
5. Where should be the shredded side that was at the very top?

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:45,880
From the

7
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,980
Men Т

8
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,580
I have sent people

9
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,200
You found the whereabouts of King of the

10
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,200
Empire, Mu Kun.

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,200
Even Goddess Du can't defeat him.

12
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,420
Now,

13
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,120
you have no chance to win.

14
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,200
The best choice for you is

15
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,540
to marry me.

16
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,460
It's too early to talk about winning or losing.

17
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,460
Even if you become the chairman,

18
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,200
you can't be rude to me.

19
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,040
Because my surname is Sun.

20
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,700
This is Sun's chicken leg.

21
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,420
Miss,

22
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,120
don't drink too much.

23
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,920
What a useless man!

24
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,920
You really underestimated him.

25
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,080
Pasha.

26
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:54,920
Yes.

27
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,220
Go and help me investigate a woman named Xia Zhi.

28
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,260
Who?

29
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,800
The woman who was lucky today.

30
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,540
Miss,

31
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,540
I don't know if I should say it or not.

32
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,840
Destroying someone's family...

33
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,300
Don't think too much.

34
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,540
I have my own plan.

35
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,680
You should go.

36
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,760
Yes.

37
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,920
I'll go.

38
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,260
He's really a man.

39
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,040
Don't joke.

40
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,220
We can't win this big brother.

41
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Let's talk about it later.

42
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,180
Well, Jin Jin.

43
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,960
I've called them.

44
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,300
I've asked them to release him.

45
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,300
I'll go first.

46
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,920
Mr. Peng, you can't go.

47
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,300
You must help me.

48
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,800
I've already tried my best to help you, Jin Jin.

49
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,800
What we need to do now is to be patient.

50
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,680
Wait a little longer, okay?

51
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,260
Wait a little longer.

52
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,300
Hurry up!

53
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,920
I just sent someone to send a letter.

54
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,800
They said they were back, right?

55
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,880
Where is Princess Hanyun?

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Where is she?

57
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,300
I didn't see her.

58
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,760
How is that possible?

59
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,920
She was...

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Jin Jin.

61
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,920
A working man.

62
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,800
How can he call you dad?

63
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,300
Only Mr. Peng can do this kind of thing

64
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,260
that can save people from danger.

65
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,840
And let me tell you, Jin Jin.

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,540
Your biggest problem is that you're too kind.

67
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,220
And you always make others

68
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,720
as kind as you.

69
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
That's not good.

70
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,920
Mr. Peng.

71
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,680
I'm so grateful to you, Mr. Peng.

72
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,180
Thank you so much.

73
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,420
Mr. Peng is here.

74
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,920
Help me to be a witness today.

75
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,920
Hao Youqian.

76
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,420
I asked someone to save your life today.

77
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,920
It's a way to repay your kindness to me.

78
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,500
From now on,

79
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,340
we're not going to be friends.

80
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,040
I, Hao Jin Jin, will never have a father like you.

81
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,420
You... What did you say?

82
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,420
I said we're no longer a father and daughter relationship.

83
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,420
From now on, I don't want to be friends with you.

84
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,500
I... I...

85
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,420
I'll beat you to death.

86
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,500
Go ahead.

87
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,500
Hao Youqian.

88
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,500
Okay.

89
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,620
Okay.

90
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,700
Okay.

91
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,880
I deserve it.

92
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,880
Who are you hitting?

93
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,760
Are you okay, Jin Jin?

94
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,500
Don't be so hard on yourself.

95
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,080
You're confused.

96
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,840
Wipe it.

97
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,260
Come back and rest.

98
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,880
So you're confused now.

99
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,340
Never again, Hao Youqian.

100
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,760
They're wondering.

101
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,760
I'm aware of it.

102
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,200
I'm sorry to hear that.

103
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,080
Who is Hamstead's father?

104
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,360
It's also a fire

105
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,760
where these two defend themselves against all the devils.

106
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,760
It's already good enough to find such a place to live.

107
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,760
What am I doing besides being your man?

108
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,760
You're a messenger.

109
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,760
A messenger?

110
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,760
But why do I have so many gambling skills?

111
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,760
Do I have any other friends?

112
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,760
Can you take me to see them?

113
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,760
Dad, I'm hungry.

114
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,760
Yes, we haven't eaten yet.

115
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,760
Dad, we haven't eaten for a day.

116
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,760
Do we want to eat first?

117
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,760
Husband.

118
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,760
Thank you.

119
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,760
Eat more vegetables.

120
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,760
I'm very sorry.

121
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,760
I really don't remember what happened before.

122
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,760
If you hadn't found me,

123
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,760
I don't know how long I would have made you hungry.

124
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,760
Husband, eat more vegetables.

125
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:27,760
I'm very satisfied that we can be together now.

126
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,760
Why did you seal the window so tightly?

127
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,760
Because we want to avoid Uncle Bad.

128
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,760
Uncle Bad?

129
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,760
Le Le, don't talk nonsense.

130
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,760
The thing is,

131
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,760
Laiwan has been in a mess lately.

132
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,760
And the security is not good.

133
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,760
You told me to prepare more.

134
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,760
I'm sorry to have you guys involved.

135
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,760
Husband, let's buy a boat ticket tomorrow and leave Laiwan.

136
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,760
Tomorrow?

137
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,760
Where?

138
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,760
Home.

139
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,760
This way, we can help you find your memories earlier.

140
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,760
Okay.

141
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,760
Go to bed early.

142
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,760
How did we sleep before?

143
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,760
I mean sleep.

144
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,760
Not that.

145
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,760
I sleep inside.

146
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,760
You sleep outside.

147
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,760
Judging from his face,

148
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,760
he must be an honest person.

149
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,760
House is full of deaf!

150
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,760
So beautiful.

151
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,760
He couldn't keep it in a good mood.

152
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
If I were him,

153
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,760
Will he find out that I'm lying to him?

154
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,760
What are you doing?

155
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,760
You guys should sleep on the bed. I'm used to sleeping on the sofa.

156
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
I'm going to sleep.

157
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,760
Wait for me here. I'm going to meet someone.

158
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,760
The snake is coming soon. Where are you going?

159
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,760
I'm afraid that I'll be late for this trip. I don't know when I can come back.

160
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,760
I want to say goodbye.

161
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,760
Okay, you go. We'll wait for you here.

162
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,760
Here.

163
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,760
I'll be right back.

164
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,760
Hi.

165
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,760
Come up.

166
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,760
I'm not going up. What are you going to do?

167
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,760
I know you're going to say goodbye to Hao Jingjing. I'll send you there faster.

168
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,760
Hao Yue, I have something to tell you.

169
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,760
There's something wrong with Xia Zhi.

170
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,760
I've already investigated the member list of that ship.

171
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,760
There's no one named Xia Zhi in it.

172
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,760
What he said yesterday might be a lie.

173
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,760
Miss Sun, don't show off your skills.

174
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,760
It's not hard to make a list.

175
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,760
Since I've known you, I've been used by you.

176
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,760
I can't tell which is true and which is false.

177
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,760
I'm afraid you'll be fooled, you idiot.

178
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,760
Let's go.

179
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,760
Where have you been these past two days?

180
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,760
I said I'd go see my dad. Where have you been?

181
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,760
Is Uncle Youqian back yet?

182
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,160
Thanks to Mr. Peng for calling me.

183
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,160
He let my dad go.

184
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,160
Mr. Peng again?

185
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,760
Jinjian, I said I'd get the money back if I had the money.

186
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,160
Do you believe me?

187
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,160
Brother Hao Yun, how can I believe you?

188
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,160
Mr. Peng called me in front of me.

189
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,160
And you? Where have you been these past two days?

190
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,160
It doesn't matter.

191
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,560
I came to say goodbye to you.

192
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,160
I wish you a better life.

193
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,360
Hello, what would you like?

194
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,760
Lele, wait for me here.

195
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,760
I'll go buy you some food.

196
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,760
You're making us look for you.

197
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,360
Please let me go.

198
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,360
I really didn't see anything.

199
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,360
You didn't see anything?

200
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,560
Then why did you keep hiding from us?

201
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,360
I'll leave Laiwan now.

202
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,760
I promise I won't tell anyone.

203
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,760
Really?

204
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,360
I only believe that

205
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,760
the dead won't talk.

206
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,360
Brother, how about

207
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,360
we talk somewhere else?

208
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,160
Here you are.

209
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,960
Jinjiam.

210
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,160
Please send this demon,

211
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,960
open him up.

212
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,120
is my natural gentleness

213
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:20,620
Let's reach for the

214
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,620
Thanks for watching!
