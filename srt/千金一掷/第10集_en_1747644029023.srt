1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's go step by step.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
First, we will make the base of the head.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
First, we will make the base of the head.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
First, we will make the base of the head.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Then, we will make the head.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
First, we will make the head.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Then, we will make the head.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Then, we will make the head.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Episode 2

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Manman.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Jingjing, come with me.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Hurry up.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let go.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Why are you following me?

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Are you going to find your Miss Sun?

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I don't have time to explain.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Hurry up and go with me.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You are in danger now.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I just saw her with you.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I said.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You don't have to worry about my business.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What's wrong?

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What's wrong?

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Jingjing, go.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What are you doing?

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Take off your dirty hands.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Take off your dirty hands.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Is she harassing you again?

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Now you get out of here.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Did you hear that?

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Come on.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Why did you let me go?

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Can't I come here to spend money?

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Spend money?

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I didn't hear wrong, did I?

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You come to spend money.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
A bottle of wine here is worth ten thousand dollars.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You work hard for a month.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Can you afford to buy half a bottle?

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And this club is made by members.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
How did you get in?

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I remember.

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Our friend in the basement.

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:39,620
He is good at stealing chickens and

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't know if he has any drugs.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I will faint later.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
If there is anything,

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
you don't have to worry about me.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Go.

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
How could this be?

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I just saw it.

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Do you think I am like you?

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
A person with a bad mind?

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I think you just want to come here

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
to drink, right?

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I tell you, Jin Jin.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
This person is bad.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I will drive him away for you.

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Throw him out.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Jin Jin, believe me.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I just saw him drug you.

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Jin Jin, go quickly.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Jin Jin.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You can step on the foot.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What should I do with this hand?

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
How about I dig a hole and bury it?

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You dig?

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Aren't you tired?

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
These people are still tired.

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Hurry up.

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That's right.

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Wait.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Miss Sun.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Miss Sun.

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I want this person.

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This is what Mr. Peng asked us to deal with.

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I said I want this person.

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Which word do you not understand?

79
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I dare not.

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I will do it.

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Miss Sun, please untie me.

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I want to find Jin Jin.

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Do you want me to let you go?

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Okay.

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But you owe me a favor.

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Okay.

87
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Hurry up.

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Come out.

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Thank you.

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Jin Jin.

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Thank you.

92
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Jin Jin, please don't be in trouble.

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Jin Jin, please don't be in trouble.

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm Sister No Yi.

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Your underground casino is really hard to find.

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Come.

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I tell you.

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
That kid must disappear from my sight.

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I don't care if he goes to the sea to feed the fish.

100
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Or to feed the fish in the mountains.

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
All right.

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Who are you talking about?

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm talking about Hao Yue, the worker.

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The worker?

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
No.

106
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You are pretending to be stupid.

107
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You wanted to protect him.

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You didn't let me touch him.

109
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Now he is fighting with Sun Yi Qian.

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
If it goes on like this.

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I will be fired from Sun Group.

112
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Sister.

113
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Look.

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
When I take Sun Group.

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I will naturally be like I promised before.

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I will hand the casino to my sister.

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Since my sister wants to protect him.

118
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Then you can help me make friends with him.

119
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Oh yes.

120
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That kid.

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Now he is developing feelings with Sun Yi Qian in the club.

122
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
As long as you help me dig this wall.

123
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Dig it.

124
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I will fulfill my promise to you.

125
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I, Pan Bi.

126
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I always thought we were just cooperating.

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You are teaching me how to do things.

128
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
No.

129
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I dare not.

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Then.

131
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Sister.

132
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You drink first.

133
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I won't bother you.

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Why are you tearing it?

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Boss.

136
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I didn't tear it.

137
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I just want to eat it.

138
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What are you doing?

139
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Boss.

140
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Don't you want to go?

141
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Now you also want to teach me how to do things?

142
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
No.

143
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Good.

144
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Come.

145
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
No.

146
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I can't drink anymore.

147
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's okay.

148
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
This is too big.

149
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Just the last cup.

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Okay?

151
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Come.

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Come on.

153
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Good.

154
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You are great.

155
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
How do you feel?

156
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I feel so good.

157
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm so happy.

158
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm so happy.

159
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm so happy.

160
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm so happy.

161
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm so happy.

162
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm so happy.

163
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm so happy.

164
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm so happy.

165
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm so happy.

166
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm so happy.

167
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm so happy.

168
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm so happy.

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm so happy.

170
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm so happy.

171
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm so happy.

172
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm so happy.

173
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm so happy.

174
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm so happy.

175
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm so happy.

176
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm so happy.

177
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm so happy.

178
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm so happy.

179
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm so happy.

180
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm so happy.

181
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm so happy.

182
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm so happy.

183
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm so happy.

184
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm so happy.

185
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm so happy.

186
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm so happy.

187
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm so happy.

188
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm so happy.

189
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm so happy.

190
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm so happy.

191
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm so happy.

192
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm so happy.
