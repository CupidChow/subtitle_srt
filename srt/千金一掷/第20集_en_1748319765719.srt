1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
I spent one hour thinking that it would be fun to take shots and verify the result

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,400
Very simple

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,040
wait for a second

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,480
nehme that

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,600
ok

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,180
i put in my memo

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:22,220
and theleg

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,080
I used tht

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,720
i will check the тай

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,480
you followed

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,400
there was less leads

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,240
we have a way together

13
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,620
to meet

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,020
that love

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,600
although I do not know why it is here

16
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,980
but we met before

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,720
You don't know him?

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,720
Fine.

19
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,720
Tell me who you are.

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,720
You may not have heard my name.

21
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,720
But you must know my master's body.

22
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,720
I don't believe you don't remember me.

23
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,720
We pretended to be husband and wife.

24
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,720
You saved me not just once.

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,720
We even wore each other's clothes.

26
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,720
You really don't remember?

27
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,720
Miss.

28
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,720
You look beautiful.

29
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,720
But your way of getting a good husband is a bit old-fashioned.

30
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,720
Miss.

31
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,720
Come here.

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,720
This is your master's personal item.

33
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,720
And the account book you have.

34
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,720
Master, let's go.

35
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,720
What a coincidence.

36
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,720
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,720
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,720
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,720
Haoyun.

40
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:12,420
You've been promoted to my

41
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,720
master's body.

42
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,720
I must represent the first law to defeat the wooden stick of technology.

43
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,720
Master, let me take you there.

44
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,720
I won't embarrass you.

45
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,720
Haoyun.

46
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,720
Listen to me.

47
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,720
Whether it's a new or old-fashioned book,

48
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,720
it's something that can't be taken away from people.

49
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,720
You must not use it to bet money on people.

50
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,720
Master.

51
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,720
People are sitting and watching.

52
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,720
The cause and effect of the cycle is not good.

53
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,720
I've seen too many people on the board

54
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,720
and broke people's hearts.

55
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,720
Including myself.

56
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,720
I've decided to bet ten times.

57
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,720
I must use my power to redeem myself.

58
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,720
The so-called reading of the world's history

59
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,720
is the essence of the book.

60
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,720
Master, what's the reason for me to learn this skill?

61
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,720
If our school is passed down,

62
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,720
it's my sin.

63
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,720
Come.

64
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,720
Remember this password.

65
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
Then contact this person.

66
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,720
I've opened a account book

67
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,720
and you've been working for half a lifetime.

68
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,720
It's a compensation for you.

69
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
But no matter what,

70
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,720
you can't use what I taught you to make money.

71
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,720
In the future,

72
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,720
there will be more people who know I'm a disciple.

73
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
If something happens to Master,

74
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,720
you must keep hiding.

75
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,720
Don't expose yourself in the name of the people.

76
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,720
Have a good life.

77
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,720
I didn't expect you to be the assistant.

78
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,720
Mr. Ji, have we seen each other before?

79
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,720
This is your master's will.

80
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,720
It also proves your master's relationship.

81
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,720
After you sign it,

82
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,720
you can inherit all your master's assets.

83
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,720
Mr. Ji, I want to announce my identity.

84
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
But your master told me

85
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,720
that he hopes you can live a good life with a clear name.

86
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
I've decided.

87
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,720
Master treats me well.

88
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,720
Now he's dead.

89
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,720
I can't bear it.

90
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,720
Master Mo,

91
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,720
Mr. Jin is here to inform you.

92
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,720
The disciple of the Immortal God of the Island has been killed.

93
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,720
Who is it?

94
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
Are you sure?

95
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,720
Mr. Jin said

96
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,720
he must follow the order.

97
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,720
He can't say it.

98
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,720
But with the relationship between the Immortal God and the Sun Family,

99
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,720
the Immortal God of the Island will surely find the master.

100
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,720
I'm sure.

101
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,720
I'm sure.

102
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,720
I'm sure.

103
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,720
We have a lot to discuss with him.

104
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,720
The Immortal God of the Island will surely find the Sun Family.

105
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,720
Master Mo,

106
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,720
if the Immortal God of the Island

107
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,720
helps Sun Yiqian,

108
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,720
it's a difficult battle.

109
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,720
Moreover,

110
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,720
what we did before

111
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,720
was not a great revenge for Sun Yiqian.

112
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,720
You're so stubborn.

113
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,720
What?

114
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,720
Nothing.

115
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,720
The Immortal God of the Island used to work with the Sun Family.

116
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,720
But the disciple of the Immortal God of the Island

117
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
went to the Sun Family.

118
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,720
He didn't necessarily help Sun Yiqian.

119
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,720
Now,

120
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,720
Sun Yiqian is seriously ill and lying in bed.

121
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,720
How could he have the time

122
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,720
to care about what?

123
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,720
What?

124
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,720
The Immortal God of the Island's return?

125
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,720
This is a good chance for us to meet up.

126
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
Master Mo, what do you mean?

127
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,720
You went to a party

128
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,720
and invited Han to the Immortal God of the Island

129
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,720
through a lawyer.

130
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,720
We're trying to

131
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,720
pull this Immortal God of the Island

132
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
to our camp.

133
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,720
I see.

134
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,720
I'll handle this.

135
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
Don't worry.

136
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,720
I'll handle it well.

137
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,720
Welcome.

138
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,720
What would you like to eat?

139
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
I'm so sorry, brother.

140
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,720
I didn't thank you

141
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,720
for not coming.

142
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,720
I was afraid

143
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,720
because of him.

144
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,720
So...

145
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,720
I heard that

146
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,720
your family saved me

147
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
while I was still alive.

148
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
I have a ticket here.

149
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,720
It's a reward for saving my life.

150
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,720
Who asked you to come in?

151
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,720
It's okay.

152
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,720
You can come to the Golden Hall Hotel tonight.

153
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,720
You can ask me

154
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
for a request.

155
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,720
Wait.

156
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,720
What do you want?

157
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,720
Golden Hall Hotel.

158
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
Is there any problem?

159
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,720
What a coincidence.

160
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,720
I have a night

161
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,720
at Golden Hall Hotel tonight.

162
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,720
And I'm the one who's the host.

163
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,720
Did you participate?

164
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
I didn't hear about it.

165
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,720
Who are you?

166
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,720
Who am I?

167
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,720
Who is the host?

168
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,720
No.

169
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,720
I'm your friend,

170
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
Gege.

171
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,720
Listen.

172
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,720
Today is the day

173
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,720
when the young master

174
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,720
sent me

175
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
to hold a special

176
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,720
Golden Handle Festival.

177
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
We will have

178
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,720
all the officials

179
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,720
come here.

180
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
So, Golden Hall Hotel.

181
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
You must come tonight.

182
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,720
Because I will be at the banquet.

183
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,720
Please be my witness

184
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,720
and ask for a marriage proposal.

185
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,720
Okay.

186
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,720
Listen.

187
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,720
Stay away from Golden Hall.

188
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,720
Otherwise,

189
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,720
I'll beat you up.

190
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,720
Since someone

191
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
asked for a marriage proposal,

192
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
I've already tried it.

193
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,720
I'm a good person.

194
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
Tell me

195
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,720
what you want.

196
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,720
I'm ready.

197
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,720
Wait for me.

198
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
Huyun.

199
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,720
Wait a minute.

200
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,720
A person

201
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,720
should have a better life.

202
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,040
I'm going back, right?

203
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,480
Mr. Feng promised to treat me well.

204
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,520
machine gun

205
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,400
Mr. Li is really mieć.

206
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,840
He gave me the love of emperor lv.

207
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,200
In the end,

208
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,880
The whole Southeast Asian market

209
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,160
is so sturdily selected!

210
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,080
Since the dust goddess passed through the ginsengchi

211
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,720
the apprentice下inee 가능ance she worked.

212
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,400
Even though it might onlyモッタ m٩ is the firstconfesson

213
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,000
Yes.

214
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,160
You see, things like that

215
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,960
should hurt when it is blurred!

216
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,300
Director Zhao,

217
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,820
What did you drop?

218
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:52,000
I've heard that the experience of yielding a

219
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,040
It's not too late.

220
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,520
But every time I use it,

221
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,080
it's very expensive.

222
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,120
So I prepared a box

223
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,000
that I've been hiding for thousands of years.

224
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,320
Mr. Zhao,

225
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,320
you've been under heavy pressure.

226
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,960
This 1000-year-old body

227
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,080
is gone by now.

228
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,760
You didn't even take it out.

229
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,160
You gave it to the chief

230
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,600
with such a big wind today.

231
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,760
Yes.

232
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,840
But,

233
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,920
how do I break it down?

234
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:25,960
I was told that

235
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,480
it was only once a while.

236
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,120
It was between

237
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:29,880
Xiao Tong and Mudan

238
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,640
whose brief competitors

239
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,920
recall one of them ended up fighting.

240
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,400
Eventually,

241
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,000
I filmed a brief gardens of a sacred V Fruit,

242
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,120
that was very close to the promise.

243
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,280
The same time as I smashed it,

244
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
I was hit by a style eye.

245
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,480
Then, I was killed by a__________.

246
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,560
I'm so с alguém.

247
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,480
I'm telling the truth.

248
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,160
It was only once,

249
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,640
in one spot.

250
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,840
And he died a very powerful old man.

251
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,840
Could it be that he lost the bet and the demon god of the demon house broke the bet?

252
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,840
Let's go.

253
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,840
President Chang, please come in.

254
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
Let's go.

255
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,840
Please come in, please.

256
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,840
Oh.

257
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,840
Why are you here?

258
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,840
You're getting married today.

259
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,840
How can I not come as a father?

260
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,840
You're embarrassed to come to see me.

261
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,840
Have you forgotten that we have broken the relationship between husband and wife?

262
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,840
Good girl, if it weren't for me,

263
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,840
how could you take Peng with you?

264
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,840
How could you wear such a good clothes?

265
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:42,840
I'm afraid you're still going to the restaurant with that old man.

266
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,840
Shut up.

267
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,840
I'm sorry, sir.

268
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,840
I don't want to make your coat.

269
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
How about you take it off?

270
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,840
Let me help you deal with it.

271
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,840
Okay, thank you.

272
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,840
Who is that guard?

273
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,840
Why is everyone thinking about running away?

274
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
Brother Hao Yun.

275
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,840
Why are you here?

276
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,840
If the housekeeper breaks my good news,

277
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,840
I tell you, get out of here.

278
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,840
You can't stand people in there.

279
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,840
Uncle, I think you're talking nonsense.

280
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,840
You...

281
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,840
Brother Hao Yun, you'd better leave.

282
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,840
President Peng will be here soon.

283
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,840
Don't get in the way of the speciality of today's meeting.

284
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
Yes.

285
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,840
You're really here for the speciality of today's meeting.

286
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,840
The banquet was prepared for me.

287
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,840
I'm not here.

288
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,840
Where am I going?

289
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,840
Well, you broke your own service.

290
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,840
Do you think you can enter this high-ranking place?

291
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
An Bao.

292
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,840
Yes.

293
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,840
Come on.

294
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,840
Take this speciality of today's meeting out.

295
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,840
Who dares to do that?

296
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,840
What are you doing?

297
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,840
Who do you think you are?

298
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,840
Let me introduce myself.

299
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,840
