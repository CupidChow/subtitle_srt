Double click X to open gifts

00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:14,420
Let's take a look sun's kiss

3
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:21,940
Make a circle with a strike

4
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:27,660
And add somerep непro de hae

5
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,760
We all thought we'd be better off if we couldn't make our move through this game.

6
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,720
Still, we were wrong though.

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,420
What would we do?

8
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,920
Hmm...

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,020
Let's see what she can do.

10
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,680
Senpai!

11
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,380
Oh hey my dear sister!

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,920
пон Side

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,620
You're gonna have a secret.

14
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,220
Oh well I should bring her here.

15
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:55,860
💀

16
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:56,360
Mm...

17
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,200
Sanshanærm...

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:03,220
core

19
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:05,980
Come on

20
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,900
What on earth are you going to do to free me

21
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,140
Your father owes me this

22
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,120
three million

23
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,240
Three million

24
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,240
How can three million be so much

25
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,860
Is the interest not counted

26
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,220
why not pay

27
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:23,660
brother

28
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,660
I really don't have that much money.

29
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,660
Even if you cut off all my fingers,

30
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,660
I don't have that much money.

31
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,660
How about I give you my restaurant's mortgage?

32
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,660
How much is your restaurant worth?

33
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,660
Come on, let's cut the meat first.

34
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,660
Wait, wait.

35
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,660
Brother Long, how about my daughter?

36
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,660
No.

37
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,660
Dad.

38
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,660
You're really good at fighting.

39
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,660
You want your daughter to give me 30 million?

40
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:59,660
But the first part of the interest can be discussed.

41
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,660
I'll pay this gambling debt.

42
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,660
30 million.

43
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,660
Just 30 million.

44
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,660
Why should I believe you can pay the debt?

45
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,660
Now I'm not asking you if you believe it or not.

46
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,660
I don't believe you.

47
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,660
I want you to choose.

48
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,660
Either I pay the debt or I'll kill you.

49
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,660
No, no, no.

50
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,660
Okay, I'll give you a week.

51
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,660
I can't see 30 million after a week.

52
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,660
It's not a finger that can do anything.

53
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,660
Be careful.

54
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,660
Why didn't you kill me just now?

55
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,660
Go.

56
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,660
Brother Long, can you help me pick up my finger?

57
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,660
I heard that it can be used in the hospital.

58
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,660
You're a big hero.

59
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,660
Just be a hero.

60
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,660
I'm not a hero.

61
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,660
I'm a hero.

62
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,660
You're a hero.

63
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,660
Just be a hero.

64
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,660
Why did you put the knife on my neck?

65
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,660
You obviously owe me 70 million.

66
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,660
You have to promise me 30 million.

67
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,660
I tell you, you'll pay for this.

68
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,660
I hit.

69
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,660
I.

70
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,660
I.

71
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,660
Dad, it's your own fault.

72
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,660
What does it have to do with good luck?

73
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,660
Besides, if it weren't for good luck,

74
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,660
you can't even keep your hands.

75
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,660
What's wrong?

76
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,660
Didn't I say it before?

77
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,660
Do it again.

78
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,660
Don't make a mess when you encounter trouble.

79
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,660
Mr. Hengcai will help you.

80
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,660
What's wrong with your hand?

81
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,660
I.

82
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,660
Is there a problem with the handwriting?

83
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,660
Say it.

84
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,660
Dad, why do you say everything out?

85
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,660
Mr. Pengcai is not an outsider.

86
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,660
Then you marry him.

87
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,660
Aren't we a family?

88
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,660
Jingjing, in terms of feelings,

89
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,660
I really have a lot of feelings for you.

90
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,660
Just let me do more for you.

91
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,660
Where can I find such a good person?

92
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,660
Jingjing, you can marry Mr. Pengcai.

93
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,660
Dad, Mr. Pengcai is almost as big as you.

94
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,660
What do you know?

95
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,660
Nan Da San Bao Jin Shan.

96
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,660
Dad, give the cheque back to Mr. Pengcai.

97
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,660
Where can we find three million without this cheque?

98
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,660
What are you doing?

99
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,660
Give it to me.

100
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,660
What are you doing?

101
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,660
Give it to me.

102
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,660
You keep it.

103
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,660
You.

104
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,660
Why did you tear the cheque?

105
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,660
Tear it and it's useless.

106
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,660
I have to tell the bank.

107
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,660
The bank may be closed now.

108
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,660
I'll see if I can get another one.

109
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,660
Don't worry.

110
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,660
No, no, Mr. Pengcai.

111
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,660
Mr. Pengcai.

112
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,660
This is...

113
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,660
I'm done.

114
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,660
It's not easy for someone to pay for him.

115
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,660
It's all your fault.

116
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,660
You will really be called unlucky in the future.

117
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,660
I didn't break the cheque.

118
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,660
Mr. Pengcai doesn't want to give you a cheque at all.

119
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,660
Can't you see it?

120
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,660
You're talking nonsense.

121
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,660
I...

122
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,660
I want to get a cheque.

123
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,660
I...

124
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,660
I...

125
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,660
So rich.

126
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,660
If you hadn't been so greedy,

127
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,660
we wouldn't have lived like this.

128
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,660
Okay.

129
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,660
You two eat and drink and pass on to me.

130
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,660
You can't even get out of here.

131
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,660
I'll sell you to pay for it.

132
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,660
Stop.

133
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,660
What are you doing?

134
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,660
I'm warning you.

135
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,660
You're an outsider.

136
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,660
Mind your own business.

137
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,660
Shut up.

138
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,660
I'll figure out the 30 million.

139
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,660
Okay.

140
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,660
You said it.

141
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,660
Boss, are we going to the bank?

142
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,660
What bank?

143
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,660
Didn't you say you were going to the bank to pay the cheque?

144
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,660
I didn't even touch it.

145
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,660
You really want me to bleed?

146
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,660
How can you think...

147
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,660
I don't know if Miss Sun likes the gift I gave her.

148
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,660
Miss Sun.

149
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,660
Good luck.

150
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,660
Why are you here?

151
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,660
This pork is for you.

152
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,660
I booked it through the small restaurant channel yesterday.

153
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,660
It's absolutely fresh.

154
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,660
There's no boy giving a girl pork belly.

155
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,660
I saw you were too skinny last time.

156
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,660
I'm sure you're going to be a little chubby.

157
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,660
I'm not going to be chubby.

158
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,660
I'm going to be chubby.

159
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,660
You were too skinny last time.

160
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,660
Eat something with oil and water to replenish.

161
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,660
Good luck.

162
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,660
Can't I even eat meat?

163
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,660
Okay, don't talk about me.

164
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,660
You said you came here today because you figured it out.

165
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,660
You want to help me?

166
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,660
No.

167
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,660
That's right.

168
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,660
I want to see what kind of work I can do.

169
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,660
Besides gambling,

170
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,660
I can be a bailiff, a driver,

171
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,660
or a runaway.

172
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,660
I need a lot of money lately.

173
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,660
Just give me a pre-paid salary.

174
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,660
If you have any difficulties, tell me.

175
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,660
I'll help you solve it.

176
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,660
You can gamble later.

177
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,660
I owe 30 million in debt today.

178
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,660
What does it have to do with me?

179
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,660
If you don't pay it back for a week, you'll die.

180
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,660
U.S. dollars.

181
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,660
U.S. dollars?

182
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,660
I owe 30 million.

183
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,660
30 million?

184
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,660
I thought it was a lot.

185
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,660
I can't solve it.

186
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,660
Why?

187
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,660
I know them too well.

188
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,660
I lent you the money today.

189
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,660
You paid the gambling debt for them.

190
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,660
They'll lose the gambling tomorrow and owe another debt.

191
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,660
What about the day after tomorrow?

192
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,660
You're going to be a cow and a horse to pay them back?

193
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,660
The bad gambler should die in the casino.

194
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,660
But their families are innocent.

195
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,660
You hate gambling.

196
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,660
Why do you want to open a casino?

197
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,660
Why do you want to participate in charity poker?

198
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:37,660
Isn't it because of you that there are bad gamblers?

199
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,660
Get out of here.

200
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,660
Is there anything wrong with what I said?

201
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,660
Get out!

202
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,660
No bomb.

203
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,660
No.

204
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,660
No.

205
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,660
You're back.

206
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,660
Brother Haoyun.

207
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,660
Didn't you think of a way?

208
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,660
Why is it so little?

209
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,660
I haven't thought of a way.

210
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,660
I told you.

211
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,660
I told you.

212
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,660
You're a big man.

213
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,660
What can you do?

214
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,660
You think you're Mr. Peng?

215
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,660
Do you have his strength?

216
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,660
Dad.

217
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,660
Brother Haoyun is also helping us find a way.

218
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,660
How can you say that about him?

219
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,660
Why are you so protective of him?

220
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,660
Mr. Peng said he would solve the 30 million problem.

221
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,660
I warn you.

222
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,660
Don't come to them to eat swan meat.

223
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,660
My daughter is going to marry into the rich family.

224
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,660
Haoyun.

225
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,660
Who are you?

226
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,660
I'm the security supervisor of the Sun family.

227
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,660
Bring someone here.

228
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,660
Sun family?

229
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,660
You're more trouble than me.

230
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,660
The Sun family is here.

231
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,660
But it's all the same.

232
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,660
You dare to mess with them.

233
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,660
I didn't.

234
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,660
It must be that you lost money in the Sun family's casino.

235
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,660
Did they find the door?

236
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,660
Take him away.

237
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,660
Go.

238
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,660
Where are you taking him?

239
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,660
I'll leave him to you.

240
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,660
We don't know him.

241
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,660
Go.

242
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,660
What are you doing?

243
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,660
Leave him alone.

244
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,660
Go.

245
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,660
But...

246
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,660
Go back.

247
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,660
Go inside.

248
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,660
What are you doing?

249
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,660
What are you doing?

250
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,660
Wait outside.

251
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,660
I have something to tell him.

252
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,660
Uncle Pasha.

253
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,660
Is it dangerous for you to be alone with that guy?

254
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,660
Is it something you should worry about?

255
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,660
I've already thought about it.

256
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,660
As long as you're willing to help me to win the charity competition,

257
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,660
I'll not only help you pay the debt,

258
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,660
but also give you the gold and gold.

259
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,660
No.

260
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,660
Other than gambling,

261
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,660
I can do anything else.

262
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,660
You...

263
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,660
You...

264
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,660
Then...

265
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,660
You should help me to finish the play

266
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,660
and continue to be my fiance.

267
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,660
What are you doing?

268
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,660
Don't do this.

269
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,660
I don't eat this.

270
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,660
Don't do this.

271
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,660
Don't be nervous.

272
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,660
Be obedient.

273
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,660
It'll be fine in a moment.

274
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,660
What are you looking at?

275
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,660
Miss sacrificed a lot for Qianxia.

276
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,660
Shut up.

277
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,660
Yes.

278
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,660
It hurts.

279
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,660
It hurts.

280
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,660
I don't want it.

281
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,660
You're mine.

282
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,660
You have to do what I tell you to do.

283
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,660
Let me go.

284
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,660
Help.

285
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,660
Help.

286
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,660
I don't want it.

287
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,660
Miss, someone is coming to the casino.

288
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,660
He just supports her.

289
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,660
A tiger again.

290
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,660
It run Всё a 100 된.

291
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,660
A tiger.

292
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,660
What?

293
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,660
That woman won gears directly from don't let the gold train pass her like fly.

294
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,260
Who is this girl?

295
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,660
You don't know?

296
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,060
She is No Yi.

297
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,860
She ranks third in the Eastern and Southern Asia.

298
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,860
So amazing.

299
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,060
I'm sorry.

300
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,660
I'm sorry.

301
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,660
I'm sorry.

302
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,660
I'm sorry.

303
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,660
I'm sorry.

304
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,660
I'm sorry.

305
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,660
I'm sorry.

306
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,660
I'm sorry.

307
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,660
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

309
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,660
