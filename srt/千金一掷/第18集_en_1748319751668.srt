00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,960
with

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:17,160
Thank's for

4
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,920
Wow

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,920
The first time I saw a picture of a man in a car.

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,920
I was surprised to see the picture of a man in a car.

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,920
I was surprised to see the picture of a man in a car.

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,920
I was surprised to see the picture of a man in a car.

9
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,920
I was surprised to see the picture of a man in a car.

Episode 19

11
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,920
I'm coming. Let go.

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,920
Dad, I'll kill him now.

13
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,920
Guo Ji needs to confirm whether he's a gold-handed man.

14
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,920
Why are you...

15
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,920
I heard that the person who will be brought by the boss is a gold-handed man.

16
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,920
Why don't you take me to see him?

17
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,920
I asked Sun Da to see him.

18
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,920
I'm not sure if he's a gold-handed man.

19
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,920
I'll stay and help you.

20
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,920
In case you find a fake gold-handed man,

21
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,920
I'll ruin your good deed.

22
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,920
This way.

23
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,920
It's dangerous here. Go.

24
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,920
Go.

25
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,920
I'm not a man who is like Sun Da.

26
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,920
You're not Sun Yixian.

27
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,920
Why did you help him to seduce the girlfriend of the boss?

28
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,920
It's a misunderstanding.

29
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,920
I'm a businessman.

30
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,920
It's hard to get some Sun's attention to pay back the favor.

31
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,920
Right.

32
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,920
The favor.

33
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,920
Right.

34
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,920
I need the favor.

35
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,920
You know,

36
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,920
in this crucial time,

37
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,920
the battle is very important.

38
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,920
Since you don't want to say anything,

39
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,920
there's no value for you.

40
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,920
No.

41
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,920
I... I have the value.

42
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,920
I have the value.

43
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,920
I have the value.

44
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,920
No.

45
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,920
I've heard that

46
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,920
Sun Yixian found a man named Mu Kun.

47
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,920
He wants to ask him to go out.

48
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,920
He found Mu Kun.

49
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,920
Mu Kun.

50
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
Come.

51
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,920
Come.

52
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,920
I'll give you a chance to show your loyalty.

53
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,920
You can use any method you can with me.

54
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,920
But stop Sun Yixian.

55
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,920
Come with me.

56
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,920
I called Jinjin.

57
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,920
Yes.

58
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,920
I came to you to confirm

59
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,920
whether you're Jin Shouzhi.

60
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,920
There's a misunderstanding.

61
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,920
I don't know what to do.

62
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,920
If I say I'm not Jin Shouzhi,

63
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,920
do you believe me?

64
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,920
I heard that Jin Shouzhi

65
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,920
is the best leader of the Dushen.

66
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,920
I can't see

67
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,920
the first move.

68
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,920
You give me four S.

69
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,920
I can't walk.

70
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,920
It's a bad luck.

71
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,920
Mr. Mu Kun.

72
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,920
Send him away.

73
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,920
Don't delay our cooperation.

74
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,920
You think Jiazhuang won't cut the cards?

75
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,920
Do you think I can't see it?

76
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,920
I'm not sure.

77
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,920
I'm not sure.

78
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,920
I'm not sure.

79
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,920
Can't you see it?

80
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,920
Do you think

81
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,920
Jinjin is not in my hands?

82
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,920
Let go of me.

83
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,920
Jinjin.

84
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,920
Brother Haoyun.

85
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,920
No.

86
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,920
I'm Jin Shouzhi.

87
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,920
You send Jinjin away.

88
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,920
I'll give you one last chance.

89
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,920
You give me four S.

90
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,920
It's also Jin Shouzhi.

91
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,920
If I cut off four S,

92
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,920
you'll give me Jinjin.

93
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,920
Cut the cards.

94
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,920
Watch it.

95
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,920
I'm not interested in a female gambler.

96
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,920
I'm interested in

97
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,920
Jin Shouzhi.

98
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,920
I didn't expect you to reveal your identity

99
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,920
for a female gambler.

100
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,920
Is it worth it?

101
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,920
I'm not interested.

102
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,920
I'm not interested.

103
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,920
I'm not interested.

104
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,920
I'm not interested.

105
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,920
Is it worth it?

106
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,920
Let go of Jinjin.

107
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,920
Or I'll kill your princess.

108
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,920
Get up.

109
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,920
Get up.

110
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,920
Don't come around.

111
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,920
I'm the grand daughter of the Sun family.

112
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,920
What are you waiting for?

113
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,920
Call the Sun family and save me.

114
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,920
Or I'll bury you all.

115
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,920
You give me a backpick.

116
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,920
Or I'll kill her now.

117
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,920
Backpick.

118
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Stop pretending.

119
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,920
Stop pretending.

120
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,920
The whole story

121
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,920
knows you're a couple.

122
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,920
I didn't expect

123
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,920
you to be Jin Shouzhi.

124
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,920
Come on.

125
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,920
Let go of me.

126
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,920
Stop.

127
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,920
I have a bomb.

128
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,920
Your bomb

129
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,920
doesn't look real.

130
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,920
If you don't believe me,

131
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,920
then just bet.

132
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,920
You guys should release Jinjin.

133
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,920
Or I'll kill her.

134
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,920
You.

135
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
Calm down.

136
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,920
Calm down.

137
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,920
Release her.

138
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,920
Brother Hou Yong.

139
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,920
They wanted me to leave the poison

140
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,920
and call you.

141
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,920
I really don't know how to go back.

142
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,920
You guys leave first.

143
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,920
We'll talk later.

144
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
Don't worry about me.

145
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,920
Stay here.

146
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
Only move back.

147
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,920
Go.

148
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
Go.

149
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,920
Don't go.

150
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,920
You.

151
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,920
You.

152
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,920
Hou Yuan.

153
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,920
Why are you alone?

154
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,920
Where's Jinjin?

155
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,920
I asked her to go back first.

156
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,920
I'll pick you up.

157
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,920
Is your bodyguard nearby?

158
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,920
It's hard to say.

159
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,920
I've changed my mind.

160
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,920
I can't follow you.

161
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,920
You're a ghost.

162
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,920
It's dangerous now.

163
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,920
Don't you know?

164
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,920
Tell me first.

165
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,920
What's your grudge with Mu Kun?

166
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,920
Why did he chase you?

167
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,920
I don't know.

168
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
There's not much to do.

169
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
Let's go.

170
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,920
Peng.

171
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,920
We can save him.

172
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,920
Come here.

173
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,920
Miss Sun.

174
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,920
Catch them.

175
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,920
Give them to Mo Penpiz.

176
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,920
They're here to catch you.

177
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,920
What are you waiting for?

178
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,920
Run.

179
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
Oh no.

180
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,920
You've been here to arrange people.

181
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,920
I didn't expect that

182
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,920
they'd come so fast.

183
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,920
I can't run away this time.

184
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,920
Oh no.

185
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
Oh no.

186
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,920
Brothers.

187
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,920
Kill them.

188
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,920
Go.

189
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,920
Brothers, go.

190
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,920
Go.

191
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,920
Are you hurt?

192
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,920
I think I've seen Mu Kun.

193
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,920
Mu Kun?

194
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,920
You didn't find him before.

195
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,920
How could you see him?

196
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,920
He had the scar on his hand.

197
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,920
I think I've seen him somewhere.

198
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,920
I remember.

199
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
I said I'll pay back.

200
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,920
Why did you stop me?

201
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,920
Do you not believe me?

202
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,920
Do you not believe me?

203
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,920
Wait for me here.

204
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,920
I'll come back.

205
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,920
Wait for me here.

206
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
My parents were killed that night.

207
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,920
Ye Fei was him.

208
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,920
Brother.

209
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,920
Brother.

210
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,920
Sister.

211
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,920
Are you all right?

212
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,920
Haoyun.

213
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,920
Haoyun.

214
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,920
Hao Yue, wake up, Hao Yue!

215
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,320
Uncle Pan Sha, call the ambulance!

216
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,120
Call the ambulance!

217
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,120
Hurry up!

218
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,120
Hao Yue!

219
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,120
Hao Yue!

220
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,120
Hao Yue, it's okay.

221
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,920
Hao Yue, wake up!
