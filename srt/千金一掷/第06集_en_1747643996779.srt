00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,560
Dad,I will go help daddy

3
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:54,400
I am here to give him gift

4
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,640
I am so sorry

5
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,640
Miss Sun, you must have misunderstood.

6
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,640
I'm the owner of this shop.

7
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,640
He's just a worker.

8
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,640
Miss Sun is here.

9
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,640
Why don't you take this kind of person away?

10
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,640
I'll hurt you.

11
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,640
Let go.

12
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,640
I brought a gift today

13
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,640
to give to him.

14
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,640
Uncle Hasha.

15
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:47,820
Sun Group sent a pure gold

16
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,640
Thank you. I don't want these things.

17
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,640
Take it back.

18
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,640
What?

19
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,640
Are you stupid?

20
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,640
I...

21
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,640
These things are more valuable than the shops.

22
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,640
How can I not want it?

23
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,640
You are the good spy, the father of that poisonous ghost, right?

24
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,640
Yes.

25
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,640
I'm very sorry.

26
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,640
This is mine.

27
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,640
Yes.

28
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,640
Congratulations.

29
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,640
I hope you can embrace a new life.

30
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,640
You and good luck to cut the hair.

31
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,640
Then I...

32
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,640
Open the business.

33
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,640
Good.

34
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,640
Good.

35
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,640
Good luck.

36
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,640
Congratulations.

37
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,640
Congratulations.

38
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,640
Congratulations.

39
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,640
Congratulations.

40
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,640
Congratulations.

41
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,640
Miss Sun,

42
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,640
thank you for attending the show today.

43
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,640
You helped me clarify the facts.

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,640
You don't have to thank me.

45
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,640
You know why I came here.

46
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,640
What's your purpose?

47
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,640
Help me participate in the charity competition.

48
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,640
How about it?

49
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,640
Have you thought about it?

50
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,640
When I helped you a few days ago,

51
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,640
I found that I was very good at gambling.

52
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,640
It's like I was born to be a bad gambler.

53
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,640
Not only do I know how to gamble,

54
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,640
I also enjoy this process.

55
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,640
I'm afraid I'll become a bad gambler.

56
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,640
So,

57
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,640
I just want to live an ordinary life.

58
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,640
Please take the gift back.

59
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,640
These gifts are too expensive.

60
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,640
I can't afford it.

61
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,640
Thank you.

62
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,640
You're so bold.

63
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,640
Uncle Hasha, let's go.

64
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,640
Okay.

65
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,640
No.

66
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,640
My golden silkworm.

67
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,640
My jade boat.

68
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,640
My treasure tree.

69
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,640
Brother Haoyun,

70
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,640
I misunderstood you before.

71
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,640
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,640
I'll take a picture.

73
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,640
Dad.

74
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,640
I found the oil bomb warehouse.

75
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,640
What are you doing?

76
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,640
Send someone to solve it.

77
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,640
I won.

78
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,640
Brother Haoyun, the food is here.

79
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,640
Brother Haoyun, the food is here.

80
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,640
It's next door. Thank you.

81
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,640
Uncle Kun has given his life.

82
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,640
We must kill him tonight.

83
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,640
And he's right here.

84
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,640
Later,

85
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,640
watch carefully.

86
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,640
Do you hear me?

87
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,640
Yes.

88
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,640
Go.

89
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,640
The card.

90
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,640
The card.

91
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,640
You guys,

92
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,640
take me to see

93
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,640
Mu Kun.

94
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,640
It's here.

95
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,640
Brother,

96
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,640
I don't look like a rich man.

97
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,640
I don't need to kill myself.

98
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,640
How can I let you die?

99
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,640
It's you.

100
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,640
I'm here to help you pay.

101
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,640
Why do you still need money?

102
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,640
I'm here to help you pay.

103
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,640
I'm here to help you pay.

104
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,640
Do you have money?

105
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,640
Why do you still need money?

106
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,640
What Peng Sai?

107
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,640
Can you avoid debt?

108
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,640
Can you avoid debt?

109
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,640
Peng Sai, you bastard.

110
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,640
You're lying.

111
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,640
Give me another day.

112
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,640
I'll find money to pay you back.

113
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,640
You mean you don't have any now?

114
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,640
Give me the money.

115
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,640
You...

116
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,640
What are you doing?

117
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,640
I think you have a good eye.

118
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,640
You're a good eye.

119
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,640
Who are you looking for?

120
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,640
Looking for him.

121
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,640
You're really rich.

122
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,640
Really rich?

123
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,640
Why are there all beautiful women around you?

124
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
Why are you here?

125
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,640
It's too dangerous.

126
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,640
Of course I'm here to bet with you.

127
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,640
I'll leave when I win.

128
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,640
No, didn't you see I was busy?

129
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,640
You should go, sister.

130
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,640
Go.

131
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,640
Okay, I'll wait for you.

132
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,640
Go.

133
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,640
Go.

134
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,640
Don't go, beautiful woman.

135
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,640
Don't make trouble.

136
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,640
Let go.

137
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,640
Calm down.

138
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,640
Baby, have a piece.

139
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,640
I don't like men with a smoky smell.

140
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,640
What a coincidence.

141
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,640
I never smoke.

142
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,640
Beautiful woman,

143
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,640
you're not worth it

144
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640
to be with a man like me.

145
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,640
As long as you're my woman,

146
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,640
I promise you'll have a good time.

147
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,640
You'll have a good time.

148
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,640
It hurts.

149
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,640
It hurts.

150
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,640
Don't come over.

151
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,640
You're all useless.

152
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,640
You may not have a finger to hold it up.

153
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,640
Boss.

154
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,640
You bitch, how dare you touch me?

155
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,640
I'm really going to trouble her.

156
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
I'll stop them.

157
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,640
You go.

158
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,640
Come on, take off this bitch's clothes.

159
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,640
Get him.

160
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
My hands are fine.

161
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,640
You go.

162
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,640
Go.

163
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,640
I won't go.

164
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,640
I won't go.

165
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,640
I won't go.

166
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,640
I won't go.

167
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,640
I won't go.

168
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
I won't go.

169
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,640
I won't go.

170
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,640
I won't go.

171
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,640
I won't go.

172
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,640
I won't go.

173
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,640
I won't go.

174
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,640
I won't go.

175
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,640
I won't go.

176
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,640
I won't go.

177
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
I won't go.

178
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,640
I won't go.

179
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,640
I won't go.

180
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,640
I won't go.

181
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,640
I won't go.

182
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,640
I won't go.

183
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,640
I won't go.

184
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,640
I won't go.

185
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,640
I won't go.

186
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,640
I won't go.

187
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,640
I won't go.

188
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,640
I won't go.

189
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,640
I won't go.

190
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,640
I won't go.

191
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,640
I won't go.

192
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,640
I won't go.

193
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,640
