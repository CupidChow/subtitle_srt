1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Anyway, they say the place is nice, but it's still not good here

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,900
Just suffering from boilers

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,180
Now, let's go to the corner

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,680
Let's switchclips

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,180
We can see...

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,260
We can move his mum

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:50,620
комментator

8
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:52,940
zheng kings

9
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:55,620
welcome

10
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,280
please tell me

11
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:56,680
what do you need'?

12
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,260
I'll go get some fried chicken.

13
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,260
Of course. You can sit down.

14
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,260
Sir, I think you look familiar.

15
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,260
You've been here before.

16
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,260
I've been here a few times.

17
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,260
It's right here.

18
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,260
You have money?

19
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,260
Why are you here?

20
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,260
I can use this shop to buy my own bet.

21
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,260
I can't afford to buy it.

22
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,260
You can use this shop to buy my own bet?

23
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,260
I can.

24
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,260
Why do you have my shop's copyright?

25
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,260
Then I can leave.

26
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,260
You can.

27
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,260
I'll give you a discount.

28
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,260
Sir, no.

29
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,260
Listen, I don't know this person.

30
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,260
You can leave if you give me the copyright.

31
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,260
I don't care.

32
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,260
I just know he owes me 25 million dollars.

33
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,260
If you don't give me the money,

34
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,260
I'll take this restaurant.

35
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,260
What are you doing?

36
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,260
Don't come over.

37
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,260
Don't come over.

38
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,260
Don't touch my stuff.

39
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,260
Fine.

40
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,260
I can give you the money.

41
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,260
After a day, I'll have 25 million dollars.

42
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,260
If you can't see it,

43
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,260
you must buy this shop.

44
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,260
Let me think who you are.

45
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,260
Xiaoya, right?

46
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,260
Don't be angry.

47
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,260
I'll take you to a nice place.

48
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,260
Xiaoya.

49
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,260
I'm hanging up.

50
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,260
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,260
This shop may not be able to operate.

52
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,260
I have a way.

53
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,260
I don't know if you're willing to do it.

54
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,260
I'll do it.

55
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,260
I don't know if you're willing to do it.

56
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,260
Actually, I'm a math teacher.

57
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,260
I was in the library before.

58
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,260
I was pulled into the black list and banned Xia Chu.

59
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,260
If you're willing to take me to Xia Chu,

60
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,260
we'll do it if we win the money.

61
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,260
But...

62
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,260
You just want to help me.

63
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,260
If you lose, it's mine.

64
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,260
Of course.

65
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,260
If you find it difficult,

66
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,260
forget it.

67
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,260
Goodbye.

68
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,260
Wait.

69
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,260
I want to try.

70
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,260
Try to find the most convenient place to sit.

71
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,260
This way, I can take more time to calculate.

72
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,260
You just have to follow my instructions.

73
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,260
I'll do it.

74
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,260
I'm sorry.

75
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,260
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,260
I'm sorry.

77
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,260
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,260
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,260
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,260
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,260
I'm sorry.

82
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,260
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,260
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,260
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,260
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,260
I'm sorry.

87
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,260
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,260
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,260
How about it?

90
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,260
The calculation is simple.

91
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,260
You just have to follow my instructions to Xia Chu.

92
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,260
You'll win.

93
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,260
Next, you have to lose on purpose.

94
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,260
Why?

95
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,260
You can't win anywhere else.

96
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,260
The river can watch over you.

97
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,260
I...

98
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,260
These are all yours.

99
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,260
I...

100
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,260
I...

101
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,260
I...

102
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,260
I just need to pay for the restaurant.

103
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,260
These are for you.

104
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,260
We agreed on half of it.

105
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,260
If you didn't help me,

106
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,260
I wouldn't have won that much money.

107
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,260
But...

108
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,260
All right.

109
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,260
I have to go back to the school.

110
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,260
Call me if you're interested.

111
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,260
Goodbye.

112
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,260
The bill is 20,000 yuan.

113
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,260
You can count it.

114
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,260
I'll take it.

115
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,260
I'll say it again.

116
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,260
I don't know that good friend.

117
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,260
He'll be the one to pay for it.

118
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,260
I'll tell you the truth.

119
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,260
Don't come to me for the bet he owes me.

120
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,260
All right.

121
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,260
The money is so hard.

122
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,260
It's not half an hour.

123
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,260
Hello?

124
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,260
Sorry.

125
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,260
Xuan Xiao sent me out for study.

126
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,260
I can't come back for the time.

127
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,260
We'll talk later.

128
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,260
All right.

129
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,260
It's all right.

130
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,260
Hello?

131
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,260
Sorry.

132
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,260
Xuan Xiao sent me out for study.

133
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,260
I can't come back for the time.

134
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,260
We'll talk later.

135
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,260
All right.

136
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,260
It's all right.

137
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,260
Since this is the money,

138
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,260
I'll pay for it.

139
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,260
Since this is the money,

140
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,260
it doesn't belong to me.

141
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,260
I'll take them away.

142
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,260
I got it.

143
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,260
I got it.

144
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,260
I got it.

145
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,260
I got it.

146
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,260
Come on.

147
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,260
I got it.

148
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,260
I got it.

149
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,260
I got it.

150
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,260
I got it.

151
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,260
I got it.

152
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,260
I got it.

153
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,260
I got it.

154
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,260
Hey, I got it again.

155
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,260
I got it.

156
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,260
I got it.

157
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,260
Hey, are you having fun?

158
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,260
Are you having fun?

159
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,260
I don't have enough money.

160
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,260
I'll pay for it.

161
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,260
Good night.

162
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,260
Good night.

163
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,260
Well,

164
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,260
let me go back.

165
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,260
I still have money in my room.

166
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,260
I'll pay for it.

167
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,260
All right?

168
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,260
You're here.

169
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,260
It's you?

170
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,260
I... I just lost a lot of money.

171
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,260
Can you lend me some money?

172
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,260
Boss.

173
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,260
Boss.

174
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,260
How do they call you boss?

175
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,260
I'm sorry, girl.

176
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,260
I'm not a math teacher.

177
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,260
I'm just a student.

178
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,260
What do you mean?

179
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,260
Are you lying to me?

180
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,260
Lying?

181
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,260
Did I force you to come today?

182
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,260
Did you come by yourself?

183
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,260
Didn't you want to bet on it?

184
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,260
I didn't expect that you're a bad guy.

185
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,260
Give me the money.

186
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,260
Why am I a bad guy?

187
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,260
All the bad guys in Dubo are bad guys.

188
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,260
You're the same.

189
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,260
He's the same.

190
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,260
Everyone is.

191
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,260
Dubo has a lot of greed.

192
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,260
This is the most original nature of people.

193
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,260
You're the same.

194
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,260
Don't move.

195
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,260
You don't need to pay me.

196
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,260
You just need a little help.

197
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,260
Call the lucky guy.

198
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,260
Ask him to pick you up.

199
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:10,260
Then you two can leave safely.

200
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,260
I'll be back.

201
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,260
Someone's here.

202
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,260
No, it's Miss Sun.

203
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,260
She said she came to see you.

204
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,260
Song Yiqin?

205
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,260
I'm here to see you.

206
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,260
Lock her up first.

207
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,260
Lock her up.

208
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,260
I'll go by myself.

209
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,260
You're afraid of the tea, my precious.

210
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,260
Why do you always fall in love at the critical moment?

211
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,260
Have we met before?

212
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,260
It's hard to find a man who can take the King's tomb.

213
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,260
I'm Sun Yiqian.

214
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,260
Nice to meet you.

215
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,260
Miss Sun, nice to meet you.

216
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,260
What a coincidence.

217
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,260
I'll take a guest later.

218
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,260
Please come to the guest room with me.

219
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,260
But Miss Sun,

220
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,260
take Miss Sun to the guest room.

221
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,260
Let me go.

222
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,260
I've already called Brother Haoyun.

223
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,260
Let's go.

224
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,260
Let me go.

225
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,260
Why is he here?

226
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,260
This time, we can't let Jin Shouzhi escape.

227
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,260
Let the brothers prepare the family.

228
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,260
Jin Shouzhi?

229
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,260
Are they using Jin Jing to catch Haoyun?

230
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,260
No, I have to report it.

231
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,260
Miss Sun.

232
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,260
Gui Bin is here.

233
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,260
Since Boss Mu Kun is busy,

234
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,260
I'll come again.

235
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,260
Okay.

236
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,260
I'll send you off.

237
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,260
I'm coming.

238
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,260
Let go of me.

239
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,260
I'm coming.

240
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,260
I'm coming.

241
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,260
I'm coming.
