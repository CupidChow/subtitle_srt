1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's go step by step.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I use the same tool as the previous one.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I use the same tool as the previous one.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I use the same tool as the previous one.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is the result.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I use the same tool as the previous one.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I use the same tool as the previous one.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This is the result.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Let's go step by step.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Go.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Why didn't you take it out earlier?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Because I like men who fight for me.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Beauty, this has nothing to do with you.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
As long as you give it to me, I can let you go.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
No, he is my man. I will take care of it.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You are in trouble.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
My boss will be here soon. You will be dead.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
My boss is from the armed forces.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
He has dozens of lives and dozens of guns.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
As long as you put down the gun and kneel down to beg for mercy, I can give you a way to live.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Boss, it's them.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
They are here.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
They are here.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
They are here.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This has nothing to do with him.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
My boss is here.

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Sorry, boss.

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
No.1.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
This...

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You are...

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No.1, I drove a car for the chairman of the committee. Do you remember?

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I think I remember my father had a driver named Xingli.

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Boss.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You are a blind dog.

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You are chasing after No.1.

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If you are tired of living, I will cut your head off.

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
No.

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
No.1, I am just a blind dog.

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
No. You are so stubborn.

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You should let him go.

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Boss, I beg you.

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I don't know you are No.1's man.

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I am not his man.

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I really don't know No.1 is yours.

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
He is not mine. Don't pull my pants.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Stop pulling.

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Don't pull.

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Just treat him as my brother.

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
His business is over.

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
But you beat him today.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Shouldn't you...

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I won't force you.

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You say it yourself. What do you want to do?

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Come on.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Hurry up.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Boss.

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
No.

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Take it.

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't want it.

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You don't need to find me.

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I don't want the money.

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Boss.

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Enough.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay. Get out.

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Get out.

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Get out.

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Sorry.

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
My glasses are broken.

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Thank you for your help tonight.

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Thank you.

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Thank you.

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I let you go.

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You...

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I let you go.

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What are you going to do?

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I saved your life just now.

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You didn't want to repay me?

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Repay?

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What are you thinking?

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I want to play with you again.

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I can play with anything.

82
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I can leave as long as you agree.

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Anything else is okay.

84
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I can't gamble.

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I promised Jin Jin.

86
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I will never touch gambling.

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Jin Jin?

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Anyway,

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
thank you for saving my life tonight.

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I will find a way to solve the gambling debt.

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Please don't come to me again.

92
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Thank you.

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
This man is really interesting.

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Jin Jin.

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Jin Jin.

96
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Why is nobody here?

97
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Jin Jin.

98
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Jin Jin.

99
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
No.

100
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Aren't you Sun Yi Qian's fiance?

101
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Why do you live in such a place?

102
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You followed me.

103
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What are you going to do?

104
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Hao Yue.

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I grew up in a casino.

106
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I started playing when I was three years old.

107
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I played cards with gamblers when I was eight years old.

108
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
When I was sixteen,

109
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
nobody could beat me on the table.

110
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And you are the first one.

111
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You are in front of so many people.

112
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So I want to win.

113
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I really don't want to.

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I just want to live an ordinary life with Jin Jin.

115
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't want to deal with you guys.

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Then what is your relationship with Sun Yi Qian?

117
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I...

118
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I don't know.

119
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I see.

120
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You look like a pure-hearted man.

121
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But you are actually quite playful.

122
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Tell me.

123
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
How many girlfriends do you have besides them?

124
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Sister No Yi.

125
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Just think that I beg you.

126
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Just let me go.

127
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I shouldn't have won you back then.

128
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What do you mean?

129
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You mean

130
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I can win if you want to win.

131
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I can lose if you want to lose.

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I didn't mean that.

133
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I tell you.

134
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I tell you.

135
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You have to bet today.

136
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I can't bet.

137
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You can't bet, right?

138
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Then I will let your Jin Jin misunderstand you.

139
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'll see if you can bet.

140
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What are you doing?

141
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I will sleep here today.

142
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Don't touch me.

143
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You can't stay here.

144
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Jin Jin will see you sleeping here.

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
He will think about it and kick me out.

146
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm sorry.

147
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What are you doing?

148
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Didn't you say that you were afraid that your Jin Jin would find out?

149
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Then we will hide in your blanket.

150
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
No.

151
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You are wronged by telling me.

152
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Do you know that

153
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
there is no normal man in Lai Wan who can refuse me?

154
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Now I'm the boss.

155
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You don't like me.

156
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I just don't understand.

157
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Why do you have to bet with me?

158
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Do you know that

159
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I can bet on two things in Lai Wan.

160
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
One is gambling and the other is being selfish.

161
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I will never allow someone to refuse both.

162
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Oh, no.

163
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Jin Jin is coming back.

164
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Jin Jin, just take it as I promised you.

165
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Please hide now.

166
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Promise to be my man?

167
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
What are you thinking?

168
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Of course I promised to be your man.

169
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Don't tell anyone.

170
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's too late.

171
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You should hide in the toilet first.

172
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Hurry up.

173
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You just promised me.

174
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Hurry up.

175
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Take it.

176
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Jin Jin, you are back.

177
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Hi.

178
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Hi.

179
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Jin Jin, you are back.

180
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Jin Jin, you are back.

181
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Jin Jin, you are back.

182
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Jin Jin, you are back.

183
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Jin Jin, you are back.

184
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Jin Jin, you are back.

185
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Jin Jin, you are back.

186
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Jin Jin, you are back.

187
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Jin Jin, you are back.

188
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Jin Jin, you are back.

189
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Jin Jin, you are back.
