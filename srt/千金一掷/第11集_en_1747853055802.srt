1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
ShIchirou teacher

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,980
Okamera

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:14,920
N Bangkok

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:23,380
Hakuna matata

5
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,520
ok

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,720
Nobody haha

7
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:43,720
?

8
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,620
Stacyâ€¦?

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,540
Bames?

10
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,180
is that your costume?

11
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,800
Why don't you believe me?

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,340
Now I finally have a lighter to shine on.

13
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,340
The story was settled.

14
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,680
Su Han

15
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,800
You...

16
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,260
What?

17
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,800
I'm lost.

18
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:26,280
When you meet someone, that person will ask you what you want to eat.

19
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,880
Yes, sir!

20
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,840
Excuse me.

21
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,600
I feel upset.

22
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,340
Where is the%.

23
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,080
I'll go clubbing.

24
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,640
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,920
Don't worry.

26
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,720
Hao Jingjing has gone home.

27
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,320
Where are you going?

28
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,960
Go back.

29
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,800
You just owe me a favor.

30
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,840
Now you want to run away?

31
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,280
Miss Sun,

32
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,840
I've told you many times.

33
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,600
I won't agree to your invitation.

34
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,480
I know.

35
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,800
You can't just leave like this.

36
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,800
What do you want?

37
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,800
At least,

38
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
have a drink with me.

39
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,200
Leave two bottles of wine,

40
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
and you disappear.

41
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,080
Okay, okay.

42
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,080
I'll disappear now.

43
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,280
You've been following me all day.

44
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,080
What's the matter?

45
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,480
This is for you.

46
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,520
This is for you.

47
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,520
When I went to see you last night,

48
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,920
I saw your glasses were broken.

49
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,480
I wanted to give them to you this morning,

50
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,640
but you ran away.

51
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,960
Don't use these glasses anymore.

52
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,800
It's more convenient to hide your glasses.

53
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,200
If you're grateful, keep it in your heart.

54
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,880
Take it.

55
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,360
Thank you.

56
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,080
You said you wanted to take back the family's gambling rights,

57
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,080
and cut it off.

58
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
Why?

59
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,440
Because of gambling,

60
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,720
I lost my family.

61
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,840
I want one more.

62
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,840
You want one more?

63
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,160
Okay.

64
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
Dad is so nice.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Are you happy?

66
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,440
Stop!

67
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,680
Stop!

68
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,320
What are you doing?

69
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,320
Give me the gun.

70
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,200
Okay.

71
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,600
Here, I'll give it to you.

72
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Don't hurt my family.

73
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,040
I'm borrowing money, not stealing.

74
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,440
I'll go to the casino now.

75
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,440
I'll pay you back the money.

76
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,360
It's okay.

77
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,360
It's okay.

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Take off your necklace.

79
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,960
Take off your necklace.

80
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,640
I'll give it to you.

81
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,520
Hurry up.

82
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,160
It hurts.

83
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,160
Don't hurt my daughter.

84
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,280
Is it here?

85
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,280
Why is the wine a little familiar?

86
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,880
What did you say?

87
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,880
This is the wine that Peng Sai drugged.

88
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,280
The wine you just drank was drugged.

89
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,280
Drugged?

90
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,080
Is it poison?

91
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,880
Spit it out.

92
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,280
It's poison.

93
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,280
It's poison.

94
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,280
It's poison.

95
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,280
I can't spit it out.

96
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,280
Stingy.

97
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,280
Stingy.

98
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,480
No.

99
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,480
I can't get this hand off.

100
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,280
I'll do it.

101
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,080
Let go.

102
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,080
It's not enough to stingy.

103
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,080
What do you say?

104
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
I got it.

105
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,280
Come on.

106
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,280
Harder.

107
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,280
Can you hold it so hard?

108
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,280
Don't move.

109
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,280
Okay. I'm coming.

110
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,280
You're a man.

111
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,280
Go on.

112
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,280
Where's my bag?

113
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,280
Stingy.

114
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,280
What are you doing?

115
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,280
I'm about to vomit.

116
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,280
I should ask you what you're doing.

117
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,280
I'm using the Heimlich method.

118
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,280
I can't vomit.

119
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,280
You...

120
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,280
You think I'm stupid?

121
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,280
The Heimlich method is used to collect the poison.

122
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,280
What are you doing?

123
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,280
Let me go.

124
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,280
It's too late if I don't move.

125
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,280
If you touch him again,

126
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,280
I'll cut your hand.

127
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,280
Why is it so hot?

128
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,280
It's so hot. I need to take a bath.

129
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,280
Miss Suo.

130
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,280
You can't do that.

131
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,280
No.

132
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,280
I need to take a bath.

133
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,280
No.

134
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
What are you doing?

135
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,280
Stingy.

136
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,280
Hold him.

137
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,280
I'll tie him up.

138
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,280
Hurry up. I can't hold him.

139
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,280
I'm so tired.

140
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,280
Why is it so hard to walk when I see you?

141
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,280
What's wrong with him?

142
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,280
Is he poisoned?

143
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,280
He was poisoned.

144
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,280
Wine.

145
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,280
It's over.

146
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,280
I'm so tired.

147
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,280
Don't touch me.

148
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,280
No.

149
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,280
Move away.

150
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,280
It's not fragrant.

151
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,280
Don't touch me.

152
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
Move away.

153
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,280
Don't touch me.

154
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,280
It's over.

155
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,280
Don't touch me.

156
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,280
Good luck.

157
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,280
Jingjing.

158
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,280
Okay.

159
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,280
I'm so stupid.

160
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,280
I thought you only had one woman outside.

161
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
Jingjing.

162
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,280
You came just in time.

163
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,280
I really need you now.

164
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,280
Two is not enough.

165
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,280
Jingjing.

166
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,280
Don't go.

167
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,280
I really need you.

168
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,280
Get out.

169
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
You bastard.

170
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,280
Peng.

171
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,280
I asked you to introduce the investors to Jingjing.

172
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,280
I didn't ask you to play with these dirty tricks.

173
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,280
Miss Sun.

174
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,280
I think you might have a misunderstanding.

175
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,280
You know I'm a good person.

176
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,280
How can I do that?

177
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,280
Give someone else medicine in the wine, right?

178
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,280
Drink one cup.

179
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,280
Mr. Peng.

180
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,280
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

181
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,280
There's only one cup of wine that hasn't been poisoned.

182
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,280
Okay.

183
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,280
If you're not lucky,

184
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,280
you see?

185
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,280
Only he can cure you.

186
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,280
I...

187
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,280
I...

188
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,280
Have you seen this woman?

189
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,280
If you see her,

190
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,280
you must tell us.

191
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,280
Let's go.

192
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,280
It should be her.

193
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,280
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,280
I'm sorry.

195
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,280
