1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,420
It is recommended to consume less sugar

2
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:40,100
to get the better results.

3
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,620
exercised

4
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,620
Episode 10

5
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,460
Qianqian, what are you doing?

6
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:03,860
Leave.

7
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,180
Go live in another woman's house.

8
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,260
Why must I go to Peng Sai's restaurant?

9
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,260
Don't you know who she is?

10
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,140
I don't know who she is.

11
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,500
But I know who you are very well.

12
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,660
This is the swat I found on your sofa bed.

13
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,260
Played from my store to the KTV's kitchen.

14
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,540
Brother Hao Yun, you are playing the real flower.

15
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,020
No.

16
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,340
And

17
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,340
It wasn't what you thought last night.

18
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:31,660
They were poisoned.

19
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,580
I'm saving them.

20
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,300
You gave them medicine.

21
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,820
No, that medicine was for you.

22
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:36,740
What?

23
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,340
No.

24
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,900
Peng Sai gave it to you.

25
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,140
They don't know why they drank it.

26
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,620
It's Mr. Peng Sai again.

27
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,340
Brother Hao Yun.

28
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,620
Why are you so against Mr. Peng Sai?

29
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,140
If you can prove it like last time,

30
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,140
I'll believe you.

31
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,940
Okay, nothing.

32
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,740
Get out of the store now.

33
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,100
Why are you still here?

34
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,020
Dad.

35
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,660
What are you doing?

36
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,020
Ask him.

37
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,220
Daughter.

38
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,540
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,300
I lost again.

40
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,860
I beg you.

41
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,180
Brother Hao Yun.

42
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,340
Please save me.

43
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,580
I beg you.

44
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,220
Dad.

45
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,940
Didn't you say you were going to borrow the poison?

46
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,260
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,580
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,300
Enough.

49
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,780
Hao Youqian.

50
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,940
I finally left you

51
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,460
and started my new life.

52
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,420
Why do you have to do this?

53
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,580
I've made it clear to you.

54
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,780
I've already separated from you.

55
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,100
Even if you die outside,

56
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,900
I won't help you this time.

57
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,700
Daughter.

58
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,980
Listen to me.

59
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,780
It's all my fault.

60
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,180
I'm a jerk.

61
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,660
But this time,

62
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,820
I'm really sorry.

63
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:45,780
I beg you.

64
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,620
Please save me this time.

65
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,820
Just this time.

66
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,100
I promise

67
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,580
I won't touch the poison again.

68
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,500
I'll leave all my money to you.

69
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,660
Daughter.

70
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,060
Daughter.

71
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,180
Okay.

72
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,020
Brother Hao Yun.

73
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,340
I saved you.

74
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,660
I took you in.

75
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,580
Do you remember?

76
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,540
I beg you to save me.

77
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,060
I beg you to help me.

78
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,060
I beg you.

79
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,220
Please save me.

80
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,220
I beg you.

81
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,900
I really know I was wrong.

82
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,340
Okay.

83
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,740
I'll be the one to blame.

84
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,980
He's your father after all.

85
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,180
Bring me 200,000 dollars

86
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,180
to redeem him.

87
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,580
Or I'll cut his back.

88
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,180
Go.

89
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,580
If you kill him,

90
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,980
I won't redeem him.

91
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,340
Why don't you go?

92
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,380
Go with me.

93
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,740
If you save him...

94
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,060
it will give me more right?

95
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,220
Why don't I give it a try

96
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,180
You go.

97
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,620
I don't need your help.

98
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,780
I don't want to save him either.

99
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,100
After all, he saved me.

100
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,220
I have to repay this favor.

101
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,100
Boss,

102
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,820
there's someone outside the casino.

103
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,740
Tell me.

104
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,860
What are you doing here?

105
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,460
I'm here to exchange for the money.

106
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,940
You let him go.

107
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,340
I'll be the one who's under pressure.

108
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:56,900
Little brother,

109
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,100
we're running a casino,

110
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,660
not selling pigs.

111
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,940
But the money is too old

112
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,460
and his body has been stolen.

113
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,940
Even if he's a crook,

114
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,340
he's a cheater.

115
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,340
Why don't you give me a few days to raise money

116
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,460
and let him go?

117
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,580
Let him go is okay.

118
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,100
But you have to bet with me

119
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,580
with your waist.

120
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:19,780
If you win,

121
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,620
I'll let him go.

122
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,740
What?

123
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,340
Are you scared?

124
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,740
Okay, I bet.

125
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,540
Okay.

126
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,620
Let's bet a little simpler.

127
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,340
Guess the money.

128
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,140
Let's bet.

129
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,260
Put a handful of melon seeds.

130
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,460
Guess the number of melon seeds.

131
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,860
Is it one or two?

132
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,540
You can feel the weight

133
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,180
before you bet.

134
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,860
Judging the number of melon seeds

135
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,860
by the weight of melon seeds and the seed.

136
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,700
It's not hard at all.

137
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,700
The amount of melon seeds is about 45 grams.

138
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,060
One melon seed is about 0.25 grams.

139
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,940
Eight grams.

140
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,140
Eight grams.

141
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,260
How's it going?

142
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,460
Have you decided?

143
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,540
The menu or the bet?

144
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,340
Bet.

145
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,780
Then we'll bet.

146
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:53,900
Seven grams.

147
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,620
The number of melon seeds.

148
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,500
How is it possible?

149
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,100
It's clearly eight grams.

150
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,140
You bet on the money.

151
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,700
Young man,

152
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,100
this is your first time in the casino.

153
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,300
The casino is the place to bet.

154
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,580
This is the place to bet.

155
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,620
Bet on the money.

156
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:11,900
Come on.

157
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,540
Get rid of the demon.

158
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,820
You bet on the money.

159
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,380
Wait.

160
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,020
Let's bet again.

161
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,340
What are you betting on?

162
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,060
I have the liver and lung.

163
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,260
Do you dare to bet?

164
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,340
Demon.

165
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,500
Demon.

166
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,420
My demon.

167
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,140
My demon.

168
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:33,740
My demon.

169
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,500
My demon.

170
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,020
My demon.

171
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,100
My demon.

172
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,460
Sorry.

173
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,180
The equipment is a bit simple.

174
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,140
Don't mind it.

175
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:47,940
How's it going?

176
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,300
Are you still betting?

177
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,220
Yes.

178
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,540
You know we bet on the money.

179
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,580
Why do you still bet?

180
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,020
Anyway,

181
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,660
the money says they saved my life.

182
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,540
Even if it hurts my life,

183
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,940
I'll bet on it.

184
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:08,660
Good.

185
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,500
I'll give you a good one.

186
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,100
I bet on the money.

187
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,420
Little brother.

188
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,900
You're a bit capable.

189
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,420
But you're still too young.

190
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,500
I'll win this round.

191
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,620
In the casino,

192
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,740
losing and winning

193
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,340
are decided by the Zhuang family.

194
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,140
Really?

195
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,820
Do you dare to bet?

196
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,780
I dare not bet.

197
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,460
If I lose,

198
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,300
you can take away

199
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,420
the valuable organs on me.

200
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,460
If I win,

201
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,420
I'll go back safely

202
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,940
with the money.

203
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,540
Young man.

204
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,380
I admire your courage

205
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,700
and personality.

206
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,460
But

207
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:29,540
you will pay for your reckless and ignorant.

208
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,780
Unfortunately,

209
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,700
no one can win in my casino.
