1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,740
It got a lot of chase, the shifts and

2
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,360
You really go fishing with me.

3
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,320
A belter?

4
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,240
A belter.

5
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,740
So you'll catch me long.

6
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,080
Hey...

7
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,340
Time is over.

8
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,040
Welcome back.

9
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,760
Only Shiting's

10
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,020
only my skirt.

11
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,020
Milk

12
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:26,220
Mash

13
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,020
No Yi

14
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,940
She can beat No Yi, who is ranked third.

15
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,220
Is she really...

16
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,660
You lost. Give me back the glasses.

17
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,860
Play another round with me.

18
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,900
No Yi, you can lose if you play again.

19
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,020
Are you trying to play tricks?

20
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,860
Do you want it?

21
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,700
Come and take it.

22
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,980
You...

23
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,980
It doesn't matter.

24
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,060
You can play tricks when you get drunk.

25
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,940
I'm also an extension and...

26
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,700
I know everyone knows Zhang of the pro-cu round.

27
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,820
I had some strength to really beat her.

28
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,820
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,260
Luo Yixian

30
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,720
You lost to him

31
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,020
It seems

32
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,900
You can't leave him alive

33
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,640
I won't let you touch him. I haven't played enough

34
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,960
Leave him to me

35
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,560
I'll handle the charity poker contest

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay

37
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
I'll go to the toilet

38
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,820
Jingjing

39
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,340
Let me do it

40
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,020
Jingjing, I was wrong last night

41
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,140
I did gamble in the Sun family's casino

42
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,640
But there is a reason

43
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,900
Brother Hao Ying, of course you have a reason

44
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,800
But don't tell me, I don't want to hear it

45
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,840
Jingjing, Miss Sun said

46
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,760
She can give us a gold card

47
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,760
Enough

48
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,760
Brother Hao Ying

49
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,600
Can you stop gambling for yourself?

50
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
And

51
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,580
About the gold card

52
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,000
Mr. Peng has already helped me do it

53
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
What?

54
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,360
You went to see Mr. Peng again?

55
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,760
Mr. Peng is not a good person. Don't be fooled by him

56
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,400
I don't know if Mr. Peng is a good person

57
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
But I know

58
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,400
You are definitely not a good person

59
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,380
You will become like my father one day

60
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,160
Once you bet on this thing

61
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,960
There is no turning back

62
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
Jingjing, I

63
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,400
Hello

64
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,400
Hello

65
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,400
I am Lawyer Jin Dazhuang

66
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
You should know me well

67
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,000
I won't introduce myself

68
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,720
I am here to be entrusted by someone

69
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,160
To deliver the copyright of the gold store

70
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,160
The copyright of the gold store?

71
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,920
So fast

72
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,000
This person doesn't look like a lawyer

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,600
Is it fake?

74
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,400
A career is not a matter of status

75
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,400
Who said a lawyer can't ride a bicycle?

76
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,400
This is called low carbon environmental protection

77
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,400
What are you doing?

78
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
It's really the gold store

79
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
What's up Jingjing?

80
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Mr. Peng

81
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,400
Someone just sent the copyright of the gold store

82
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,400
Thank you Mr. Peng

83
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
What is this? Who am I?

84
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
An important partner of the Sun family

85
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,400
What's the point of a small store?

86
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,400
I promised you

87
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,400
I will definitely do it

88
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
I will definitely do it

89
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,400
I promise you

90
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
I promise you

91
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
I promise you

92
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,400
I promise you

93
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,400
I promise you

94
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
I promise you

95
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,400
I earned the store

96
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
How did it become yours?

97
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,400
You earned the gold store?

98
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
Jingjing, don't believe her

99
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,400
She is a liar

100
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,400
Brother Haoyun

101
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,400
Now it's Mr. Peng who helped me get the gold store

102
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,400
You said he is a bad person

103
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,400
What do you mean by going gambling behind my back?

104
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,400
Jingjing, gambling

105
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
This is not good

106
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,400
Don't you know that Jingjing hates gambling the most?

107
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,400
This kind of person is not worth your attention

108
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,400
Remember

109
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Leave it to me

110
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
Jingjing

111
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,400
Do you know what to do?

112
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
What are you doing?

113
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,400
Don't hit him

114
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,400
It's okay

115
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,400
I'm doing it for him

116
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,400
Do you understand?

117
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,400
You have to hit him once

118
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Do you think he will gamble next time?

119
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,400
No

120
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,400
Let's see if our hearts are not good

121
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,400
Go

122
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
I

123
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Go

124
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
Wait for me to send the evidence to Jingjing

125
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
See what she says

126
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
See

127
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,400
This is the bargaining chip your little restaurant has been mortgaged on me

128
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,400
You owe me a lot

129
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
You can take it

130
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
Take it

131
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,400
Remember

132
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
If you want to play again, go to me

133
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,400
I won't make it difficult for you in our relationship

134
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,400
I'm sorry

135
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
I'm sorry

136
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,400
I'm sorry

137
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Jingjing, I'm doing some thinking work

138
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
President Peng, I'll give you a ride

139
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
Good luck

140
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,400
You are hurt

141
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
It will be better if you get some ice

142
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
Thank you

143
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,400
Who is that Jingjing?

144
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,400
You actually do so much for her

145
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,400
Maybe we crossed the boat secretly

146
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
I was drowned on the beach

147
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
I was injured on my head and I can't remember anything

148
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,400
Jingjing didn't care about the money and insisted on taking me home

149
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,400
They gave me a good name according to the information on the boat ticket

150
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,400
Jingjing doesn't dislike me for stealing and playing black magic

151
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,400
She gave me food and shelter and paid me

152
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,400
I don't know how to repay her kindness

153
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,400
Then you should make up with her

154
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,400
Not what you think

155
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Miss Sun, I always want to apologize to you

156
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,400
I'm sorry for making you angry last time

157
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,400
But I still want to know

158
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,400
You hate gambling so much

159
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Why do you have to find someone to take part in the charity poker competition?

160
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,400
She is so sincere

161
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Tell her my thoughts

162
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,400
Maybe she will help me

163
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,400
Only by winning the charity poker competition

164
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,400
I can take back the right to run the gambling factory

165
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,400
And cut the family's gambling business

166
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,400
The gambling is not just about money

167
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,400
But also their family and life

168
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,400
My parents are also...

169
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,400
Miss, the car is here. We can go

170
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
Give me a pen

171
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
Take it

172
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,400
This is my personal number

173
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,400
I don't care what you think

174
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,400
But I really hope you can help me

175
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:13,400
Miss, are you interested in this boy?

176
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
I'm afraid of the police

177
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
You know I hate gambling

178
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
I...

179
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,400
I'm just using him

180
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
Yes, you are so beautiful

181
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,400
How can you like him?

182
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:31,400
But you haven't seen anyone for so many years

183
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:38,400
Miss, since he doesn't want to help us

184
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,400
I will go to see Mokun

185
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,400
Ok

186
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,400
But I have a way to make him help me

187
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,400
But if Mokun can go out

188
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,400
We will have double insurance

189
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,400
Yes

190
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
Great

191
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,400
Congratulations

192
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
Thank you

193
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,400
Welcome to the gambling factory

194
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
Congratulations

195
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,400
Come on, brother

196
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
Congratulations

197
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,400
Mr. Peng Sai

198
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,400
Come on

199
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
Please

200
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
Stand here

201
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,400
Mr. Peng Sai

202
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,400
Mr. Peng Sai

203
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Dad, Mr. Peng Sai invited you here

204
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
You can stay here

205
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,400
But after the ceremony

206
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,400
You will go back to your restaurant

207
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,400
Don't see me again

208
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,400
We are family

209
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
It's not good

210
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,400
I won't forget what you did before

211
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,400
Jingjing

212
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,400
Why are you here?

213
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,400
Go back

214
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,400
I want Jingjing

215
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
You are a blind man

216
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
You are a blind man

217
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
Why is she here?

218
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,400
Listen

219
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,400
Today is the day of Mr. Peng Sai and Jingjing's wedding

220
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,400
Don't be a third wheel

221
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,400
It will hurt their relationship

222
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,400
Jingjing

223
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,400
You should be careful

224
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,400
Mr. Peng Sai is not a good person

225
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,400
I have video evidence

226
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,400
No

227
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,400
And the store has nothing to do with him

228
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
He is lying to you

229
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,400
You

230
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,400
How can you talk like that?

231
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,400
Are you a monster?

232
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
Wait

233
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
Mr. Peng Sai

234
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
You are revenge for my dad

235
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,400
You have been persuading him to quit

236
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
Jingjing

237
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,400
You really believe what he said?

238
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
Why is there no sound?

239
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,400
Forget it

240
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
There was no sound

241
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
But it's me

242
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,400
Jingjing

243
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,400
I got the chips from the casino

244
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,400
I asked him to pay the money

245
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
To quit the gambling

246
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
Ask him if you don't believe

247
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,400
I have the money

248
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,400
I have the money

249
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,400
I have the money

250
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
I have the money

251
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,400
I have the money

252
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,400
I have the money

253
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,400
I have the money

254
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,400
I have the money

255
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,400
I have the money

256
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,400
I have the money

257
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,400
Mr. Peng Sai has been helping me to quit gambling

258
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,400
Jingjing

259
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
It's not like that

260
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,400
They lied to you

261
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,400
You said that you didn't earn this store

262
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,400
Ok

263
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,400
Then tell us today

264
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,400
How did you earn it?

265
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,400
It's Sun Yiqian

266
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,400
I helped him

267
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
He promised me

268
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,400
Miss Sun who is famous in Laiwan

269
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,400
You helped her

270
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,400
If you don't know how to brag, don't brag

271
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
I'm a man who is honest in Laiwan

272
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:43,400
I have been with the Sun family for many years

273
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
You don't think I'm kidding

274
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,400
Kidding

275
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,400
You prove that you helped Jingjing to get this store

276
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,400
I don't have time to talk nonsense with you

277
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,400
This store is the store that I invested in

278
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,400
The boss

279
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,400
Jingjing and me

280
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,400
If you want to stay

281
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,400
Show your attitude

282
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,400
You will be nice

283
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,400
Or you kneel down and kowtow to me

284
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,400
I can't help thinking about keeping you

285
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,400
Bullshit

286
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,400
You are not a boss at all

287
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,400
Arrogant

288
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
Take it down

289
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
No, don't hit people

290
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,400
Don't hit him

291
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,400
You let him go

292
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,400
Let him go

293
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,400
Don't touch the kowtow

294
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,400
Hurry up

295
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,400
Don't touch the kowtow

296
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,400
I have a strong desire for success

297
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,400
The world is just a devil

298
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
It's okay

299
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,400
Don't touch

300
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,400
Miss Sun

301
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,400
What's wrong with Miss Sun

302
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,400
She must know that I am opening today

303
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,400
I came to congratulate me

304
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,400
Miss Sun

305
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
You came today

306
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
The store is really a place to be proud

307
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,400
Miss Sun

308
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,400
Come on

309
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,400
You still have so many things

310
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,400
It's embarrassing, right?

311
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,400
Who are you

312
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,400
I

313
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,400
Miss Sun

314
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,400
Get out of the way

315
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,400
Don't go

316
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,400
I came today

317
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,400
To give her a gift

318
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,400
Miss Sun

319
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,400
I'm sorry

320
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
