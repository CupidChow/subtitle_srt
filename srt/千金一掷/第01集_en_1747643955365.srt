1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,940
Stand By Me

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,200
Rye Rong

3
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,580
именно

4
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,380
blush

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,880
엔,

6
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,240
Huangjiaton Huashun.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Hello, Miss.

8
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Dad, mom,

9
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
I'm back.

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'll get everything

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
that belongs to the Sun family back.

12
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,000
This is my promise to you.

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Miss,

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
it's settled.

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
According to the police investigation,

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
the Sun family

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
is the only one who has the right to

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
get the right to the game.

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The bet between the God of Gambling and Mu Kun

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
was on a cruise ship.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But the God of Gambling lost.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I don't know why

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
the cruise ship exploded

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and Mu Kun was rescued.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But the whereabouts are unknown.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Miss,

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
listen to me.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Don't get involved in

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
the charity poker competition.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
No.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The charity poker competition

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
is the only chance

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
for me to get back

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
the right to the Sun family's casino.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But without the help of the God of Gambling,

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
how can I win the competition

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and the prize?

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Since it's said that Mu Kun

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
can win the God of Gambling,

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
isn't Mu Kun

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
our new candidate?

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Come on.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Come on.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Come on.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Go on.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Go on.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
He's paying the money

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
for the low price.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Uncle, stop gambling.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
If we lose the money

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Jin Jin gave us,

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
we can't run the restaurant.

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You don't know how to be grateful.

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
If my family didn't live by the sea

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and took you back,

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
you would have starved to death.

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Come on.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm warning you.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Don't touch my Zhaocaizhen.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
If you keep talking,

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'll kick you out

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and then

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'll help you steal the gambling

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and lock you up in the prison.

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It seems that I'm lucky today.

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I finally got the high.

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'll kill you.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Miss.

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
This is a place for the three departments.

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Why are you here

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
to cook fish?

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Uncle,

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm here to cook fish.

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm here to cook fish.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm here to cook fish.

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm here to cook fish.

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm here to cook fish.

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm here to cook fish.

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm here to cook fish.

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You're looking for someone?

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm looking for someone.

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Give me your cigarette.

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Come on. Hurry up.

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I heard that the leader of your company

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
is the late Emperor Mu Kun.

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
He's the leader of your company.

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Show me some respect.

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Take me to meet him.

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Go away if you don't gamble.

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Where did you come from?

91
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'll slap you.

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What are you doing?

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
How dare you hit me?

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Wait.

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Miss.

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Sorry.

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's a misunderstanding.

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's okay.

99
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's okay.

100
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What's okay?

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You almost destroyed my Zhaocaizhen.

102
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's me.

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You're not hurt.

104
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Wait.

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Wait. Which side are you on?

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Go on.

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Take me to see Mu Kun.

108
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
This is your money.

109
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
This...

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Why are you looking for my boss?

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Do you need an explanation now?

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
No.

113
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You have to make an appointment

114
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
to see my boss.

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This...

116
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'll take you there now.

117
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'll take you there.

118
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Wait.

119
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
No.

120
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You have to give me half of the cards.

121
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You have to finish this round.

122
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay.

123
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I can stop you

124
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
if you want to give me money.

125
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Okay.

126
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Finish this round.

127
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Uncle.

128
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Stop gambling.

129
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You're going to lose this round.

130
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Let's go.

131
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You can see the way out.

132
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
No.

133
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I saw the gambler

134
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
was too bad at playing cards.

135
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
He couldn't play good cards.

136
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Uncle.

137
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Let's go.

138
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You're lying.

139
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm in a bad mood.

140
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Don't talk nonsense here.

141
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Wait.

142
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What are you talking about?

143
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Why don't you do it?

144
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You...

145
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Miss.

146
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Let's not meddle in the business.

147
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Let him learn a lesson.

148
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Since you don't want us to leave,

149
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'll let you

150
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
spit out all the money you just cheated.

151
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Give me the cards.

152
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Okay.

153
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Three.

154
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I quit.

155
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
No.

156
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'll take the money.

157
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'll take the money.

158
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I took it.

159
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Okay.

160
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I won.

161
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You're so lucky.

162
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
How is that possible?

163
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's all my fault.

164
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
He got hurt so quickly.

165
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He actually found Trace

166
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
in the queue so quickly.

167
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
No.

168
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You're gambling.

169
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
No. What are you doing?

170
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You're gambling.

171
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Put the money down.

172
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
How can you cheat?

173
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What are you doing?

174
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'll kill you.

175
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You're gambling.

176
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
How can you hurt people?

177
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Give me the money.

178
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Hurry up.

179
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Stop.

180
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Are you okay?

181
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Thank you.

182
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Haoyue.

183
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Let's go.

184
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Let's go.

185
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Miss.

186
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He's quite something.

187
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
God bless me.

188
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm so blessed.

189
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I was picking you up.

190
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It was written on the ticket.

191
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'll put a lucky number on it

192
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and name you Haoyue.

193
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But why don't you

194
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
have any luck?

195
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You...

196
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You're useless.

197
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'll call you unlucky.

198
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Where's the fish you want to buy?

199
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Dad.

200
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm going to buy some fish.

201
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'll buy some fish.

202
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'll buy some fish.

203
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Dad.

204
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You lost all your money again.

205
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I didn't lose.

206
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I won today.

207
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What about the fish?

208
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Who let that guy cheat

209
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
and take all the money?

210
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Dad.

211
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Can you stop gambling?

212
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I...

213
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's not my fault.

214
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I was lucky to take it.

215
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
This is his card.

216
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Uncle.

217
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
No.

218
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Jingjing.

219
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I didn't.

220
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Do you think I'm blind?

221
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
If you keep gambling,

222
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
this family will be gone.

223
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You...

224
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You can't live like this.

225
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You...

226
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Jingjing.

227
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Mo Pan Bi.

228
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
If there's nothing else,

229
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
please go back.

230
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I have something to do.

231
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Take it.

232
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Of course I have something to do.

233
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And it's a good thing.

234
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
When we were kids,

235
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
we only paid for the wedding.

236
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Today I'm here

237
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
to make a marriage contract

238
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and marry you.

239
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You're really joking.

240
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I've never heard of this.

241
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Lawyer Jin.

242
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Lawyer Jin.

243
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Is it true?

244
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
As the senior of Sun Group

245
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
for more than 30 years,

246
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I can assure you

247
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
that this marriage contract is true.

248
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But as the most famous lawyer

249
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
in Laiwan,

250
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I can tell you responsibly

251
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
that the so-called marriage contract

252
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
doesn't have legal effect.

253
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What doesn't have legal effect?

254
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Let's go.

255
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Let's go.

256
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
This is a marriage contract between two families.

257
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
If Sun Family doesn't make a marriage contract,

258
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
then the directors and the bookworms

259
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
won't believe Sun Family anymore.

260
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Mo Pan Bi.

261
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Don't think I don't know what you're thinking.

262
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You're afraid that

263
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
you won't get the right to run the casino

264
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
in the charity competition next month.

265
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So now you want to use the marriage contract

266
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
to split my shares.

267
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
No.

268
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Dream on.

269
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So what?

270
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Do you want to

271
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
go against the board of directors?

272
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What a pity!

273
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I've already engaged with someone else.

274
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Mo Pan Bi.

275
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Laiwan.

276
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Mo Pan Bi is the only one

277
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
who deserves to be the daughter of our Sun Family.

278
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Why not?

279
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
My marriage contract is...

280
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's...

281
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's...

282
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's her.

283
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
She's my fiancee.

284
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm sorry.

285
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm sorry.

286
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm sorry.

287
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm sorry.

288
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm sorry.

289
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm sorry.

290
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm sorry.

291
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm sorry.

292
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm sorry.

294
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm sorry.

295
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm sorry.

296
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm sorry.

297
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm sorry.

298
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm sorry.

299
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm sorry.

300
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm sorry.

301
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm sorry.

302
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm sorry.

303
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm sorry.

304
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm sorry.

305
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm sorry.

306
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm sorry.

307
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm sorry.

308
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm sorry.

309
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm sorry.

310
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm sorry.

311
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm sorry.

312
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm sorry.

313
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Let go of too many wild plants

314
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
How to absorb the ordinary darkness

315
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Youth is easier to be destroyed than the present

316
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Come on, the time of love

317
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Use it to burn the burning fire

318
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Let this golden paradise be mine

319
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Fall like a burning sword

320
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The five-moon voice is gently singing

321
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Become the final victor

322
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Before dawn, use the skill to turn the night

323
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I read the sky's chains

324
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's a mirror, it's a gentle hand

325
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I was born to have the power to break through

326
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's fate that makes me alone
