1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
How was it?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Were you enjoying it...?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Oh, you're毒� Murder going on everywhere

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Avada carne!

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,960
Very funny

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,920

Episode 2

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Brother Hao Yun, I'm coming.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Brother Hao Yun, I'm coming.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Sister, be careful.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Be careful.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Why don't you wear clothes?

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I just finished the toilet. It's a little stinky.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I took a shower.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Wait for me. I'll be right there.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'll be right there.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'll be right there.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm almost done.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Sun Yi Qing, what do you mean?

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What do you mean?

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I think you're not just trying to help him win the charity poker competition.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You want to get his person?

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
He...

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
He's just a gambler.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You know I hate these people the most.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But...

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He's a good gambler.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
He should be quite in your taste.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You're not just trying to make him gamble with you, are you?

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Since you know it all,

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
you can save your energy.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
He's mine.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Thank you. I'm afraid he'll fall for me.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Hello, Mr. Mo.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Hello.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Mr. Mo,

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
we have news from Sun Yi Qing.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Go ahead.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He said that Sun Yi Qing

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
would go to a fast food restaurant for lunch tomorrow.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You don't have to report

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
such a small matter.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yes.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Should I let him do it?

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
No.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Just let him

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
make an appointment with the board of directors.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
K is a big shot.

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's a big shot.

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It can't be exposed

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
until the critical moment.

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Understood.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Mo.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I was in the bathroom last night.

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I didn't mean to.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let me help you wipe the medicine.

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's okay.

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
No need.

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I can do it myself.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Qingqing!

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Qingqing!

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Qingqing!

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Qingqing!

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Qingqing!

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Qingqing!

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I want to tell you

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
about the store.

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm sorry. It's a misunderstanding.

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's all over.

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Mr. Peng Sai doesn't have to mention it.

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm here for another thing.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I just found out

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
that a very powerful boss

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
is coming to invest in the chain store.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I think

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
it's a good idea.

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The chain store?

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yes.

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But

85
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
it's just opened.

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm afraid I can't make it.

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
People go up,

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
water goes down.

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
When you join the chain store

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and become a big boss,

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
you'll know

92
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
how to make money.

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Really?

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Of course.

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You don't have to worry about

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
capital operation.

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'll do it.

98
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
When you have enough money

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
to count,

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
you should thank me.

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Here.

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The address of the meeting tonight

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
is here.

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Tan Jiameng.

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Jin Jin, don't believe him.

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He's a liar.

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
He said he owed him

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
30 million yuan.

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He didn't.

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I...

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Don't come to see Jin Jin again.

112
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Or I'll beat you

113
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
once.

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Wait, Haoyun.

115
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The person who's after us

116
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
didn't come to us.

117
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You

118
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
speak for him.

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I beg you.

120
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Don't delay Jin Jin's

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
future.

122
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
If I didn't pay,

123
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
would anyone come to us?

124
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Someone paid for us.

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Someone paid for us?

126
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Are you going to use Miss Sun

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
as a shield?

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
If I didn't pay,

129
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
would you pay?

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
30 million yuan has nothing to do with Miss Sun.

131
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm not that close with her.

132
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Haoyun.

133
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's been days.

134
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Did you miss me?

135
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Oh, I brought you a gift.

136
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Jin Jin, you're here too?

137
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Oh, my.

138
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Why is she here?

139
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Mr. Peng,

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
let's go see the investor.

141
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Jin Jin, don't go with her.

142
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
She's lying to you.

143
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's none of your business.

144
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm sorry, Miss Sun.

145
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I have something to do.

146
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'll go first.

147
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Let Haoyun take care of you.

148
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Miss Sun, goodbye.

149
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Jin Jin.

150
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Miss Sun, I have something to do.

151
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Let's talk tomorrow.

152
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Haoyun, wait.

153
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Haoyun, you went after her today

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
and persuaded her.

155
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What about tomorrow?

156
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
She has a strong ambition.

157
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You can't always protect her.

158
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But as long as you win the competition

159
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
for our Miss,

160
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
you're her ambition.

161
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Jin Jin,

162
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
you don't have to deal with people like Peng Sai.

163
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Uncle Pasha,

164
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
let her go.

165
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yes.

166
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Why didn't you meet anyone else?

167
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's still early.

168
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Besides, the big boss

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
likes to be late.

170
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Jin Jin,

171
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
do you know why I'm so concerned

172
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
about you?

173
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Because I've been

174
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
taking care of you for a long time.

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm sorry.

176
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Because I've already

177
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
treated you as my future wife.

178
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Mr. Peng Sai, you're really funny.

179
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm sincere to you, Jin Jin.

180
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I've done so much for you.

181
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Don't you know

182
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
how much I love you?

183
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Mr. Peng Sai.

184
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's okay.

185
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'll get a bottle of wine.

186
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You can relax.

187
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Peng Sai.

189
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Wait.

190
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Put this in the wine

191
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
and send it to my room.

192
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Listen,

193
