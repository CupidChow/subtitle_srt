00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
How to make a

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,400
aquatic plant

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,140
A s車

4
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,920
development

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,980
is the best to use on road

6
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:46,180
Thanks to our Но都明家

7
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,260
Do not talk. hunter me

8
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,300
what?

9
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:57,620
You...

10
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,620
Don't do this.

11
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,220
I'm just here to work.

12
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,620
Don't get so close to me.

13
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,860
You dare to take advantage of me.

14
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:06,580
I'll kill you.

15
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,860
I didn't move.

16
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,660
You're the one who's moving.

17
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,660
Sun Yiqian.

18
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,780
I think you're hungry.

19
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,580
You can even eat this kind of stuff.

20
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,820
He's not an ordinary person.

21
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,220
He...

22
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,220
He's the disciple of the Poison God.

23
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,100
He's a gold finger.

24
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,060
When did I become

25
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,900
the disciple of the Poison God?

26
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,820
When did the Poison God become a disciple?

27
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,900
I'm disappointed in you.

28
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,180
Pacha said

29
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,500
I should send him off.

30
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,060
Young Master Mo.

31
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,660
Please go back.

32
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,060
I think he looks like a dog in the countryside.

33
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,860
How could he be the disciple of the Poison God?

34
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,820
The Sun family and the Poison God are always secretive.

35
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,980
You're an outsider.

36
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,180
You know too much.

37
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,540
Besides,

38
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,220
don't you think

39
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,340
the dog is cute?

40
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,420
Let's go.

41
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,660
Wait.

42
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,540
If the dog is really a gold finger,

43
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,900
do you dare to bet with me?

44
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,340
Mo Panbi.

45
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,140
What do you think you're qualified to bet with the Poison God's disciple?

46
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,300
Well...

47
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,620
Is the dog a fake?

48
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,820
You dare not bet with me?

49
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,060
You're a dog.

50
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,980
You don't value the gold finger.

51
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,580
Fine.

52
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,580
If you lose,

53
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,260
you'll learn from your dog.

54
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,100
I don't want to get involved in your business.

55
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,420
I don't want to bet.

56
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,020
I'm telling you.

57
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,540
The person in front of me is a bad guy.

58
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,460
If you don't help me,

59
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,820
he'll take my property

60
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,940
and take my body.

61
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,580
I know you're a good person.

62
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,260
If you don't help me,

63
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,820
your conscience will hurt.

64
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,540
It hurts.

65
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,060
My conscience hurts.

66
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,220
Have you two had enough?

67
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,020
Stop arguing.

68
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,980
Stop it.

69
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,140
Dezhou, Black Jack,

70
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,100
and Shaizi.

71
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,260
What are you betting on?

72
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,900
I don't know how to bet.

73
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,180
No...

74
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,780
He doesn't know how to bet?

75
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,620
Right.

76
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,860
He looks like a dog.

77
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,700
How could he be a gold finger?

78
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,420
Good luck means

79
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,060
he won't lose.

80
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,020
tasted だいじょう

81
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,140
If you make a bet,

82
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,180
it'll be a big statement.

83
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,380
So,

84
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,340
what about the Pepper Wash?

85
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,500
I can't do it.

86
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,660
I...

87
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,660
Uncle Pachar told me to come and fight with him.

88
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,660
You just need to be the same as the one in the jade card.

89
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,660
I believe you are a little lucky.

90
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,660
I...I...

91
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,660
It's a potion.

92
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,660
It can be a mark on the back of the card.

93
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,660
The ink pen with special eyes can know the size of the white face.

94
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,660
Please.

95
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,660
You first.

96
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,660
The third one on the left.

97
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,660
Forget it.

98
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,660
The situation is unclear.

99
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,660
Let's listen to him.

100
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,660
The third one on the left.

101
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,660
I'm sorry.

102
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,660
I'm Black-Tao Ace.

103
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,660
You are so lucky.

104
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:00,660
But if you win three games, you can't rely on luck.

105
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,660
When did I say three games and two wins?

106
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,660
You didn't say a game of life and death.

107
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,660
Okay.

108
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,660
Whatever.

109
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,660
I'll see how you win me.

110
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,660
But I have a condition.

111
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,660
If I win the second game,

112
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,660
you have to fulfill your engagement and marry me.

113
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,660
I'm sorry.

114
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,660
I'll see how you win me.

115
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,660
Black-Tao Ace.

116
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,660
Black-Tao Ace.

117
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,660
Black-Tao Ace.

118
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,660
You are even.

119
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,660
Is Mr. Mo Pan Bi also Black-Tao Ace?

120
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,660
There is only one Black-Tao Ace in a card.

121
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,660
Mr. Mo is not old.

122
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,660
How can he be always Black-Tao Ace?

123
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,660
You are lucky.

124
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,660
Next game.

125
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,660
I didn't expect this doggy has something.

126
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,660
Next game, I'll turn Black-Tao Ace over and kill him.

127
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,660
Next game, I'll draw the cards first.

128
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,660
This is not the rule.

129
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,660
You drew the last game first.

130
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,660
I've given up three games and two wins.

131
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,660
You can't give up once.

132
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,660
You.

133
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,660
Okay.

134
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,660
But I have a condition.

135
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,660
I'll play the next game.

136
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,660
Play the game?

137
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,660
Whatever you play.

138
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,660
No problem.

139
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,660
I can find Black-Tao Ace no matter how you play.

140
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,660
No, I...

141
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,660
I can't.

142
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,660
What's wrong?

143
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,660
When did he change the government card?

144
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,660
You draw one.

145
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,660
Wow, two square pieces.

146
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,660
What card do you want to draw to win?

147
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,660
Maybe I can't lose any card.

148
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,660
Two square pieces is the smallest card.

149
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,660
Really?

150
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,660
I quit.

151
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,660
Mr. Mo Pa Mi.

152
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,660
Did you forget something?

153
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,660
What did I forget?

154
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,660
You forgot that you have to learn doggy's lesson if you lose.

155
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,660
When did I say that?

156
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,660
Go back.

157
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,660
Go away.

158
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,660
Don't get in my way.

159
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,660
Go away.

160
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,660
I'm sorry.

161
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,660
Our dog doesn't understand human language.

162
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,660
If you want him to give way,

163
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,660
you have to communicate with him.

164
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,660
I...

165
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,660
Sit down.

166
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,660
Mo Pa Mi is really good at doggy's lesson.

167
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,660
Even the dog can understand it.

168
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,660
You guys wait.

169
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,660
I won't let you go.

170
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,660
Wait.

171
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,660
Miss Sun, I have something to do.

172
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,660
I have to go.

173
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,660
Don't come to me for this kind of thing.

174
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,660
Miss.

175
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,660
This person's reading is not clear.

176
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,660
And the source is not clear.

177
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,660
It can't be used.

178
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,660
Do we have other choices?

179
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,660
The charity poker contest will be held next month.

180
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,660
Mu Kun hasn't found it yet.

181
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,660
I think he can.

182
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,660
What?

183
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,660
You just left without money?

184
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,660
What do you want me to do?

185
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,660
Sit on the field of our Sun family.

186
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,660
Help me win the charity poker contest next month.

187
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,660
No.

188
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,660
I can't do this job.

189
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,660
I have asked around.

190
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,660
You like a gold street shop lately.

191
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,660
As long as you agree to help me,

192
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,660
I can give it to you directly.

193
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,660
Gold street shop.

194
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,660
Oh, right, Brother Haoyun.

195
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,660
I asked you to help me ask about the gold street shop.

196
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,660
How is it?

197
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,660
Look.

198
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,660
This shop looks really good.

199
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,660
It's too expensive.

200
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,660
In the future, I must have my own shop and life.

201
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,660
I must leave Hao Youqian.

202
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,660
I want to leave here before he sucks my blood.

203
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,660
Brother Haoyun.

204
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,660
The most hateful thing in my life is the poisonous ghost.

205
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,660
You promise me.

206
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,660
Don't cut the poisonous fire.

207
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,660
Even if it's not once.

208
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,660
Jingjing, don't worry.

209
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,660
Haoyue.

210
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,660
I'm here to thank you for your help on the fish card.

211
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,660
So our Sun family decided to provide you with a job.

212
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,660
Uncle.

213
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,660
You don't have to be polite.

214
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,660
I don't need a job.

215
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,660
I already have a job.

216
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,660
Don't be busy with the answer.

217
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,660
Think about it.

218
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,660
After thinking about it, call me.

219
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,660
I will help Jingjing live a good life.

220
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,660
Don't pretend to be a good person.

221
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,660
As long as you promise to cooperate with me.

222
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,660
Money and shop.

223
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,660
It's all yours.

224
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,660
Brother Haoyue.

225
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,660
Bad news.

226
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,660
I'm sorry.

227
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,660

230
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,660
I'm sorry.

231
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,660
Brother Haoyue.

232
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,660
Bad news.

233
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,660
What's wrong, Jingjing?

234
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,660
My dad, he...

235
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,660
Go.

236
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,660
You're gambling without money.

237
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,660
One more time.

238
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,660
One more time.

239
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,660
I will win.

240
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,660
Believe me.

241
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,660
Stop talking nonsense.

242
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,660
Left hand or right hand.

243
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,660
You choose one.

244
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,660
Can I see the nail?

245
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,660
You're playing tricks on me.

246
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,660
I'm sorry.

247
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,660
