1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
Thanks for watching...

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:50,300
After the purpose of the Sh Quadrant,

3
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:58,820
Agreed.

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What?

5
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This...

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I know how you draw.

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
There is a scale on the table.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You can weigh the number of melon seeds.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And one of the melon seeds has a magnet.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Use your magnetic ring to control the melon seed's single pair.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
But there were seven melon seeds just now.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Why is there only one left?

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I don't put the melon seeds under the drag.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
How can you hit the melon seed?

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Your Majesty, how can you hit the melon seed?

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Wonderful.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You can change the melon seed under the drag.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You are really a good student.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You are really a good student.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I am willing to bet on the number of melon seeds.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What do you mean?

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You just won the 200,000 dollars.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I don't want the money.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I want to lose the money and go back.

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Silly boy.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You saved him this time.

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Next time he will still bet.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I advise you to take the money away.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Don't waste money on this rotten gambler.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I don't want the money.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I want to lose the money and go back.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I tell you the truth.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I tell you.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yaozi has already bought the price.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So you two must leave one.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Silly boy.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I will ask you one last time.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Are you taking the money away?

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Or do you insist on letting me go?

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Don't cry.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What's wrong?

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Why are you so anxious to call me here?

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What happened?

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Don't cry.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Mr. Peng.

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You must help me.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Haoyun went to count my dad.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
But they haven't come back yet.

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Can you find someone to save them?

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Don't worry. Don't cry.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Don't cry.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Your dad must be saved.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
As for Haoyun,

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
it's not impossible.

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Really?

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Jingjing.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Many years ago, your dad promised me

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
to marry you.

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What do you think?

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Mr. Peng.

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
We have always respected you.

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But...

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Jingjing.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You must understand one thing.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Do you want to live like this forever?

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You are worried about everything.

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You can't save any money.

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Be my dad.

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Be with me.

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I will protect you forever.

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Okay?

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Okay.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Okay.

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Think about it.

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Mr. Peng.

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Are you really going?

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Those stupid people.

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I will beat them.

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
In this place,

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
except for the Sun family,

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I have to meet other people.

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But...

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But I heard that the person who kidnapped people this time...

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Who?

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's him.

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What's wrong?

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's cash.

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It will take some time to prepare.

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Mr. Peng will handle it.

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Have you decided?

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I will give you another chance.

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I forgot to use the money.

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Okay.

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Give Mr. Fang the money to sell his medicine.

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yes.

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Then your medicine...

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You can keep it.

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
No.

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You are not professional.

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You don't even use the medicine?

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You...

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You are a man of love and will.

103
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You are brave and ambitious.

104
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You are really qualified to be a part of our family.

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Part of our family again?

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Are you okay?

107
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Dad.

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Can you not meddle in my business?

109
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You are my daughter.

110
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Your marriage is a big thing.

111
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
How can I not care about it?

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Little brother.

113
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I like you.

114
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Be my son-in-law.

115
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I will be your son-in-law.

116
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I will be your son-in-law.

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I will be your son-in-law.

118
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Dad.

119
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
No.

120
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Where are you playing?

121
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That Hao You Tian is not good to you.

122
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Their family is also very poor.

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Today, our Naiwen family asked you to be their son-in-law.

124
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Why do you have to go back and be a beggar?

125
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
This 200,000 dollars.

126
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Just as a way to buy off their gratitude to you.

127
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Dad.

128
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Uncle.

129
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I can't be your son-in-law.

130
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Little brother.

131
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Don't be shameless.

132
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I ask you again.

133
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
My daughter.

134
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Are you marrying her or not?

135
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Uncle.

136
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I am a person who has lost his memory.

137
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
How about I find my memory back and talk to you?

138
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Okay.

139
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
If you don't marry her, just kill her.

140
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Uncle.

141
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Dad.

142
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I see who dares to touch my people.

143
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Xiaoqian.

144
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Don't be impulsive.

145
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We are here to negotiate.

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Come to my territory to scare me.

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Sun Yiqian.

148
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
There is nothing wrong.

149
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yesterday we just had a father-in-law relationship.

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So today I feel a little old and a little angry.

151
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
President Naiwen.

152
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Don't be angry.

153
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Are you a kindergarten kid?

154
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
If you do this,

155
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
he touched me last night.

156
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Are we also a couple?

157
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Xiaoqian.

158
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Even if you really like that boy,

159
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
we don't have to fight against the Naiwen family.

160
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
He doesn't have a armed team in Beijing.

161
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Do we need to be afraid of him?

162
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Your Sun family has already taken over the business of our casino.

163
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Now you still want to come and take my son?

164
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
President Naiwen.

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Misunderstanding.

166
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's not as serious as you say

167
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
when children fall in love.

168
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Okay.

169
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
How about we make a decision today?

170
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Let good luck choose for himself.

171
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
See if he chooses me or your Sun family.

172
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Okay.

173
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Then the loser will be the one who loses.

174
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Okay.

175
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Then the loser will automatically quit.

176
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Okay.

177
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Get up.

178
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Choose.

179
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You must choose one today.

180
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Dad.

181
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Dad.

182
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Dad.

183
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Dad.

184
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Husband.

185
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Husband.

186
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Husband.

187
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Husband.

188
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Husband.

189
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Husband.

190
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Who are you?

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What's going on now?

192
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Dad.

193
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
This is my husband, You Haoyun.

194
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
We were separated last month because of the sea disaster.

195
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
No.

196
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I don't seem to know you.

197
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Husband, what's wrong with you?

198
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Husband, don't scare me.

199
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm your wife, Xia Zhi.

200
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
How could you forget me?

201
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
This is our daughter, Lele.

202
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Right, the photo.

203
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Look.

204
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
This is our photo.

205
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
We finally found you, husband.

206
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Let's go home together, okay?

207
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You're really my wife?

208
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Lele, take dad home with you.

209
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Go.

210
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Husband, let's go.

211
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
No.

212
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Where are you going?

213
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
He hasn't chosen yet.

214
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
He already has a wife.

215
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Don't embarrass me here.

216
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Miss, bad news.

217
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Something happened to the company.

218
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
We have to go back immediately.

219
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Thanks to all the great men.

220
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I think I will lead the company to a more prosperous future.

221
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Qianqian.

222
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Qianqian.

223
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Why are you here?

224
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I don't know.

225
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I was just called by Mr. Jin.

226
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Today, the shareholders' meeting suddenly started to vote.

227
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It was decided temporarily that Mo Panbi

228
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
will be the acting chairman of Sun Group.

229
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That's not good.

230
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Mo Panbi, I really underestimated you.

231
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm not in the company for a few days.

232
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You actually took over the whole board meeting.

233
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
No, Qianqian.

234
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Look, this is the board meeting's decision.

235
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I can't refuse it.

236
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm really sorry.

237
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Mr. Mo, you don't have to blame yourself.

238
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
In fact, you have the right to give up the right to be the acting chairman.

239
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
If you want, I can handle the procedures for you now.

240
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
No trouble.

241
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Mr. Jin, sit.

242
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Sit.

243
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Okay.

244
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I think I should listen to the decision of the shareholders.

245
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You're so stubborn.

246
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Qianqian.

247
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I know you want to get the right to manage the casino

248
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
through the charity poker competition at the end of the month.

249
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Then you control the whole casino.

250
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But I have a bad news to tell you.

251
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I've already sent someone to find the whereabouts of Emperor Mu Kun.

252
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Even God of Du can't win him.

253
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Now you have no chance to win.

254
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm sorry.

255
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm sorry.

256
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm sorry.

257
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm sorry.

258
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm sorry.

259
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm sorry.

260
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm sorry.

261
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm sorry.

262
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm sorry.

264
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm sorry.

265
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm sorry.

268
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm sorry.

269
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm sorry.

270
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm sorry.

271
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm sorry.

272
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm sorry.

273
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm sorry.

274
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm sorry.

275
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm sorry.

276
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm sorry.

277
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm sorry.

278
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm sorry.

279
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm sorry.

280
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm sorry.

281
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm sorry.

282
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm sorry.

283
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm sorry.

284
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'm sorry.

285
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm sorry.

286
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm sorry.

287
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm sorry.

288
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm sorry.

289
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm sorry.

290
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm sorry.

291
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm sorry.

292
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm sorry.

294
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm sorry.

295
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm sorry.

296
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm sorry.

297
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm sorry.

298
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm sorry.

299
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm sorry.

300
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm sorry.

301
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
