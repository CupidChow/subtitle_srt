1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
Take your time to choose the菼 containing other ingredients and start right away!

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,040
Now we have picked an estére.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,540
In addition, the landscape was used for painkillers.

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:24,860
You can see the example information on wherever you take aADE.

5
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,260
Boss, this guy has been winning all night.

6
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,260
I suspect he's out of the house.

7
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,260
Should we take him down?

8
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,860
Boss Lantang, what about we bet?

9
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,860
If I win, you'll let my master bet.

10
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,460
If I lose, I'll give you a hand.

11
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,660
Who is the bet?

12
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,460
The bet of the bet is in Southeast Asia.

13
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,260
20 years ago, he was so beautiful and had no opponents.

14
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,460
The only thing he could do was bet.

15
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:29,060
20 years ago, he was so beautiful.

16
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,060
The only bet is in Southeast Asia.

17
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,860
He only knows how to bet.

18
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,060
Your master is in Mu Kun.

19
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,060
He wants to see me.

20
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,060
But what's your point?

21
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,060
You bet with me.

22
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,660
Don't be so mean.

23
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,260
I bet money.

24
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,060
I'm asking you.

25
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,460
What's your point?

26
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,460
You bet with me.

27
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,260
Is it okay to bet with me?

28
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,660
Boss Lantang,

29
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,860
we bet on the bet.

30
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,060
We bet on the bet.

31
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,060
We bet on the money.

32
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,260
Are you sure?

33
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,660
You're a good boy.

34
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,060
Then let's drink.

35
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,060
Cheers.

36
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,460
Boss Lantang,

37
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,060
how's the bet?

38
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,060
Are you crazy?

39
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,860
I'm very impressed with you.

40
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,260
I like it.

41
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,260
I like it.

42
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,260
I like it.

43
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,260
I like it.

44
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,260
I like it.

45
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,260
I like it.

46
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,260
I like it.

47
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,260
I like it.

48
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,260
I like it.

49
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,260
Mu Kun.

50
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,260
Mu Kun.

51
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,260
You're still here

52
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,260
to fight with me?

53
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,260
You're still here to fight with me?

54
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,260
You're still here to fight with me?

55
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,260
You're still here to fight with me?

56
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,260
You bet on the money.

57
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,260
Why do you say that?

58
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,260
What's wrong?

59
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,260
You bet on my bet.

60
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,260
Will you bet on it?

61
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,260
Since ancient times,

62
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,260
you bet on the money.

63
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,260
You want to win the money

64
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,260
not only on the table,

65
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,260
but also on the boat.

66
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,260
The boat is yours.

67
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,260
The river is yours.

68
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,260
What's next?

69
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,260
You've already arranged it.

70
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,260
The card.

71
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,260
The next card is

72
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,260
Red Heart,

73
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,260
Blue Flower Cure,

74
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,260
Fang Pian Ace,

75
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,260
Fang Pian Seven,

76
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,260
Black Peach Wine.

77
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,260
You dare to take us in?

78
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,260
You...

79
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,260
Don't think that you can take us as a killer

80
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,260
in the capital.

81
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,260
Shut up.

82
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,260
Otherwise, you'll throw yourself in the sea

83
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,260
and go back to China.

84
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,260
This can only prove

85
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,260
that you're indeed a disciple of the gambling god.

86
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,260
You're a famous gambling master.

87
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,260
But you should know the rules on gambling tables.

88
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,260
If you can't catch the cash,

89
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,260
gambling is still effective.

90
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,260
Do you dare to take us in?

91
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,260
I don't need to take us in.

92
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,260
I'll use the three on the table

93
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,260
to win you.

94
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,260
You mean, you want to use the three

95
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,260
to win my Tonghua Cure?

96
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,260
Where's my black peach?

97
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,260
If you're a gambling master,

98
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,260
you're the biggest loser.

99
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,260
But you're nothing now.

100
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,260
I'm a small team of three.

101
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,260
I'm not a big deal.

102
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,260
Boss Han Dang, you lost.

103
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,260
When did you

104
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,260
turn my card around?

105
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,260
You're a good boy.

106
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,260
You're a good boy.

107
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,260
I'm not a good boy.

108
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,260
You're a good boy.

109
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,260
When did you turn my card around?

110
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,260
You're a good boy.

111
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,260
What do you mean?

112
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,260
You...

113
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,260
Boss Han Dang,

114
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,260
you lost because you wanted to bet.

115
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,260
Take me to see Mu Kun.

116
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,260
I'll let you go.

117
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,260
You're awake.

118
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,260
Who are you?

119
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,260
I'm Qianqian.

120
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:42,260
I'm afraid Uncle Chao is awake.

121
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,260
Where are you?

122
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,260
This is my home.

123
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,260
How are you?

124
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,260
What's wrong with me?

125
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,260
You got hurt by Mu Kun.

126
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,260
You were in a coma for a night.

127
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,260
You scared me.

128
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,260
Mu Kun? Where's my master?

129
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,260
Master? What are you?

130
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,260
My master is a god of gambling.

131
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,260
A god of gambling?

132
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,260
I heard that he lost to Mu Kun.

133
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,260
He was in a coma for a night.

134
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,260
Impossible.

135
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,260
How could my master lose?

136
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,260
Where are you going?

137
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,260
You're not recovered.

138
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,260
You'll be in danger.

139
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,260
I'm going to find someone.

140
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,260
Jingjing. She's safe now.

141
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,260
Don't worry about her.

142
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,260
Okay. Who is Jingjing?

143
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,260
You're playing with me, right?

144
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,260
You don't remember me?

145
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,260
I don't know why I'm here.

146
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,260
But we've known each other before.

147
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,260
I'm here to help you.

148
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,260
I'm here to help you.

149
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,260
I'm here to help you.

150
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,260
I'm here to help you.

151
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,260
I'm here to help you.

152
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,260
I'm here to help you.

153
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,260
I'm here to help you.

154
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,260
I'm here to help you.

155
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,260
I'm here to help you.

156
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,260
I'm here to help you.

157
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,260
The wall is cleaned.

158
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,260
I have everything under control.

159
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,260
I'm here to help you.

160
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,260
I'm here to help you.

161
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,260
I'm here to help you.

162
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,260
She's with you.

163
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,260
I'm going to make a little bit of a

164
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,260
little bit of a

165
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,260
little bit of a

166
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,260
little bit of a

167
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,260
little bit of a

168
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,260
little bit of a

169
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,260
little bit of a

170
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,260
little bit of a

171
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,260
little bit of a little

172
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,260
bit of a little bit of a

173
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,260
little bit of a little bit of a

174
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,260
little bit of a little bit of a

175
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,260
little bit of a little bit of a

176
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,260
little bit of a little bit of a

177
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,260
little bit of a little bit of a
