1
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:27,740

2
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,200
It sure is coming down.

3
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,310
It's the rainy season.

4
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,870
And no customers to speak of...

5
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,270
That's right.  Oh, this looks delicious.

6
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,350
Hey, that smells amazing.

7
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,440
Who are you?

8
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,650
Who did you come to see?

9
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:30,870
You do... anything, if paid, right?

10
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,480
If the price is right, we do anything.

11
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,360
Where did you get hurt like this?

12
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,020
So, how can I help you?

13
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,130
I need you to kill a person for me...

14
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,060
- Sir, you've got the wrong idea— 
 - Shush!

15
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,530
Who are you looking to kill?

16
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,650
Kang... Kang Yeo Joo.

17
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,730
Kang... Yeo... Joo.

18
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,520
Kang Yeo Joo?

19
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,420
I've heard that name before.

20
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,110
Hey, punk, what do you mean? You couldn't have.

21
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,570
Who is Kang Yeo Joo?

22
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,170
- My wife. 
 - Huh?

23
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,670
I'll give you as much money as you want.

24
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:26,660
Kill... my... wife.

25
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,780
Are you writing on manuscript paper these days?

26
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,860
Yeah.  I thought it might help with the writing.

27
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,990
Should I just write it for you, that damned story?

28
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,470
The publishing company will sue you immediately.

29
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,470
Did you forget that your husband is an attorney?

30
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,390
I guess you're right.

31
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:24,230
I have nothing to worry about.

32
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,280
Come on. Look at me while we're talking.

33
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,900
Are you going to workout?

34
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,150
No, to have an affair.

35
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,120
- Wearing a tracksuit? 
 - I'll be taking it off anyway.

36
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,680
Don't take your pants off.

37
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,270
You have belly fat now.

38
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,130

39
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,400
Are you okay?

40
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,170
Me?

41
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,750
Sir, are you okay?

42
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,230
Sir, are you okay?

43
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,870
Mister!

44
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,750
Call an ambulance!

45
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:24,060
Mister, it's just that... you're the first man for me.  Honey, I am sorry.

46
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:41,000
It wasn't bad for the first time, right?

47
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,470
What a relief!

48
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,500
- Yes? 
   - Are you alive?

49
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,750
Yes.  He should be fine after a few days' rest.

50
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,940
What do you mean by "a few days"?  We are about to go on air!

51
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,630
Hey!

52
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:05,480
Aren't I so fast?  I might get there on time at this rate.

53
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,110
My wife told me not to take my pants off outside of home.

54
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,490
30 seconds left.

55
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,940
I don't even have time to zip up.

56
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,040

57
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,530
Hello.  This is Beautiful Morning Talk's Baek Soo Jeong.

58
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,860
Today, we have a guest who is better known as the "nation's husband."

59
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,350
We'll invite Attorney Han Woo Seong here.

60
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,550

61
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm Attorney Han Woo Seong.

62
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,860
 Thank you.

63
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,480
You've become the talk of the town these days offering pro bono divorce representation.

64
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,750
What's the story?

65
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:16,070
Even while suffering from assault or abuse,

66
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:20,790
there are women who can't get a divorce.  I am providing legal support for them.

67
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,400
Perhaps, do you plan on going into politics?

68
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,860
No... No, I am not.

69
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,480
I'm just joking.

70
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,300
So you help other couples to get a divorce,

71
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,500
but you yourself are a devoted husband.

72
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,240
Yes.  I am making efforts not to end up with a divorce suit myself.

73
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,640
Look at her slyly smiling with her eyes.

74
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,820
She looks just like the wench who seduced my husband.

75
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,740
Who are you talking about?

76
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,030
No, it's nothing.  Have a seat.

77
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:01,280
 Something that seems bitter, but what can't be refuted is...

78
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,560
Wow, smells delicious!

79
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,280
Okay, I'll concede.

80
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,290
Your husband is better at making abalone porridge than I am.

81
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:14,060
 It's not an exaggeration...

82
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,070
 The biggest reason for a divorce can be personality differences.

83
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:23,050
 Attorney, you said you met your wife in a very fateful way...

84
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,530
 Did you meet at a great travel destination?

85
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,430
No, it was at a study dorm.

86
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,790
A study dorm?  That's unexpected.

87
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:36,700
Yes.  I was preparing for the bar exam.

88
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,460
 I was doing a favor for a close senior

89
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,830
 by overseeing the study dorm once in a while.

90
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,330

91
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:49,860
Woah... It makes my heart tremble, I can't read it.

92
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,530
Wow, this author is completely crazy!

93
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:57,860
How many people died in this novel?

94
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,660
Who is the author? Are they a psychopath or something?

95
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,890
This crazy jerk...

96
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:10,640
used to be a newspaper journalist.

97
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,070
Kang Yeo Joo.

98
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,160
Oh, it's a woman?

99
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,970
What does she look like?

100
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:22,740

101
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,130
Wow, what is she so pretty for?

102
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:31,830
Wow, she's like an actress!

103
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,990
 I'm here to see a room.

104
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,160
Please come back tomorrow.  The general manager isn't here so...

105
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,420
She's prettier in person.

106
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,690
What kind of room are you looking for?

107
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,160
A special room.

108
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,160
Oh, a room with a window?

109
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,510
Windows aren't necessary.

110
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:11,000
By any chance, do you have a room where someone died?

111
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,310
Excuse me?

112
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,760
You must have a room like that, no?

113
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,350
Do you have a room where someone died?

114
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:24,470
 Are you crazy? Why would we have a room like that? Do you want us to be ruined?

115
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,550
There must be a room like that somewhere.

116
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,640
 Ah, there is a room that's unpopular because of the noise of the outdoor unit right next to it.

117
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,000
 But there are probably a lot of dead mice in there.

118
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,720
- Are there no rooms? (informal)  
   - There is.

119
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,290
I'll call you back.

120
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,770
You keep speaking informally to me.

121
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,230
I'm old enough to have completed my military service.

122
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,470
You are younger than I thought.  Where is the room?

123
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,720
This way.

124
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:56,040
You are not preparing for an exam, are you?  You don't seem like you are working either.

125
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,400
I have a bit of supernatural sense.

126
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:04,460
Is your work, perhaps, related to trees?

127
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,920
I sense a lot of tree energy in you.

128
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,260
Is your work related to paper?

129
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,740
Perhaps, a writer?

130
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,320
This room is quiet, so it'll be good for getting work done.

131
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,950
White noise helps you focus.

132
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:35,690
How did the previous tenant die?

133
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,220
Excuse me?

134
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,820
I think it was probably murder.

135
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:51,190
A murder?

136
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:54,070
Was there a witness?

137
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,770
No.

138
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,740
Umm, I mean...

139
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:05,350
The corpse was found a week later.

140
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:09,710
This is the last room on the floor so not many people pass by and...

141
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:12,370
It really was terrible.

142
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,090
The smell must have been bad.

143
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:18,270
The ventilation is really good here.

144
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:23,630
The owner of this dorm used to be in the ventilator business.

145
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,450
What about the culprit? Was he caught?

146
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,290
No.

147
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,530
There're spider webs.

148
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:37,700
I'll remove them right away.

149
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,290
No, I like it. Leave it.

150
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:47,170
Because, perhaps, that spider might have witnessed the murder.

151
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:16,070

152
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:38,870
 The sounds of her typing almost sound like a piano concert.

153
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,400
Who's she killing now?

154
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,500
She doesn't look even once.

155
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,130
She does that to you, too?  She doesn't seem well, right?

156
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:07,360
She never acknowledges me.  She doesn't even say greetings, that rude one.

157
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,750
It's because she's an artist.

158
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,140
An artist?

159
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,680
She really is pretty.

160
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,550
So there's a reason you're not going home after all.

161
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,640
You Sillim-dong Casanova!

162
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,390
Don't think about doing anything funny.

163
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:28,210
That's not happening as long as I'm the general manager here.

164
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:32,990
Hyung, this time it's different. It's not like that.

165
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:38,880

166
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,670

167
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,920
Thank you.

168
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:54,080
Instead of your autograph, please write your phone number.

169
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,820
What's your phone number?

170
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,220
Your phone number.

171
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,990
What?

172
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,650
So it was love at first sight.

173
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,480

174
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,210
Yes.  I tend to fall at first sight.

175
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,200
Do you have many experiences falling in love?

176
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,400
No.

177
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,360
Don't misunderstand, Honey.

178
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,170
You're the only person I fell in love with.

179
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,220
I love you.

180
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,960
When did she come back from the United States?

181
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,460

182
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,260
Did you shamelessly come to look for me even here?

183
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:13,230
Yes. Because of you, I'm being chased off to the United States. Are you satisfied now?

184
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,370
But you just wait.

185
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,970
I can't stand being in debt to anyone.

186
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:30,060
You have to be careful of someone with that kind of demure face.

187
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:37,650
Don't trust your husband too much either.  You know that, right?

188
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:41,630
How do you share a bedroom with someone you can't trust?

189
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:44,590
You're so naive in some ways.

190
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,620
Oh, you are not going anywhere today, right?

191
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,780
Why?

192
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,140
CEO Yang said she would be coming by.

193
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,390
CEO Yang?

194
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,450

195
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,290
I'll hold her neck and head.

196
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:19,250
- Deputy Na, you wait and open the door. You guys grab her legs and arms, one each. Got it? 
 - Yes.

197
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,140
You can't make any mistakes.  We don't have time.

198
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,610
1, 2, 3! Fighting!

199
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,200
 Good work!

200
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,710
 Thank you for the hard work.

201
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,010
Your suit.

202
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,960
Thank you.

203
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,240
Thank you for your hard work.

204
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,540
Thank you for your hard work.

205
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,630
Thank you for your hard work.

206
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,590
Thank you for your hard work.

207
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,180
Do you want to eat lunch together?

208
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:18,320
It's a little difficult today because I have a trial.

209
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,070
What about dinner?

210
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,720
I'm having dinner with my wife.

211
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,990
Then, how about breakfast?

212
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:30,590
You're busy, so what about if I go jogging in your neighborhood?

213
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,860
It's Mondays and Wednesdays, isn't it?  Your workout days.

214
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,260
It was a joke.

215
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,910
You are really kind of cute.

216
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,990
It makes me want to tease you.

217
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:49,400
I am busy so...

218
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,590
Thank you for your hard work.

219
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,080
We'll see you again.

220
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,570
Are you interested in Lawyer Han?

221
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,780
Does it look that way?

222
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:10,000
It probably won't be easy. There's no one who doesn't know his wife.

223
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,880
Really!

224
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,260
She was just here...

225
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:31,750
I asked you to hold on to her so that she can't run away this time.

226
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,600
How can I?  I'm very busy, too.

227
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,030
Please...

228
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:41,600
She was always in her room.  Where did she go?

229
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,140
I don't know.

230
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,820

231
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,110

232
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:06,500
₩3,500. ($3.50)

233
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,200
You are sure that Ms. Kang is coming today, right?

234
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,130
If she blows off today as well, we won't let it go.

235
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,300
Never.

236
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:51,820
Of course, don't worry. Okay.

237
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:57,450
Oh, what am I going to do?  This is killing me.

238
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,710
This girl, I should...

239
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:02,090
I found her!

240
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,760
How did you find her?

241
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,440
I got a tip.

242
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,510
I had asked for cooperation from everyone in the neighborhood earlier.

243
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:12,960
 Hurry! Hurry!

244
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,800
Open the door, quickly.

245
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,820
There.

246
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,300
Will she be all right?

247
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,520
Of course.  If she didn't go today, she would've gotten sued.

248
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,560
You did her a favor.

249
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,130
Good job.  Good. We're going!

250
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:34,020
Ah, if you have time, please come to the book talk later.

251
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,260
I'll save you a souvenir.  Please come.

252
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,940

253
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,980
I see that you even brought your office manager.

254
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,900
You're not even offering us a cup of tea?

255
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:15,540
How about a settlement?  Thirty-five percent of the assets and a thousand in alimony (10,000 USD).

256
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,200
My client wants to protect his family.

257
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,220
Is that why he had an affair?

258
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,170
Do you have any evidence?

259
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,060
Mr. Office Manager?

260
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,140
That's a friend.

261
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,900
What? Friends can't shake hands?

262
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,470
There happens to be a five-star hotel in the back.

263
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,850
A luxury hotel makes a good background for pictures.

264
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:50,930
The view is awesome as well.

265
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:55,310
This kind of photo was uploaded on his female friend's blog.

266
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,230
What about it?

267
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,030
You don't see it?

268
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,990
You don't have good eyes.

269
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:16,710
It could be age-related farsightedness.

270
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:21,980
Don't tantalize and just tell me.

271
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,520
He is your client, right?

272
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,920
If we go to court, we will have to censor the image. Maybe a peach?

273
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,780
You know that I have a peach allergy.  How about grapes?

274
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,370
Yes, maybe two bunches?

275
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:26,110
Let's renegotiate.  40% of the assets and 15,000,000 in alimony (15,000 USD). 
  (T/N: The speaker actually says "cheon oh baek (1,500)" which is shortened from "cheon oh baek man" (15,000,000))

276
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:29,140
Wasn't it 35% of the assets and 10,000,000 in alimony earlier?

277
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:33,360
Now it's 45% and 20,000,000 since time is money. (~20,000 USD)

278
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,770
Tick tock, tick tock.

279
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,310
I'll discuss it with my client.

280
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:42,300
- 50 and— 
 - Wait!

281
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:46,000
45% and 20,000,000, I said I'll call him now.

282
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:55,400
You made a good choice on behalf of your client.

283
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:10,480
Yes, it's been settled.  45% of the assets and 20,000,000 in alimony.

284
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,050
Yes, I'm on my way to the office so I'll meet you there.

285
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,510
Do you like that you won?

286
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,850
I feel a little bad.

287
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:20,450
Then buy me dinner.

288
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,180
Today is Tuesday, so I'm going to the supermarket.

289
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,300
My wife is busy these days.

290
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,920
That's right.

291
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,670
See you.

292
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,590
What was I thinking?

293
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:45,640
You've been waiting long, haven't you?  It was really difficult for us as well to bring this guest here.

294
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,440
This writer has many adjectives to describe her.

295
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,750
Bestseller writer, crime specialist writer,

296
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,590
one of the nation's leading "hard-boiled" female writers,

297
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:58,750
 Why don't we meet her now?

298
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:04,400
Writer Kang, please finish this event well.

299
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:11,040
Well, is it even possible to do well wearing clothing of such low quality?

300
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:16,600
They are expensive clothes.  Just keep them clean, that's all I ask.

301
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,440
Oh, did you spent money to buy this?

302
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:30,640
Let's invite Writer Kang Yeo Joo and talk about her book.

303
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,020
Please come in.

304
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,700
Welcome.

305
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,870
Oh my god, I'm so sorry. Are you all right?

306
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,200
Yes, I'm all right.

307
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,710
Oh! You're the lawyer who appears on TV, right?

308
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,890
Yes.

309
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:32,150
- Hello! 
 - Yes, hello.

310
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:35,180
Please could you sign here for me?

311
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,890
- Should I? 
 - Yes.

312
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:42,260
You always said you do the grocery shopping for your wife and I see that it's true.

313
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,460
What's your name?

314
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,620
- Yoo Ok Joo. 
 - Okay, Ms. Yoo Ok Joo.

315
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,450
One, two, three.

316
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:55,330
- Thank you! Oh? 
 - Customers, we're announcing for a limited time, a sale on crab. 15% off!

317
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,660
Aren't you going for the limited time sale on crab?

318
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,050
I planned to meet my wife.

319
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:04,850
All right.

320
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,510
- Yes. 
 - Writer, in your works, you are famous for

321
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:26,270
terribly killing men who commit extramarital affairs.

322
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:30,230
By any chance, is it because of your experiences?

323
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,140
The writer's husband is well known for being a devoted loving spouse.

324
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:51,230
The content of the fiction probably stems purely from her imagination.

325
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:54,230
Yes.

326
00:29:54,230 --> 00:30:00,820
If your husband cheats on you, what would you do?

327
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,890
Will you divorce him?

328
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:12,660
I haven't given a thought to being a divorcee.  A widow is a different thing.

329
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,960
 I probably would do the same as in my stories.

330
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:47,790
 Be it a suicide or an accidental death, it would be a perfect crime.

331
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,950
 I'm a specialist.

332
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:57,530
It would be nice if that kind of thing never happens.

333
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:05,090
Because mourning clothes don't look very good on me.

334
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:13,160
Your husband would be very surprised if he saw your answer.

335
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:18,220
What if we took this chance to do a video love message?

336
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,530
 Please do it for us.

337
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:30,020
 Please do it.

338
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:43,860
Honey, what I just said wasn't a joke.  You know me, don't you?

339
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:48,790
If you don't want to be found as a corpse, do well.  I love you.

340
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:12,340
- Why can't we go in? 
 - Let us in!

341
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:16,530

342
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,730
Writer Kang, when can we see your next book?

343
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,800
Good job.

344
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,170
I plan on writing it this year.

345
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:45,040
The publishing company is threatening to sue me,

346
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,240
demanding that I return the down payment.

347
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:53,030
She jokes so seriously...

348
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:56,050
What a great sense of humor!

349
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,660
 - We demand an apology! 
 - Apologize!

350
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,900
 - She must apologize! 
 - Hey, hurry!

351
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,670
Any other questions?

352
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:17,760
 There she is!

353
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,050
 Kang Yeo Joo! Apologize!

354
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:23,750
- I think I need to take care of things here so, please try to handle the crowd. 
 - It's only been five minutes.

355
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:26,070
We'll compensate you for the event fees.

356
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:30,730
We'll conclude today's book talk.

357
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,810
Thank you for attending.

358
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,640
 Hallelujah!

359
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,670
 Glory, glory, hallelujah!

360
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,410
Who are those people?

361
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:45,900
Ms. Kang's first book was critical of the church, so they show up to every event.

362
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,450
 Hallelujah...

363
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:50,180
 Kang Yeo Joo!

364
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,680
 Kang Yeo Joo!

365
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,870
Did you block it?

366
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:10,030
♫  You tried to hide it, your own little secret  ♫

367
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:17,490
♫  I pretended not to know and I let it go. 
After trying once or twice, did you get used to it?  ♫

368
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:27,360
♫  You said everything was perfect. You never looked back  ♫

369
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:34,420
♫  I'll return all of me that had to look at you like that  ♫

370
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:42,680
♫  Feel my cold gaze. I'm never gonna love again  ♫

371
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:48,950
♫  Try making fun of that mouth again. 
I'm never gonna love again  ♫

372
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,790
I have legs, too.

373
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:55,350
Oh, right.

374
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:59,790
♫  Like sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

375
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:03,390
♫  I fall again, sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

376
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:06,490
♫  Leave me alone  ♫

377
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:11,580
♫  I fall again, sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

378
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,450
♫  Leave me alone  ♫

379
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:20,420
 Your items have been safely delivered.

380
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:23,130
It's time to go.

381
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:25,270
Why is it always Tuesday and Thursday?

382
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:28,610
Can't it be Monday or Wednesday?

383
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:30,730
Monday and Wednesday?

384
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,850
It's because I go jogging on those days.

385
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,650
So what?

386
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:01,080
Because I get tired?

387
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:07,710
Do you want to go to Japan on Thursday and have some sashimi?

388
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:10,590
I don't think that'll be possible for a while.

389
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:15,310
So you mean you can't go?

390
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,130
Are you thinking about ending it now?

391
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:29,090
It's because a reporter is going around digging into our relationship.

392
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:32,460
- Which one? 
 - A reporter from Dongmin Daily.

393
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:37,890
Did you get caught or something?  You know how fast rumors travel in this industry.

394
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:42,910
Isn't meeting like this dangerous, too?

395
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,210
I'm sure it'll turn out okay.

396
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:49,210
Let's end it now.

397
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,950
I'll be careful.

398
00:36:55,460 --> 00:37:00,360
They have already caught on. Would they leave us alone?

399
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:29,980
Attorney Park is so cool!

400
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,790
Thanks to her, Tuesday/Thursday is cleanly finished.

401
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,590
Okay.

402
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:09,030

403
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:00,790
You worked so hard.

404
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:01,960
Cheers!

405
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,250
Thank you for the drink!

406
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,040
Ah, so refreshing!

407
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,960
Writer Kang, you're sitting alone again.

408
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,730
I told you I didn't want to go.

409
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:21,580
Did you go as far as kidnapping me so that could happen?

410
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,940
I was told that it was only for the members,

411
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,530
so I thought it would be okay.

412
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,680
Stop being upset and have a drink.

413
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,290
I don't drink bottled beer.

414
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,030
Should I get you a draft beer?

415
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:45,790
Mr. Owner, draft beer here—

416
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,880
You don't seem to remember at all.

417
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,210
The convenience store.

418
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:11,400
You're the informant.

419
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,940
Yes, I just wanted to help.

420
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:20,110
You were a big help.  I even got a massage.  The eggs were very fresh.

421
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,490
He's the one who got hit by all the eggs.

422
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:25,560
It got on my clothes as well.

423
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,890
To be precise, those are my clothes.

424
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:44,880
Who?

425
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,120
Miss Baek Soo Jeong?

426
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,370
Honey, I am home.

427
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:02,070
 Smell of food?

428
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:11,600
 What's going on?  My wife wouldn't be cooking...

429
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,890
 What's the meaning of this?

430
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,900
Honey.

431
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:36,380
 That kind of smile is as dangerous as when she speaks formally.

432
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,490
You must've worked hard.  Go wash up and come.

433
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:42,510
 Formal speech.

434
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:47,520
Did something bad happen?

435
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,260
You're psychic.  How did you know?

436
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:54,260
 Because you cook, smile, and speak formally.

437
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:01,200
The entire church came again.

438
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,090
Is that so?

439
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:05,590
The deacon aged quite a bit.

440
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,860
What did you buy?

441
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:14,660
Crab, your favorite.  I bought it during a limited-time sale.

442
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:18,690
- Go wash up and come out. 
 - It's heavy...

443
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,630
I got scared for no reason.

444
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,160
What is this?

445
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:47,050
This...

446
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,650
She couldn't have seen it, could she?

447
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:53,440
Did she?

448
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,980
Why?

449
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:06,080
What do you mean?  Let me have the laundry.

450
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:12,460
But your face...

451
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,370
What about my face?

452
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:19,060
What about my face?

453
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:21,450
Did you put makeup on?

454
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,260
For the book talk.

455
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,050
You look pretty.

456
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,650
Why is this so crumpled up?

457
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:36,880
I sweated a lot today.

458
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,030
What is it?

459
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:09,160
 My wife is sensitive to smells.

460
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:12,110
 What kind of shampoo did I use that time?

461
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,700
What is this?

462
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:22,180
It's what I use at home. You know women are sensitive to smells.

463
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:26,210
What is this? You carry around a cheating kit?

464
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:29,730
 No. I didn't make any mistakes.

465
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:46,290
Hurry up and come out.

466
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:47,900
Yes.

467
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:59,110
Damn, I almost got caught!

468
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:04,760
It seems like she's suspecting something.

469
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,340
It's a good thing I ended it quickly.

470
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:18,330
What's wrong? You're cooking and everything.

471
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:20,770
A guest is coming.

472
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,440
Who?

473
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:31,820
Honey, she's here.

474
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:49,040
Attorney Han, do you also live here?

475
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,880
Please, come in.

476
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:11,060
When he's done with work, he comes home immediately.

477
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:14,220
That's right.  You already know him, right?

478
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:19,340
We meet every Monday and Wednesday.

479
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,830
They're meetings for the new program we are about to launch.

480
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,240
You're appearing in a new program?

481
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,370
It got canceled.

482
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,090
But I didn't hear that.

483
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:34,280
It got canceled.

484
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:38,860
I didn't want to come empty-handed.

485
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:40,720
Thank you.

486
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:49,150
How did you know? This is the only kind I use.

487
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,920
Why is it always the same perfume?

488
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:02,260
Because it's the fragrance that fits you the most.

489
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:07,460
Go ahead and wash your hands, please.  The food is almost ready.

490
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:13,270
It seemed that way.  I had a feeling.

491
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:16,880
Where is the toilet?

492
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,520
The toilet... It's this way.

493
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:11,370
You are an expert with knives.

494
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:15,660
Since the main character in my last book was a knife-wielder,

495
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,870
I learned it specially.

496
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:20,350
It's helpful too when I'm cooking.

497
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:22,520
Do you need any help?

498
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:25,660
No. You can just look around the house.

499
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,270
- Honey? 
 - Yes?

500
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:28,580
Please help her.

501
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:30,190
Yes.

502
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:41,290
(Come here.)

503
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,810
Is it okay to have physical contact like this at home?

504
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:55,880
Are you crazy? Why did you come here?

505
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,080
We ended it last week.

506
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,090
But I'm not finished yet.

507
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:04,230
And today, I came because I wanted to see Kang Yeo Joo, so mind your business.

508
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:08,900
How do you know my wife?

509
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:13,650
It's not a pleasant relationship, though.  Anyway, your phone has been turned off.

510
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:16,500
And you didn't even show up on Monday.

511
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:20,650
I'm going to devote myself to my family now.

512
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:26,200
- Let go. 
 - She might hear.

513
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:30,090
What?  What now?  What?

514
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,090
It's a poisonous flower.

515
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:35,420
My wife's taste is peculiar.

516
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:37,450
She's coming, she's coming, she's coming.

517
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,980
- Show her our room as well. 
 - Oh okay.

518
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:46,150
She's interested in a lot of the plants here.

519
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:49,020
Now, I'd like to see your bedroom.

520
00:49:56,690 --> 00:50:00,930
All this time, you've been giving me the makeup your wife uses as gifts?

521
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,750
If you close the door, won't it be more suspicious?

522
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:09,660
It's over. What is there to be suspicious about?

523
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:13,060
I told you I'm not done.

524
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:44,050
Do you like this kind of thing?

525
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,380
Something thrilling.

526
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:56,740
My wife's eyesight has never been less than 20/20.

527
00:50:56,740 --> 00:51:00,770
She can even detect what brand of hair dye someone uses.

528
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:26,640
It was unexpected for you to visit.

529
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,360
I thought you didn't like me.

530
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,480
 But you just wait.

531
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,430
 I can't stand being indebted to anyone.

532
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,280
It was a long time ago.

533
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,330
But now, I am rather sorry.

534
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:46,060
Why? Why are you sorry?

535
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:49,880
Could you... give me... that, Honey?

536
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:53,590
The bread, please!

537
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:57,480
Thank you.

538
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:04,570
I'm interrupting your romantic dinnertime.

539
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,720
The wine is all finished.

540
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:16,390
Honey, bring some more wine.

541
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:18,030
Yes.

542
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:19,870
It's all right.

543
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:23,230
I'll go get some more wine.

544
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,850
(Why the wine?)

545
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:40,510
How is Attorney Han at home? Does he do well?

546
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:45,130
Outside, he does a really great job.

547
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:47,190
Is that so?

548
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:49,900
How is he outside of the home?

549
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,020
How should I say it?

550
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:56,710
Should I say he's detailed?

551
00:52:56,710 --> 00:53:00,460
Honey, where was the wine again?

552
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,760
In the basement storage.

553
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,110
That's right. Basement storage.

554
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:12,090
Where in the basement storage?

555
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:14,270
The wine cellar, next to the refrigerator.

556
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:16,620
Wine cellar.

557
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:20,260
Was the wine cellar next to the refrigerator?

558
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:23,520
I'll go.

559
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:29,460
Okay.

560
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:35,920
What are you trying to do?

561
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,460
I am leaving since you don't seem to welcome my presence.

562
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,050
Really?

563
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,540
I'll see you in room 1820 tomorrow.

564
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:46,290
How many times do I have to say it? I'm really not going.

565
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:51,540
Really? Then I have to stay for one more bottle of wine.

566
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:54,480
But what happens if I get drunk?

567
00:53:56,530 --> 00:53:59,500
I tend to blabber when I'm drunk.

568
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:07,320
Okay. Fine. Good. I'll go.

569
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,230
The usual time?

570
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:14,840
I'll be waiting.

571
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:19,880
But it'll be the last time.

572
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,510
We'll see.

573
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,470
You're already leaving?

574
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:31,440
I must have had too much wine.

575
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:25,500
 Do you have a death wish?

576
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,840
Stop doing dangerous things.

577
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:39,520
Let's meet and talk, Miss Baek Soo Jeong.

578
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,910
I'll go to you.

579
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:53,240
You're awake?

580
00:55:55,610 --> 00:55:59,290
I didn't see you so I got worried.

581
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:03,120
Is something wrong?

582
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:06,460
You seemed to be arguing with someone.

583
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:10,080
It wasn't an argument.  Let's go to sleep.

584
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:27,440

585
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:22,160
Is she not back yet?

586
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:27,250
 The person you called cannot answer now...

587
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:28,070
What...

588
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:30,720
What is she doing not even answering her phone?

589
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:35,820
Did she change her mind already?

590
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:39,900
What strange thing is she up to now?

591
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:45,090
Baek Soo Jeong came to your house?

592
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,410
She's totally crazy.

593
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:50,750
I knew something like that would happen sooner or later.

594
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:54,400
You cheat so steadily and diligently.  Of course, there would be a problem!

595
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,210
What do you mean I cheat?  I'm a devoted family man.

596
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:05,020
What about all those women you slept with?

597
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:10,650
Who did I... I sleep with?

598
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:12,510
Nonsense.

599
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:21,970
It is my belief that you only sleep at home.  As soon as I am done with the deed, I go home immediately.

600
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:25,260
Why?  To keep my family.

601
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:27,230
It makes sense.

602
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:38,800
Attorney Han Woo Seong?

603
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:50,260
Representative Bu made a special request for you.

604
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:55,840
I've heard a lot about you.  I heard that you were involved in the presidential election as well.

605
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:59,080
I'm working for the opposing side now.

606
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:01,610
Ah, I see.

607
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:03,600
Politics is a living creature so...

608
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:08,000
I heard that you have made up your mind but...

609
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:13,550
Now that I've decided to enter the race, I suddenly have a lot to think about.

610
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:16,900
I worry that I might disappoint everyone.

611
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:19,740
I'll take care of everything.

612
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:25,040
You just need to keep up the clean image of  "nation's husband" as you are doing now.

613
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,260
That's all.

614
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:31,670
Yes, sure.

615
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:39,370
From now on, you'll discuss everything with me, right?

616
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:42,930
If we are to come up with a strategy, there cannot be anything that I'm not aware of.

617
00:59:42,930 --> 00:59:44,550
It's important.

618
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:46,920
Yes, I understand.

619
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:50,180
But how would I contact...

620
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:52,440
I'll call you.

621
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,960
Goodbye.

622
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:05,240
Woo Seong!  Hey, who is he?

623
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:11,230
A political consultant.

624
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:13,680
Be it the president or a congressman

625
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:17,040
or the party leader, if you have him, you are halfway to winning the race.

626
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,660
Yeah!

627
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:23,800
You... Wow.

628
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:29,040
My efforts looking after you were not in vain. To think a congressman will spring from my side...

629
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:35,230
Whose side? It's more like you're from my side.

630
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:39,500
Anyway, don't forget that I know a lot about you.

631
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,680
- I'll buy you some drinks. 
 - Today?

632
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,310
- I'm busy today. 
 - You said you cut it off with the women, so why are you busy?

633
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:46,290
Laundry.

634
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:53,380
I've reset my burner phone.

635
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:56,900
And I've replaced my sim card.

636
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:59,630
Black box.

637
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:02,570
Call memory and navigation.

638
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:30,350
"Congressman Han"?

639
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:32,980
It sounds great. "Congressman Han."

640
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:38,930
People of the nation, I'll be your Congressman Han who treats your ailments! 
(T/N: "Congressman Han" and "oriental medicine practitioner" in Korean are homonyms.)

641
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:44,330
Was I destined to become a congressman?

642
01:01:44,330 --> 01:01:46,460
It sounds natural.

643
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:48,280
"Congressman Han."

644
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:55,200
The feeling of being re-born.  I don't need to feel apologetic towards my wife.

645
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,390
Nor do I need to be nervous.

646
01:01:57,390 --> 01:02:03,840
Now go back to the beginning and... when I feel lonely...

647
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:11,650
That's right.  I have the videos to console me.

648
01:02:11,650 --> 01:02:14,650
I'm not lonely.

649
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:22,270
Honey, I'm home.

650
01:02:22,270 --> 01:02:24,290
Is she in the kitchen?

651
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:35,320
Honey?

652
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:42,130
Honey?

653
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:07,030

654
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:09,920

655
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,860
"If you cheat, you die"?

656
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:22,650
Does she... already know?

657
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:25,490
How much does she know?

658
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:28,330
It can't be.

659
01:03:29,090 --> 01:03:32,920
I haven't been caught... not once...

660
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:37,000
What? Wait.

661
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,750
Wait a minute.

662
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:44,320
Hold on.

663
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:47,160
Wait. Wait.

664
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:50,150
Wait.

665
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:52,560
Wait.

666
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,450
I need to be calm.

667
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:57,120
Everything was perfect.

668
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:59,940
No, she's just playing with me.

669
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:12,260
He hasn't caught on to anything at all.

670
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:14,790
How do I turn this off?

671
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:17,050
This is my chance.

672
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:24,870

673
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:30,990

674
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:39,230
♫  Feel my cold gaze. I'm never gonna love again  ♫

675
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:47,400
♫  Try making fun of that mouth again. 
I'm never gonna love again  ♫

676
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:51,930
♫  Sweet temptation like sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

677
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:55,900
♫  You melt sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

678
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:56,780
♫  I fall again sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

679
01:04:56,780 --> 01:04:59,700

I bought poison that day, to kill you with.

680
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:02,360
 A person is not the same as shoes.  You can't repair and use.

681
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:05,520
 She blew off the broadcast.  She caused some big trouble.

682
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,090
 Baek Soo Jeong is done in this industry.

683
01:05:07,090 --> 01:05:09,940
 Look for me if something happens...

684
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:13,860
 There's no such thing as "Uncle and Niece" or "Friends" between a man and a woman.

685
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:15,390
 He's a dirtbag to women.

686
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:17,440
 I saw something yesterday.

687
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,920
 Did you perhaps enjoy it?

688
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,790
Ma'am!

689
01:05:20,790 --> 01:05:21,300
♫  Everything...  ♫
