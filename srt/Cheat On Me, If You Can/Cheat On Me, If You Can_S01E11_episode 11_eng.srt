1
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,580

2
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,100

3
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,490
Find out who sent this.

4
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,570

5
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:43,980

6
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,400

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,670

8
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:06,540

9
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,020
This is the video you were talking about.

10
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,740
Thank you.

11
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,770

12
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,020
Deputy Na.

13
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,560
How much has Writer Kang written?

14
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,470
The CEO keeps asking about it.

15
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,380
Ah... I don't really...

16
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,070
- The CEO is quite worried. 
 - Why?

17
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,990
She used to worry because the writer wasn't writing the story.

18
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:27,800
Now, she's worried because the story is being written.

19
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,750
I'm not sure what she really wants.

20
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,340
They say the English royal family drink this.

21
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,990
It's Taylors of Harrogate tea.

22
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:42,420
I only make it for the CEO, but as an exception...

23
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,980
Thank you.

24
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,960
By the way, what can I help you with?

25
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,970
Perhaps, did you send this letter?

26
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,430

27
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,040
No.

28
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,710
Oh, that's right...

29
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,720
The CEO told me to send it.

30
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,240
Two or three times a week, she collects the mail and sends them.

31
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,250
CEO Yang does?

32
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:26,160

33
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,880
Writer Kang, this is Soo Ho.

34
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,240
I found the person who sent the mail.

35
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,100
What?

36
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,120
CEO Yang?

37
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,060
 I heard that you were originally called Park Yeo Joo, is that right?

38
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,480
 Who says that?

39
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,230
 A man who has an interest in you.

40
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,660
 Tell him to stop being interested in me.

41
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,430

42
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,530
Why are you following me? Do you like me?

43
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:49,590

44
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,570
Is this a threat?

45
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,970
I have no idea what you're talking about...

46
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,390
Okay, fine! I sent it.

47
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,580

48
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,420
I wanted you to look at th... that and remember that... incident.

49
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,860
What?

50
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,990
Ah, if I did that...

51
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,520
I thought you might give up on that book.

52
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,320
And this is not a threat but a request.

53
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,280
You are going to stop me with that long-forgotten past?

54
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,770
Long-forgotten past?

55
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,120
That horrible incident... how could you?

56
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,770
Why did Soo Ho relay that kind of thing and—

57
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,820
I will go to another publisher.

58
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,270
You! Don't forget, there's a contract.

59
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,860
Contract?

60
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,820
That's a civil matter.

61
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,640
Threatening me with that mail is a criminal matter.

62
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,770
Which would be more advantageous?

63
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,250
Do you want to go all the way to the end?

64
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,870
That's up to you.

65
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,740
Whatever I do...

66
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,470
You can't stop me.

67
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,220
You know that, right?

68
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:49,110
This is... Ma Dong Kyun.

69
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,310
Ah, yes...

70
00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:00,390
 19-3 Daemun-dong, Mapo-gu

71
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,740
 Yes, it's Sinho Publishing.

72
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,050
 Yes, that's right.

73
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:12,130
 Then... what time would be good for you?

74
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,170
Ah, yes.

75
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,500
Ah, I'll see you then.

76
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,580
Bye.

77
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,810
Come over there immediately.

78
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:37,580

79
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,870

80
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,690
Set up the interior of this car.

81
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,000
Yes, Sir.

82
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,130
An editor-in-chief in his forties with fifteen years of experience

83
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,770
managed Youngse Publishing.

84
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:16,480
He had an employee but had to let go of them due to management difficulties.

85
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,790
What about the family?

86
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,250
None, he's never even been married. Ten years ago,

87
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:26,310
after breaking up with his fiancee, he's been alone since.

88
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,150
 Marriage?

89
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:50,450
 Okay, let's say we're getting married.

90
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:57,220
I should have stopped her then.

91
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,880
I'm sorry, CEO Yang.

92
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,460
I... spoke carelessly.

93
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,910
It's fine.

94
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,110
She would have found out even if it weren't for you anyway.

95
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,800
She is Kang Yeo Joo after all.

96
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,720
We won't be able to stop her.

97
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,400
A metal ruler and a rollerball pen are musts for an editor...

98
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,430
Yes, I'll set that up, Sir.

99
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:47,350
There should be a calculator next to the phone.  He's an editor who is managing the publishing company on his own.

100
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,970
What about a dictionary?

101
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,340
You didn't even get a dictionary?

102
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:00,070
A used looking latest edition of Standard Korean Language Dictionary, all three volumes.

103
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:04,350
English Dictionary (English-English), English-Korean Dictionary, and Korean-English Dictionary. Get rid of these two.

104
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,360
These chairs?

105
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,580
That way... she will sit here.

106
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:22,390
Right at that spot... get rid of the bookcase and hang a picture.

107
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,710
What kind of picture should I hang?

108
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,760
I'll send you a few pictures of myself when I was young.

109
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,950
Hang up the best one.

110
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,200
Pardon?

111
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,030
I'll give you two hours to finish setting everything up.

112
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,670
If I find any gaps again when I return,

113
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,170
you'd better be prepared.

114
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:03,360

115
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,100
Did Kang Yeo Joo leave?

116
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:13,440
 Yes, she is about to leave from the police station, Sir.

117
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,460
Go home, I'm going to take a taxi.

118
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,860
Why? Where are you going?

119
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,440
There's someone I need to see.

120
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,880
I'll give you a ride.

121
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,840
Go home, I'll take a taxi.

122
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,750
Finally, they're meeting.

123
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:28,350
I have set everything up to remind her of the incident nine years ago, Sir.

124
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,770
 You can expect a good result, Sir.

125
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,690
 She'll never refuse.

126
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:46,820
 I... know Kang Yeo Joo's weakness well.

127
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,090

128
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,770
♫   One, two, three!   ♫

129
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,630
♫   If I look into your eyes, I am a troublemaker   ♫

130

00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:03,160

137
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,770
Long time no see.

138
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,390
I'm getting a feeling of déjà vu.

139
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,030
What are you doing?

140
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,960
 Are you going to abandon your mission?

141
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,210
 I'm sorry.

142
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,800
You betrayed the organization.

143
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,150
Our mission was to get rid of Kang Yeo Joo.

144
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,060
Why did you do it?

145
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:19,340
Why did you save Kang Yeo Joo with your life?

146
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,180
Answer me.

147
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,800
I want to know, too.

148
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,070
Why I did that.

149
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:02,020
You waited a while, didn't you?

150
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:06,550
No, not at all. It looks like you didn't have any trouble finding the place.

151
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,490
Come in.

152
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:12,360
♫   Now I vaguely understand   ♫

153
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,190
♫   Why you had to feel sorry   ♫

154
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:19,750
Have a seat.

155
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,660
♫   I must have been too excited   ♫

156
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,570
Isn't this a song that was popular a long time ago?  About ten years ago?

157
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,000
♫   Even the moment you were leaving...   ♫

158
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,560
I listened to this song frequently when I was in the hospital.

159
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,000
 How...

160
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,650
About nine years ago.

161
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,210
♫   A pleasant goodbye   ♫

162
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:45,340
You were hospitalized for a long time, weren't you, back then?

163
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,200
You have a good memory.

164
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,310
♫   If I had known...   ♫

165
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:54,130
How could I forget, that incident?

166
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:04,930
If you hadn't saved me then,

167
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:08,030
I wouldn't be sitting here now.

168
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,980
Anyone would have done the same.

169
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,450
Given the circumstance.

170
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:27,490

171
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,390
 What is it?

172
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:08,580
 I'm sorry. I couldn't answer the call because I was in a meeting.

173
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,800
 You should have eaten first. Were you waiting for me?

174
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,190
 No, no, I'm all done.

175
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:22,630
 I'll be right there. Okay.

176
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,450
 This is Ma Dong Kyun.

177
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:40,640
 Pardon? You want me to save Kang Yeo Joo again?

178
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,720
 But my mission was...

179
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,090
 But it's dangerous right now.

180
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,700
 The fire has spread a lot—

181
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,950
 I understand, Sir.

182
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,040

183
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:51,810
 They say he is an editor-in-chief of some publishing company.

184
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:55,840
 He saw the fire while he was at the warehouse to get a book.

185
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,820
 He almost died... trying to save you, a complete stranger.

186
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,740
 Such a cold wench!

187
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:09,840
 Ah... how could a man like him exist in this day and age?

188
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:27,560
You were very handsome.

189
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:33,720
No, no, that's not true.

190
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,780
Even so, those were...

191
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:42,740
the good... days.

192
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,070

193
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:07,090
 When she sees this picture,

194
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:10,120
 Kang Yeo Joo will feel guilty.

195
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,490
 Then, it's game's over.

196
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:26,050
Writer Kang...

197
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:29,760
Ah, I...

198
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,700
I think my skills are as good as anyone else.

199
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,460
If you would just entrust me with it...

200
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,960
I wouldn't do any harm to your work.

201
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,250
I thought hard about it myself.

202
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:03,100
When you called, I had a feeling that you might bring it up.

203
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:08,180
It's not like I want recognition for saving you or anything like that at all.

204
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:12,180
That incident... please don't feel pressured.

205
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,860
I will publish

206
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,880
with your company. My new work.

207
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,380
Thank you so much.

208
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,970
Thank you very much. Thank you.

209
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,660
Ah, this was regarding a publishing contract.

210
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:53,000
Why would she hide something like that?

211
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,750
Ah, this...

212
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,930
Ah, that hurts. Damn!

213
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,670
Can you hear well?

214
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,270
So-so.

215
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,860
 Hold him for just one minute.

216
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:21,260
 I was going to change the publisher anyway.

217
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,630
What is it?

218
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:30,870
Chief Ma entered into a publishing contract with Kang Yeo Joo.

219
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,470
What, already?

220
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,190
Ah, that fox!

221
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,790
You have to at least give him credit for his skills.

222
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,850
Yes, I understand.

223
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,710
Did you fool Kang Yeo Joo?

224
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:05,920
However, that book...

225
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:10,440
It could put you in a difficult position.

226
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,650
Me?

227
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:17,180
What... is it about that...

228
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,860
There's a lot of dangerous content.

229
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:26,610
For example, nine years ago...

230
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:31,960
the identity of the culprit that started the fire at the book warehouse...

231
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:42,420
Also... the culprit that killed Baek Soo Jeong.

232
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,730
 Baek Soo Jeong would be...

233
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:49,990
Ah! Baek Soo Jeong...

234
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:53,670
Isn't she the actress who was found dead at the Han River recently?

235
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,750
She was famous as a Hallyu (Korean Wave) star at one point.

236
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:02,890
As I thought, she was planning on writing about Baek Soo Jeong.

237
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:07,500
Then, does that mean Kang Yeo Joo is not the culprit?

238
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:12,800
Do you know the culprit?

239
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,880
Yes.

240
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,430
W-Who is it?

241
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:33,190
I haven't written that far yet.

242
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,170
You said you know the culprit...

243
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:41,010
What I'm writing is fiction.

244
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:45,620
The culprit... can change as I write.

245
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:49,660
You know very well yourself.

246
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:08,880
You are still wearing it... that ring.

247
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,810
 I just thought that you were working at a publishing company.

248
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:30,190
 If you hadn't gotten hurt, were you planning on lying to me even after we got married?

249
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,390
By chance,

250
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,500
do you not regret saving me?

251
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:53,190
If I were you, I would hate me.

252
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,520
I'm sick of it.

253
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:16,310
That woman.

254
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:23,580
 You will regret it... if you publish.

255
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:29,710
 Ah, without that, I would have to shut down the publishing company.

256
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:34,630
 Please just write a good work, Writer Kang.

257
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,260
He's a great actor. A great actor.

258
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:46,200
Ah, this was the newest equipment, and I didn't even get to use it!

259
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,410
As you promised.

260
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,120
 Please enjoy.

261
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:12,440
 Do you know how to plant a bug?

262
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,170
 Since Chief Ma is suspicious about everything, I need your help.

263
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:19,900
 You are not expecting me to do it for free, are you?

264
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,940
The audiotape.

265
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:30,450
My trust level for people is very low.

266
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,860
I'm the one that told you about their meeting.

267
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,430
And I'm the one who did not get caught.

268
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:42,030
So, what is it that you want?

269
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:00,030
But why is she changing the publisher?

270
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:28,450
Honey, how is CEO Yang doing these days?

271
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:32,430
I assume she's fine. Why?

272
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:37,550
Is she not threatening you because there hasn't been any new work?

273
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,820
You go to sleep first.

274
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:57,680
Why do I get the feeling that there's a lot she is hiding?

275
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,180
Is there a lawsuit that is not working out or something?

276
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:09,270
If it was a lawsuit, I would have won already.

277
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,790
I can't resolve it legally.

278
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,280
 I would be more advantageous for the election.

279
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,610
 I have even made a president.

280
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:29,050
 Would I be personally involved just to get a congressman elected?

281
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:34,600
 What would you do if I go to the other side?

282
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,780
 I... know a lot about Attorney Han.

283
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:43,050
 Keep it to yourself, please.

284
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:50,180
 If you mess with Attorney Han, you will become my enemy.

285
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,490
 Are you threatening me?

286
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:57,830
 Ah...

287
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:02,940
 Start by changing your assistant.

288
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:06,050
 She has loose lips.

289
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:11,410
 Please drink.  It'll get cold.

290
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,230
What is it?

291
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:19,430
What is the reason for protecting Han Woo Seong?

292
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:22,590
If you can't do it even with power, just give it up.

293
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,970
You must feel like drinking today.

294
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:36,700
No, I want to drink fast.

295
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:40,490
 Hey, I heard that Attorney Han's wife is at the Seodong Police Station.

296
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:44,520
I am leaving first.

297
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,520
Hey, where are you going?

298
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:52,090

299
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:56,140
I heard that the warrant was denied, and she just submitted it to a witness interview.

300
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,290
What was Kang Yeo Joo suspected of?

301
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:05,390
Kid-Kid-Kidnapping, subornation of violence...

302
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,110
Excuse me?

303
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:16,980
But... how do you know the chief of the station?

304
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:43,440
- Ah, Sir! 
 - It's been a while. Have you been well?

305
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,840
Yes, thanks to you. And yourself, Sir?

306
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,900
Ah, of course.

307
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,270
Where is Mi Rae?

308
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:54,380
Ah... because of her classes...

309
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,710
Ah, she must be upset again.

310
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:59,750
- Shall we go? 
 - Yes.

311
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:10,660
I heard he's back in the country.

312
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,070
Aren't you going?

313
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:15,160
I'm busy.

314
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:23,590
What's going on with the arrest warrant for Kang Yeo Joo?

315
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:28,830
The prosecutor asked if we were crazy.

316
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,440
Because we have eyewitness testimony of the kidnapping.

317
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,630
Then, why was it denied?

318
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:37,620
Baek Soo Jeong's manager recanted his testimony.

319
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:47,790
 That damn... What the hell is she doing?

320
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,970
 What did you say?

321
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,590
 Why don't you ask him yourself?

322
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:59,080
 This woman threatened you, didn't she?

323
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,460
 No, no, she didn't.

324
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,380
 I am the culprit.

325
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:09,220
 I am saying that I killed Soo Jeong.

326
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,300
That Kang Yeo Joo used some trick, I'm telling you.

327
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,030
That's right! We are dealing with Kang Yeo Joo! Kang Yeo Joo!

328
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:22,550
You went ahead and asked for a warrant without a plan, based only on the testimony?

329
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:26,890
Let's conduct a scientific investigation. A scientific investigation.

330
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:30,610
Hey, why is it that you two are always together without any performance result?

331
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:34,580
- What? 
 - If we are together, do we have to show performance results?

332
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:37,190
You crazy punk!

333
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,180
Where are you going?

334
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:42,200
- A scientific investigation. 
 - That...!

335
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,650
That ill-mannered...

336
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,350
Uh, damn! Hey!

337
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:50,950
- Hey! 
 - Ah, sorry.

338
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:53,740
Wow, damn!

339
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,360
You are saying that you stabbed Baek Soo Jeong in the stomach?

340
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:35,370
Baek Soo Jeong was stabbed in the back.

341
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:39,050
Ah, I stabbed her back and...

342
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:43,120
Then, you are saying that you stabbed both the stomach and the back, right?

343
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,480
Yes.

344
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,480
So, you stabbed the stomach like this and...

345
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,970
stabbed the back, too...

346
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:54,470
and stabbed both sides.

347
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,030
The answer is... always at the crime scene.

348
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,820
Let's start from the beginning.

349
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,620
We are going to start digging all the way from the beginning again?

350
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:13,880
That's why... This time, let's do a scientific investigation, not useless digging.

351
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,470
A scientific investigation, or digging, they are both a fool's errand anyway.

352
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:22,690
Let's go, to dig.

353
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,740
He is so pessimistic.

354
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,020

355
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:48,710
He stabbed Baek Soo Jeong as she was coming through the front door...

356
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:54,900
but the blood is concentrated in this direction.

357
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,390
The chances are that this missing kitchen knife is...

358
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:10,660
the tool that was used in the crime.

359
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,860
At least, it wasn't a paring knife.

360
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:20,490
At a minimum, it's longer than 25 cm.

361
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:23,570
Then, the manager...

362
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:26,040
 Then, where did you get the knife?

363
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:30,730
 I brought over the paring knife from home.

364
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,700
is not the culprit.

365
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,650
That's right.

366
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:45,450
You can't be in here.

367
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:49,660
I wanted to organize the keepsakes.

368
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,720
It's the face of one who lives drinking only the morning dew, isn't it?

369
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:05,070
She was every man's first love.

370
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:09,940
I made it so.

371
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:12,520
Asia's Goddess.

372
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,240
 Can I really become an actress?

373
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:24,170
My dream is to become a famous actress just like you.

374
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:28,110
Come closer.

375
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:39,220
First thing, get rid of this lipstick.

376
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:48,970
Men were always the problem.

377
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:52,050
Always a man who was already taken.

378
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:56,650
Was she seeing a married man or something?

379
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:12,540

380
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,560
What is this?

381
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:22,520

382
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,580
Please come in.

383
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,480

384
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,260
Put the map up so that we can see it.

385
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,580
- Hello. 
 - Don't we have a bigger map?

386
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:45,860
We can't even see it? Go to the store later and get one.

387
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,080
Ah...

388
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,560
Hello.

389
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,060
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

390
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,080
Change this.

391
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,220
 Distribute it everywhere.

392
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:57,080
Oh, you're here.

393
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:01,790
Ah, Director Na... Nam... my picture outside...

394
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:05,780
You don't like it? We can take another one if you prefer.

395
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:08,520
That's not the problem.

396
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,730
How could you open an office without consulting with me first?

397
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:12,480
You need to answer your phone for me to discuss with you.

398
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,170
And why didn't you come yesterday? Yesterday, of all days, when the mural is getting completed,

399
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:19,190
you should have come. Even the Chancellor of Seoyeon University came.  It's important, right?

400
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:22,050
Director Nam.

401
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,420
Let's talk.

402
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:31,560

403
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:35,590
If you do this, things become difficult.

404
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:39,090
I've helped you so much.

405
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:44,440
I know, but my wife is really against me going into politics.

406
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,210
I'm not sure what you're trying to say.

407
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:52,760
You didn't know? I already spoke to your wife about this. It shouldn't be a problem going forward.

408
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:57,290
Are you saying that you met with my wife?

409
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:02,070
She had a lot of conditions.

410
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:07,290
 Female employees and female secretaries are not allowed. And please do not allow female reporters in, either.

411
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:11,070
 Events where there will be many females are not allowed, and please let me know in advance of the event schedule.

412
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:14,730
 Of course, it won't be easy to manage an election campaign without females.

413
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:19,460
 Taking the reality into consideration, I won't object to females over the age of 50.

414
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:23,020
 Also, what does his schedule look like today?

415
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:26,900
 Ah, he has an event where he will be painting a mural with Seoyeon University students.

416
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:30,960
 Since Seoyeon University has a high concentration of votes in Seodong-gu...

417
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:35,210
My wife came to the mural painting?

418
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:38,660
She had a lot of interest in the students.

419
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:41,910
 Ah, it's okay.

420
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:43,780
 Oh no!

421
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,030
 It's fine.

422
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:53,290
 How refreshing.

423
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:57,690
 I see that there are many young college students.

424
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:00,460
 Especially, female students.

425
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,160
 They are all our votes.

426
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,140
 What do you think? It looks nice, right?

427
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:18,270
The issue with your wife has been resolved as well, so what else is the problem?

428
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:20,960
You really are difficult.

429
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,510
That is...

430
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:29,160
It's not resolved.

431
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,530
My wife is not that simple.

432
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:34,060
Even when she smiles, it's not a smile.

433
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:38,000
Why didn't you tell me that she came...

434
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,860
She said she wanted to surprise you. Surprise!

435
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,280
Yes, I was surprised.

436
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:12,520
Writer Kang, how are you?

437
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:15,640
You came?

438
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,530
I found all the materials.

439
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,850
Where did I put it?

440
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:32,640
- Are you looking for something? 
 - Yeah.

441
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,290
A business card.  You look for it as well.

442
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:38,470
It's black in color and it has some kind of office written on it.

443
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,720
I think this is it.

444
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,870
Gwak Jeong Moon Office?

445
00:47:57,870 --> 00:48:01,200
It was here. I looked for it all day and couldn't find it.

446
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:19,900
 You are not going to continue seeing her, are you?  Go Mi Rae.

447
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,800
 What do you mean "see her"? I only ran into her a few times by coincidence.

448
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,120
 Coincidence? Be careful.

449
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,070
 That female college student.

450
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:32,610
So, she wasn't just saying it.

451
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:35,020
 Paint got on your shoes, didn't it?

452
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,830
 While you were painting the mural.

453
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:40,220
 It's blue paint, right?

454
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:42,380
 And Go Mi Rae did it.

455
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:44,560
 That's why she bought the shoes and brought them over, right?

456
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:47,740
She saw them herself... the shoes.

457
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:03,440
Ah, that day... did I do anything else strange?

458
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,090
 Are you all right?

459
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:16,440
It just came as an instinct. Wow, seriously!

460
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,050
Ah, habits really are scary.

461
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,560
Ah, that's right! I am crazy! The water bottle!

462
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,770
 Please have some water.

463
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,990
She couldn't possibly have seen everything, could she?

464
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:41,530
No, no. If she saw everything, she wouldn't just let it pass, not with her temper.

465
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:50,520
Gwak Jeong Moon Office is a detective agency.  Apparently, they are the best in this field.

466
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,790
I heard they will do anything for money.

467
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:55,030
Is that right?

468
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:58,710
I heard that they would even kill a person.

469
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:01,200
What a menacing advertisement.

470
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,520
Okay, good job.

471
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:14,990
Why does Kang Yeo Joo have a business card for a detective agency?

472
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:18,690
Is it for an inverview?

473
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,450
Did she see everything?

474
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:52,560
 If you eat it... apparently, you can see brilliant yellow color as you die.

475
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,150
 Supposedly, it tastes pretty good, too.

476
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:59,890
 It became famous when a housewife made tea with it.

477
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:03,660
 For a hateful husband.

478
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,020
 Be careful.  Behind you, it's a Wolf flower.

479
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:13,100
 If the flower touches you, I will have to call 911.  It will be inconvenient.

480
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:22,170
 Isn't it too dan... dangerous to grow at home?

481
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:24,980
 I grow it because it's dangerous.

482
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:32,680
Honey.

483
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,090
You're home?

484
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:37,310
I thought you'd be late.

485
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:42,910
I came early so we could eat dinner together.

486
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:46,930
That's good. I made blowfish soup.

487
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:51,320
Blowfish soup?

488
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,590
You like it, don't you?

489
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:57,520
Today... I made it myself.

490
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:06,140
It should be tasty.

491
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:15,380
Is he the best in the field?

492
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:17,660
You said he was a former cop, right?

493
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:21,780
Yes, he was the team leader of the Violent Crimes Unit but we understand each other.

494
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,800
Superintendent.

495
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:28,600
If he was a superintendent, then he was pretty high in rank.

496
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,730
Why did he quit?

497
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,910
There was a political incident...

498
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:35,250
Ah, it's okay.

499
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:37,790
Good. You did well.

500
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:44,300
More importantly, where is a good place to have fun these days?

501
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:56,860
- I will sit for a while and go. 
 - Okay.

502
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:04,590
Excuse me.

503
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:09,540
There is a "study" in the room. Are you interested?

504
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,490
Okay?

505
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,790
I have seen you in magazines.

506
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:30,840
Ah, really?

507
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:33,930
What do you think, seeing me in person?

508
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:38,410
You look like a MFS (mother's friend's son).  Like a nice guy.

509
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,920
I see.

510
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,840
I'm not like that.

511
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:09,060
 I thought you should at least see the completed mural.

512
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:20,390
 My wife is a little sensitive these days, so phone calls or texts are a bit...

513
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:25,870
 diffi... difficult... from now.

514
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,330
Oh, what do I do?

515
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,700
Why is this...

516
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:13,690

517
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:19,290
Go Mi Rae?

518
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:21,100
So this was the meaning of that painting.

519
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:32,310
Honey, I'm taking out the trash.

520
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:34,460
Okay. Go ahead.

521
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:53,840
Gwak Jeong Moon Office.

522
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:58,020
He was a former cop.

523
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:01,270
Would he really be able to kill a person?

524
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,530
But then again... at least he wouldn't leave any evidence behind.

525
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:10,510

526
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:24,970
Who?

527
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:26,960
Secretary Cha?

528
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:38,510

529
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:43,220
♫  I can't hide it. Let me down  ♫

530
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:45,530
♫  All right  ♫

531
00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:51,450
♫  I can't hide it. Let me down  ♫

532
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:55,920
♫  Get away from me  ♫

533
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:00,040

534
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:04,530
♫  Never mind just get away  ♫

535
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:11,310
 Why are you like that? Why did you become so bad-mannered after coming to Korea? Are you seeing a guy? Huh?!

536
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:15,440
 Don't you remember the reporter from Korea Daily who died nine years ago?

537
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:20,010
 He promised to marry Kang Yeo Joo but was two-timing?

538
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:24,070
 If the cause of the accident hasn't been revealed, then you're saying it might not have been an accident?

539
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:27,120
 Can I call you? If you don't want me to, it's okay.

540
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:32,590
 Go Mi Rae likes you. You enjoy that, too. I cannot forgive.

541
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:34,400
♫  Can't you hear my rough breathing  ♫
