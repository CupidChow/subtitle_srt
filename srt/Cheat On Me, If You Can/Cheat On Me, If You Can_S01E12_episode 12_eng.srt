1
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:27,870

2
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,010
Secretary Cha?

3
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,040
I thought you were upset,

4
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,800
so I came to have some fun with you.

5
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,010
Dammit!

6
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,880
Hey, are you crazy?

7
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,290
What are you doing in my room right now?

8
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,520
You just left a mark on my face.

9
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,240
Do you know what that means?

10
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,300
Leave.

11
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:36,370
Mi Rae, what's wrong with you?

12
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,480
Why have your manners become so poor after coming to Korea?

13
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,270
Hey!

14
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,640
Do you have a new man?

15
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,020
Huh?

16
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,400

17
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,030
Don't you need to go to the hospital?

18
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,230
This girl is truly out of her mind.

19
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,340
How could she wound your face? Let me see.

20
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,250
Her father will throw a fit if he finds out.

21
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,680
I think I have to take Mi Rae with me.

22
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,420
To America?

23
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,700
Yes. After coming to Korea,

24
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,760
she's starting to act out.

25
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,420
 No, Mom. Please.

26
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,030
You're right. That would be best.

27
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,340
Her father isn't happy with her either.

28
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,050
It's cold. You should go back inside. I'll find Mi Rae and bring her back.

29
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,730
That's okay. She must be upset after causing that ruckus.

30
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,070
I should go and comfort her.

31
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,370
- It's cold, so you should go back inside. 
 - No, that's all right.

32
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,400
You must be so cold!

33
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,020
Oh, dear!

34
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,820
- She ran away. You have to hurry up and find her. 
 - I understand, Ma'am.

35
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,890
Miss!

36
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,890
H-hey. Hey.

37
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,570

38
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,530

39
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:07,530
Honey, this was in the trash bin.

40
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,190
Yes, I thought it was time to throw it away.

41
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,620
Seeing as how you picked it out of the trash,

42
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,510
you must really like that jacket.

43
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:20,420
You gave it to me.

44
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,720
It seemed like that jacket had been in another woman's hands.

45
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,980
Another woman? Who?

46
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,350
Are you talking about Go Mi Rae?

47
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,500
Am I wrong?

48
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,390
Honey, I think you're misunderstanding something.

49
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,480
Go Mi Rae and I are nothing–

50
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,900

51
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,970
Go Mi Rae likes you,

52
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,730
and you're enjoying that attention.

53
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,200
Hello?

54
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,800
I'm sorry to call you,

55
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,030
but I have no one else to contact right now.

56
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,390
Mi Rae, here you are!

57
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:30,110
Mi Rae, as I told you before,

58
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,320
my wife is uncomfortable with you calling me, and please refrain from making personal calls to me.

59
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,740
Contacting me at such a late hour is also not good etiquette.

60
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,630
I am hanging up.

61
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,790
I'm not enjoying it.

62
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,840
This student probably understands that now, too.

63
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,810
That's it then, right?

64
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,630
I won't go into politics either.

65
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:01,600
So that I don't run into Go Mi Rae... again.

66
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,070
No. Do it.

67
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,970
You have to get elected.

68
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:16,400
- If I go into politics— 
 - I will fully support you.

69
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,890
Honey,

70
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,880
did you meet Director Nam?

71
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,620
I heard that you were also at the mural painting event.

72
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,550
- Why didn't you tell me? 
 - Are you complaining right now?

73
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,120
- No, that's not it— 
 - I have to work.

74
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,910
I... damn...

75
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,690
became a senseless person.

76
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,460
 I can let the emergency funds slide, but cigarettes are a different matter.

77
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,710
♫  Time stood still  ♫

78
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:24,420
♫  When I saw you  ♫

79
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:30,220
♫  When I saw you  ♫

80
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,810
Copy of the resident registration card, marriage registration certificate.

81
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,300
Marriage registration certificate?

82
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,570

83
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,510
What is it? Are you doing a background check on Kang Yeo Joo?

84
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,050
How do you find out about an unregistered marriage?

85
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,700
Well... I guess with a wedding invitation or wedding photos.

86
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,900
Why? Did Kang Yeo Joo marry someone else?

87
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,870
Yes. There was a wedding invitation.

88
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,500
Really? With whom?

89
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,440
 Joo Min Jae.

90
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,800
 Daean Daily reporter.

91
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,640
 The newspaper Kang Yeo Joo used to work for as a reporter?

92
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,450

93
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,220

94
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,190
Joo Min Jae.

95
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,610

96
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,760

97
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,790
He was active only until ten years ago.

98
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:35,450
Why aren't there any articles about him after that?

99
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,190

100
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:42,380
It doesn't look like he moved to a different newspaper either.

101
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,090

102
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:07,350

103
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:12,900

104
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,750
 Let's say we're getting married.  You and I.

105
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:29,350
 Then, let's start printing the wedding invitations right away.

106
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,310
 Aren't you rushing it?

107
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,000
 When should I visit your father to say hello?

108
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,220
 It's been over ten years since I last contacted him...

109
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,560
 This is a good excuse to contact him, isn't it? The wedding.

110
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,410
I can't forgive.

111
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,430
Ah, I'm going to be late again!

112
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,260
Yeah, go to the Daean Daily Newspaper.

113
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,000
 I already asked for their cooperation so you can ask for the Deputy Chief of Political Affairs.

114
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,190

115
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:35,900

116
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,710
- Are you busy? 
 - Not busy.

117
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:07,610
Then... could you find Go Byung Hee's answer for me?

118
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,990
You get it yourself... the second cabinet on the right.

119
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:12,590
Uh, okay.

120
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:19,790
By the way, Yoon Hee, since the day we went to your house,

121
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,850
won't cook for me.

122
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,750
I have so little energy, my legs are shaking.

123
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,420
Why would your wife... not cook...

124
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:37,900
She told me to go have Miss Go Mi Rae cook for me!  Miss Go Mi Rae!

125
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,790
I don't even expect loyalty!

126
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,660
At least, you shouldn't frame me!

127
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,450
If you have the slightest bit of conscience, you wouldn't even be able to lift your head!

128
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,290
How can you shamelessly try to talk to me?

129
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,050
Were you always this thick-skinned?

130
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,370
 How did you get so thick-skinned?

131
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:57,330
 Wow, I'm just so upset! I'm so frustrated! Seriously!

132
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:02,610
 Hey! Hey, at least, try responding!

133
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:23,200
 Mi Rae, as I told you before,

134
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,370
 my wife is uncomfortable with you calling me, and please refrain from making personal calls to me.

135
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,630
 Contacting me at such a late hour is also not good etiquette.

136
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,310
Of all times, why did she call me when my wife was around?

137
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,550
But still, she did save my life...

138
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,130
I was a bit harsh.

139
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,210
No, forget it.

140
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:55,440

141
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,000
- Hello? 
   - I'm calling from the Seoyeon police substation...

142
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,730
Police substation?

143
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,120

144
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,410
Excuse me, I am Han Woo Seong. I got a call...

145
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,970
Ah, yes. Please come this way.

146
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,200
Here.

147
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,680
What happened?

148
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,150
She was roaming the streets in her pajamas. Someone in the neighborhood found her and brought her over.

149
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,750
She didn't have any wallet or ID.

150
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,350
She wouldn't say anything...

151
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:42,080
Your number was the last call made from her cellphone, so we contacted you.

152
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:48,160
I see. Thank you.

153
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,940
Are you all right?

154
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,220
Don't cry...

155
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:32,260
I'm sorry. You contacted me because you needed my help but I...

156
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,440
I didn't even ask why you called...

157
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,770
I didn't want to,

158
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,020
but I had no one to call... I'm sorry.

159
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:45,630
I would've done the same.

160
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:49,090
You did the right thing. It's okay.

161
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,950
There, there.

162
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,080
Have you eaten?

163
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,490
Ramen's here.

164
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,700
Please enjoy.

165
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,950
Please eat.

166
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,380
You should have a proper meal with rice. Is this going to be okay?

167
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,000
Yes.

168
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,790
It's really delicious.

169
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,390
 It doesn't have enough water.

170
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,470
 The heat was not high enough, so the noodles lost their elasticity.

171
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,250
 You call this a "hot" restaurant and brought me here?

172
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,180
Please eat slowly.

173
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,970
I can't normally have this.

174
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,890
I want to eat a lot of it when I can.

175
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,370
Why... can't you eat it?

176
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:30,390
I don't have the money... to buy it...

177
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,120

178
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,750

179
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,880
Come Again Ramen?

180
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:03,100
It's a ramen restaurant he likes.

181
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,250
Is he having ramen for lunch?

182
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,950
Whenever you feel like having ramen, call me. Okay?

183
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,600
Okay.

184
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,410
A phone call is a little...

185
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,680
Talk (Korean chat app) isn't going to work either.

186
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,310
Email... is also a bit...

187
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:39,220
Ah, mail would be good! To the office address.

188
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,630

189
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:23,870

190
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:27,970
What did he buy so much at the mart?

191
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,880
Why aren't you asking?

192
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,340
What do you mean?

193
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,690
About what happened last night.

194
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,500
It seemed like something you didn't want to think about.

195
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,990
If I ask... you would have to think about it again.

196
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,180
You know I'm a lawyer, right?

197
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:03,500
Do you need my help, perhaps?

198
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,870
If that's the case, can I give you a call?

199
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,580
Only during times of emergency.

200
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,770
Ah... that... that is...

201
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,630
If you wouldn't like that, it's okay.

202
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:22,790
I'm not trying to put you in a difficult spot.

203
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,430
Sure, call me.

204
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,130
One second.

205
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,930
Just a moment.

206
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,800

207
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,590
- Hello? 
 - Where are you now?

208
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:54,730
I'm at the office.

209
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:55,890
Did you have lunch?

210
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,200
I ordered black bean noodles.

211
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,180
 Ah... Ah, th... that's right, black bean noodles.

212
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:05,410
Honey, I'll call you back after I eat.

213
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:08,620
Okay, eat up before the noodles get soggy.

214
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,840

215
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:25,320
There is no one who knows that Joo Min Jae married Kang Yeo Joo.

216
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:29,920
There is no one who went to the wedding and no one who heard about the wedding.

217
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:33,250
Did they have a secret wedding or something?

218
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,490
Then, why did he disappear right after?

219
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:39,640
He didn't disappear. He died.

220
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,310
Died?

221
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,890
Ten years ago.

222
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,230
A vehicle explosion.

223
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:59,660
The car exploded and he died?

224
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,830

225
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,970
The car was mostly burned up.

226
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:06,750
And both of them passed away before arriving at the hospital.

227
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,360
Two people?

228
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,470
There was a woman in the passenger seat. They were living together.

229
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:17,480
Living together?

230
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,050
Everyone around seemed to know about the relationship.

231
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:24,340
Perhaps... Kang Yeo Joo knew about it as well?

232
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,760
He promised to marry Kang Yeo Joo...

233
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,870
but was two-timing?

234
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,860
But... the interesting thing is—

235
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,680
What? Is there something more?

236
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:04,360
The cause of the vehicle explosion was not revealed... in the end.

237
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:11,000
Since the cause was not revealed... it is possible that it was not an accident?

238
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:22,320
The first article Kang Yeo Joo wrote after she became a reporter was an analysis of a vehicle explosion.

239
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,360
You remember.

240
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,030
This is the article Kang Yeo Joo wrote.

241
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:38,610
The cause of vehicle explosion and case of criminal abuse.

242
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:44,240

243
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:49,010
Reporter Kang Yeo Joo.

244
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,810

245
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:58,120
In an emergency, call this number.

246
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,510
Will it be okay?

247
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:08,360
Won't your wife make it difficult for you?

248
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,970
I don't use that phone, so it's okay.

249
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,570
I'll be going now.

250
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,210
Oh, sure.

251
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:28,840
You're sure  that you're all right?

252
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,640
I'm feeling brave thinking about eating ramen again.

253
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,100
Please don't worry.

254
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,700
There won't be a need to call you.

255
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:01,030
It's just that... I feel relieved thinking that I have someone I can call.

256
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,140
Thank you so much for today.

257
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,470
Goodness.

258
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:36,760
She wrote in such detail about the vehicle explosion.

259
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,680
She understands precisely the workings of the engine.

260
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:42,910
It's good enough to get included in a scientific magazine.

261
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,500
Could it be a coincidence?

262
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:06,250
You know that Kang Yeo Joo does everything like a professional.

263
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,930
Kang Yeo Joo could have disguised it as an accident

264
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:25,290
and killed Joo Min Jae.

265
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,800
 There are many strange things surrounding her.

266
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,790
 But nothing has been properly revealed.

267
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,010
But then again,

268
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:36,610
she even tried to kill her lover.

269
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:39,560
 She tried to kill her boyfriend.

270
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,950
 She suspected that he was cheating on her.

271
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:46,830
In Kang Yeo Joo's books, men who cheat end up getting horribly murdered.

272
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,470
If it was fiction, Han Woo Seong would already be dead. Right?

273
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,780
Oh, no!

274
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:04,360
I saw it clearly with my own two eyes.

275
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:27,740
So you are saying that you saw Baek Soo Jeong's corpse, right?

276
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:34,110
But... how did you escape from there?

277
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,670
Come on, hurry! Grab me!

278
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,480
Run! Run!

279
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,650
That was the last time...

280
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,940
I saw that man.

281
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,830
He is at a hospital now.

282
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:08,230
He is unconscious.

283
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,260
The only person who can testify now...

284
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,480
is you, Mr. Kim Deok Gi.

285
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:16,770
That woman was right.

286
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,240
 Now, the only person who knows the culprit is you.

287
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,190
A woman?  You mean...

288
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:30,930
that Kang Yeo Joo again?

289
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,610
What did Kang Yeo Joo say?

290
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,510
Did she threaten you?

291
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,870
 Then, if you disappear, it becomes a perfect crime.

292
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,570
 Do you still want to get out of here?

293
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:56,070
Look.

294
00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:00,370
We'll protect you so that Kang Yeo Joo can't harm you.

295
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:04,070
- So— 
 - Please let me meet her... Kang Yeo Joo.

296
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,330
Mr. Kim Deok Gi...

297
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:07,130
I'm telling you that I am the culprit!

298
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:10,560
Okay... I got it.

299
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,910
Okay, I got it. I got that.

300
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:15,660
Let me ask you just one question.

301
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,930
That... Baek Soo Jeong's trophy...

302
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:21,700
why did you have it?

303
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,350
She...

304
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:28,110
threw it at me.

305
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,660
I think she misunderstood something.

306
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,430
She got mad at me and...

307
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,830
 You are also with them, aren't you?

308
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,190
 I trusted you.

309
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,630
 To monitor me...

310
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,990
 you were a spy they planted, weren't you?

311
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,050
That was the last time I saw her.

312
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:05,650
But you just said you—!!

313
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,990
You said you killed her.

314
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:13,200
Ah... that's right.  I killed her with that trophy.

315
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,120
You said you killed her with a paring knife! A paring knife!

316
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,450
You said you went like this!

317
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:20,140
Please let me meet Kang Yeo Joo.

318
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,980
Then I will tell you everything.

319
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:28,590
Please I ask you... Please let me meet her once.

320
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:45,450
So, she plans on writing the "Secret Prayer Room" again?

321
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:49,130
I got the publishing contract, so please do not worry.

322
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:52,970
The book... will end up in our hands.

323
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:56,040
If that happens...

324
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,750
It will be a blessing in disguise.

325
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,550
But...

326
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:11,830
It's too early to relax. It's Yeo Joo we are dealing with.

327
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,670
You never know what she might do again.

328
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:19,110
The Daean Daily reporter who died nine years ago...

329
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,040
don't you remember him?

330
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,730
After she married Han Woo Seong,

331
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:27,810
she's been living quietly, hasn't she?

332
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:30,490
That marriage is the problem.

333
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:35,250
Director Nam has Han Woo Seong in his hands.

334
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:40,910
He will try to manipulate Yeo Joo by using that Han Woo  Seong. That rat bastard.

335
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,870
Too many people have gotten hurt.

336
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,880
Don't you think it needs to come to an end this time?

337
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,330
Endure just a few more months...

338
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,660
then it will be our world.

339
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:02,510
Yes, Sir. We will bring it to a close.

340
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,340
Okay.

341
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,110

342
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,710
 Number 1...

343
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,610

344
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:31,450
 I sent you the photo of the mural. Did you see it?

345
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,880
 I didn't get it.

346
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,890

347
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,290
What-What-What?

348
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,790
W-W-What is it?

349
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:28,600
If you cheat, you die.

350
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:33,000
When did I cheat?

351
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,100
I'm talking about my new book, "If You Cheat, You Die."

352
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:43,210
That's right. It's the title of your book, isn't it?

353
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,870
"If You Cheat, You Die."

354
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:48,750
The main character is an attorney, but I need to do some investigation to collect materials.

355
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,740
Can you help me?

356
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,890
Of course.

357
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:59,500
Thank you, Honey.

358
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:04,240
No need to thank me.

359
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:51,160
Why are you having coffee in the morning? It will upset your stomach!

360
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:02,680
Honey, what is this book about?

361
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,500
- An attorney— 
 - It's already interesting! Wow!

362
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,180
Thank you.

363
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,860
- gets involved in a murder case. 
 - Wow!

364
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,050
It sounds really fresh!

365
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:16,000
Who died?

366
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:20,590
An actress who knew the attorney well.

367
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:23,250
She was a Hallyu star at one point. 
  (T/N: Hallyu = the Korean Wave of entertainment)

368
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,250
Are you all right?

369
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:30,780
Are you all right?

370
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,850
My hands were slippery.

371
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:35,450
I'll do it. I'll do it. You'll get hurt.

372
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:52,550
It can slip.

373
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,450

374
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,030
 Ah, why are you like this?

375
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:48,210
The two of them having an affair... Would that be interesting?

376
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,520
No, not really.

377
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,130
No?

378
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:59,610
The detectives... are presuming that they are having an affair.

379
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:07,430
But an attorney and an actress... are not a very good pairing, are they?

380
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:11,360
The story seems a bit autobiographical, too...

381
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,900
Maybe instead, her rent money was stolen or...

382
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,600
maybe that her predecessors treated her unfairly...

383
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,320
Yes.

384
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,250
I will send the money soon.

385
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:27,110
But... it will be solved for sure, right?

386
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,310
You keep...

387
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:51,030
Will the Respondent accept the Petitioner's request for dissolution of marriage?

388
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:53,570
No, it can never happen.

389
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:57,460
The Petitioner had an extramarital affair, but my client wants to forgive everything and keep the family together.

390
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,140
Respondent has usually been treating the Petitioner violently

391
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,650
and it got to a point where it can no longer be tolerated.

392
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:05,080
What about the evidence?

393
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,890
I will present it at the trial.

394
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:10,390
It's not that there is no evidence?

395
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:14,720
Whether or not there is evidence, you will find out at the trial, wouldn't you?

396
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:27,160
Violently? What nonsense!

397
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,510
Knowing full well that she cheated,

398
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:32,690
he cried and pleaded with me to at least prevent a divorce!

399
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:36,330
Her cheating is your client's claim!

400
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:43,690
You don't know how a man is just by his appearance... like you, Attorney Han.

401
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:46,430

402
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:48,700
What about me?

403
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:52,430
Do you know what kind of person this guy is?

404
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:56,660
Wh-Wh-What are you going to say?

405
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:02,240
Nation's husband, my foot! When you are nothing but a cheater—

406
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,540
Why are you covering—

407
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,190
He's a damn cheater, this guy.

408
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:09,160
How many women do you have?

409
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,110
Providing counsel to ones just like you!

410
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:15,970
Uh... Ah... Honorable Mediator, I have a lot of heat in my body...

411
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:19,010
I had plenty of wind ever since my training days. 
  (T/N: "Wind" and "cheat" in Korean are homonyms)

412
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:22,540
Yes... I used to be a wind lover (cheater).

413
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,440
I heard you went to the police station because of your wife, is that right?

414
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:33,750
It was for a witness interview.

415
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:36,970
I heard they applied for a warrant. Witness, my foot!

416
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,230
Applied for a warrant?

417
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,930
You didn't know?

418
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:47,470
The title was really scary... kidnapping, subornation of violence, burial?

419
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:52,000
What nonsense! She only knows about writing fiction!

420
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,890
K-Kidnapping, burial?

421
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:58,580
I heard directly from the team leader for the Criminal Division, so it's up to you to believe it or not.

422
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,900
I'll see you at the trial.

423
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,670

424
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:57,750
 The person you are trying to reach...

425
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:02,330
Don't you think she has become strange?

426
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:12,480
You have been... investigating properly, right?

427
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,740
Yes, they are the best.

428
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,940
I don't think so... Something is strange.

429
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:23,390
I think she has a man, damn!

430
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:28,510
What is the name of the agency?

431
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:31,440
 Today, it's 30% discount!

432
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,650
 It's not just sirloin, but ribs and...

433
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:39,600
Honey, should I ask for the whole rib or ask them to trim it?

434
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,720
Bring a whole rib. I want to work with the knife.

435
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,740
Yes, I understand. Yes.

436
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,500
 Welcome!

437
00:42:56,330 --> 00:43:01,580
 I heard they applied for a warrant. Witness, my foot!  You didn't know?

438
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:10,280
 The title was real scary. Kidnapping, subornation of violence, burial?

439
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:15,890
How does that even make sense? She probably heard something strange from somewhere...

440
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,400
Please try some.

441
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,810
Yes, I will...

442
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:35,750
I'll feed you.

443
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,920
It's okay...

444
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,460
Yes.

445
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:47,220

446
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:05,660
You came? You are a little late.

447
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:10,950
You came personally this time. I could have gone myself.

448
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:13,230
No, I said we should come.

449
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:17,040
Well, it was an opportunity to see your office, too.

450
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:21,460
By the way, judging by this interior,

451
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,930
you are really frugal.

452
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:27,530
Even when we've given you so much money.

453
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,210
Then, I'll give you this month's report.

454
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:46,500
They're holding hands.

455
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:55,590
 This is Professor Lee Moon Gil.

456
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:59,400
 He specializes in western art, and he studied abroad in France.

457
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,360
He does have a lover.

458
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:05,020
Just because he has a lover, doesn't mean that I can trust him, does it?

459
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:07,370
His lover is a man.

460
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,460
I saw him last month and I see him again.

461
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:18,430
You won't be seeing him next month.

462
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:24,720

463
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:43,210
 After the leave... if I enlist in the army immediately,

464
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:48,130
 I wouldn't have any reason to see Go Mi Rae again.

465
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:55,940
 Thank you... for cooperating.

466
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:09,240
Who is this guy?

467
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,970
He seems to hang around Mi Rae.

468
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:15,100
Is it going to be okay?

469
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:21,140
They are a campus couple.

470
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:28,010
They are hiding the fact that they are dating. It's very common in the same major and same school club.

471
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:38,790
I am seeing this older guy for the first time.

472
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:41,380
He's a new face that appeared this month.

473
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:45,690
He is Attorney Han Woo Seong, quite famous as the Nation's Husband.

474
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:49,330
I don't think he would become a problem since he has a good relationship with his wife.

475
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:51,700
He is a family man so he shops at the mart and—

476
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,720
She doesn't usually laugh like this.

477
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,340
I am getting a bad vibe.

478
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:05,100
I will monitor them well.

479
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:17,110
Please make every effort.

480
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,120
Yes, Sir.

481
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:22,990

482
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:28,760
Oh, by the way, Miss Go Mi Rae purchased a house today.

483
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,660
A house?

484
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:34,330
How much was it?

485
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:36,710
It was ₩93,000,000 ($93,000).

486
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:39,260
What kind of house is that cheap?

487
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:41,750
A place where three houses cost ₩60 million ($60,000)?

488
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:56,140
Is there news of re-development here?

489
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:59,360
No, this is a green belt zone.

490
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:01,720
Then, why did she buy it?

491
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,960
It's not as if she's going to live here or invest in it.

492
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,530
Ah, what is this now?

493
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:20,670
Is this a painting of a mermaid princess?

494
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:26,440
It's funny.

495
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:30,750
A mermaid princess... wearing a wet suit.

496
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:49,360
Why change the main display?

497
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:52,850
You said it was the top-selling item for this season.

498
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:58,470
It's time to change of season, so the item is being replaced with a new product.

499
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:04,740
♫  When I saw you  ♫

500
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:19,690
I thought you didn't like stir-fried glass noodles.

501
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,130
It's not for me.

502
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:28,170
You are not uncomfortable about me investigating your office, are you?

503
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:31,200
Why would I feel uncomfortable? What do I have to hide from you?

504
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:36,580
If there is nothing to hide, why do you have a passcode for your phone?

505
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,650
It's because of Jin Ho hyung.

506
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:48,920
He keeps using my cellphone.

507
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:50,750
Jin Ho does?

508
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:53,920
You know that his wife doesn't like him playing games.

509
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:59,720
That's why he pays for the games with my phone.

510
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:03,130
Oh really?

511
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:21,050
I'm here to collect some materials so don't mind me.

512
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:23,830
You can be natural and work.

513
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:30,060
The main character of the book she's writing is an attorney.

514
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:36,940
Let's sit.

515
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:50,000
Honey... that investigating... do you really have to keep doing that?

516
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,560
Why? Is it uncomfortable?

517
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:57,080
N-N-No, it's just that it's hard on you, that's all.

518
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:01,630
I should just have someone aid you with the materials. If I just make a phone call—

519
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:05,080
If I want to know about the day-to-day life of an attorney, I'll have to do it even if it's hard.

520
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,700
It's the fate of a writer, isn't it?

521
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:09,680
Ah, that's true.

522
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,930
It's the fate of a writer.

523
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:18,900
But... why... are you going to... the police station... again?

524
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:22,900
 I heard that they applied for a warrant. Witness, my foot!

525
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:27,010
There is someone I need to visit.

526
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:39,050
Eat slowly.

527
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,520
You must have been very hungry.

528
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,760
Here, have some water.

529
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:28,990

530
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:32,470
 I... am the attorney for Kim Deok Gi?

531
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:35,520
 I submitted the General Power of Attorney in your name as well.

532
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,430
 The cops wouldn't let me visit.

533
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:43,300
 Without even discussing it with me...

534
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:46,250
 I was in a hurry, so I didn't think about discussing it with you. Sorry.

535
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:50,360
 Just... ask a few questions for me.

536
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:57,480
 This will be helpful.

537
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:08,670
When I first saw you, I was very surprised.

538
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,800
I don't look as good as I do on TV, right?

539
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:17,450
For broadcasts, they put on makeup...

540
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:19,990
I saw you in person many times, too.

541
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:21,830
Where?

542
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,890
At Soo Jeong's apartment.

543
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:34,640
 Surprise!

544
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:38,520
 My star Baek.

545
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,310
 That lawyer is married!

546
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:49,190
 I know! Who wouldn't know about the "nation's husband"?

547
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:50,720
 Then, why are you seeing him?

548
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,860
 Who are you to meddle with my private life?

549
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:56,090
 Whether there is a scandal or not, I will take care of it myself!

550
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:58,570
 - Ah, seriously! 
 - Ah, let go!

551
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:00,500
 Let go!

552
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,850
 I'm going to see him!

553
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:12,380
Why did you have an affair with Soo Jeong?

554
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:22,200
You must have misunderstood. I met with Miss Soo Jeong because of work—

555
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:26,740
I shouldn't say anything to Kang Yeo Joo, right?

556
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:32,270
But I think she will eventually find out anyway.

557
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:35,330
Your image was captured on the CCTV.

558
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:38,870
I saw it... the image that was stored on the USB.

559
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:15,920

560
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,320
 Did you ask whether or not he has the video from the CCTV?

561
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:23,640
 The video of Baek Soo Jeong's apartment. Does he have it?

562
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:45,990
That... USB, where is it?

563
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:36,310
You are sure that my image was captured?

564
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:39,710
Yes.

565
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:49,480
Is it indigestion?

566
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,700
It probably is.

567
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:02,260
Mr. Kim Deok Gi! Mr. Kim Deok Gi!

568
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:04,120
Mr. Kim Deok Gi!

569
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,040
Mr. Kim Deok Gi! Mr. Kim Deok Gi!

570
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:09,110
Mr. Kim Deok Gi! Mr. Kim Deok Gi!

571
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:11,020
- Here! 
 - Move aside, please!

572
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:11,990
Hurry! Hurry!

573
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:13,180
Are you all right?

574
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:14,950
Mr. Kim Deok Gi! Mr. Kim Deok Gi!

575
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:16,670
Mr. Kim Deok Gi!

576
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:17,880
Just a moment!

577
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:18,830
Stay still, please!

578
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:20,810
Mr. Kim Deok Gi!

579
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:21,620
Mr. Kim Deok Gi!

580
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:25,120
 Mr. Kim Deok Gi, wake up!

581
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:29,200

582
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:33,510
♫  I can't hide it. Let me down  ♫

583
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:37,790

584
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:42,060
♫  I can't hide it. Let me down  ♫

585
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:46,640
♫  Get away from me  ♫

586
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:54,110
♫  Never mind just get away  ♫

587
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:56,440
 A suspect died inside the police station.

588
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,280
 If you want to at least reduce the sentence,

589
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,720
 confess. Confess!

590
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,330
 She probably stacked the cards to frame Han Woo Seong as the culprit.

591
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:06,760
 She's taking revenge for his cheating. It's her style of story.

592
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:09,520
 Either get murdered or get framed for a murder...

593
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,820
 No, he has no connection at all. He is just someone who helped me and that I'm thankful for.

594
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:13,860
 Leave quietly.

595
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:16,330
 You are the only one to bid my farewell.

596
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:18,850
 That's right. I didn't see anything.

597
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:20,730
 Sister-in-Law, aren't you worried?

598
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:22,610
 Wouldn't it be a good experience as an attorney?

599
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:25,520
 If he is innocent... he should be released soon.

600
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:29,280
♫  Can't you hear...  ♫
