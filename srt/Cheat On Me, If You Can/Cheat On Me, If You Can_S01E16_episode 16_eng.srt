1
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,140
You know who the culprit is.

2
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,090
Isn't that right?

3
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:37,670

4
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,940
Now I know what you want.

5
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,040
The puzzle is complete.

6
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:18,150
I'm sure you mean "the story."

7
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,940
The person who turned themself in

8
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,560
is not the culprit.

9
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,910
Do you even know who turned themself in?

10
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,280
We don't even know yet.

11
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,630
Ah, seriously!

12
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,300

13
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:03,450
These are the detectives in charge: Detective Jang Seung Cheol and Detective An Se Jin.

14
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,250
Hello.

15
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,140
I should've told you sooner.

16
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,300
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,500
I killed her.

18
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,880
Where did you kill her?

19
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,610
In her living room.

20
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,010
What did you kill her with?

21
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,360
A western-style kitchen knife.

22
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,520
It was made in Germany

23
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,810
so it cuts meat well

24
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,660
and doesn't rust easily, either.

25
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,840
 What do you think?  Does the person look like the culprit?

26
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,990
 If it was a wound to the carotid artery, the blood would have spurted out in all directions...

27
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,260
 But her clothes are too clean.

28
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:37,030
 Seeing that we only have the video of her coming out,

29
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,660
 it looks like it was edited.

30
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,460
 Does it seem like it was done intentionally?

31
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,520
Excuse me.

32
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,730
Could you not tell Yeo Joo

33
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,100
about my part in this?

34
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,810
Just... let her think that I quit my work and went down to the countryside.

35
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,560
 Auntie wants to be the culprit.

36
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,240
 She probably will refuse to see me.

37
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,330
Why?

38
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,520
I'm saying I killed a person.

39
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,050
She'll think I'm a horrible person.

40
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,020
Please, just give me that.

41
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,770
Please, I beg you.

42
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:44,750
I raised Yeo Joo since she was a child.

43
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,430
If she finds out that I'm a murderer...

44
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:11,180
 Why did she turn herself in when she's not the culprit?

45
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,080
 Because she thinks that I'm the culprit.

46
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,310
Why isn't she answering the phone?

47
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,800
Auntie is not answering either.

48
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,960
You have a guest.

49
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,510
Miss Mi Rae?

50
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,040
Hello, Attorney Han.

51
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,520
Please drink.

52
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,490
Thank you.

53
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,590
What brings you here? Did you stop by on your way somewhere?

54
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,450
No.

55
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,410
You told me to come to see you if I need help.

56
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,900
Ah, I see. You did the right thing.

57
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,620
How can I help you?

58
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,890
If it's a legal matter, we are confident.

59
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,240
It's a legal matter.

60
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,620
What is it? A lawsuit?

61
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,750
A lawsuit for dissolution of marriage.

62
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:35,130
Ah... Your parents must not be getting along.

63
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,010
No, it's me.

64
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,630
Pardon?

65
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,560
I want to get a divorce.

66
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,760

67
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,410
How in the world would you call this... taking care of things?

68
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,490
After stuffing yourself full of all that money.

69
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,430
The young lady asked for a divorce.

70
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,870
Just taking pictures?

71
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:15,040
Is that the end of it? Huh?

72
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,020
Excuse me, Mi Rae...

73
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:26,370
As to the division of property and alimony... how much are you thinking of?

74
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,820
Two thousand. 
  (T/N: Depending on the unit used, the amount can change. She leaves the unit ambiguous.)

75
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:32,870
Okay, ₩20,000,000 ($20,000) is a possible amount.

76
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,100
I mean ₩200,000,000,000 ($200 million).

77
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,810
Wha—? Excuse me?

78
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:51,030
My office reports only facts to you.

79
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,920
If there's a problem, the two of you should work it out—

80
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,940
So...

81
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,670
You won't take responsibility for this?

82
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:17,040
That responsibility...

83
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,210
Well, how much will do it?

84
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,640
I'm asking, how much do you want to kill that bastard?

85
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,310
Hey, this... this is a lottery win. Wow.

86
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,120
Hey! This is— Oh!

87
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,150
So she was the daughter of the Sae Mirae group.

88
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:54,570
And for someone like her,

89
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,820
I bought ramen and a ₩10,000 ($9) cosmetic?

90
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,280
Hey, if the division of property is worth ₩200,000,000,000,

91
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,390
then if you just think 3% for the contingent fee, how much is that?!

92
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:07,430
₩6,000,000,000!

93
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:12,430
Bro, we are dealing with Jin Sung group's Seo Jae Ha.

94
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,650
Is this the time to talk about the contingent fee?

95
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:18,490
That's true. They will bring their law firm, too.

96
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,530
If they come wearing their boxing gloves,

97
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,150
it will be difficult to win.

98
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,690
But... what is she thinking that she wants to hire us?

99
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,500
 Please don't worry. We'll win.

100
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,200
 Because I'm not going to lose.

101
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,230
Honey, I couldn't reach you all day.

102
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,070
Is anything wrong?

103
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:54,400
I couldn't get hold of Auntie, either...

104
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,960
What? The police station?

105
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:11,140
I know that you are not the culprit.

106
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,500
Please tell me the truth.  We should catch the culprit.

107
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,980
It's true that I killed Baek Soo Jeong.

108
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:22,400
There's no reason why you would do that.

109
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:32,850
This is all because of you, isn't it?

110
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,870
Sorry?

111
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:39,150
Because I was afraid that our Yeo Joo would find out about you cheating on her...

112
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,920
I went to see her

113
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,430
to ask her to stop seeing you.

114
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,470
- Auntie— 
 - What? What?

115
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:54,910
Are you going to lie to me again?

116
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:59,160
I saw you secretly meeting Baek Soo Jeong.

117
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,930
 Why are you being like this?

118
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,220
 Yeo Joo...

119
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:37,330
 Because of her father, she can't stand cheating.

120
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,070
 Are you going to hurt her again?

121
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:43,940
 If you were going to do that, why did you get married?!

122
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,950
Auntie, water, please.

123
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,910

124
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,690

125
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,570

126
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,500
 Auntie, do you remember?

127
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,630
 When I was staying with my maternal grandmother?

128
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,150
 After your mother died like that,

129
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,060
 I heard that you couldn't speak and wouldn't eat,

130
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,810
 and would just cry.

131
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,430
 I was so upset.

132
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,440
 Auntie.

133
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,730
 What is it?

134
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,640
 It's tasty.

135
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,730
 Okay. Good.

136
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,330
 You are brave, our Yeo Joo. Eat.

137
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,470
 Let's eat. Eat.

138
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,170
 I remember.

139
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,590
 That dumpling soup...

140
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,880
 It really was tasty.

141
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,880
What's happening with Yeo Joo's book?

142
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,970
It looks like it's almost finished.

143
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,670
You can get it, right?

144
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,560
The contract for publishing has already been signed.

145
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,090
If by chance,

146
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:31,640
you can't put your hands on that book, it's over for us.

147
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,270
You should take care of things before that.

148
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:38,700
Are you just going to let Yeo Joo go wild like that?

149
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,500
She's targeting me right now!

150
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,890
Yoon Hyeong Sook is the culprit, but you don't have definite evidence?

151
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:54,460
Was any evidence collected at the crime scene?

152
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,370
None.  There was nothing.

153
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:01,650
That's the evidence.  That kind of skill can only mean that it was done by professionals.

154
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:04,820
Not an ordinary housekeeper.

155
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:09,270
For instance... the National Intelligence Service.

156
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:14,560
Detective Jang,

157
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,190
you were already suspecting it, weren't you?

158
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:20,460
That this Baek Soo Jeong case and the case from ten years ago

159
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,860
are connected.

160
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,440
Yeo Joo's a time bomb!

161
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,730
I can't let personal feelings get in the way all the time.

162
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,040
"Personal feelings"?

163
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,390
This is all because of Chief Ma.

164
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,270
 Why would you want me to move

165
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,660
 a corpse that's well buried in the cemetery?

166
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,440
 Places that have connections to Kang Yeo Joo are dangerous.

167
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,550
 Even with a small clue, the corpse can be found.

168
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,150
 Yeo Joo isn't that skilled!

169
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,040
 Okay.  I will go personally.

170
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,700
So frustrating!

171
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,340
Such a scaredy-cat!

172
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:39,200
Are you really going to just let her be?!

173
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,400
If you can't get the book this time,

174
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,080
I'll have to make the decision, isn't that right?

175
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,040
With Kang Yeo Joo... really...

176
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,110
I have an ill-fated relationship.

177
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,070
Kill her...

178
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,630
Save her...

179
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,650
Repeat...

180
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:12,510
There's a piece of evidence that even the National Intelligence Service couldn't get rid of.

181
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,670
The knife.  I will find it for you.

182
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:23,040
You are talking about the missing kitchen knife, aren't you?

183
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,640
Are you sure?

184
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:29,050
Please let me see my housekeeper.

185
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,050
Oh my, what is this? I said I'm not going to see her.

186
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,360
Auntie.

187
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,750
I saw you coming out of Baek Soo Jeong's studio apartment.

188
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,800
- I'm just going to go. 
 - Auntie.

189
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,660
Baek Soo Jeong died because her carotid artery was stabbed.

190
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,630
Blood would have burst out like a fountain.

191
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,960
But not a single drop got on your clothes, though.

192
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,530
 The door was left open.

193
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:22,700
 Excuse me. Are you inside?

194
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,960
 The door was left open so...

195
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,500
 I'm just going in.

196
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:35,750
 Why am I being so polite?

197
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,920
 When I should grab her by the hair and curse at her.

198
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,590
Oh no, I... I killed her!

199
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,370
Don't you talk nonsense!

200
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,280
It's because of me, isn't it?

201
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,130
You saw my perfume bottle

202
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,600
and thought it was me.

203
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,590
 M-My Yeo Joo...

204
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:39,750
Auntie, it wasn't me.

205
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,030
If you keep insisting like this, it will get harder to catch the culprit.

206
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,750
Where did you hide the knife?

207
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,450
 It matches with Yoon Hyeong Sook's fingerprints.

208
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:53,540
You shameless! You have on the mask of a human but...

209
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:58,770
- I'll be released soon anyway. 
 - I know.

210
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,920
- That's why I'm going to pull everything out by the roots. 
 - The roots?

211
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:13,380
You... do you have spare time these days?

212
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,990
If you have time, monitor your husband instead.

213
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:24,020
At Soo Jeong's funeral, he was crying his heart out.

214
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:27,220
Seeing that you are not divorced with something like that going on,

215
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,410
you are quite something, too.

216
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:33,830
Let's go.  No need to respond to this ridiculous nonsense.

217
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,790
Let's go.  We are going.

218
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:40,100
What use is it being so great?

219
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:46,070
A daughter follows her mother's path in life!

220
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:48,130
Let's go. Let's go.

221
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,830
Come on.

222
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:07,280
I wasted energy needlessly cleaning everything. All I did was wear myself out.

223
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:12,280
Auntie, why did you go to Baek Soo Jeong's place?

224
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:17,360
Why would people think that I am the culprit?

225
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,090
The detectives and you, too.

226
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,420
I don't understand.

227
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:28,100
I don't have any reason to kill Baek Soo Jeong.

228
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,950
There's a lot of work I have to do. Go inside.

229
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,560
 That happiness you are enjoying...

230
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,060
 won't last for long.

231
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:15,600
 Because I will take it away from you.

232
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,140
I found all the materials.

233
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,320
Was the actress successful in taking her revenge, I wonder?

234
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,570
Did she seduce the attorney, I wonder?

235
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,080
She probably failed.

236
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,600
Because the attorney... only loves his wife.

237
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:56,960
No, she was successful.  That way, the wife can take harrowing revenge on him.

238
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,480
My readers want that.

239
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,650
You...

240
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:16,150
said you want to learn to write stories, didn't you?

241
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,470
Yes.

242
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,780
I will teach you.

243
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:27,300
But you need to help me in return.

244
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,700
- Your wife had that USB? 
 - Yes.

245
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,560
She submitted it as evidence.

246
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,370
That means she saw your image captured on the CCTV at Baek Soo Jeong's studio apartment.

247
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,060
 What is it?

248
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:54,820
I'm scared because she's not saying anything.

249
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:58,740
Would she take revenge on me?  Knowing that I cheated on her?

250
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:02,440
No way! You just simply get a divorce. Who would—

251
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,320
If it's your wife we're speaking about, maybe she would.

252
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,330
How did it get this far? Seriously.

253
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,320

254
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,550
 I will go in.

255
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,930
Why did he... come here?

256
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,550
Why...

257
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,870

258
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,980
When I looked up, suddenly the signboard fell on top of me so I dodged it.

259
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:36,950
After I dodged it, I looked up again. I don't know if it was a person or a ghost,

260
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:40,290
but something stepped back. Are you sure that it wasn't captured on the CCTV?

261
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:43,340
Yes, I'm sure. There was no one on the rooftop.

262
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,880
I am telling you that I clearly saw it.

263
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,610
It looks like the signboard fell because it was old. Why don't you just settle with the building owner?

264
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:10,890
 The reason was quite intimidating.

265
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:14,930
 Kidnapping, subornation of violence, burial?

266
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,940

267
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:50,010
Are you really going to hand that over to the publisher?

268
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:53,310
Why? You don't like it?

269
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,070
Doesn't it need a little bit of work?

270
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,990
Are you an artist?

271
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,010
I want to publish it quickly.

272
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,670
Okay. Well, first, we'll have to edit it.

273
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,430
Would you like to read it?

274
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:41,680
When do I have the time to read that? The election is right around the corner.

275
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,890
Was the story interesting at least?

276
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:50,220
Well, it was a bit all over the place, unlike the usual Kang Yeo Joo piece.

277
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:54,720
And it wasn't even about the secret prayer room.

278
00:31:56,020 --> 00:32:01,540
You wasted your energy needlessly. Wow. You can go.

279
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:14,760

280
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,840

281
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,620

282
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,850

283
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:28,650

284
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:31,260

285
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,780

286
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,730
Park Jae Geun, Yoon Hyeong Sook, the president.

287
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:50,480
She used all our real names!

288
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,460

289
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:57,160
Immediately file a Motion for Injunction to Prohibit Sales and sue her for defamation of character.

290
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,490
Yes, Sir.

291
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:02,760
And which law firm has the most resources to deal with this?

292
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,540
Then, what the hell was this?

293
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:16,650
 What? The knife disappeared?

294
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:24,010
 I will find the knife and bring it.

295
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:28,430
 - And about Yeom Jin Ok? 
 - Forget it.

296
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:32,020
 - I will take care of it. 
 - Pardon?

297
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,080
 You can leave.

298
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:38,170
 Ah?  Yes, Sir.

299
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,730

300
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,540
What about the one I received?

301
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,680
Ah, I wrote that one.

302
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,790
It's my very first work.

303
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,800
It was a mess.

304
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,750
Everyone is like that at first.

305
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,530
I sent Kang Yeo Joo

306
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:31,300
 the right assistant, it seems.

307
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,660
♫  The times when you shook me up have passed  ♫

308
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:39,560
Why don't you open the book to page 82?

309
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:43,690
I wish you luck, Mr. Ma Dong Kyun.

 Please, sit.

316
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:10,800
 There was not a single post-it note on the books he read.

317
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,860
 He was an editor without a red pen...

318
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:18,700
 There are only words... with a magnifying glass for viewing pictures above.

00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:55,250
♫  I'm frozen in the memories of the past  ♫

331
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:59,250
♫  All the moments fill the vision before me  ♫

332
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:02,540
♫  At the end of the road I didn't take  ♫

333
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:07,460
♫  Don't go away, yeah  ♫

334
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,880
♫  Come back to me  ♫

335
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,720
♫  Don't go away, yeah  ♫

336
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,280
♫  Don't go away  ♫

337
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,990
♫  Don't go away, yeah  ♫

338
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:24,660
♫  Don't go away  ♫

339
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,490
♫  Don't go away  ♫

340
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:32,870

341
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:47,880
But why did you hand over the story I wrote to Chief Ma?

342
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:53,050
Just because... it was fun, wasn't it?

343
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:58,490
And since when did you know that I was a National Intelligence Service agent?

344
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:02,310
How is it possible to not know?

345
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:04,110
When you can catch an egg with your bare hand.

346
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:08,220

347
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,740
Why did you do such a dangerous thing when you can't even make much money doing it?

348
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:39,380
I didn't even have enough for my own use.

349
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,750
There is no way I would sell it to others. Isn't that right, Mi Rae?

350
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,170
You set me up, didn't you?

351
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:50,090
I want a divorce.

352
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:00,840
When I get out, I will kill you.

353
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,040
You won't be able to get out so easily.

354
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,160
You won't be able to quit taking drugs,

355
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,880
and I will keep coming up with people who bought drugs from you.

356
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,420
The reporters are having a field day already.

357
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,960
Calling you the fourth generation chaebol (large industrial conglomerate) who fell into disgrace as a drug dealer.

358
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,330
Some even called you the drug king.

359
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:23,570
Those judges and prosecutors you bought with money,

360
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:26,310
how long do you think they can protect you?

361
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,560
I will kill you! Hey! Hey!

362
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,580
Let go! I will kill you!

363
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:40,420
 I will kill you! I will kill you!

364
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,390
♫  Nevermind, just get away. Yeah, yeah  ♫

365
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:49,390
♫  Yeah. Everything, get away  ♫

366
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:56,520
I'll have to go home early tonight and sit in a hot bathtub for a while.

367
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:00,060
You wish your life was that good.

368
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:03,750
They said the closing report for the investigation needs to be written by tomorrow morning.

369
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,220
Are you saying we have to stay up all night working again?

370
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,690
It's so cold because of the temperature limit for the heater.

371
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,580
Let's just go to a motel.

372
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,020
I don't want to.

373
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:16,110
Ah, let's just go to a motel!

374
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:23,380
Ah, what does it matter when we are working? When there is no feeling between us?

375
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,440
Ah, the people are all...

376
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,130
It matters.

377
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,080
When you get married, you will know, too.

378
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,320
You are so loud! People are all whispering.

379
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,450
Ah, seriously! Fine, whatever.

380
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,490
Then, in the car...

381
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:39,880
go ahead sleep all crumpled up.

382
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,750
Ah, seriously!

383
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:46,540
You sleep on the floor then.

384
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,760
Why would I? Not going to happen.

385
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,600
Men are all the same.

386
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,080
I've never looked elsewhere. You should be happy to be with a guy like me.

387
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,060
- That's why I'm putting up with you. 
 - Wow, great.

388
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,610
Hey, Woo Seong. What's up?

389
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:07,750
Right now?

390
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:10,760
We're supposed to go to the supermarket together!

391
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,610
No, I'm not busy at all.

392
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,900
I will be right there.

393
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,150
Sorry.

394
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,500
I will see you later. (very formally)

395
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:24,060
Aw, okay, okay.  Sorry.

396
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:27,380
It'd be better if you just cheated on me!

397
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:30,390
You just wait until you come back.

398
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,290
Last night...

399
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,030
A signboard fell on top of me.

400
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:53,360
Are you sure it wasn't an accident?

401
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,100
No.

402
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:59,870
I saw something... yesterday.

403
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:02,080

404
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,800
The assistant has been concerning me lately.

405
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,810
He was with the special operations unit and he used to work at a detective agency.

406
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:12,510
Are you writing a story, too?

407
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:15,450
Ah, seriously.

408
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:19,190
She even got life insurance without letting me know.

409
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:21,210
Worth ₩1,500,000,000 ($1,500,000).

410
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:22,720
What?

411
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:28,180
Could the two of them have planned together and...

412
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,100
No. No.

413
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:34,630
It's very chilling.

414
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,960
I am sorry.

415
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:20,550
 Excuse me.

416
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:31,450
 Are you going to just let that punk walk around freely?

417
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:33,370
 Are you?

418
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:37,390
 Go right now and make him paralyzed or kill him or do something!

419
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:39,730
 Do it, quickly.

420
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,250
 How did you dare to covet something you can't have?

421
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:48,470
 Those people are on a completely different level than you.

422
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:51,130
 Why did you mess around without knowing anything and shorten your life?

423
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:54,550
 I don't want to do this, either.

424
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:37,320
Ah, what is this? What happened?

425
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:53,610
Ah, Cha Soo Ho, that punk again!

426
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:03,180
And I think I met someone yesterday...

427
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:06,910
 - Where did he get hurt like this? 
 -  Mister, you are bleeding!

428
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:11,490
 - How can we help you? 
 - I will give you... as much money as you want.

429
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,270
Was that a dream?

430
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:20,580
Let me see.

431
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,020

432
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:37,240
₩50,000,000 ($50,000)?

433
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:42,660
W-Where did I send this much money to?

434
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,090
Why did you drink so much?

435
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:03,870
Did you get hurt? Your clothes are a mess, too.

436
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,240
Drink some of this at least.

437
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:39,320
 I don't want to do this, either.

438
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,160
 Writer Kang asked me for a favor.

439
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:15,190
Aren't you eating? You like pufferfish soup.

440
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:31,630
Honey, this won't do.

441
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:35,750
- Let's talk honestly. 
 - About what?

442
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:43,230
Last night, I met your assistant.

443
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,100
Did you tell him to do it?

444
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,300
You caught on?

445
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:13,110
I didn't think it could possibly be, but did you really... tell him to do it?

446
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:19,870
Well, he told me he was with the special operations unit and used to work at a detective agency as well so...

447
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:28,740
Why? Because I cheated? Or is it because of the young and handsome assistant?

448
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:35,730
Did you cheat on me?

449
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:41,260
What?

450
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:48,780
Ah, t-that...

451
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:55,900
I'm saying that you might wrongly s-suspect that I cheated...

452
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,130
T-That's why.

453
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:06,840
Yes.

454
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:10,690
Hello.

455
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:16,970
You are Chief Manager Gwak Jeong Moon, aren't you?

456
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:22,210
Yes, I am. How can I help you?

457
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:25,640
We heard that you are the best in this field, is that right?

458
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:28,490
That's why we would like to hire you.

459
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:34,210
Well... Can you kill... a person for us, please?

460
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:39,650
Who?

461
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:48,170
How could you misunderstand something like that?

462
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:51,940
Soo Ho saved you, twice.

463
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:54,840
He even hurt his shoulder which I feel so bad about.

464
00:48:56,050 --> 00:49:01,400
 They are at a completely different level than you. A level you could never dream to achieve.

465
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:09,620
 As you heard, he will not be able to get near your wife from now on.

466
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:11,780
 Yes. Please don't worry.

467
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:18,740
 Why are you doing this to me?

468
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:25,300
 - Please spare my life. 
 - I don't want to do this, either.

469
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:30,650
 Writer Kang asked me for a favor.

470
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:05,650
Because... he is... around a lot...

471
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:07,670
I asked him for a favor.

472
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:10,240
Because I thought you might be in danger.

473
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:20,170
I am sorry... for misunderstanding.

474
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,160
If you didn't get hurt, it's okay.

475
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:31,810
If you don't want to have the pufferfish soup, have the dumpling soup. Auntie made a lot.

476
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:43,080
- I'll just have the pufferfish soup. 
 - Then have it.

477
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:48,880
It's tasty.

478
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:55,940
I knew it. There's no way your wife would...

479
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:02,550
My wife was only concerned for me.

480
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:11,600
 Director, when my wife suddenly gave me permission to go into politics,

481
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,300
 was it to monitor me?

482
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:17,770
 It was to protect you, Attorney Han.

483
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:20,600
 In case something dangerous happened.

484
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:24,930
 If you become a congressman, then at the very least,

485
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:27,430
 the opposing side wouldn't easily be able to do something to you.

486
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,680
 You don't know, do you?

487
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:39,040
 How dangerous your situation was.

488
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,100
It's your guilty conscience getting the best of you. Geez.

489
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,740
You are right.

490
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:49,120
There is no "being cool" between a man and a woman.

491
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,290
That's right.

492
00:52:50,290 --> 00:52:54,190
I am sick of women now.

493
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:56,220
Okay. Get to your work.

494
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:20,540

495
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:57,360
Since the book is complete, there won't be any reason to see each other again.

496
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,920
Are you going back to the National Intelligence Service?

497
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:04,020
I'm going to hand in my letter of resignation.

498
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:13,960
With my retirement bonus, should I open up a convenience store?

499
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,120
In this area?

500
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:34,270
Where do they sell a jacket like that?

501
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:42,080
Dokdo (an island in the Sea of Japan). I always visit once a year.

502
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:46,720
Would you like to go with me once?

503
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,980
Are you coming onto me now?

504
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:03,720
May I?

505
00:55:09,950 --> 00:55:17,340
♫  You tried so hard to hide it  ♫

506
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:18,160
♫  Your little secret  ♫

507
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:22,710
♫  I pretended not to know and ignored it  ♫

508
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:25,230
No, I am busy now.

509
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:27,050
♫  You got used to it over time  ♫

510
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:30,010
♫  I'm sure you thought it was perfect  ♫

511
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:31,390
 Team Leader Gwak.

512
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:35,400
♫  I bet you never even looked back  ♫

513
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:42,430
♫  And I had to watch you do it all 
 I'll make sure you get what you deserve  ♫

514
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:50,570
♫  Feel my cold gaze 
 I'm never gonna love again  ♫

515
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:55,080
♫  Try playing around with those lips again  ♫

516
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:58,770
 Some people came by who wanted me to kill you for them.

517
00:55:58,770 --> 00:55:59,640
♫  Sweet temptation like sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

518
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:04,480
 I don't like you but not enough to kill you. That's why I am telling you.

519
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,480
♫  Sugar, sugar  ♫

520
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,350
 Be careful, please.

521
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:12,040
 The person who ordered the murder for hire... is your husband.

522
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,040
♫  Leave me alone  ♫

523
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:20,430
 There is no reason my husband would want to kill me.

524
00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:28,130
Are you aware... of your husband's relationships with other women?

525
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:49,060
Honey!

526
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:58,030
Honey!

527
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:04,680
Honey!

528
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,890
Honey!

529
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:13,160
Honey!

530
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:17,080
Honey!

531
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:43,480
What is this?

532
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:54,430

533
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:58,070

534
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:23,380
Honey, d-did you press the wrong button?

535
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:32,500
Honey... we...

536
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,820
Is anything wrong?

♫  Your gaze that stops me  ♫

♫  Such unbelieveable timing  ♫

546

♫  Everything is still the mess we left behind  ♫

♫  This is certainly the end  ♫

♫  The palace I dreamed of for a moment  ♫

♫  My every moment has become empty  ♫
