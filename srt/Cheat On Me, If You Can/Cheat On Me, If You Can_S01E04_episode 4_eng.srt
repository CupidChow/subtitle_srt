1
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,730
What do you think, Mr. Han?

2
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,750
Would you like to buy it?

3
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,750
I won't wait long.

4
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,010
There are many people looking for it.

5
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,870

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,370
 It's 50,000,000 won by tomorrow.

7
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,660
How much is it, that you're like this?

8
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,940
What?

9
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,940
Too expensive to agree to, but too difficult to ignore.

10
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,020
You're making that kind of face.

11
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,660
It's not that. The meat is just a little chewy.

12
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,250
What do you mean, it's not that?

13
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,690
Is it life insurance or an annuity?

14
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,530
You said the call was about buying insurance.

15
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,420
 It's okay.

16
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,200
 It's probably a call asking me to buy insurance.

17
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,580
If it's too expensive, it's either life or annuity.

18
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,690
Get life insurance then.

19
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,180
I'll just get liability insurance. Since I'm still healthy.

20
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,530
The world is dangerous.

21
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,860
You never know what could happen to someone. There could be an accident.

22
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,070
I think that would make me feel completely lost.

23
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,110
These days, even royalties aren't enough,

24
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,660
and I've not been able to write something new.

25
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:50,740
I think it'll be reassuring to have life insurance.

26
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:58,900

27
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,840
Yes, Director.

28
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,380
There's nothing out of the ordinary.

29
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,090
But in her basement,

30
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,040
I found human blood.

31
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,090
It's type B blood, and it's under a week old.

32
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,590
 The forensics are checking the DNA.

33
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,280
Blood type B?

34
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,440
Kang Yeo Joo's blood is type A, Han Woo Seong's blood is type O, and the housekeeper's blood is type AB.

35
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:20,580
There's no one in that family with blood type B, but Baek Soo Jeong is type B.

36
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,980
So,

37
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,420
you're saying that Baek Soo Jeong's disappearance has

38
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,030
some connection with Kang Yeo Joo?

39
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,480
It's not certain but—

40
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,260
Twenty-seven percent of this country's citizens have type B blood.

41
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,290
Don't waste your time on useless endeavors.

42
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,420
Even if I withdraw the fund, it's not that much.

43
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,130
Do you have any money?

44
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,030
I can't use an account with a deficit! She'll catch on!

45
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,150
You can see all the accounts on one screen these days.

46
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:19,270
I'm getting allowances myself nowadays. What money would I have?

47
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,120
Stop.

48
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,330
Don't do that!

49
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,650
I'm dead! I'm dead. How much is he asking for?

50
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,790
Dad is on the phone right now, stop.

51
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:38,110
What? 50,000,000?

52
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,030
Oh, sorry!

53
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,820
Don't cry, please! You're okay!

54
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:51,890
Where does it hurt? Daddy is sorry.

55
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,170
What? Where did it go?

56
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,740
I told you to watch the kid and you make him cry—

57
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,730
Are you looking for something?

58
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,710
What do you mean?

59
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,290
There was a lot of dust here.

60
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,590
If there's a spark, a fire could start.

61
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,680
Really?

62
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,310
Oh, I thought you were looking for this.

63
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,660
Money keeps turning up in this house.

64
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,850
Let's go!

65
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,340
My little son.

66
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,870

67
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,150
What are you doing?

68
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:28,370
Money keeps popping up in this house.

69
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,980
What? Only $300?

70
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,630
No. That's enough then.

71
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,850
Yeah, thanks. Bye.

72
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,790
Ironing in the middle of the night?

73
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:37,270
I thought it over carefully last night.

74
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:40,670
I think I can solve this with the money I have now.

75
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,370
Really? Okay, I'll be there quick.

76
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,670
Here. Take care of these, too.

77
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,290
Come on.

78
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,330
Attorney Han Woo Seong?

79
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,540
 He looks younger up close.

80
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,590
 No excess on his body at his age.

81
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,870
Does he have a personal stylist?

82
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:46,040
He wears it like it's out of a magazine.

83
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,380
He basically looks like a celebrity.

84
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,850
I'll call you back.

85
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,010
Should I give you an autograph?

86
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,280
 Han Woo Seong. Please be happy. :)

87
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:33,570
I'm pretty sure I told you not to think about it.

88
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:37,590
Stop playing detective and watch her closely.

89
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,260
Additional agents will join you.

90
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:48,900
Of course, I know. I know, okay?

91
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,780
The head is all the way up on the top.

92
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,950
 She put on a great performance in her last work.

93
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,700
 She's last year's winner.

94
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,480
 And this year, she's a nominee for the Grand Prize.

95
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,520
Hello, Writer Kang.

96
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,600
Sure, whatever.

97
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,880
Every dress looks old and used.

98
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,600
You can't hide even a small knife in those kinds of clothes.

99
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,920
But still, the heels can be a weapon.

100
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,650
But then again, that size of earring

101
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,640
could be used against a vital point.

102
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,830
This is what you call a weapon.

103
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:56,560
Doesn't it look like the hammer that was made by Yoo Young Cheol?

104
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,020
It looks really heavy.

105
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,490
It looks like it's plated in a tin alloy.

106
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,210
And it's heavy enough that everyone is using two hands to hold it.

107
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,760
- I guess the serial murderer this time is a celebrity. 
 - No.

108
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,700
Go buy some more beer.

109
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,740
And this, too.

110
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:22,370
I see this serial killer is an alcoholic.

111
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,340
Be careful on the way. So that the beer doesn't get foamy.

112
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,070
This was the best job. There was nothing I had to do.

113
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,100
 I'm sorry.

114
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,850
It was better when I was here.

115
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,980
Kang Yeo Joo always drinks this.

116
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,460
And she only eats that.

117
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:08,590
She always sits there so, even if it's empty, put some boxes on top so other customers can't sit there.

118
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:13,220
And most importantly, don't forget the straw.

119
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,910
25,800 won.

120
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,340
Do you know anything about Kang Yeo Joo?

121
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:26,020
Resident registration number, school, house, publishing house, alumni.

122
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,340
What about her books? Have you read them?

123
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:32,350
"The night when the still-warm blood dampened the dry leaves,

124
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,850
the dark blue moonlight covered the graveyard like a cotton blanket."

125
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:39,770
It's her fourth work, page 94 titled Live Burial, 11th line.

126
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:50,580
She's a monster. Did she memorize all six books?

127
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,600
  Congratulations!

128
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,500
That's a really expensive one.

129
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,430
Is it sponsored?

130
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,640
Did someone buy it for her?

131
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,990
 Are you taking down the curtains?

132
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,720
Yes.

133
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:37,470
 Don't forget to dust the rails when you take the curtains down!

134
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,650
Okay, I said I got it.

135
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,810
Don't even think about resting! We have to clean today!

136
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,630
Okay.

137
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,340
He responds well enough.

138
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,230
Seriously.

139
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,840
Dad!

140
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:08,420
Dad's on his way to work.

141
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,110
Okay, okay.

142
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,250
You're so good at saying goodbye.

143
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:21,450
I told him to clean out his pockets!

144
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,990
He never checks them!

145
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,990
I can't live!

146
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:36,190
I said to take off your socks and put them here!

147
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:40,800
I can't do this anymore! You do it!

148
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,520
Dad ran for it.

149
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,620
What? This guy.

150
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,670
How can you say he ran for it? That's rude.

151
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:55,740
Right. Dad ran for it.  (Formal)

152
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,530
Where did he go?

153
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,230
To work.

154
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:02,620
I mean he went to work.  (Formal)

155
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,160
What work does he have on Sunday?

156
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,680
 Where is it?

157
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,780
I feel like he needs money and isn't telling me.

158
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,180
There's no need to go this far.

159
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,980
I think it would be better to...

160
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,760
 Hey!

161
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,970
Fine.

162
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,220
Writer?

163
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,570
Writer!

164
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,880
I bought beer.

165
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,260
You're here?

166
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,170
Are you going somewhere?

167
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,220
Yeah.

168
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,590
I went a bit overboard while trying to match with the shoes.

169
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:48,450
I see you like that style. I didn't know.

170
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,600
No, I hate this style.

171
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,690
The sound gets on my nerves.

172
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,110
Then why are you wearing it?

173
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,100
It's a cool thing.

174
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:06,040
Every time I walk I get on someone's nerves.

175
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,800
I'm sorry?

176
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,490
Why were you so late?

177
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:27,940
I barely got out of there. Did you get the money?

178
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,160
5,000,000 won.

179
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,700
Will that be enough?

180
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,000
Don't worry. I have a plan. You brought the laptop, right?

181
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,100
Yeah.

182
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,680
Here.

183
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,200
- What are you going to do? 
 - Wait a second.

184
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,380
Okay.

185
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,890
Okay. What?

186
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:52,240
Did you buy a fountain pen again?

187
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,570
Geez.

188
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,560
Is it expensive?

189
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:01,150
- Wow, the gold there is... 
 - It's working well.

190
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,090
Oh my gosh—

191
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:06,310
My nostrils.

192
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,470
It's a hidden camera?

193
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,830
What are you trying to record?

194
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,970
The maintenance chief.

195
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:23,550
- What's the plan? 
 - First, I'll give him 5,000,000 won ($5,000).

196
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,860
This is it?

197
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:42,020
Are you kidding me? Do you think I'm a beggar?

198
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:48,660
Should I report you to Dispatch

199
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,860
and see what happens?

200
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:55,390
So you're saying if I don't pay the 50,000,000,

201
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,530
you'll release my video?

202
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:03,000
It's not 50,000,000 won anymore, now it's 100,000,000 won.

203
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,480
First,

204
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,750
according to Clause 1 of Article 283 of the Criminal Code:

205
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:15,080
those who threaten a person shall be sentenced up to three years in prison or fined up to 5,000,000 won.

206
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,880
What?

207
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,150
The crime of blackmail according to Clause 350 of Article 1 of the Criminal Law:

208
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:27,680
anyone who threatens for personal gain will be sentenced up to ten years.

209
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,490
I recorded you threatening me this whole time.

210
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:36,390
 Should I report you to Dispatch

211
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,020
 and see what happens?

212
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,910
Will you take the 5,000,000 won

213
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:47,970
or go to jail?

214
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,140
I just need to record the part when he's threatening me.

215
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,840
Then he won't be able to ask for too much.

216
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,670
Of course, not unless he's an idiot. He'll go away with 5,000,000 won.

217
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:01,430
It's not even a video of a crime.

218
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:06,050
I was nervous for no reason.

219
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,400
It's nothing.

220
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,110
You are so smart.

221
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,580
 Why isn't he coming? Call him.

222
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,820
 He's not picking up.

223
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,240

224
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,070

225
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,680
So annoying. Why does she keep calling?

226
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,640
I apologize, continue.

227
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,740
I was a little on edge from not sleeping well the night before.

228
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,700
But they were fighting late at night in the hallway.

229
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,470
You can hear everything in the hallway even if you're quiet. It was really loud.

230
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,850
 Who do you think you are to butt into my personal life?

231
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,190
 Who cares if there's a scandal or not! I'll handle it.

232
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,620
 Come on!

233
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,880
 Let go! I said let go!

234
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,640
 I'm going to meet him! He's coming over!

235
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,480
They fought for a while then it got quiet.

236
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,410
By any chance, was it a guy?

237
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:08,350
Yes, he was tall and had broad shoulders.

238
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:11,270
Was he on the good looking side?

239
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,570
No.

240
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:16,740
I saw him in the parking garage sometimes but he didn't leave a good impression.

241
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,460
Did you see him in the parking garage?

242
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:23,060
He called Baek Soo Jeong "Big Sis"

243
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,880
and would help her carry stuff and drive her car.

244
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,740
You call people like that "managers."

245
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,560
Someone who holds a celebrity's items and drives them around. They're called managers, right?

246
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:53,120
I watched the Korean Wave Awards Ceremony all night.

247
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,130
That award ceremony was from a few days ago.

248
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,970
I watched it over and over again.

249
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,790
You must have a lot of time on your hands.

250
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:01,400
I'm working on a new book these days.

251
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,270
When the book comes out, it'll become a best seller, obviously;

252
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,050
and at the year's end, I'll receive an award.

253
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:10,900
Even if it's bothersome, I should at least be aware of what types of dresses are in style.

254
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,280
How much longer are you going to keep following us?

255
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,630
I didn't bring a car.

256
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:23,890
You want a ride?

257
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:26,190
It's not free.

258
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:29,510
I'll find you the trophy.

259
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,320
What are you talking about, "trophy?"

260
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,690
The award ceremony trophy.

261
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:46,870
That trophy wasn't in Baek Soo Jeong's house.

262
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,970
Why does the trophy need to be there?

263
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:53,340
The day she disappeared, she received the Best Entertainer at the Korean Wave Award Ceremony.

264
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:58,920
She was wearing a yellow silk dress. Cold medicine?

265
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,490
No, it looked like a giant mucus.

266
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:03,770
Mucus?

267
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:07,480
Excuse me. We know about her receiving the award, too.

268
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,080
Then, why don't you know about the missing trophy?

269
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,400

270
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,480
 It's notorious for being a very big and heavy award.

271
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,450
 A junior colleague of mine usually

272
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,120
 uses it for cracking open walnuts.

273
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:28,010
Would walnuts be the only thing you could crack?

274
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,550
Are you saying the culprit could've used it as a weapon?

275
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:34,210
You've watched too many movies.

276
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:37,070
The trophy is evidence,

277
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:39,520
so why do you think it disappeared?

278
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:44,510
Don't you think the manager would know?

279
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:54,920

280
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,810
Are you home?

281
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,970
If you need help, ask.

282
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:06,590
Why? Would you like to open it?

283
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:09,630
It doesn't look that hard.

284
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:19,210
Hey. Hey, what are you doing? Hey!

285
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:25,180
- You're crazy. 
 - Oh no, my hand slipped.

286
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,320
Damn it.

287
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:43,590
Where is he?

288
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:02,240
Why do you think there's a dried out half-dead plant by the door?

289
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,550
You should've told me earlier!

290
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,710
Be quiet.

291
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:21,860
Ugh, so annoying acting like she's all that.

292
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,120
What's this?

293
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,660
He wasn't an ordinary manager.

294
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:58,160
Wow. At this rate, he'd be considered a stalker.

295
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,970
Why would they use this stalker as a manager?

296
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:05,660
I'm also using a stalker as my assistant.

297
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:10,350
Obsessive people do their jobs well. They're thorough.

298
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,480
What's this?

299
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:28,000
Baek Soo Jeong used to MC the Morning Talk.

300
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,790
I've watched that program before.

301
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,530

302
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,670
I'm getting a feeling.

303
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:57,940
Hey. Come here.

304
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,130
Look at these.

305
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,660
Only one is different.

306
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,700
What are you saying is different?

307
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,990
The angle is different.

308
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:30,010
Her neck angle is different. That is the angle of her heart.

309
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,110
Like this.

310
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,220
- Then, does that mean these two are—  
- Are you two dating?

311
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:46,710
Get off me. You're heavy.

312
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:49,610
It's because there's a lot on my mind.

313
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:54,760
If I knew, I would've taken a taxi.

314
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,650
You can still take a taxi now and be on your way.

315
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:00,490
I should pay you for the ride.

316
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,450
What do you think that lady is really thinking?

317
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:32,990
She's probably just looking for something for her novel.

318
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:36,690
They say this symbolizes a fist.

319
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:40,310
Does it mean "fighting" or something?

320
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:44,380
Did you get in touch with the producer?

321
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,870
Yes. He's at the TV station.

322
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,750
Even though it's Sunday?

323
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:51,570
They don't have "weekends" over there either.

324
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:54,690
Wow, looks like we're not the only ones working overtime for a living.

325
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:56,910
It's the same for everyone.

326
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:01,430

327
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,780
Why isn't he showing up?

328
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:11,660
Something seems a bit off.

329
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,680
I need to find out what he's up to.

330
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:17,460
Okay.

331
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,460

332
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:30,210
Hello. You're the PD for Morning Talk, right?

333
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:33,900
Yes. How can I help you?

334
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,850
Do you know Han Woo Seong?

335
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:38,580
Yes.

336
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,840
The chief quit.

337
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,130
I'm sorry?

338
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:45,640
He packed up and everything.

339
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,320
But up until yesterday, he was still—

340
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,900
I know.

341
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,650
He didn't even transfer everything over to me.

342
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:58,100
He was cast for the part because Soo Jeong requested it.

343
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,790
What kind of relationship did they have?

344
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:07,390
It was one sided on Soo Jeong's part.

345
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:11,320
Should I say she hit on him?

346
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,630
 Would you like to eat lunch together?

347
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:22,360
Then, are you saying Han Woo Seong wasn't interested at all?

348
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,550
He blocked it off completely.

349
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:27,650
You know. He's the nation's husband.

350
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:34,450
 I'm busy so I'll get going.

351
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,240
 Good work.

352
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,870
But then again, his wife is known as Witch Kang.

353
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,480
Witch Kang?

354
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,670
I'm sure you know since you're detectives.

355
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,850
She's on "We Want to Know."

356
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:49,520
Writer Kang Yeo Joo.

357
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,040
- What? 
 - Kang Yeo Joo?

358
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,710
Is that why she...

359
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,060
 Are you two dating?

360
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:14,170
I'm at a loss for words.

361
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:24,210
 I won't wait long.

362
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,520
 There are so many people who want to see it.

363
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,220
 I need to get the original.

364
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,020
Going to go to work?

365
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,950
Yes, I write better at dawn.

366
00:33:54,780 --> 00:34:01,190
 The scent of your shampoo and soap you're currently using... I can tell they are excessively expensive.

367
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,690
Is this the cheapest one?

368
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:25,310

369
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,700
Why are you following me? Aren't you working?

370
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,120
It's time for rotation.

371
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,440
What?

372
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:01,820
Do you have to eat the target's favorite snacks and beer when you're on the job?

373
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,950
Don't you know about rapport forming?

374
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:06,210
You have to know them better in order to get close.

375
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:08,830
When you get close, doesn't it interfere with your job?

376
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:12,920
Don't worry. I've been working for six months and she still hasn't noticed me.

377
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,730
It's not an easy thing to do.

378
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:17,660
Maybe you're not her type.

379
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,090
If you finished working then head home.

380
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:26,740
It's my job to search the perimeters of the target's home.

381
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,520
It's the target.

382
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,010
What is this place?

383
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:07,810
573-3 Deokhwang-ri, Doseon-myeon.

384
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:09,660
It's famous for mountain herb roots.

385
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,520
There was something like this near Seoul?

386
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,490
What's with that truck, gosh.

387
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,500
The sound.

388
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,950
Look, we're losing her!

389
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,650
Where does that road lead to?

390
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,520
It's all mountain herb root fields.

391
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,530
There's a fishing spot nearby but nothing else.

392
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,900
What about this way?

393
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,030
Mountain.

394
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,970
There's no place in this country without a mountain.

395
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:26,730
There's a cemetery. It's quite large.

396
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:32,600
Where do you think Kang Yeo Joo went?

397
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,330
Well, I'm sure she's not out buying mountain herb roots.

398
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,890
So many dead people...

399
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,190
Maybe she went to buy the roots.

400
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,660
It's obviously the cemetery that she was visiting.

401
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,890
Why would she go to a cemetery?

402
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,700
To collect data.

403
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:40,060
The cemetery is the best place to hide a body.

404
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,470
You know. Kang Yeo Joo only writes novels like those.

405
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,920
At this time of night?

406
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,170
It doesn't feel the same in the morning.

407
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:48,130
Her sixth novel,

408
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:52,400
"The Murder Case Without a Corpse," a body is buried at 1:00 a.m.

409
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,620
At a cemetery.

410
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,950
I read it, too.

411
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:03,830
  All of the grass at the cemetery are hiding knife blades.

412
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:06,070
 In order to remember the murder.

413
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:09,900
 Page 84, 5th line.

414
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,520
Get in.

415
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,650
It is by the cemetery, right?

416
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:33,230
There's no better place to hide a body than in a cemetery.

417
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:35,480
Since it's full of bodies.

418
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,880
You can't recklessly dig up a private grave like it's a hill.

419
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,060
And there's no way a warrant will be issued.

420
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:46,060
Then it won't be found.

421
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,160
What if it's done properly?

422
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,010
 Why does it have to be now when Baek Soo Jeong disappeared?

423
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:54,410
 Be careful. She's a dangerous woman.

424
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:57,440
I need to be given the right information to do my work!

425
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,430
Yes?

426
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,720
I wasn't saying it to you.

427
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:12,330
Isn't the smell of mountain herb roots getting strong here?

428
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:14,870
Maybe because we're near the cemetery.

429
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,990
That's not the way to her house!

430
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:35,970
She's going to the mart. She goes to the same place every time.

431
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:45,260
I needed to cool my head for a bit.

432
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,130
I'll stop by the mart and then go home. Okay.

433
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:28,510
Is the main character a butcher, this time?

434
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:44,730
What on earth is going on inside her head?

435
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,380
 Throw a water bomb.

436
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,890

437
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:09,470
- A painted tshirt! 
 - Look!

438
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:10,670
Wow!

439
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:11,790
 Come here, come here, come here.

440
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:13,520
- Can I look at these? 
 - Yes, yes!

441
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,110
Go Mi Rae!

442
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:23,800
I'm having a  party in Gangnam. Want to come?

443
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,900
I'm a little busy today.

444
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:34,510
This is the 47th rejection.

445
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,860
Okay.

446
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:40,030
I'm off.

447
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:42,440
I'm really going.

448
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,690
I'm not giving up.

449
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,850
Hello! I'm from the Green Ivy Club!

450
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:57,520
How are you planning to complete your volunteering credits?

451
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,950
You have to pass your TOEIC in your 4th year, and so there's no time to volunteer then. 
  (TOEIC: Test of English for International Communication.)

452
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:02,540
Thank you so much. Thank you.

453
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:03,580
 Please consider joining.

454
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,740
- Hello. 
 - Hi, Mi Rae!

455
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:08,130
- Hello. 
 - You're here?

456
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:10,040
What are you doing?

457
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:24,240
You haven't been able to... contact him yet?

458
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,070
He even quit his job.

459
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:33,940
Did he take someone else's money and run off?

460
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,530
By the way...

461
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,580
Here.

462
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,090
- What's this? 
 - It's yours.

463
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:49,830
- A gift? 
 - Open it.

464
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:53,550
What's with the packaging?

465
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:17,560
Where did you find this?

466
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,160
Some student gave it to me.

467
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,000
Student?

468
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:26,090
 Attorney Han!

469
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:30,280
 Excuse me!

470
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:33,420
Could it be?

471
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:35,550
Hello, I'm with Green Ivy!

472
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:37,450
How are you planning to fill your volunteer credits?

473
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:39,330
- Thank you. 
 - Wow, that's pretty.

474
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:41,290
 How are you planning to fill your volunteer credits?

475
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:43,300
 You have to pass TOEIC, so you won't have time to volunteer then.

476
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:45,430
 Don't regret it later, please join.

477
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:47,340
 Thank you.

478
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,890
Are you really an art student?

479
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:55,820
We just need to fix the details and it'll be fine.

480
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:58,560
If you draw it like that, do you think new members will join?

481
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:21,120
Mi Rae! You're awesome.

482
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:42,500
Hey. The person who dropped off the pen, was it a female student?

483
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:46,320
Welcome.

484
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:55,260
No. It was a male student.

485
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:58,420
He was really built. Like a wrestling athlete.

486
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,730
Really?

487
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:04,260
Why? Were you expecting something else?

488
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:07,110
Like a young pretty female student?

489
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:09,920
You... You still haven't come to your senses.

490
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,950
What are you talking about? Don't even say the word "woman" around me.

491
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:17,060
What do you think is causing me all this grief right now?

492
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:19,520
At least you know.

493
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:28,050
Yes, Director Nam?

494
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:31,560

495
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,170
- Good work, everyone. 
 - Good work.

496
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:35,180
Excuse me.

497
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:37,260
Mi Rae, good job.

498
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,940
Mi Rae, are you going to the environmental cleanup? It's happening at the Han River.

499
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,150
Have you ever seen Mi Rae go to those kinds of things?

500
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:44,410
I heard a celebrity is going.

501
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:45,890
You're lying. Which celebrity is going?

502
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:48,070
Han Woo Seong.

503
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:50,530
Attorney Han Woo Seong?

504
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:53,860
He even helped hand out food at the orphanage. The Nation's Husband.

505
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,630
How is he a celebrity?

506
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:59,630
If you come out on TV, you're a celebrity. You've never seen a celebrity before, have you?

507
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:04,750

508
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:10,450
You're really not going?

509
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,930
I have a prior appointment.

510
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:19,420
What did Director Nam say?

511
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,820
He said I shouldn't be late for the event, and that the political party leader is going.

512
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:24,900
Are you really going into politics?

513
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:27,430
Are you crazy? How can I do politics in this situation?

514
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:29,080
Then, why are you going to the event?

515
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:33,430
So I can tell him in person. It's rude to do it over the phone.

516
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:36,420
He's someone who's trusted and helped me all this time.

517
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,610
Treat me half as nicely as you treat that guy.

518
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:41,060
You'd better do better. Jerk.

519
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:45,610
About Kang Yeo Joo,

520
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:47,580
Baek Soo Jeong is like a rival.

521
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,670
Why is she clinging on to this case?

522
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:52,040
There are more than a few suspicious things.

523
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,620
Could she be connected to the disappearance?

524
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:56,960
Is she trying to find something out by partaking in the investigation?

525
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,030
Or she could be trying to hide something.

526
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:03,790
I'll have to keep Kang Yeo Joo out of the investigation.

527
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:07,570
Forget about going to the Team Leader. I'll just let her know how it is.

528
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:11,730

529
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:25,750
The blood found in Kang Yeo Joo's house is confirmed to be Baek Soo Jeong's.

530
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:28,770
I already heard about the DNA result.

531
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:31,490
 Is there anyone else to report to him besides me?

532
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:38,790
And what happens if Kang Yeo Joo is involved?

533
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:41,470
This case will remain unsolved.

534
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:44,390
And why is that?

535
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:47,360
Because Kang Yeo Joo is participating in the investigation.

536
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:50,190
So... she's taking part in the investigation to cover up the case?

537
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:52,310
Kang Yeo Joo is a crime expert.

538
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:55,030
I think it's possible.

539
00:48:57,950 --> 00:49:00,330
Where is everyone?

540
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:02,090
Are they avoiding us?

541
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:05,660
Where have you been fooling around?

542
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:09,220
What are you talking about? We went to look for Baek Soo Jeong.

543
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:11,730
The DNA result came out.

544
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:16,010
Team Leader...

545
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:18,300
Is it Baek Soo Jeong?

546
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:20,890
Yes.

547
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:27,490
- Hurry up and come in. 
 - Yes.

548
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:35,630
What is it? Didn't you guess it already?

549
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:38,120
I was hoping I wasn't right.

550
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:40,340
Why?

551
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:43,980
Just because.

552
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:46,420
Just?

553
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:48,260
Let's go in.

554
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,120
Are you suspecting Kang Yeo Joo?

555
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,040
I think I'll know after further investigation.

556
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,270
I'm talking about the police.

557
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,320
Do they think she's a suspect?

558
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,960
I don't think so.

559
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,040
Given that Kang Yeo Joo is participating in the investigation.

560
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:21,960
Then, delete all evidence.

561
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:27,090
- I'm sorry? 
 - Delete all traces of evidence against Kang Yeo Joo. Immediately.

562
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:30,070
Before the police find anything.

563
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:31,900
Chief.

564
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:36,330
If you're done with your report, you may leave.

565
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,040
Customer, you have to pay for that first.

566
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,950
Did you report to him on the DNA results?

567
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,330
Just know, doing that gave us more work to do.

568
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:23,580
Check all the cars that were here before Baek Soo Jeong went missing.

569
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,160
Check? How would I know that?

570
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,570
Can't you see it?

571
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:28,330
Here's one. Write down the license plate number.

572
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:30,400
It's been parked here a while.

573
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:35,950
This one, too. It's probably been here a while, too.

574
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:41,800
Get originals for all of them.

575
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:42,710
Okay.

576
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:45,660
Our job is to erase all traces of Kang Yeo Joo.

577
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,170
Okay.

578
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:49,990
Aren't you curious?

579
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:51,440
About what?

580
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,500
Why we're erasing all traces of Kang Yeo Joo?

581
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:57,090
What is there to be curious about? We just do what we're told.

582
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,330
I'm sure the head is doing whatever needs to be done.

583
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:08,180
Chief Ma probably loves her.

584
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,520
Do I just need to get the traffic CCTV footage?

585
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:19,070
No. There's a cafe where Baek Soo Jeong and Kang Yeo Joo met.

586
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:21,600
Get the black boxes from that vicinity

587
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,590
and the CCTV from the convenience store, too.

588
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:25,790
All that?

589
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:27,660
All that?

590
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:33,140
Be thankful for the computer virus. If not for that, you would have died today.

591
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:35,700
Garage, elevator, hallway, and lobby;

592
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:39,430
there are 117 CCTVs in this building alone.

593
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:43,560
But thanks to the virus, 10 days' worth of footage was lost.

594
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:49,330
Before the police get to it, get it done.

595
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:51,890
 Let me take a shot right there.

596
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,880
 Just one more, please.

597
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,080
- Director. 
 - Yes?

598
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:09,280
There's a difficulty to my being a politician.

599
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,980
That's what I'm here to take care of.

600
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:16,490
Difficulty? What is it?

601
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:20,720
Well...

602
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,610
It could be trivial depending on how you look at it,

603
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:29,540
but my wife is opposed to me being on politics, and...

604
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,230
Oh, I know of a way.

605
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:38,840
Now, let's move it. Hurry up!

606
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,260
 Yes, Sir.

607
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:43,160
Detective Jang, get the CCTV and black boxes.

608
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:46,030
- Detective Ah, get letters of cooperation. 
 - Yes sir.

609
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:48,390
Okay, let's get it going!

610
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,710
This one.

611
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:56,330
And that one.

612
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:02,810
Collect all the black boxes out of those cars.

613
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:05,490
We've already got the ones from the cafe.

614
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:09,150
All the cameras from those stores...

615
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:13,220
Here you go.

616
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:17,460
It'll take just a minute.

617
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,480
Please sign this.

618
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:27,530
If you can pull up the ones from this date...

619
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:30,510

620
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:44,080
Thank you.

621
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:51,440
And I feel like I'm lacking qualifications, too.

622
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,690
You're the nation's husband. What more qualifications do you need?

623
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:06,760
I will do my volunteer work diligently and be back!

624
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,660
Thank you.

625
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:12,780
How quickly can you run 100 meters?

626
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:15,940
About 14.26 seconds.  Why do you ask?

627
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:18,550
Let's run it in 12 seconds.

628
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:21,720
Hey! Those two!

629
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:25,680
Hurry up!

630
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:30,260
Over here!

631
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:33,830
Come on! Hurry, hurry!

632
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:39,940
♫  I'm sure you thought it was perfect  ♫

633
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:43,920
♫  I bet you never even looked back  ♫

634
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,000
♫  And I had to watch you do it all  ♫

635
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,060
♫  I'll make sure you get what you deserve  ♫

636
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:58,650
 Hurry!

637
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:00,770
 Hurry! Go!

638
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:02,590
Run!

639
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:06,570
♫  I'm never gonna love again  ♫

640
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:07,590
Run!

641
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:11,890
♫  Sweet temptation like sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

642
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:15,990
♫  You melt sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

643
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:21,920
♫  I fall again sugar, sugar, sugar. Leave me alone  ♫

644
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,760
♫  It'll be useless holding on  ♫

645
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:29,370
♫  Sweet temptation like sugar, sugar, sugar, you melt   ♫

646
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:33,500
♫   Sugar, sugar, sugar, I fall again  ♫

647
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,350
♫   Sugar, sugar, sugar   ♫

648
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:39,170
♫   Leave me alone   ♫

649
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:10,380
Seriously!

650
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:12,630
It's very important.

651
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:22,540
I've heard that you've been volunteering for a long time with young people.

652
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:26,550
Me? Well, not that long.

653
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:27,670
I was just...

654
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:28,420
First, please put this on.

655
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:30,690
Let me put this on first.

656
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:32,870
Oh, are you collecting trash from here?

657
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:36,470
Yes. The volunteers collect the trash,

658
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:39,500
and we tie them to this boat and take them ashore.

659
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:43,410
They're bringing some trash right now.

660
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:46,460
You just have to receive them.

661
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:48,860
- M-Me? 
 - I'll be helping,

662
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:50,540
so it's okay. Please stand up first.

663
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:52,660
Why?

664
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:56,180
I think you'll have to go over to the other side.

665
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:58,480
I'll help you, so please get over to the other side carefully.

666
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,910
I can't swim.

667
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:01,950
It's all right, I'll help you.

668
00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:04,360
It'll be okay. It should be... okay.

669
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,860
Over to the other side.

670
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:08,130
Please be careful.

671
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:10,160
Just a little more.

672
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,690
They're almost here.

673
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:16,020
Let me put the life vest on first.

674
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:19,650
Please hold the rope.

675
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,590
Give me the rope.

676
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,250
Here.

677
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,190
 - What's that? 
 - Oh!

678
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:59,000
 Oh, someone fell in the water.

679
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,330
I think someone fell in the water.

680
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:02,490
Someone died?

681
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:04,060
What? What's going on?

682
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:05,420
Who did you say it looked like?

683
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:07,160
Go! Go quickly!

684
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:34,110
 What's going on?

685
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:35,490
 What is that? Is it a body?

686
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:37,540
 What is it?

687
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:38,960
 Look over there!

688
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:39,960
 What is that?

689
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,880
 It looks like a person!

690
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:46,080
 Wow!

691
00:59:54,650 --> 01:00:01,690

692
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:06,960

693
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:11,610
♫  I'm never gonna love again  ♫

694
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:15,180
♫  Try playing around with those lips again  ♫

695
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:19,700
♫  I'm never gonna love again  ♫

696
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:24,260
♫  Sweet temptation like sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

697
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:28,290
♫  You melt sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

698
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:30,900
♫  I fall again sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

699
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,590
 Baek Soo Jeong's body being found only puts Chief Ma in a tough spot.

700
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:36,890
 Detective Jang, are you the one who is connected to Baek Soo Jeong?

701
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:39,000
 It's also a crime to protect a criminal.

702
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,480
 Why are you protecting Kang Yeo Joo?

703
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,360
 I'm going to confess that I've been having an affair.

704
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:46,630
 Women let themselves be fooled even when they're aware.

705
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:47,980
 Get out right now!

706
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:49,960
 It's the highway. How?

707
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,520
 You can't sleep here!

708
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,670
 Sir! Sir!

709
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:56,180
 I was suspicious from the beginning. I felt like you were hiding something.

710
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:59,070
 You're... being careful, aren't you?

711
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:01,200
♫  I bet you never even looked back  ♫
