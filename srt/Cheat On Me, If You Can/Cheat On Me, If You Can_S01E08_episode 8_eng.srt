1
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,290
Oh, this...

2
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,780
Why is it here? I threw it away.

3
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,020
Sorry about throwing out the trash haphazardly.

4
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,910
Trash?

5
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,540
Oh,

6
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,610
it's a little unfair, though.

7
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,160
I threw it out with the paper trash properly.

8
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,290

9
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:58,410
Honey, did you see my bag?

10
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:06,480

11
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,460
Honey!

12
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,660
Honey!

13
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,660
Honey, my bag—

14
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,530
Where is it?

15
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,500
Isn't that yours?

16
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,900
Huh?

17
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,280
Oh, it was here.

18
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,590
Hmm, but why is this here?

19
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,450
Did you come to report something?

20
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,920
Yeah, but they said I should come tomorrow because he had matters to take care of.

21
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,830
You caused trouble again, didn't you?

22
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,640
What trouble would I cause?

23
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,130
Did you find the undercover agent who was in charge of Kang Yeo Joo?

24
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,550
He came back in a hurry after being demoted and floating around abroad.

25
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,160
Everyone is on edge.

26
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,340
- Why? 
 - You know... he's affiliated with the opposition party.

27
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,070
So what?

28
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,350
The presidential election is coming up soon. Don't you know the term "lame duck"?

29
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,090
The opposition party people are coming back one by one.

30
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,590
You should be careful, too.

31
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,540
About what?

32
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,370
Chief Ma is affiliated with the Blue House.

33
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,220
If your superior is for the ruling party, you are, too.

34
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,070
You have no choice even if you dislike Chief Ma.

35
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,550
There's no ruling or opposition party to a civil servant.

36
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,740
The public is the one paying my salary.

37
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,910
You're so frustrating.

38
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,560
Who cares if you're an undercover agent when you're clueless about in-house politics?

39
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,960
Huh?

40
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,600
What?

41
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,270
The grim reaper is here.

42
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,340
- Is he one of ours? 
 - No, a subcontracter.

43
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,450
Freelancer.

44
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,500
Him showing up means someone has to die.

45
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,950
A killer?

46
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:39,970
Chief Ma seems to be scheming something.

47
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,550
What? You have something to say?

48
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,920
How long do I have to clean up after you, huh?

49
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,510
The object is in the Philippines. Get it for me.

50
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,180
Alive?

51
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,450
Alive, dead, whatever.

52
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,430
Who cares?

53
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,580
You have to bring the object back.

54
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,150
Go to the Philippines right away...

55
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,860
before you cause a problem again.

56
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,150
I should practice the piano some more, right?

57
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,700
My fingers are stiff, so I can't play as well as you.

58
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,890
I'm not that good either these days.

59
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,890
Oh, you're the same as always.

60
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:59,590
Even your typing sounds like you're playing the piano.

61
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,100
- What are you doing? 
 - I was about to wash clothes.

62
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,200
- Take your pants off, too. 
 - I'll do it!

63
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,200
I'll do it.

64
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,860
I'll do it.

65
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,490
Hurry up and take it off.

66
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,020
Yes. Okay, then I'll see you at the event.

67
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,940
Thank you.

68
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,710

69
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,770
010...

70
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,080
It's a little...

71
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,230
 Her radar is on. I have to be careful!

72
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,390
Here.

73
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,410
Can you answer it for me?

74
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,610
What's the passcode?

75
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,950
Why would I make one when I don't have any secrets?

76
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,530

77
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:17,100
Even married couples need to respect each other's personal life.

78
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,300
Why at this hour?

79
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,660
Hello?

80
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,260
Hello, Attorney Han.

81
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:46,120
I'm Go Mi Rae.

82
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,780
Remember me? Han River?

83
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,760
Han River?

84
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,680
 Thank you for giving me a ride last time.

85
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,370
 Oh, this could cause a... misunderstanding.

86
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,940
Of course, I remember.

87
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,770
Oh, thank you so much for that.

88
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,560
But...

89
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,410
how come you're calling at this hour?

90
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,510
Oh... I apologize.

91
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,850
I had a part-time job in the morning, so I didn't have time to call you.

92
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:29,180
I see. Oh, okay.

93
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,500
I understand.

94
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,960
Okay.

95
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:47,090
No, no. It's not late.

96
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,690
Yes.

97
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,720
I nearly forgot.

98
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,110
Thanks for the call.

99
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,960

100
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,310
It's definitely a woman's hair.

101
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,110
I see.

102
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:32,760
So it's two hours before the start of the event?

103
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,800
Yes. Then I'll see you there.

104
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,700
Thank you.

105
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,020
Who was that?

106
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,940
The person I saved from the Han River.

107
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,170
You saved someone who was drowning?

108
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,760
Yes. It's a good thing I learned to scuba dive.

109
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,800
Oh, why did you do something so dangerous?

110
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,850
The person I saved

111
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,660
couldn't even breathe.

112
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,710
He's fine now and walking around.

113
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:19,270
He talks and drives, too.

114
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,890
Isn't that just amazing?

115
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,670
If I had known saving a person felt like this, I would have gone to medical school.

116
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,580
You can't pay to get into medical school.

117
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:48,800
By the rough look of the surface, it's not someone who's young.

118
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,550
The root is weak.

119
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:56,020
Medium bob, dark brown.

120
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,700
The cuticles are damaged.

121
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,150
Maybe from a lot of stress?

122
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,690
It's mine.

123
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,540
Where is she going this late?

124
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,750
What is she up to?

125
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:31,950
Is the main character this time working for CSI?

126
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,950
What are you doing here?

127
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,390
What are you doing here?

128
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:46,900
I came to replenish the toilet paper since we're out.

129
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,530
I asked what you're doing.

130
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:53,880
Oh... I was taking a peek.

131
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,230
Taking a peek?

132
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,270
I was wondering how she got inspired.

133
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:02,160
Since I want to be like her.

134
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:06,230
Wow. I see.

135
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:10,130
You're working so hard well into the evening.

136
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,650
What is she suspicious of?

137
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,960
Huh?

138
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,190
Did she catch onto me going into politics again?

139
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,820
She's suspicious about a woman...

140
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,330
 I erased the black box.

141
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,080
 Navigation's been reset.

142
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,300
 Even if she was rummaging through the car,

143
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,840
 nothing will be found.

144
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,530

145
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:07,070
ACP?

146
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,810
ACP... ACP.

147
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,900
ACP.

148
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,160

149
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,990

150
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,510
ACP.

151
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,330
A semen test reagent?

152
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,220

153
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,010
What?

154
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,500
Is she onto me?

155
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,870
 Honey, I love you.

156
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,420
 It would be good if she opened the sun visor, too.

157
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,150
It's clean.

158
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,380
Overly...

159
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,720
Honey, where did you go so late?

160
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,790
 Probably, the garage?

161
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,770
The car was dirty, so I cleaned it up a bit.

162
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,400
This late?

163
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,520
And then I found this.

164
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,070
Oh, sorry.

165
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:55,220
I bought it to give you,

166
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,170
but I forgot when I switched cars.

167
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,850
Thanks for the surprise.

168
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:06,300
I didn't even realize you'd get something like this for me.

169
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,570
It looks great on you.

170
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,890
It's perfect.

171
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,230
 I didn't even realize.

172
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,870
 He's very elaborate.

173
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:20,620
 As expected, I'm perfect.

174
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,250
Are you going to work again?

175
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,400
It's time for bed.

176
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,590
I'm writing an important part.

177
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:35,870
Who is our writer killing today?

178
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,190
Not today.

179
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:43,190
I have to wait for the perfect opportunity.

180
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,800
I'm curious about what it is.

181
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,800
It's a story about a culprit who mistakenly believes he committed a perfect crime.

182
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,850
Oh, it sounds fun.

183
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:05,590
The culprit got rid of all his fingerprints in order to leave no evidence,

184
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:10,450
but in the end, he gets caught because of the handprint with no fingerprints.

185
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,650
He falls into his own trap.

186
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,710
It means people shouldn't try so hard to come up with petty tricks.

187
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,460
Go to bed before me.

188
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,840
The blood on the trophy belonged to Kim Deok Ki, Baek Soo Jeong's manager.

189
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,570
Where are the police focusing their investigation?

190
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:00,090
They confirmed that the manager left for the Philippines,

191
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:04,280
and they've requested Manila's National Police Agency for an international cooperative investigation.

192
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,680
What is the result of Baek Soo Jeong's autopsy?

193
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,110
This doesn't look like a knife wound.

194
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,480
Trophy.

195
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:23,400
The trophy only had her manager's blood on it.

196
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,020
Then...

197
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,170
did she get an abrasion from a hammer?

198
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,040
I don't think it's from a weapon.

199
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,720
I think she hit it on the corner of a piece of furniture.

200
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,930
What are these wounds?

201
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,990
They look like scratches.

202
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,100
Let's see.

203
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:05,320
Here, here, and here are knife wounds.

204
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,080
The crucial piece is...

205
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,410
Oh, here it is.

206
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,210
It's a neck stabbing injury.

207
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:28,410
The carotid artery ruptured and caused excessive bleeding.

208
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,800
The cause of death is...

209
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,780
It's hemorrhagic shock caused by excessive bleeding.

210
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,730
She got stabbed in the back.

211
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,580
The person was very upset.

212
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,660
They stabbed a vital spot, but the person uselessly stabbed her some more.

213
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,750
It's an amateur.

214
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,010
What's strange is that

215
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:07,720
white ants were found in her stomach.

216
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,520
White ants?

217
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:22,220
She was found in the river. Why were there ants?

218
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,410
It was found in the stomach and esophagus.

219
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:32,110
Then... the body was moved from land into the river.

220
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:36,130
They usually live in soil.

221
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:41,620
Just because the body was buried, it doesn't mean these show up inside someone's stomach.

222
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,400
So?

223
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,770
Baek Soo Jeong's body was

224
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:56,930
buried in the ground, before it was moved to Han River.

225
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:05,160
Your responsibility is Kang Yeo Joo, not Baek Soo Jeong!

226
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,860
- But Chief! 
 - It's your last warning.

227
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,920
Just do your job.

228
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,580
Let the cops catch the murderer.

229
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:27,470
Are you trying to disobey?

230
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:34,610
No, Sir. I apologize.

231
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:52,710
Hey, when have you ever seen me wear something like this?

232
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:57,540
- Hey. 
 - You bought just one? So cheap.

233
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,380
I was going to share it with you.

234
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,530
About the ants...

235
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,710
It bothers you, too, doesn't it?

236
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,810
  He saw the body personally.

237
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,550
  He only said he saw it on the mountain.

238
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:17,150
Could it be that he was telling the truth that he saw her body on the mountain?

239
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:22,120
I know... It bothers me.

240
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,530
Is he conscious?

241
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,380
Not yet.

242
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:32,190
When the property manager showed up at the hospital, they said he was wearing clothes from another hospital.

243
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:35,840
Then let's look into that.

244
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,400
It smells!

245
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,070
You wrote everything down so well.

246
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,880
Here it is. Do you know where Dooseon Hospital is?

247
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,290
Dooseon Hospital? I've never heard of it before.

248
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,690
Dooseon-myeon Deokhwang-ri. It's in Gyeonggido.

249
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,200
Let's go.

250
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,580
Did you stay up all night writing again?

251
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:17,070
No. Something else came up.

252
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:27,430
If you keep pushing yourself like that, you're going to ruin your skin!

253
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,890
Here. Take these.

254
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:33,420
That's why I take them every day.

255
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:39,830
Just know that your skin still being this good is all my doing.

256
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,520
I know.

257
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,560
Well, I do feel different taking them.

258
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:51,640
But... where's your assistant?

259
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,600
He went to look for material.

260
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,170
What does he think he can find out there?

261
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:01,450
I know. There's nothing you can't find online these days.

262
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:04,950
He's just trying to waste time doing nothing.

263
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,780
I can't be bothered so I just let him be.

264
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,440
You know, don't trust him too much.

265
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,510
 What are you doing here?

266
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:23,080
Trust? Me? Him?

267
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:28,310
I find him suspicious in so many ways.

268
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:33,410
No need to worry. He's in the palm of my hands.

269
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,550
I think my wife is seeing another man.

270
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:50,260
Have you gotten your hands on any texts or messages?

271
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:54,160
She runs a whelk restaurant.

272
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,660
I see.

273
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:03,010
There... I saw them together!

274
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,060
Wipe your tears.

275
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:18,550
Sir, that's not enough evidence.

276
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,770
That is...

277
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,810

278
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,510

279
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:52,610
Why is she not picking up?

280
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:14,410
And you let them be?

281
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,050
Did you get photos or any kind of evidence?

282
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,980
I was out of my mind.

283
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,730
Oh, gosh!

284
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:26,520
But... money kept going missing,

285
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,700
so I installed a security camera.

286
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:35,760
Oh, it's all there.

287
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,920
That's enough. You can get a divorce.

288
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:45,090
No. I can't get a divorce.

289
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:49,390
Sir, you said your wife is having an affair!

290
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:53,590
She'll come back if I treat her well.

291
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,470
How about suing for adultery?

292
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:03,170
You can get compensated by the person who had the affair.

293
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:05,630
I don't need it.

294
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:12,790
Attorney, please prevent the divorce from happening.

295
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:17,440
My wife filed for divorce.

296
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,770
Pardon? She filed... for divorce?

297
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:25,410
Wow, how brazen of her!

298
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,990
Sir, get up.  Please, get up!

299
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:32,680
You did nothing wrong, Sir!  She's the one who wronged you!

300
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:46,050
Why is she being so conscious of others?  She's not lacking anything...

301
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,110
You will ruin your eyes if you look at a tablet in a moving car.

302
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:07,010
I have to send this to the club president by today.  She is a little scary.

303
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,400
What is it?

304
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,940
I have to introduce the guests at an event my school club is participating in.

305
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,030
Should I do it?

306
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:19,070
Why don't you just attend school for me?

307
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:23,460
You bring hardship to yourself...

308
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:28,870

309
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:31,250

310
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:43,870
What is the thought behind wanting to live with a woman who had an affair?

311
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:46,140
Is divorce easy for you?

312
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,470
If your wife has an affair, would you be able to divorce her right away?

313
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,340
Of course!

314
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:56,910
Even if your spouse has an affair, you still have to divide the assets.  You know that, right?

315
00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:01,210
I will just sell the apartment and move into a rental or something.  It's easy. What's so hard?

316
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:06,210
And the mortgage for the apartment is paid off?

317
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,310
I have 10 years left.

318
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:15,590
Of course, I should have custody of my son.

319
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,590
And you have the confidence to work and raise him?

320
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,720
My mother will...

321
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,620
Ah, that's right.  She has arthritis.

322
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:27,180
Then... even if your wife has an affair, pretend ignorance.

323
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:30,280
You will become a loser if you get a divorce.

324
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,650
Ah, why in the world would Yoon Hee have an affair?

325
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:37,170
Do I gamble, have a woman, or use violence against her?

326
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,850
Other than those, she has every reason.

327
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:53,780

328
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:59,660
He says that he is happiest watching his wife eat breakfast.

329
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,940
I... have never seen my parents eat together.

330
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,870
Interviews are all lies.

331
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:12,230
I've seen couples file for divorce immediately after declaring their love in an interview.

332
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:17,870
He says he doesn't want his wife to get her hands dirty so he does all the cooking and cleaning.

333
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:21,180
That kind of man... doesn't exist.

334
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,480
Does the wife make money?

335
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,500
He is an attorney though.

336
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,600
Who are you talking about anyway?

337
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,760
Attorney Han Woo Seong, the nation's husband.

338
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:39,660
Only one of those men exists in Korea.

339
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,940
Only one...

340
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:48,750
I wonder who the woman is that has such a rare kind of man?

341
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:58,120

342
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,910

343
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:06,910

344
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,280
There is no Sae Mirae Hotel.

345
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,410
Is it a motel?

346
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,480

347
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,340
While buying a gift at a shopping mall...

348
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,400
It doesn't explain Room 7508.

349
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,910
Sae Mirae, Room 7508.

350
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:45,310

351
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:48,650
Seoyeon University Lecture Hall?

352
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,610
 Citrus scent.

353
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:01,440
 She is in her early twenties...

354
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,880
You are a female college student, aren't you?

355
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:27,820
Apparently, she doesn't visit her in-laws even on holidays.  She doesn't even know her in-laws' birthdays.

356
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:31,440
I envy her.  I have to remember even my sister-in-law's birthday.

357
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,320
She even got her husband to sign a physical injury waiver.

358
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,580
I feel a little bad for Attorney Han.  How did he marry someone like her?

359
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:49,550
Thank you!

360
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,560
We have to make her give up on the divorce proceedings...

361
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:58,260
Would she go through with the divorce proceedings when we have the picture as proof that she had an affair?

362
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:02,000
She will probably try to settle.  What did her attorney say?

363
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,570
I've never heard of her.  I think she's new, still trying to find her bearings.

364
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:07,830
She said she will come over personally.

365
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:11,110
They know that they are at a disadvantage.

366
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:14,140
It looks like it will resolve easily.

367
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:19,350
A newcomer... We will teach her a lesson!

368
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:27,010
You said she's a newcomer.

369
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:28,850
Right?

370
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:38,760
I thought it would be too much for a newcomer, so I volunteered.

371
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,070
I'll have an iced latte.

372
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:52,860
You knew it was my case. That's why you took it, right?

373
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,410
Bingo!

374
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,930
I'll crush you for sure.

375
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,730
Did you even look into the case before coming?

376
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:07,430
This is a case I can't lose even if I wanted to.

377
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:12,960
The husband is violent and suffers badly from delusional jealousy.

378
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,350
How can they maintain a marriage when he monitors her all day and night?

379
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:21,370
Is helping her at the store monitoring her?

380
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:28,770
Do you know that your client had an affair?

381
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:37,360
We have a video of the scene.  A trial is useless.

382
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:41,980
So, let's go to mediation and receive marriage counseling.  How about it?

383
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,810
Here is a refreshing iced cafe latte!

384
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:51,650
Please drink.

385
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:02,160
You have a refreshing drink and wake up, okay?

386
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,660
There won't be any mediation.

387
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:12,580
I've already filed the complaint and... I plan on going forward with the proceedings until the divorce is finalized.

388
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,920
It looks like it's not going to be easy.

389
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:28,450
Why of all people... is it Attorney Park?!

390
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:33,810
She's going to play dirty and drag out the proceedings.

391
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,160
Who are you?

392
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,420
You were in charge of Kang Yeo Joo for three years, weren't you?

393
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:16,470
Even though she was being monitored, it was only perfunctory.

394
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:20,230
Because everyone thought the position was only a rest stop.

395
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:23,220
There wasn't any special instruction from above,

396
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:27,690
and since she was writing "The Perfect Disappearance," she hardly stepped outside.

397
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,430
I'm fine.

398
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,870
During the probationary period, I had an occasion to go to her wedding to support the team.

399
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:51,460
It was a strange wedding.

400
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,350
There were hardly any guests on the bride's side.

401
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,900
She had no parents, no friends.

402
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:08,550
Let's see.  Let's see.

403
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:11,630
Can you hand me the equipment?

404
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,780
It's a new model.

405
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:24,760
The microphone sensitivity on this is much better than the older one.

406
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,410
I heard that there weren't any incidents after the wedding.

407
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:30,910
So, why are you going around digging things up?

408
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:41,360
I'm giving you a piece of advice as your senior.  If you want to stay around for a long time with the company, leave the thinking to the people above.

409
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,410
By chance, do you know a book called "The Secret Prayer Room"?

410
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:54,440
Sure, I know.  It's a legendary book.

411
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,340
Everyone knows about it but no one has seen it.

412
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,470
That kid might know.

413
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:06,870
He's a colleague of mine. He was in charge of Kang Yeo Joo since she was a reporter.

414
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:09,300
 His name is Ma Dong Kyun.

415
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:19,090

416
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,340
This is Chief Ma.

417
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,610
Chief Ma?

418
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:32,200
Uh?  He's already a chief?

419
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:37,270
Wow, he moved up fast!  I should've just stayed in that team, too.

420
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:39,150
I'm leaving.

421
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:07,890
Chief Ma, again?

422
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:11,510
Is there anything I can find out without having to go through Chief Ma?

423
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:15,430
It always comes back to Chief Ma. Again, Chief Ma.

424
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,580
Again, Chief Ma.

425
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:41,270
I heard that he is exceptionally patriotic, so I had high expectations.

426
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:46,000
But I hear that he is going around digging things up and making things bigger.

427
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,430
I will control the situation, Sir.

428
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:50,390
It bothers me. Replace him.

429
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,480
It's a good opportunity, Sir.

430
00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:00,470
He succeeded in infiltrating as Kang Yeo Joo's assistant.

431
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:05,140
If we replace him, it will take more time to approach again.

432
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,950
You have been doing well to prevent it until now.

433
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:10,810
Please trust me and let me handle it this time as well, Sir.

434
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:14,260
The election is not far away.

435
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,850
I know it, Sir.

436
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,700

437
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:37,390

438
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:48,530
Hello. You're Go Mi Rae. Right?

439
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:49,430
Yes.

440
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:53,750
I'm Reporter Jo Dong Joo from Dongmin Daily News. Do you have some time?

441
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:02,700

442
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:11,200
I don't know if I'm doing the right thing.

443
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,010
We're meeting often.

444
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:26,740

445
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:30,990
Attorney Hwang's father-in-law passed away, so I came in his place.

446
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,960
Even though I'm busy.

447
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:36,330
Is that so?

448
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:39,100
Are you doing memory management already?

449
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,430
Of course not.

450
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:44,910
Then, are you at least doing some other management?

451
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:53,350
I changed my hairstyle, but you didn't notice.

452
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,960
Before, even when I just cut my bangs, you noticed.

453
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,070
Oh, you curled your hair.

454
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:03,400
The waves came out well.

455
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,560
I did it somewhere expensive.

456
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:12,870
The curls are different. The gloss is really shiny.

457
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:15,860
On my way out of the salon, I saw you.

458
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:47,610
She's young and pretty. Although she didn't look very smart.

459
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:50,420
So that's your taste...

460
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,450
Attorney Han.

461
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,370
I have something to tell you.

462
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:15,630
Why did you lie?

463
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:17,860
Huh? About what?

464
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:23,530
 I heard Attorney Han saved a student who was drowning in the Han River. You're that person, right?

465
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:26,230
 I wanted to interview you for an article.

466
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:28,400
  Interview?

467
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,990
 Then I'll be in the paper?

468
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:38,250
How did it turn out that way?

469
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:42,320
Can't that article not get published?

470
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,140
That's... Don't worry, there must have been a mistake.

471
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:48,210
He said it'll get published tomorrow.

472
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:51,910
If it gets known that I was there that day, I...

473
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:54,510
Will it put you in a bad situation?

474
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:58,560
I'll get fired from my part-time job.

475
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:04,800
Because... I lied I was sick, and my boss doesn't know I was there.

476
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,970
I had a hard time getting that job, and I need to earn money for my tuition, and...

477
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:19,800
I don't know why I have to tell you this when I did nothing wrong.

478
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,540
I know.

479
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:30,940

480
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:49,420
The air is cleaner now that we're outside of Seoul.

481
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,550
What is this smell?

482
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:55,360
It's deodeok (mountain herb).  Don't you know that smell?

483
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:59,340
I wondered where the rotting smell was coming from. I don't like deodeok.

484
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,370
Typical.

485
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:09,060

486
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,330

487
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:16,410

488
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:20,140
He was wearing another hospital's patient gown.

489
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:22,690
Have you seen him?

490
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:40,590
About here.

491
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:44,170
He was sitting like this.

492
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:49,660
At first, we thought he was drunk.

493
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:51,960
I heard he had a lot of wounds on his body.

494
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:56,440
Did he come up from here or come down from there?

495
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,780
What’s over the hill?

496
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:03,710
A cemetery. This whole mountain is a cemetery,

497
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:07,200
but the graves haven’t come down this far yet.

498
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,980
Why revise the article when it’s going to help us?

499
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,990
I took care of everything, so don’t worry.

500
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:20,920
That’s not the issue here. What will that student think of me?

501
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:28,370
She’ll like it since she’ll be on the news. Who doesn’t like getting attention?

502
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:33,470
It's your turn, Attorney Han.

503
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:39,430
 Yes, thank you.

504
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:48,340
 Thank you for your gracious words.

505
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:53,100
Next, I’d like to introduce to you someone who is already well-known as the “nation’s husband.”

506
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:58,560
Let’s welcome Attorney Han Woo Seong who is one of the next generation of leaders with youthful insight.

507
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,790
Thank you.

508
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:12,980
Hello, everyone, I’m Attorney Han Woo Seong.

509
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:18,450
Could a case go to trial just because

510
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:22,170
someone didn't say "thank you"?

511
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:30,840
You wouldn’t think so, right?

512
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:34,690
No. It happens a lot.

513
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:37,750
Divorce lawsuits are that type of circumstance.

514
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:42,800
The words of gratitude,

515
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,830
the power of those words,

516
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,780
are amazing. Aren't they?

517
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:59,660
Sometimes I forget to say thank you, too.

518
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:06,190
So, today, before it’s too late, I’d like to say this.

519
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,350
Thank you for saving me.

520
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:56,490
This person saved me from the river a few days ago.

521
00:48:56,490 --> 00:48:58,010
Yes.

522
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,430
What are you doing?

523
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:14,360
I’ve always been thankful to you. For Pilates, too.

524
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:17,920
If you do this, it’ll create problems.

525
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,820
Just smile since it’s ended up this way.

526
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,130
It must be creepy if you come here at night.

527
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:08,350
Cemeteries are not all that great in the daytime, either.

528
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,100
I remember that day.

529
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:21,520
I made my rounds at about 2:30 a.m.

530
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,560
Do you do it even at that hour?

531
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:29,130
No, but someone threw a rock through that window.

532
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:38,810
 Who would do that at that late hour?

533
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:42,410
 I figured someone came to the cemetery and ended up getting drunk.

534
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:45,590
 It happens once in a while.

535
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:48,820
 I wasn’t sure, so I called the police

536
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:51,330
 and looked around.

537
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,310
The person ran off that way.

538
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:07,320
Did you see the person’s face?

539
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:12,360
I did catch a glimpse, but it was so dark.

540
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:22,980

541
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,280
Attorney Park.

542
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:32,360
It's said that the Seodong-gu elections are won or lost at Seoyeon University.

543
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:36,790
Yes, that's why I'm putting extra attention to it.

544
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:39,320
What's the reason that you were looking for me?

545
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,890
I'm a bit interested in politics.

546
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:47,320
Politics aren't as fun as you think they are.

547
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:53,490
I scored higher than Attorney Han on my college entrance exam, my law school exam, and my training academy exams.

548
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:55,860
Politicians aren't about grades.

549
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:59,690
You need an interesting story. It's important.

550
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:03,380
An interesting story?

551
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:09,120
Attorney Han's story is messier than you think.

552
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,730
Is that so?

553
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:14,690
If you go with Attorney Han, it will be dangerous.

554
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:18,340
Because I'll make it so.

555
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:42,970
So, will you choose me? And abandon Attorney Han?

556
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:53,740
 Thank you for today.

557
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:57,570
 I'm sorry about the misunderstanding and getting angry earlier.

558
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:02,220

559
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:06,420

560
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,440
I'm sorry.

561
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,910
My wife is pretty sensitive these days.

562
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:21,860

563
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:37,260
My gosh, you scared me!

564
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:40,360
 She's smiling.

565
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,380
Welcome home.

566
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:44,720
 Formal language?

567
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,290
 Is she cooking, perhaps?

568
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:49,160
I made your favorite, spicy seafood stew.

569
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:53,200
 So, she's going as far as cooking.

570
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,030
I wanted to eat spicy seafood stew, anyway.

571
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:58,710
Honey, you're definitely the best.

572
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,500
Thank you.

573
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,440
Wait.

574
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:10,360
You can now use your car.

575
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:18,150
Can I do that?

576
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:22,340
Yes. I had a bit of trouble with the car.

577
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:41,100
It was too old-fashioned. I changed the Blackbox to an infrared Blackbox.

578
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:46,170
No matter how dark the night is, it can be filmed perfectly.

579
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,550
Did you remove all the tinted windows?

580
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:55,500
Tinted windows reduce the radio reception rate.

581
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:58,380
It is also stuffy when driving at night.

582
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:01,540
Right.

583
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:04,590
I changed the seat too because it was dirty.

584
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,900
I did some maintenance on it, too.

585
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,900
You don't have to thank me for anything.

586
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:22,280
Because my husband's safety is my safety as well.

587
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:41,340
Thank you.

588
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:45,390
You have to give me my car, too.

589
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:52,200
That's true.

590
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:02,440
I have to clean it, though.

591
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,760
No, I'll do it.

592
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,620
Honey, the smell isn't gone yet.

593
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:22,920
This smell.

594
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:39,270
Why did you use air fresheners?

595
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:42,380
So the smell can disappear faster.

596
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:09,260
None of you know as much as I do about Kang Yeo Joo.

597
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:13,750
Of course. You're the first person to be hired as her assistant.

598
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:17,200
Kang Yeo Joo, Doesn't she have a marriage agent?

599
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:21,020
There is only one person that you can meet right now.

600
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:23,550
Who is it?

601
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:25,380
Ma Dong Kyun.

602
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,070
Forget about Chief Ma.

603
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:31,920

604
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:53,100

605
00:58:53,100 --> 00:59:01,370
♫  Feel my cold gaze. I'm never gonna love again  ♫

606
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:09,480
♫  Try playing around with those lips again. 
 I'm never gonna love again  ♫

607
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:13,950
♫  Sweet temptation like sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

608
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:15,870
♫  You melt sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

609
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:17,940
 How dangerous is Kang Yeo Joo?

610
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:21,430
 There have been many strange deaths; however, nothing clear has been revealed.

611
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:23,160
 I'm Baek Soo Jeong's agency representative.

612
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,950
 Find the person who killed Soo Jeong.

613
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:28,530
  Are you sure it's Kang Yeo Joo's car? At that late night,

614
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:30,460
 you're saying she went to the cemetery?

615
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:34,230
 If you eat it, they say you see a brilliant yellow before you die.

616
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:36,460
  You might not be her first husband.

617
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:39,150
  Do you already know, or are you being deceived?

618
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:41,530
 He's not married. Nor does he have a girlfriend.

619
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:42,960
 Then, why is he wearing a ring?

620
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,680
 You met here? The two of you?

621
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,820
  It must've been like a movie.

622
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:51,120
  Since I have pieced together the puzzle, I guess it's time to end it.

623
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,400
♫  And I had to watch you do it all  ♫
