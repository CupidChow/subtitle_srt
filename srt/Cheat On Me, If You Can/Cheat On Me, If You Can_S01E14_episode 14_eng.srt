1
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:28,080

2
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:37,540

3
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,660
What are you doing here? Let's eat.

4
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,570
The flower is opening.

5
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:06,600
Once winter arrives, the spider lily's roots fill with poison.

6
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,930
Soon, it's time to get ugly.

7
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:11,980

8
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,500
What?

9
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,060
Signing the publishing contract with Kang Yeo Joo was the assignment?

10
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,930
You didn't know?

11
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,660
I was informed, too.

12
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,760
Chief Ma left me out?

13
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,070

14
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,460
Should I have gone around and told everyone then?

15
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:39,890
I am not "everyone," but Kang Yeo Joo's head agent.

16
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:43,370
If you can't even trust me, why am I part of this team?

17
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,460
Because you're just the suitable guy

18
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,580
to be left by Kang Yeo Joo's side.

19
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,350
What does that mean?

20
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,720
Kang Yeo Joo...

21
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,740
must be prevented by you

22
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,760
from causing more trouble.

23
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,970
And if she already...

24
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,660
caused trouble?

25
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,540
Then deal with it!

26
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,660
Got it?

27
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,580
So that she doesn't notice.

28
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,060

29
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:41,660
 They say Han Woo Seong is entering the general election.

30
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,410
 Keep an eye on him.

31
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,390
Keeping my eye on Kang Yeo Joo is a pain as it is,

32
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,110
now I have to monitor Han Woo Seong, too?

33
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,460
We're heading to the public cemetery again?

34
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,820
It's a meaningful place for Kang Yeo Joo.

35
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,410
The cemetery and the land surrounding it,

36
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,070
are all registered in Congressman Park Jae Geun's name.

37
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,980
It's her father's land.

38
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:28,040
 As long as she has Park Jae Geun behind her, no matter what she does,

39
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,520
 Kang Yeo Joo is untouchable.

40
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:44,490
If you had ever lied to me,

41
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,550
what would have been the reason?

42
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:53,280
Ah... it would be because... you...

43
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,040
might... be worried.

44
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,690
Or... maybe because you might get hurt.

45
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,490
It would be a white lie... whatever it may be.

46
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,590
It would be, right?

47
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,450
It was a foolish question.

48
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:44,750
But... w-why did we come to the cemetery?

49
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,490
The things you've been curious about...

50
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,050
I'm going to tell you everything today.

51
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,830
H-H-Here?

52
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,920
It can only be told here.

53
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,790
Can you open the trunk for me?

54
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,430
Sure.

55
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,270
We... are taking the tools?

56
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,020
Why? Are you scared?

57
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,270
No.

58
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:01,020
It's been less than a day since I was released from the holding cell.

59
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,490
You don't need to be scared. You just need to hold the bag.

60
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,270
Let's go.

61
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,920
There is no one here.

62
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,620
Let me have that.

63
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,270
Uh?

64
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,650
- This? 
 - Not that one.

65
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,690
Is this useful enough?

66
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,720
Honey, are you keeping any secret from me?

67
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,790
I am... going to tell you my secret now.

68
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:44,570
It's d-dangerous.  W-Why are you doing this?

69
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,510
Give me this...

70
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,090
and let's talk.

71
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,560
Um... this...

72
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,330
Would it be okay to just leave them be?

73
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,010
With that kind of chainsaw,

74
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,600
even murder is possible.

75
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:21,080
Yes, Chief, this is an emergency situation.

76
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,590
If Kang Yeo Joo does something dangerous,

77
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,490
would it be okay to reveal myself?

78
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,320
Never!

79
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,810
Do not get yourself involved unless Kang Yeo Joo is in danger.

80
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,610
Do you really think so?

81
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,820
I understand.

82
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,250
What should I do?

83
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,970
Should I shoot?

84
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:48,140
It's not that kind of situation.

85
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,300
I know Kang Yeo Joo better than anyone.

86
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,490
If anyone shoots, it will be me.

87
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,120
W-W-What's wrong, Honey?

88
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,810
I will tell you today for sure.

89
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,340
You don't need to tell me your secret.

90
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,890
So, give this to me and... Give it to me...

91
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:24,640
Give it to me... and s-sit down for a moment.

92
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:35,740
You were always disappointed with me... for not telling you.

93
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,740
Honey, you don't look good.

94
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,690
Sit down for a moment, Honey.

95
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:47,330
 That's the place that Kang Yeo Joo is most afraid of.

96
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,020
 Honey!  Honey!

97
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,150
Your concern is a little overreaching.

98
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,920
It is also my duty to protect Kang Yeo Joo.

99
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,770
- Right now... her husband is... protecting her. 
   - Honey!

100
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,300
 Honey! Honey!

101
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,560
Honey, are you all right? Are you all right?

102
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,640
Honey, breathe!  Breathe!

103
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,790
I thought they might get worried unnecessarily,

104
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,870
so I didn't tell the family, Mother.

105
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:52,540
You did the right thing. No need to cause trouble.

106
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,210
She wasn't planning on killing herself anyway.

107
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:58,070
She was just protesting because she doesn't want to go to America.

108
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,060
Please don't worry too much.

109
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,660
Did you buy this chainsaw to cut the weeds around the grave?

110
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,800
Not even for woodcutting...

111
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:59,630

112
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,510
I am sorry.

113
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,450
You were disappointed, weren't you?

114
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,080
I had my own reasons.

115
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,160

116
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,730
Still, twenty-five years is too long, isn't it?

117
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,840
 Finally...

118
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,270
 Kang Yeo Joo went to visit her mother's grave.

119
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,970
 After twenty five years.

120
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,740
 - Hello. 
 - Hi.

121
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:18,170
It looks like it's all done now. It's clean now, isn't it?

122
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,840
Honey, say hello. It's my mom.

123
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,790

124
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:44,110
You are introducing me to your mother only now?

125
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:50,870
To be honest, it's my first time coming here as well.

126
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,410
Still, it's not bad.

127
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:05,390
I was worried that it would be a mess because I haven't been coming.

128
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,790

129
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:18,370
 It's here!  Please come this way.

130
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:21,660
 Whew.

131
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,840
 Please be careful.

132
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,450
 Be careful.

133
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,950
 Ah, there are so many!

134
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,380
 Oh, wow!

135
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:54,240

136
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:27,230
 Carefully. Carefully.

137
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,840
 Heave!

138
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,220
 One, two, three!

139
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,320
 You are cold, aren't you?

140
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:20,080
 Mother-in-Law, your son-in-law is here.

141
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,400
 Next time, I will come with my wife for sure.

142
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:28,130
 I will make sure Yeo Joo is so happy

143
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:32,490
 that she forgets all her painful memories, Mother-in-Law.

144
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,320
Are you crying?

145
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,940
No.

146
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:08,170
I have been forgetting.

147
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,720
What?

148
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:17,440
How I... felt... about you.

149
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:31,950
Now you know the reason why my mom wasn't at the wedding.

150
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,140
Aren't you going to ask about my father?

151
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:44,740
Even if I don't ask, you are going to tell me anyway when you are ready. Right?

152
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:52,080
Some day... I will tell you.

153
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,750

154
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,490
 Mi Rae, just a minute.  Mi Rae!  Mi Rae!

155
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,970
 Open the door! Now! Mi Rae!

156
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:59,830
 Open the door! Now!

157
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,590
 I was wrong. I was wrong.

158
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,600
 Don't do this, please.

159
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,050
 Please.

160
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,600

161
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,670
That was a close call.

162
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,570
I'm getting an ominous feeling.

163
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:12,320
 I know I said I wouldn't call. I am sorry.

164
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,140
 I think this might be the last time.

165
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:22,490
 It seems that you are the only one to bid my farewell.

166
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:27,730
 Thank you for everything. I won't forget you.

167
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,360
What is this?

168
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,330
It's giving me the chills.

169
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,260
Is something wrong?

170
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:08,690
- Hello? 
  - H-Hello? Mi Rae?

171
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:13,050
 You are okay, right?

172
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:21,040
Mi Rae, is anything wrong?

173
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:37,300
Good, I'm relieved that you're all right.

174
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:42,790
I called because I was worried. Yes.

175
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:47,910
Yes... okay... then... bye.

176
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,890
Yes.

177
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:52,600
 Just a moment, please.

178
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,250
Hello?

179
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,090
I'm scared so...

180
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:05,650
would it be all right to talk just for a little while longer?

181
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,630
Mi Rae, why would you think you're a useless person?

182
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:13,340
You saved my life, didn't you?

183
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:23,030
To me... you are a very important person.

184
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:26,090
The fact that I can breathe like this...

185
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,280
is thanks to you.

186
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,330
You, too.

187
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:51,260
You saved my life.

188
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,490
From now on,

189
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:08,530
it's thanks to you that I can breathe.

190
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,810
Why are you outside when it's cold?

191
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:06,740
- Were there a lot of people using the restroom? 
 - Pardon?

192
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:10,680
It took you a while... when the rest area is not crowded.

193
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:16,510
There were many out-of-order toilets.

194
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:21,720
Honey, you must be hungry, right? Let's hurry up and go. Let's go.

195
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,370
Wow, Han Woo Seong, that punk!

196
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:30,150
The trial is right around the corner. Instead of getting the lawsuit ready,

197
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,460
where did he go? Seriously!

198
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,370
Am I the attorney?

199
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,850
Ah, seriously!

200
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,840
Wow!

201
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:50,720
Woah!

202
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:56,320
Eat before it gets cold.

203
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:05,210
Woah! Look at all that cheese! That's crazy! It looks tasty.

204
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,710
Go ahead and answer it.

205
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,980
It's your phone, why would I?

206
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:38,760
Aren't you curious who's calling?

207
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,460
I unlocked the passcode.

208
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:56,690
The judge's office called again asking when we are going to submit the signature for the Go Byeong Hee case.

209
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:58,800
You said you have to win this time for sure.

210
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,250
 Can you prevent the divorce like this?

211
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:08,330
 Have them get a divorce right away, or else send him to jail.

212
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:14,740
 Jail? It's because you don't know well...

213
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,550
 The adultery law has been abolished for a while.

214
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:23,610
 Adultery law? This is a domestic violence case.  She's getting beaten, right?

215
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,180
 Don't you see the bruise mark?

216
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:33,380
Have them get a divorce. This is a domestic violence problem.

217
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,370
What? Sister-in-Law?

218
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:03,590
 You saved my life, didn't you?

219
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:07,720
 To me... you are a very important person.

220
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,960
 The fact that I can breathe like this,

221
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,910
 is thanks to you.

222
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:20,780
 You can want anything and you can have anything you want.

223
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,150
 Whether buy it with money or take it away from someone.

224
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,390
 Would it be all right to do that?

225
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:40,550
 Would it be all right for me to have anything?

226
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:46,880
 Should I live for a little while longer?

227
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:56,280
He has a very good reputation.

228
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:00,740
He is known to be very good to his wife, right?

229
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:05,050
But he's not the type to use violence.

230
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:08,710
 Money... I don't need it.

231
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,860
 Attorney Han, please just prevent a divorce.

232
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:19,400
He is a duplicitous cowardly bastard.

233
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,900
He only hits her where it's not visible.

234
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:29,610
Local cops would probably be on his side as well.

235
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:32,370
Since he cares a great deal about his reputation.

236
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,480
I... have to prevent... the divorce... at least.

237
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,420
 Just because I agreed to a few settlement talks, you are being so overly confident.

238
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,280
 Do you really think you can win against me?

239
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,580
 If I win?

240
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:02,550
 I will admit that you are good enough to dump me and I will stop hanging around you.

241
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:08,330

242
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,700
If you don't do something about it, she won't live for very long.

243
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,460
Domestic violence ends only when the victim dies.

244
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:18,340
Have them get a divorce. Tell the woman to obtain a restraining order.

245
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:37,360
Miss, everyone is going crazy looking for you at the hospital!

246
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,130
Do you know how to make ramen?

247
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:42,870
Excuse me?

248
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,460
I want to eat ramen.

249
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,090
Why would you eat something that is unhealthy?

250
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,420
It's good for my mental health.

251
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:33,170
I saw that you took Han Woo Seong to the New National Party.

252
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:37,510
Yes.  He is very popular among women

253
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:40,340
so the party has high expectations for him.

254
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:45,750
The son-in-law of the ruling party candidate for the general election

255
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:49,490
is running for the opposition party. Does that even make sense?

256
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:58,510
We... made a president together.

257
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:04,030
Why do you want to take a different path now?

258
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,390
If you were disappointed about something—

259
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,420
Why don't you convince Mrs. Kang Yeo Joo?

260
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:11,290
That... would be faster.

261
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,580
She is your daughter, isn't she?

262
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:24,490
I hope you don't come to regret

263
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:30,360
the choice you're making right now.

264
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:37,950
Then...

265
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:52,200
If I don't keep a leash on him, he always creates trouble.

266
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:59,600

267
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:04,010
Right now, the case is still ongoing.

268
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:06,370
And...

269
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:09,660
Kang Yeo Joo is a suspect.

270
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:14,520
It is my understanding that she is no longer a suspect.

271
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,890
The testimony was recanted and there is no evidence either.

272
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,550
Wow, I really can't communicate with this guy.

273
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:32,030
- Okay. We will participate. 
 - Hey.

274
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,410
Participate in what?

275
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:37,060
Do you want to sell all our information to the broadcasting company?

276
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,410
- Listen to me. 
 - Didn't you hear what I've been saying all this time?

277
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,060
- Wait a sec and listen— 
 - How many times did I say it now?!

278
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,420
Hey, hear me out! Geez.

279
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,360
- I'm sorry. 
 - Sure.

280
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:53,830
You know, now... Kang Yeo Joo won't even come in for a witness interview.

281
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:58,620
Let's think that instead of doing a broadcast, we are investigating.

282
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,160
How about it?

283
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,790
What do you mean "How about it"?

284
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,800
Yes, sure.

285
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,780
We will do it.

286
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:19,250
Excuse me, by chance, do you pay an appearance fee?

287
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,340
Thank you.

288
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,790
I heard you are the best in this field.

289
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:38,170
I heard that you take care of everything for high profile people.

290
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:41,410
What kind of help do you need?

291
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:48,540
No, that's not it. I was hoping that you could be a consultant for our broadcast.

292
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,770
Broadcast?

293
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,760
I am...

294
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:00,680
the producer for "Unanswered Questions."

295
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,100
We are investigating the Baek Soo Jeong murder case.

296
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,770
We need the help of a professional like you.

297
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:11,170
- The Baek Soo Jeong case? 
 - Yes.

298
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:15,750
Writer Kang Yeo Joo recommended you... as the perfect person for the job.

299
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:20,970
Kang Yeo Joo?

300
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:26,350
That woman... has gone crazy.

301
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:31,030
So, were you able to sign on Mrs. Kang Yeo Joo?

302
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:37,350
Then we should all get together for a face-to-face meeting or something.

303
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,790
I don't think I can go gather materials today.

304
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,690
Ah, that's too bad. I wanted to go to work with you.

305
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,040
I will go now.

306
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:07,160
There is a meeting for "Unanswered Questions."

307
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,160
 By the way, do you know Attorney Park Hye Kyeong?

308
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:19,110
 She's the consulting attorney for "Unanswered Questions." She says she went to the same training center for lawyers as you.

309
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:22,060
Who's going to be at the meeting?

310
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,160
The detectives, the experts,

311
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,950
and the consulting attorney, probably.

312
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:30,900
The consulting attorney?

313
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,210
Attorney Park Hye Kyeong?

314
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,600
What are you doing here at this hour?

315
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,120
I have a meeting so I'm busy.

316
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,350
What meeting? "Unanswered Questions"?

317
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:54,730
Where did you hear that?

318
00:37:56,310 --> 00:38:00,720
You are doing this on purpose because "our wife" is going to appear in the program, aren't you?

319
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:09,170
Did you just say "our wife" in front of me? 
 (T/N: Koreans refer to family as "our" family rather than "my")

320
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,530
I don't have a wife!

321
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,160
It feels like you are telling the mistress to avoid running into the lawful wife lest the wife might get offended.

322
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,160
It really feels crappy.

323
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,690
Hey!

324
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:34,420
T-These days... my wife is... a little sensitive.

325
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,280
She might catch on.

326
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,620
This kind of relationship with you...

327
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:44,460
is not something so proud for me to go around telling everyone.

328
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:50,760
That's why I'm saying... can't you just stay out of that program "Unanswered Questions"?

329
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,350
I told you to win the trial.

330
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:57,900
Then, I will get myself completely out of your life.

331
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:04,420
- But... can't you get out just a little earlier? 
 - What?

332
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:09,800
I said I'm already late. Don't get in my way and get lost!

333
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,580
Attorney Park!  Attorney Park!

334
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,550
Attorney Park!

335
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:23,990

336
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:28,980
Do we even have to go to the meeting for  "Unanswered Questions"?

337
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,210
They said Kang Yeo Joo is coming.

338
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:33,260
- Here. 
 - Get that away.

339
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,840
Why do you give me what you've been eating?

340
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,390
Why? Is it gross?

341
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:44,100
I am a married man. Let's be a little more proper.

342
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,760
Does what that punk said bother you?

343
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:53,940
It's because my wife put up such a fuss. I promised to be careful.

344
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,750
I'm your wife, too.

345
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:58,130
A wife, as a partner.

346
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:02,890
- Don't even say the word "wife", okay? 
 - Wow.

347
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:05,490
Ah, seriously.  Fine!

348
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,620
I got it.

349
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:11,420
What are you doing now? Hey!

350
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:14,030
I'm speechless.

351
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:23,500
Is this a taxi? Why are you sitting in the back?

352
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:27,020
You said we should be proper.

353
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,560
If you are going to be like that

354
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,340
you shouldn't even ride in the car.

355
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,110
About Manager Kwak...

356
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:53,360
No, I mean... Did you meet with Mr. Kwak Jeong Moon?

357
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:56,010
Yes.

358
00:40:56,010 --> 00:41:00,440
 Do you know what kind of woman you're getting mixed up with?

359
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:07,010
He didn't seem to be interested in participating.

360
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:10,160
I thought so.

361
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,870
But in the end, he'll do it.

362
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,620
Hello?

363
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,820
What? Who's this?

364
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,750
It's Attorney Han.

365
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:49,360
Until when are you going to follow me? Kang Yeo Joo is in the meeting room right now...

366
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:53,810
I wasn't following you!

367
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,590

368
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:13,620
There are two consulting attorneys?

369
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:16,690
Ah, well...

370
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:18,940
If there are two, then it would be more objective.

371
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:22,520
I've been on TV with Baek Soo Jeong before.

372
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,140
Wouldn't having two people just be a waste?

373
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,130
I'll work pro bono.

374
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:29,700
The meeting room is small, too.

375
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,490
It's so big!

376
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:36,960
And... I was the attorney for the prime suspect, Kim Deok Gi.

377
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,160
I was.

378
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,320
Weren't you once a suspect?

379
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:45,240
That's why. Could there be a better lawyer than me,

380
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:49,360
who has gone under a police investigation and knows the case well?

381
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,450
There isn't, right?

382
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:16,660
I'll help you.

383
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:19,310
- Hello. 
  - Candidate number one, Park Jae Geun!

384
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:21,890
- Yes, yes. Goodbye. 
  - Park Jae Geun! Park Jae Geun!

385
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:24,590
Thank you!

386
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:26,600
Deacon, are you doing well?

387
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,880
I'm counting on you this time, too.

388
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,790
Someone like you should go to the Blue House. 
  (T/N: Korean presidential residence).

389
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:35,060
 Candidate Number 1, Park Jae Geun!

390
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:37,510
 Park Jae Geun! Park Jae Geun!

391
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:39,040
 Candidate number one!

392
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,380
"Unanswered Questions"?

393
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,820
 Park Jae Geun! Park Jae Geun!

394
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,300
You're sure Yeo Joo is going to be in it?

395
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,880
Yes.

396
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,120
 Park Jae Geun!

397
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:54,900
Don't worry, Sir.

398
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,600
I've got agents ready.

399
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:03,590
You will never... be disappointed.

400
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:04,930
Yes, Chief.

401
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:07,460
You are ready for your new assignment, right?

402
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:09,100
Yes.

403
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,530
Infiltrate.

404
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:12,860
I got it.

405
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:17,760
What are you doing? Hey!

406
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,870
Aren't you going to ring me up?

407
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:24,350
That's not my job anymore.

408
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:41,760
Kang Yeo Joo!

409
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,730
He really came.

410
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:50,240
I told you he'd come.

411
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,460
How did you get through to him?

412
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:54,510
He is a devoted husband.

413
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:09,430
It's been a long time, Manager Kwak Jeong Moon.

414
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:25,990
 You're Manager Kwak Jeong Moon's wife, right?

415
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,890
 Yes.

416
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,610
Why did you go see my wife?

417
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:35,950
How could you when she's in the hospital!

418
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,060
Are you saying it's my fault?

419
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,490
Are you saying it's not?

420
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:48,950
W-W-Who are y-you to yell at s-s-someone else's wife?

421
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:50,990
Attorney Han?

422
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:52,690
Huh?

423
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,560
Excuse me, Manager.

424
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:07,010
Manager Kwak Jeong Moon?

425
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:10,890
The legend of Seodong Police Station Violent Crimes Unit. Wow!

426
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:14,080
You're my role model, Manager!

427
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,640
I really respect you.

428
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:18,060
If I can get an autograph...

429
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:21,070
- An autograph? Don't be silly. 
 - Leave me alone.

430
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:26,040
I applied to work under you, but he got picked.

431
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,240
If you could sign here...

432
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,410
- Stop it. 
 - You stop it! Geez!

433
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:31,830
- Why are you being like this? 
 - People are staring, it's embarrassing.

434
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,040
Hello.

435
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,600
Just leave me alone!

436
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,400
Just give it here.

437
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:43,940
- I regretted my pick back then. 
 - I'm sure.

438
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:47,540
What are you saying right now? You even signed?

439
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,700
Let's start the meeting.

440
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:55,460
You're here for the "Unanswered Questions" meeting, right?

441
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:56,950
Yes.

442
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:03,470
What is this? What are you doing here?

443
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:07,370
I'm the newest writer of "Unanswered Questions."

444
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:16,080
I started today because they can't reach their previous writer.

445
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:20,260
I look forward to working with you.

446
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:32,940
You don't even report to me now? Are you saying you are only going to deal with the managerial level?

447
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:35,050
If you asked, I would've told you.

448
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:37,270
How could I when I have no information?

449
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:41,960
Should I have asked you out of the blue if you became the writer for "Unanswered Questions"?

450
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:45,820
Did you eat?

451
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:48,780
Are you busy right now?

452
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:53,340
If you asked me any of those, I would've told you.

453
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:03,350
What does she mean?

454
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:08,420
Is she mad because I didn't ask her if she ate?

455
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:14,820
Thank you all for your participation.

456
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:18,210
Since it's difficult to have all of you in one place,

457
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:22,350
I'll certainly try to reveal the true culprit of the Baek Soo Jeong case.

458
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:30,600
I want to see the crime scene again.

459
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:36,110
Let's see...

460
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:42,860
We can't let you do that.

461
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:47,730
But Manager Hong gave us permission.

462
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:49,290
What?

463
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:52,640
Shit...

464
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,790
♫  The eyes that stop me  ♫

465
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:26,310
Do you want to go with your usual style?

466
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:29,400
I want a transformation.

467
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:34,980
♫  Can’t even laugh in this story, yeah  ♫

468
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:39,590
♫  Now I can see our end  ♫

469
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:43,860
♫  For a moment, I dreamed of my palace  ♫

470
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:47,910
♫  But my every moment has grown so empty  ♫

471
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:52,130
♫  Now I don’t need anyone  ♫

472
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:56,440
♫  The once brightly shining world has  ♫

473
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,630
♫  Fade out  ♫

474
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:03,140
♫  Can’t cover it, let me down  ♫

475
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:05,410
♫  All right  ♫

476
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:11,400
♫  Can’t hide it, let me down  ♫

477
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:16,150
♫  Get away from me  ♫

478
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:20,080
♫  Yeah, yeah  ♫

479
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,850
♫  Never mind, just get away  ♫

480
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:25,600
Whatever I do, wherever I go from now on,

481
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,610
don't report them to my mom.

482
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:29,840
♫  Now everyone  ♫

483
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,960
My pretense that "I don't know" when I do...

484
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,300
ends today.

485
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,870
♫  Yeah  ♫

486
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:40,400
I have just as many shares of the mall as my mom.

487
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,410
If you want to be on mom's side,

488
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:45,580
write your letter of resignation first.

489
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:49,870
If you are my employee then act like it.

490
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:53,640
Miss, it's like you've become a completely different person.

491
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,960
You know who my mom and dad are.

492
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,920
I learned a lot from them. It runs in the family.

493
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,890
♫  Yeah  ♫

494
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:07,430
♫  Now everything fade out  ♫

495
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:18,430
Good.

496
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:24,680
You'll do it, right? "Unanswered Questions."

497
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:36,010
 He won't easily decide because of his concerns for you.

498
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:42,810
 But... this is the last chance to solve that case from ten years ago.

499
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:49,570
 Manager Kwak needs to recover, too.

500
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:55,140
Okay. I'll do it.

501
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,950
I'll really do it this time.

502
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:03,550
I promise! Really!

503
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:04,900
Eat one more spoonful.

504
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:09,750
Move... Move me to a shared hospital room.

505
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:12,980
Why are you bringing that up again?

506
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:16,070
I earn enough for you to be here!

507
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:31,140
Since the flowers bloomed, the fragrance is so nice. Right?

508
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:34,130
Auntie,

509
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:37,660
there are no flowers here with a nice fragrance.

510
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,790
I smell it though.

511
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:43,170
That's my perfume smell.

512
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:48,450
Don't you have something to tell me?

513
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:52,110
What do you mean?

514
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,420
If not then, fine.

515
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:13,770
We haven't found the weapon used by the criminal.

516
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:22,350
We suspect that it's this knife that's not here.

517
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,690
This one?

518
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:37,410
That knife... Where did you get it?

519
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,940
  It's my perfume smell.

520
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:04,170
Does Yeo Joo know?

521
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:13,930
I bought it on my way here.

522
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:21,090
How did you see it?

523
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,610
Looking at the angle, the difference in the height is not that great.

524
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:36,870
Also, by looking at the size of the wound, to say that there was strength used is a bit...

525
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:43,620
Their height would be around mid-160cms.

526
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:45,740
They're taller than me.

527
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:55,350
If you wear heels, then I think you'd be that tall.

528
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:02,390
This is all because of that wench.

529
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:06,870
That foxlike wench. How dare she?

530
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,190
 Welcome.

531
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,050
I'd better take it out.

532
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:40,990
I was wrong to bury it there in the first place.

533
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:44,320
It's a place where Yeo Joo frequents.

534
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:50,670
We have someone who witnessed her body being thrown into the Han River.

535
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,210
 What are those people doing?

536
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:16,490
 I couldn't make out their faces, but...

537
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:20,030
He said the person was a woman.

538
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:28,630
So the only thing you're sure of is that they're a woman?

539
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,730
That's why I said she had to be careful of that demure face!

540
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,840
 You think of yourself as really smart, don't you?

541
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:10,380
 You think you're living so happily and successfully, right?

542
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:15,190
 So... do I look pathetic to you?

543
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:25,320
 That happiness you're going after... There's not a lot left.

544
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:30,320
 I'm going to steal it.

545
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:05,060
And the knife is not the only thing that disappeared.

546
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:07,790
Her perfume disappeared, too.

547
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:13,360
They found pieces of the perfume bottle in Baek Soo Jeong's dress.

548
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:30,190
According to the analysis result... the bottle was manufactured in France.

549
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:41,560
This one.

550
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:45,760

551
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:50,130
 I didn't want to come empty-handed.

552
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:52,170
 Thank you.

553
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:00,620
 How did you know? This is the only brand I use.

554
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:06,740
Do you know much about that perfume?

555
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,580
Not sure.

556
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:16,700

557
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:22,820
♫  Can’t cover it, let me down  ♫

558
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:29,520
♫  Can’t hide it, let me down  ♫

559
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:34,170
♫  Get away from me  ♫

560
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:38,140

561
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:40,890
♫  Never mind, just get away  ♫

562
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:44,680
 To be honest, I came back because I missed Pen.

563
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:47,060
 - Who is Pen? 
 - You think you can handle it?

564
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:50,090
 If it's to catch Soo Jeong's murderer, of course, I'll help.

565
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:50,890
 She said she has one condition.

566
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:52,660
 They asked to bring me with you.

567
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:55,010
 Would there be some sort of connection with the Secret Prayer Room case?

568
01:00:55,010 --> 01:00:57,890
 Either she's involved, or it was committed by Kang Yeo Joo...

569
01:00:57,890 --> 01:01:02,670
 Yeo Joo and that assistant... in the basement storage...

570
01:01:02,670 --> 01:01:04,640
 Who killed Baek Soo Jeong...

571
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,180
 You know who the murderer is. Right?

572
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:09,010
 Are you not feeling well?

573
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:11,240
 I now know what you want.

574
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:13,100
 All the puzzle pieces are fitting together.

575
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:15,620
♫  Can't you hear  ♫
