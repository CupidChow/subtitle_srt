Why is this here?

5
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,710
 You left this in Room 7508 at Sae Mirae Hall.

6
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:36,130
 It seemed like something special so I'm returning it to you.

Do you know how much this car is worth? It's very expensive.

00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,000
Other girls would go crazy to go for a ride in it.

10
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,160
- I'm really okay, though. 
 - It's okay.

11
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,240
I'll just drive you to the art school, then.

12
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,020
You'll not want to get off once you ride it.

If it gets bigger... I can't attend school.

Seeing as the handwriting is round and nice,

it's a young lady who grew up sheltered.

- Then, who is the woman who called? 
 - It's probably an accomplice.

159
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:56,620
- I'll meet the patient. 
 - Then, I'll look into where the express courier went to.

160
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,930
- Don't just call them this time.  Go there in person and— 
 - Jesus, you're nagging!

161
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:05,300
Look... One wife is enough for me.

162
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:09,440
That damn temper.

163
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,910
Ah, look how good this looks!

164
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:27,470
- Tastes so good. 
 - Wow.

165
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:32,900
Wouldn't it be nice if we could pull books out from Writer Kang as easily as cheese from this plate?

166
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:40,820
Is it really okay for us to comfortably eat?  She's not the kind of person to treat us to a meal for no reason.

167
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:48,700
Writer Kang, you are not going to feed us today then say that you can't write a story before the end of the year, are you?

168
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:55,730
- Then, I'm not going to eat. 
 - CEO Yang, you've suffered a lot.

169
00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:02,360
The only works that sell are mine, but I haven't written in years. You must have been frustrated.

170
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:07,300
- If you don't write this year either, I'm really going to file a lawsuit. 
 - Don't worry.

171
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,110
Ah, s-so you are writing, Writer Kang?

172
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:22,720
Then I should be buying this meal! Hey, give me that cup.

173
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,850
Are you really?

174
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,340
When the overdose of Ketamine was injected,

175
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,840
it was too much for his heart.

176
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,180
He has a history of arrhythmia anyway, so he absolutely needs rest.

177
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:47,170
Did you see the face of the kidnapper?

178
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,660
Is it someone you know?

179
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:04,320
I saw him... often...

180
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,540
At the studio apartment?

181
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,620
Is it someone who lives there?

182
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,380
Someone you saw often at the studio apartment,

183
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,620
but doesn't live there.

184
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,120
You are saying that you didn't see the face?

185
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,910
He told you to leave it by the door?

186
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,650
What about the address?

187
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,420
Jeongyeon-dong 110-5.

188
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,100
Jeongyeon-dong?

189
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,910
By any chance, the address of the place you delivered to...

190
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,080

191
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,000
Was it 110-5, Apt #201?

192
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,010
  Yes. That's right.

193
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,210
By any chance, is it this person?

194
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,650
It is! It's him!

195
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,200
It is him?

196
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,820
Yes!

197
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,060
Team Leader.

198
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:18,000
Put Baek Soo Jeong's manager Kim Deuk Gi on the wanted list, and

199
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,130
hurry over to the airport and order an emergency departure ban!

200
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,160
Do you want me to go there in person?

201
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,360
Are you going to take responsibility if he gets away in the meantime?

202
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,270
I'm going.

203
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,980

204
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,500
  No.

205
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,250
 If it gets published, it'll become a bestseller.

206
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,940
Of course, it will.

207
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,140
What is Writer Kang writing these days?

208
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:06,320
I don't know. It seems the main character changes every day.

209
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:15,300
Writer Kang, what's the subject of your next work?

210
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,060
If you cheat, you die.

211
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,690
I'm getting a feel for it. That will be good!

212
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,670
What's the story about?

213
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:27,320
Well... a story that teaches you if you cheat, you die.

214
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,640
The message is good, too.

215
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,540
These cheating jerks, they can all just...

216
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,960
Bury them... In this novel.

217
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:50,980
Was it this person alone? There wasn't any other accomplice?

218
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,940
There was a woman, too.

219
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,040
A woman?

220
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,310
That woman, yes! She was there!

221
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,930
That woman...

222
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,940
Who was the woman?

223
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,050
Who was the accomplice that you saw?

224
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,520
Wait!

225
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,960
Please, you can't do this here.

226
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,560
- Just a minute! 
 - Please go outside. Hurry!

227
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,600
- Just a minute! 
 - Hurry up, please, go!

228
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,040
His breathing is unstable.

229
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,570
Please hold him down.

230
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:47,610
Can't you tell me even just a little bit about the story?

231
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,410
Even if it's just the first scene.

232
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:53,010
If you just tell us one line then we'll know it all.

233
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,830
- The first scene? 
 - Yes!

234
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,820
A famous actress...

235
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,090
suddenly disappears.

236
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,300
 An actress?

237
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:16,500
- Disappears? 
 - It's already good from the beginning.

238
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,170
The suspect is the actress's manager,

239
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:21,430
but he also goes missing.

240
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,730
So, then, in the past, there must've been

241
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,410
- some kind of incident. Right? 
 - Yes.

242
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,670
Like some kind of big secret?

243
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,490
Right.

244
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:39,010

245
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,340

246
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,490
What about the manager? What happened?

247
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,490
We put a departure ban in place, but...

248
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,960
But?

249
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,730
He already left for the Philippines.

250
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,570
Already?

251
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:59,430

252
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:08,520
Because of a secret that can never be revealed,

253
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:15,010
many people are killed and kill others.

254
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,320
Killer...

255
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:32,950
But... what is that secret?

256
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,890
Don't tell me! Don't tell me!

257
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:41,050
No, tell us.

258
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:43,230
All right, what is it?

259
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,410
A secret prayer room in a church.

260
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,280
That room's existence is a secret in and of itself.

261
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,780
  Secret prayer room?

262
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:06,990
Writer Kang, is this why you're buying this meal?

263
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,770
Gosh.

264
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,740
What's wrong?

265
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,760

266
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,620
Unless an international investigation takes place, catching the manager is a lost cause.

267
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,930
Let's first investigate Han Woo Seong.

268
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:25,880
He'll be good at slipping away since he's a lawyer.

269
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,620
If only the adultery law still existed, we could catch him...

270
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:33,220
He said there was an accomplice at the kidnapping.

271
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:39,530
You're telling me this now?

272
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,570
Did he see a face?

273
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,450
Yes, it was a woman.

274
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:45,310
Woman?

275
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,920
I'll process your payment.

276
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,470
Hey, just take a break this year.

277
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,590
You said you'd sue me.

278
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,970
You can rest until next year!

279
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:00,550
Just... give up on that book.

280
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:04,840
I'm going to write it. It's time I did.

281
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,410
Even if you write it, I can't publish it. Okay?

282
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:13,750
Many publishers want to work with me. You know that, right?

283
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:17,670
Writer Kang!

284
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,720
She's killing me.

285
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,990
The secret that was supposed to be taken to the grave

286
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:27,880
will be exposed in the end.

287
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:31,610
What is the secret?

288
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,930
I'll need to write it.

289
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,820
Why does CEO Yang hate this novel so much?

290
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,820
Did CEO Yang say she hates it?

291
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:53,230
I mean she seemed angry earlier.

292
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:57,210
It's because of menopause. She has a bad temper and gets angry easily.

293
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,210

294
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:44,940
Has she suspected something? She seems too relaxed.

295
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:13,010
Is it number two or number three?

296
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,520
I'm going to meet with Son Eun Kyung.

297
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,870
This time make sure to get it! How long has it been since the trial ended, and she still didn't make the deposit?

298
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:22,890
Okay.

299
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:26,600
If she complains about being out of rice, don't fall for it! It's her favorite trick! Don't you dare fall for it!

300
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,880
I told you I'll definitely get it. If she doesn't, I'll sue her.

301
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,410
Sue her? I'm so sure that'll happen!

302
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:34,240
That punk is so soft!

303
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,200
If it wasn't for me being here, you'd be screwed!

304
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,130
Would there be a secret prayer room?

305
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:40,920
 Mr. Song's bookstore

306
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:44,120
 has every book ever published.

307
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,420
I'll go to Cheonggyecheon, then.

308
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,500
Oh, where are you off to?

309
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,890
I'm running an errand for Writer Kang.

310
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,550
What errand?

311
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:57,700
- Data. It's for gathering data. 
 - Oh.

312
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,660
- Be careful on your way. 
 - Okay.

313
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:15,370
 Don't accept cabbage for payment like last time, and make sure to get the money!

314
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:21,670
Goodness, I knew I should've been the one to go. Unbelievable.

315
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,470
Oh, welcome.

316
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:27,100
- Hello. 
 - Excuse us.

317
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:32,880
Goodness, you two must be here for divorce counseling.

318
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,890
You've made a good choice.

319
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,830
I'm glad you got the job.

320
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:40,200
Yes, you're my first customer.

321
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,290
- Oh, really? 
 - Yes.

322
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:46,310
- Your signature. 
 - Oh, yes. Over here?

323
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:51,230
- Just a moment. 
 - Sure.

324
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,490
 Don't accept cabbage for payment like last time, and make sure to get the money!

325
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,820
- Okay. 
 - Ah, yes.

326
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:08,380
- I just need to sign it here, right? 
 - Yes.

327
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:21,830
Oh, us? This is who we are.

328
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,010

329
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:29,870
So, you two... aren't here for divorce counseling, I see.

330
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,940
I don't need divorce counseling,

331
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:35,640
because my wife is already getting that done.

332
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,820
And I'm not married.

333
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,570
But what brings you here?

334
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:43,830
Where is Attorney Han Woo Seong?

335
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,480
H-He's at a trial.

336
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:52,070
Then, where should we wait? We have lots of time, so we'll wait.

337
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:56,660
- I don't have time... 
 - I can lie down here and get some sleep. 
 - Yes, that's good.

338
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:59,620
- Gosh, this is nice. 
 - I have to go out for a bit.

339
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,270
We won't disturb you. You can continue with your work.

340
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:11,780
- It's a great sofa. Very nice. 
 - Well, then.

341
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:14,430
I'm going to the restroom.

342
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:17,240
- Sure! That's okay. 
 - Yes, go ahead. As much as you like.

343
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,910
All right, then.

344
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:35,680
As soon as I get an income, I'll be sure to give you your money first thing.

345
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,620
Oh, sure.

346
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,290
I have nothing to give you right this moment...

347
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:44,270
This isn't much but... at least my heart...

348
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:51,550
I'm just kidding. You must've been surprised. Hold on.

349
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,870
Here are some rubber gloves!

350
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:00,230
Disposable scrubbers.

351
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,190
Containers for the side dishes, a set.

352
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,160
Oh, no, it's okay.

353
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,090
A flipper (spatula) to flip over for.

354
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:11,880
This... You never have to worry about environmental negative effects.  Why?  Because it is made of silicone, so it doesn't burn.

355
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,100
Oh, I-I have one at home.

356
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:18,730
Do you have one at home? Oh, but still you should take it. It's from my heart.

357
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,380
Here, I'll put them in for you.

358
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:26,840
Ah, you have no idea how good these are.  If you try these, you can't go back to using other ones. That's how good they are.

359
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:31,360
Oh my!  Gosh it fits perfectly.

360
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,390
Here!  Please take them.

361
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,180
Oh, sure.

362
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:41,630
- Attorney Han, I'll definitely pay you the money. 
 - Okay.

363
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:44,920
And... this... Don't forget.

364
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,100
- Okay. 
 - Thank you!

365
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,950
Yes, Jin Ho.

366
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:21,250
Woo Seong, w-where are you? Some detectives came looking for you!

367
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,300
Detectives?

368
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:29,780
 I'll tell the cops everything.  You just wait.  It's over for you.

369
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,950
What should I do? Is it okay if I tell them everything?

370
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,840
  Should I have it? The child?

371
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:51,970
No-No way. I'm going to take the truth about my relationship with Soo Jeong all the way to the grave.

372
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:54,800
I told them you went to a trial.

373
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:00,430
They said they'd wait for as long as it takes. So, don't come to the office at all. Do you understand what I'm saying, don't you—

374
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:03,230
- Mr. Office Manager. 
 - Yes!

375
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,820
 You said you can't get in touch with him.

376
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:10,680
If you keep doing this, I'll arrest you for obstruction of justice.

377
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:28,021
It's not Woo Seong.

378
00:35:28,021 --> 00:35:30,441
Who is it then?

379
00:35:30,441 --> 00:35:32,311
My wife.

380
00:35:35,861 --> 00:35:39,691
H-Honey? Yes.

381
00:35:39,691 --> 00:35:42,791
Please come to the police station so you can have rice with beans tomorrow morning. 
  (T/N: Traditional meal served to inmates.)

382
00:35:50,881 --> 00:35:55,751
Ah, damn!

383
00:35:55,761 --> 00:35:59,241
- Darn it. 
 - Come on, hurry up.

384
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:24,781
The bookstore owner has never even seen that book before.

385
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:26,881
In that case, it's a book that doesn't exist.

386
00:36:28,291 --> 00:36:31,751
The book has definitely been published though.

387
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:37,311

388
00:36:38,291 --> 00:36:41,731
There must be someone among the seniors who knows it.

389
00:36:43,961 --> 00:36:45,711
What about the thing I asked for?

390
00:36:52,661 --> 00:36:54,691
Move over a bit.

391
00:36:54,691 --> 00:36:59,391
Just go. Gosh, seriously.

392
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:04,471
I really don't know anything, okay?

393
00:37:04,471 --> 00:37:09,291
Why are you so worried?  I'm the one in charge of Kang Yeo Joo.  I have enough clearance to look at something like this.

394
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:14,181
I'm worried about getting on Chief Ma's bad side.  I was the one that took Second Lieutenant Hunter with us last time, too...

395
00:37:14,181 --> 00:37:18,671
Then, make sure to line up behind him then.

396
00:37:18,671 --> 00:37:24,441
That's what I worry about, too.  Is it going to be the National Intelligence Service secret weapon or Chief Ma?

397
00:37:30,341 --> 00:37:33,301
There were quite a few agents who watched Kang Yeo Joo.

398
00:37:33,301 --> 00:37:35,621
I've excluded the ones who are overseas or the "black" agents.

399
00:37:35,621 --> 00:37:38,901
These are the only ones you can meet right now.

400
00:37:41,701 --> 00:37:45,091

401
00:37:59,261 --> 00:38:01,021
You sure do love coffee.

402
00:38:01,021 --> 00:38:02,791
Oh, yes. Thank you.

403
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:04,821
You're really good at making coffee.

404
00:38:04,821 --> 00:38:07,901
This is a 1:2:1 ratio, isn't it?

405
00:38:07,901 --> 00:38:09,921
It's a packaged mix.

406
00:38:17,591 --> 00:38:20,071
Goodness, Attorney Han.

407
00:38:20,071 --> 00:38:23,781
Nice to meet you. You're quite late.

408
00:38:25,421 --> 00:38:28,141
Can we talk for a moment?

409
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,661
You know Baek Soo Jeong, don't you?

410
00:38:45,661 --> 00:38:49,121
Yes, I met her through work.

411
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:51,201
What about in private?

412
00:38:56,761 --> 00:38:58,561
I have not.

413
00:39:01,441 --> 00:39:06,481
Someone saw you coming out of Baek Soo Jeong's house.

414
00:39:08,051 --> 00:39:10,191
Me?

415
00:39:10,191 --> 00:39:14,951
I don't even know where Baek Soo Jeong's house is.

416
00:39:15,781 --> 00:39:18,321
But it was recorded on the security camera.

417
00:39:22,371 --> 00:39:25,901
I've never been there, so how could it record me?

418
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:32,871
What is he thinking, doing something like that?

419
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,561
Is he doing that because he has a plan?

420
00:39:48,681 --> 00:39:50,911
Do you have a plan of action?

421
00:39:51,481 --> 00:39:53,401
Go back inside.

422
00:39:53,401 --> 00:39:57,411
What are you saying? You'd be out of your mind.

423
00:39:57,411 --> 00:39:59,691
We have to stay together.

424
00:40:01,021 --> 00:40:04,731
Stop shaking your leg. I'm losing more of my mind because of you!

425
00:40:06,911 --> 00:40:10,171
Is it really necessary to meet the witness?

426
00:40:10,171 --> 00:40:12,831
Because you don't believe me.

427
00:40:40,961 --> 00:40:45,501

428
00:40:48,371 --> 00:40:52,251
- Hello. 
 - Yes, what is it?

429
00:40:52,251 --> 00:40:55,471
It was on my way so I stopped by.

430
00:40:56,381 --> 00:40:58,831
I thought you might need these.

431
00:41:02,951 --> 00:41:06,151
It doesn't have harmful effects on the environment and doesn't melt on the stove.

432
00:41:06,151 --> 00:41:09,471
Aren't you here because you're curious about the circumstances of the investigation?

433
00:41:16,811 --> 00:41:19,891
H-How did you...

434
00:41:28,971 --> 00:41:31,991
- Excuse me, mister. 
 - Yes?

435
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:34,261
- Hello. 
 - Hello, sir.

436
00:41:34,261 --> 00:41:35,741
Yes, yes, yes.

437
00:41:35,741 --> 00:41:38,271
Come on, hurry. Come on, run, run.

438
00:41:38,271 --> 00:41:40,961
Here, this person... You remember him, right?

439
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:46,221
 You must trust me

440
00:41:46,221 --> 00:41:49,661
 and firmly deny.

441
00:41:49,661 --> 00:41:51,721
 It's in the middle of Gangnam.

442
00:41:51,721 --> 00:41:54,821
 The foot traffic at a residential complex is 25,000 per day.

443
00:41:54,821 --> 00:41:57,961
 There is no guarantee that the memory is accurate.  That's important.

444
00:41:57,961 --> 00:42:03,071
So... you'll be the first

445
00:42:03,071 --> 00:42:07,091
to cheerfully say hello.

446
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:09,221
- Oh, you're—  
 - Oh, hello!

447
00:42:09,221 --> 00:42:11,351
You remember me, right?

448
00:42:11,351 --> 00:42:13,681
I come by twice a week.

449
00:42:13,681 --> 00:42:17,671
- Oh, you—  
 - I remember seeing you a lot on the 19th floor.

450
00:42:17,671 --> 00:42:20,071
When I came out after working out.

451
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:22,671
Was that the 19th floor, and not the 18th floor...?

452
00:42:22,671 --> 00:42:25,741
18, 18th floor! It's apt. 1820, right?

453
00:42:25,741 --> 00:42:27,701
- That's right! 
 - Yes, that's right.

454
00:42:27,701 --> 00:42:31,701
- It was room number 1920, right? 
 - You're right.

455
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:36,441
Then, why did you go to room 1920?

456
00:42:37,211 --> 00:42:39,221
I bought some Pilates classes.

457
00:42:39,221 --> 00:42:40,751
What?

458
00:42:40,751 --> 00:42:42,891
- Pilates. 
 - Pil...

459
00:42:42,891 --> 00:42:45,001
Pilates?

460
00:42:49,431 --> 00:42:50,841
Will it be okay?

461
00:42:50,841 --> 00:42:52,301
Things could get more twisted when lying—

462
00:42:52,301 --> 00:42:55,721
Just do as you're told.

463
00:42:57,991 --> 00:43:00,481
Hanging it there should work, right?

464
00:43:18,941 --> 00:43:21,851
Have you still not decided?

465
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:30,061
As long as your name is hanging there, I can resolve whatever issues you have.

466
00:43:39,051 --> 00:43:42,481

467
00:43:52,331 --> 00:43:53,981
- Hello. 
 - Hello...

468
00:43:53,981 --> 00:43:55,911
We're the police.

469
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:01,071
I see, but what is this about?

470
00:44:11,541 --> 00:44:13,921
Hello.

471
00:44:27,301 --> 00:44:29,641
What brings you here at this hour?

472
00:44:29,641 --> 00:44:32,201
You usually come at dawn.

473
00:44:43,601 --> 00:44:45,831
That's right, I do.

474
00:44:45,831 --> 00:44:48,001
Please open your knee a bit more here.

475
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:50,031
- A little more, please. 
 - My knee cartilage!

476
00:44:50,031 --> 00:44:52,291
Yes, yes. Breathe, please. Breathe.

477
00:44:52,291 --> 00:44:54,061
A little more, please!

478
00:44:54,061 --> 00:44:56,041
- Just a little more. Just a little. 
 - I can't.

479
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:57,411
Little more! There!

480
00:44:57,411 --> 00:44:59,571
Please open this leg up more.

481
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:02,511
- That's it! 
 - Ouch!

482
00:45:04,191 --> 00:45:06,821
You've been attending classes diligently.

483
00:45:06,821 --> 00:45:08,921
Mondays and Wednesdays.

484
00:45:08,921 --> 00:45:12,701
Yes. I have weight gain in my stomach these days.

485
00:45:16,811 --> 00:45:20,251
Excuse me, Instructor, do you have any pictures?

486
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:23,781
People take a lot of photos in these classes.

487
00:45:23,781 --> 00:45:26,251
He's pretty shy, so...

488
00:45:26,251 --> 00:45:27,981
You don't have any?

489
00:45:27,981 --> 00:45:31,141
I do have some that I took in secret.

490
00:45:34,701 --> 00:45:36,671
You should rest now.

491
00:45:36,671 --> 00:45:38,301
Okay.

492
00:45:57,091 --> 00:46:00,461
Mr. Han Woo Seong, can you show me this move?

493
00:46:00,461 --> 00:46:02,221
Okay, should I then?

494
00:46:02,221 --> 00:46:04,301
I learned it last week.

495
00:46:17,421 --> 00:46:20,681
Let's say that he wasn't having an affair. Then, what about the kidnapping of the manager?

496
00:46:20,681 --> 00:46:24,231
Call records are clean, and he has a solid alibi.

497
00:46:24,231 --> 00:46:25,561
But something is definitely off, though.

498
00:46:25,561 --> 00:46:26,961
The property manager is the one who is suspicious!

499
00:46:26,961 --> 00:46:31,071
How could he have seen the corpse in the mountain when it was found in the Han River?

500
00:46:39,461 --> 00:46:45,101
Is there... anything else that I don't know about?

501
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:51,621
From now on, you must never keep any secrets from me.

502
00:46:51,621 --> 00:46:55,181
Then... I can't resolve them for you.

503
00:46:55,181 --> 00:46:56,701
Yes, Sir.

504
00:47:01,951 --> 00:47:05,771
You'll come to tomorrow's event on time, won't you?

505
00:47:33,221 --> 00:47:34,891
It's all been solved.

506
00:47:34,891 --> 00:47:39,071
As long as you watch your mouth, there won't be any problems.

507
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:44,691
Hey, 80% of my weight is the weight of my mouth!

508
00:47:44,691 --> 00:47:47,301
Even under any kind of torture,

509
00:47:47,301 --> 00:47:49,461
I will never tell anyone

510
00:47:49,461 --> 00:47:52,731
that you had an affair, don't worry.

511
00:47:57,591 --> 00:48:00,491
No, no, no!  It's not that...

512
00:48:00,491 --> 00:48:03,061
- No, no, it's not. 
 - What's not it?

513
00:48:06,961 --> 00:48:10,971
To-Today isn't the day you're supposed to throw out food waste.

514
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:14,261
It is today.

515
00:48:15,221 --> 00:48:20,661
But then again, you wouldn't know since you've never done it.

516
00:48:20,661 --> 00:48:24,701
What are you talking about? I did it last week, too!

517
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:31,731
But d-did you hear anything?

518
00:48:38,051 --> 00:48:40,131
Hear what?

519
00:48:44,591 --> 00:48:47,131
Throw this out and come inside.

520
00:48:47,131 --> 00:48:49,461
You were on your way to throwing it out. Go ahead.

521
00:48:49,461 --> 00:48:51,431
Okay.

522
00:49:00,621 --> 00:49:02,901
Could it be...

523
00:49:13,811 --> 00:49:15,661
It can't be...

524
00:49:18,611 --> 00:49:23,031
You two hang up the posters, and you do the banner.

525
00:49:23,031 --> 00:49:28,641
Buying equipment for use at the event, you and...

526
00:49:28,641 --> 00:49:30,471
I'll do it with her.

527
00:49:32,831 --> 00:49:35,191
I have to go to my part-time job.

528
00:49:35,191 --> 00:49:39,451
Really? What are you going to do then?

529
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:44,021
She can be the event personnel.

530
00:49:44,021 --> 00:49:46,221
Are you even coming to the event?

531
00:49:46,221 --> 00:49:48,681
Yes, I'll go.

532
00:49:49,881 --> 00:49:52,221
Fine.

533
00:49:52,221 --> 00:49:56,281
Then you take care of the guests. Take the seating chart and show them to their seats.

534
00:49:56,281 --> 00:49:57,831
Okay.

535
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:03,431

536
00:50:03,431 --> 00:50:06,851

537
00:50:07,811 --> 00:50:10,251
Is Attorney Han Woo Seong attending, too?

538
00:50:10,251 --> 00:50:11,891
Try calling him.

539
00:50:11,891 --> 00:50:15,151
That's your job.

540
00:50:15,151 --> 00:50:17,251
Okay.

541
00:50:17,251 --> 00:50:20,621

542
00:50:48,651 --> 00:50:50,651
Honey.

543
00:50:56,421 --> 00:50:59,081
Honey, I'm home.

544
00:51:00,571 --> 00:51:02,431
Honey?

545
00:51:03,301 --> 00:51:05,861
Honey?

546
00:51:05,861 --> 00:51:07,591
Honey! Honey!

547
00:51:07,591 --> 00:51:10,421
Honey! HONEY!

548
00:51:10,421 --> 00:51:12,461
Honey, I'm here.

549
00:51:12,461 --> 00:51:14,031
Honey...

550
00:51:14,031 --> 00:51:16,191
Honey! Honey!

551
00:51:16,191 --> 00:51:18,281
I'm home!

552
00:51:19,171 --> 00:51:21,111
Honey?

553
00:51:23,111 --> 00:51:24,801
Honey!

554
00:51:24,801 --> 00:51:27,891
Honey... Honey?

555
00:51:27,891 --> 00:51:29,701
Honey!

556
00:51:33,961 --> 00:51:35,871
Honey?

557
00:51:39,961 --> 00:51:41,611
Honey?

558
00:51:42,721 --> 00:51:44,501
Honey...

559
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:46,171
I—

560
00:51:46,171 --> 00:51:49,291
I told you not to bother me when I'm concentrating!

561
00:52:01,171 --> 00:52:03,461
Honey...

562
00:52:03,461 --> 00:52:06,091
Are you concentrating?

563
00:53:45,641 --> 00:53:49,961
We played this piece on our first date.

564
00:53:49,961 --> 00:53:51,721
I remember.

565
00:53:51,721 --> 00:53:55,321
Even what I was thinking at the time.

566
00:53:56,201 --> 00:53:58,671
What were you thinking?

567
00:53:59,811 --> 00:54:03,371
"This man doesn't know how to play the piano."

568
00:54:03,371 --> 00:54:07,311
"He learned it in a hurry to impress me."

569
00:54:07,311 --> 00:54:12,371
"He must have read my interview where I said my ideal man is someone who can play the piano with me."

570
00:54:12,371 --> 00:54:16,471
"He probably practiced the same piece for three months."

571
00:54:17,221 --> 00:54:20,431
Wow, that's accurate. How did you know?

572
00:54:20,431 --> 00:54:25,981
I could tell. I just pretended not to know.

573
00:54:25,981 --> 00:54:29,441
I practiced up to five hours a day.

574
00:54:36,141 --> 00:54:42,081
But now... I feel like I'm too careless about you.

575
00:54:44,051 --> 00:54:46,591
I understand.

576
00:54:46,591 --> 00:54:50,161
Since work comes before me.

577
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:57,441
I... even love that about you, Honey.

578
00:54:58,631 --> 00:55:01,651
I think I need to take an interest in you from now on.

579
00:55:48,151 --> 00:55:50,301
You've seen it before, right?

580
00:55:50,301 --> 00:55:52,061
 What is that?

581
00:56:01,961 --> 00:56:06,401
Why is it here? I threw it away.

582
00:56:06,401 --> 00:56:08,781
Sorry about throwing out the trash haphazardly.

583
00:56:08,781 --> 00:56:10,621
Trash?

584
00:56:14,271 --> 00:56:17,541
It's a little unfair, though.

585
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:20,331
I threw it out with the paper trash properly.

586
00:56:20,331 --> 00:56:22,511
 No muscle tension.

587
00:56:22,511 --> 00:56:25,381
 No changes in eyebrows.

588
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:29,081
 Normal blinking, no dilated pupils.

589
00:56:29,081 --> 00:56:31,861
 Steady breathing.

590
00:56:31,861 --> 00:56:33,251
I'll throw it out properly next time.

591
00:56:33,251 --> 00:56:35,661
 He's not lying, though...

592
00:56:42,021 --> 00:56:44,071
Is Jin Ho well these days?

593
00:56:44,071 --> 00:56:45,931
Yeah.

594
00:56:45,931 --> 00:56:48,461
We should have dinner together sometime.

595
00:56:48,461 --> 00:56:50,691
Okay. That'll be nice.

596
00:56:52,811 --> 00:56:54,771
Tell Yoon Hee to come, too.

597
00:56:54,771 --> 00:56:58,841
That would be nice. We should tell them to bring Dong Ho, too.

598
00:57:04,431 --> 00:57:06,491
The phone's ringing.

599
00:57:25,621 --> 00:57:30,591
Why did you call? I told you not to unless there's danger.

600
00:57:30,591 --> 00:57:35,741
I can't communicate with anyone and I'm scared.

601
00:57:35,741 --> 00:57:40,751
People even have guns here.

602
00:57:40,751 --> 00:57:43,241
It would be less painful to get

603
00:57:43,241 --> 00:57:47,671
shot and killed there than getting buried alive here, though.

604
00:57:47,671 --> 00:57:50,031
I-I'm sorry!

605
00:57:50,031 --> 00:57:53,231
I won't call you anymore! I swear!

606
00:57:53,231 --> 00:57:56,001
I-I'm sorry.

607
00:57:56,001 --> 00:58:00,551
Until my novel is completed, you must never come back.

608
00:58:00,551 --> 00:58:02,821
If you want to live.

609
00:58:08,321 --> 00:58:15,261

610
00:58:16,501 --> 00:58:20,201

611
00:58:20,201 --> 00:58:27,651
♫  Feel my cold gaze. I’m never gonna love again                   ♫

612
00:58:28,451 --> 00:58:36,531
♫  Try playing around with those lips again. 
I’m never gonna love again  ♫

613
00:58:36,531 --> 00:58:41,101
♫  Sweet temptation like sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

614
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:43,361
♫  You melt sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

615
00:58:43,361 --> 00:58:44,411
 White ants?

616
00:58:44,411 --> 00:58:47,171
 She was found in the river. Why are there ants?

617
00:58:47,171 --> 00:58:51,671
 It means Baek Soo Jeong's body was buried in the ground.

618
00:58:52,891 --> 00:58:57,481
 I hear he's been digging around and making a mess of things. It bothers me, switch personnel.

619
00:58:57,481 --> 00:59:00,151
 Dead or alive, does it matter?

620
00:59:00,151 --> 00:59:02,371
 Attorney Han's story is messy.

621
00:59:02,371 --> 00:59:05,641
 It'll become dangerous if you stick with Attorney Han. I'll make it that way.

622
00:59:05,641 --> 00:59:07,311
 Why did you lie?

623
00:59:07,311 --> 00:59:10,551
 I don't know why I have to tell you when I didn't do anything wrong.

624
00:59:10,551 --> 00:59:14,541
 It's a story about a criminal who mistakenly believes he committed the perfect crime.

625
00:59:14,541 --> 00:59:18,241
 I'm saying don't try to get one on me with your petty tricks.

626
00:59:18,241 --> 00:59:21,600
♫  And I had to watch you do it all  ♫
