1
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,700

2
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,850
 I'm supposed to shoot in the leg but...

3
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,960

4
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,450
 Since it's my first time, I don't know what will happen.

5
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,330

6
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:58,450

7
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,930

8
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,470
 That's why I told you to cooperate with us.

9
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,340
 Who is it?

10
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,750
 I can never tell.

11
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,100
 How can I trust you?

12
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,190

13
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,280
 So it's you... that bonehead.

14
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,320
 I heard that you got tangled with the National Intelligence Service guys, is that right?

15
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,480
 Because of you, the central office is in total chaos.

16
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,010
 Do you want to join the Violent Crimes Unit?

17
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,480
 Huh?

18
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,580
 The one who paved the way for corruption in the Eulji company

19
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,340
 is the lobbyist Park Jae Geun.

20
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,240
  - Park Jae Geun. 
 - He is known to use actresses for lobbying.

21
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,510

22
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,720
 And Baek Soo Jeong is one of those actresses.

23
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,660
 All the actresses belong to the A Actors company.

24
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,970
 The CEO is Yoon Hyeong Sook.

25
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,700
 She is the wife of Park Jae Geun.

26
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,050
 How about it? You get the picture, right?

27
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:18,130
 Park Jae Geun and Yoon Hyeong Sook teamed up and threatened the naive generals

28
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:21,080
 to secure an arms deal.

29
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,350
 There is a high probability that the lobbying takes place at Faith in Action Church where Park Jae Geun is a member.

30
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:29,120
 There's a private office on the third floor of the church building.

31
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,810
 If we can just penetrate that room, catching Park Jae Geun is just a matter of time.

32
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,070
 Hey, newbie, are you keeping up?

33
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,040
 Yes.

34
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,690
 It will be difficult to obtain a search warrant for a church, though.

35
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,760
 So how do we hit it?

36
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,620
 We have a plan.

37
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,420
 A plan?

38
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,060
 The name of this operation is "The Secret Prayer Room."

39
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,060

40
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,280
 And the one who wrote the article on "The Secret Prayer Room" was Kang Yeo Joo.

41
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,750
Kang Yeo Joo?

42
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,590
Wasn't the reporter a male?

43
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,520
It's my understanding that he died as a result of a car explosion.

44
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,980
They wrote it together.

45
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:17,000
There was even a rumor that they were engaged, although I don't know if it is true or not.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,920
She's had quite a long relationship with Baek Soo Jeong, that Kang Yeo Joo.

47
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,550
It was an ill-fated relationship.

48
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,800
Because Kang Yeo Joo wrote that article,

49
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,340
Baek Soo Jeong ended up getting kicked out to the US.

50
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,360
Could this case somehow be related to the Secret Prayer Room case?

51
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,940
Since Kang Yeo Joo is involved in so many ways.

52
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,830
Whether she is involved in it,

53
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,370
or Kang Yeo Joo committed the crime...

54
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,200
you should figure that out yourselves. Am I a detective?

55
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,420
Ah, Sir! Please help me. It's killing me!

56
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,540
The reporters are camped outside the police station every day...

57
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,760
Our team leader is grilling us for not being able to catch the culprit.

58
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,250
I know.  I know that feeling.

59
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,750
Okay, here.  Eat a lot.

60
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,450
Here. You're going through a lot. Eat more. It tastes good.

61
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,900
- Eat. 
 - It is tasty.

62
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,850
That part is tasty.

63
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,460
Good, good. Eat up.

64
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,530
It is tasty. It certainly is tasty.

65
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,400
Ah, our Se Jin is the one that really needs to eat up.

66
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,070
- Eat a lot. 
 - Okay. Thanks.

67
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,230
And have some sauce, too.

68
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,640
You two look good together. Why don't you date each other?

69
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,360
Pardon?

70
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,400
Already married.

71
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,070
Really?

72
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,330
I didn't know!

73
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,600
Hey, congratulations! You've got more skills than you look like you'd have!

74
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,950
- No. 
 - No.

75
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,240
I called and told you that I was getting married back then.

76
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,700
I married a different woman.

77
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,240
- Yes. I'm single. 
 - Yes, she's single.

78
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,090
Why? You should've married each other.

79
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,980
You look good together.

80
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,960
Can we drop it?

81
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,450
A person should be like this cheese... like this...

82
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:56,550
You see? A person needs to have a flavorful nature like this for anyone to marry her.

83
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,960
Hey, you don't get to eat anymore. No more.

84
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,720
Leaving love aside,

85
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,240
at least you should be able to kiss the person

86
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,190
to consider a marriage.

87
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,530
With him... Really...

88
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,300
Hey.

89
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:15,800
After you get married, you can't kiss anymore. There's a law.

90
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,400
What nonsense is that?

91
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,200
Then, why do you get married?

92
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,430
It's to not kiss the person you want to kiss.

93
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,250
Bravo! You are right, sir.

94
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,500
Give me a glass, please. That's the right answer.

95
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,770
Wow!

96
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,790
I understand my wife less and less.

97
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,760
 Honey!

98
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,780
 That perfume...

99
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,920
 It... It's the one you use, isn't it?

100
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,770
 You even got it as a gift from Baek Soo Jeong as well.

101
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,050
 Do you know something about that perfume?

102
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,800
 Well...

103
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,670
 If I say that I received it as a gift from Baek Soo Jeong,

104
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,620
 it would be easy for the cops to misunderstand, wouldn't it?

105
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,140
She has many secrets.

106
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:55,070
You... Did you catch on?

107
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,970
Catch on to what?

108
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,370
No.

109
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,190
No way.

110
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,280
What... do you mean "no way"?

111
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,950
If the trust is gone between you, the marriage is over!

112
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,940
You shouldn't doubt so easily like that!

113
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,000
Why? Do you know something?

114
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,430
No, nothing!

115
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,270
I don't!

116
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:55,060
I'm sure I left it here somewhere.

117
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,430
What are you looking for?

118
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,970
It's still a mess like this?

119
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,160
Clean it all up.

120
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,170
She made the mess...

121
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,200
Do I have two bodies?

122
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,030
When did she even give me the time to clean?

123
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,470

124
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,940
 Come here.

125
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,070
  - This is a secret. 
 - Okay.

126
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,560
 I'm sorry.

127
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,730
 That is... your wife...

128
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,190
 with that assistant...

129
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,750
No. No.

130
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,290
When am I going to clean all this?

131
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,050
I should've left her to get crushed.

132
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,400
 Hey! Aren't you going to help me out?

133
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,820
 Why you!

134
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:06,700
Were her eyes always that big?

135
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,110
Was it because she was surprised?

136
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,800
Oh!

137
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,440
Oh, it's hot.

138
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,590
Is it because it's the basement?

139
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:53,730

140
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,280

141
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,740
"Secret prayer room"?

142
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,170
Did he not leave yet?

143
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,840
 Your wife...

144
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,500
 with that assistant...

145
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,190
 in the basement storage room...

146
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,900
What are you doing?

147
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:19,780
- Pardon? 
 - What are you doing?

148
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,970
Ah, I was thinking about how to organize the shelves.

149
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,780
Uh, should I do it in Korean alphabetical order or English alphabetical order?

150
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,400
Why not by size or color?

151
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,150
Wow, seriously...

152
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:37,510
You really have many different ways to goof off.

153
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,690
 In the basement, they... what?

154
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:54,010
 No. I c-can't say...

155
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,410
 No matter what kind of torture I face...

156
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:59,980
 I can't say it. I am sorry.

157
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,880
Clean this up, too.

158
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,810
Clean them all up, even if you have to stay up all night.

159
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,180
What are you doing here?

160
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:23,040
I saw you weren't... in your study, so...

161
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,300
The assistant... he hasn't left for the day yet?

162
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,260
Yeah, he's cleaning up the storage room.

163
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:35,410
You two... were here together... all this time?

164
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:45,650
Honey... don't you think you keep the assistant... working too late?

165
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:52,500
Why would you be concerned with something like that?

166
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,970
Ah... there might be a rumor that you are too bossy.

167
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,700
The rumor has already spread.

168
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,480
Since the twenty-one assistants who have quit are bad-mouthing me already.

169
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,580
Ah, what if the number becomes twenty-two?

170
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,390
It probably is already.

171
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:33,640
"In the hallway of the Faith in Action Church on the third floor,

172
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,160
there is a room that is not shown even in the blueprint of the building."

173
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,250
This is old.

174
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,870
No one uses something like this these days.

175
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,440
 The assistant doesn't do anything out of line or anything like that, right?

176
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:14,550
He's at an age when he would lack self-control.

177
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,390
Out of line?

178
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,590
He's always doing something out of line.

179
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:31,370
But then again... you wouldn't allow it.

180
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,050
Why would you think that?

181
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,550
That I wouldn't allow it.

182
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:42,580
You allowed another woman into your cabinet.

183
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:50,820
- Ah, but t-that's a misunder— 
 - I...

184
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,740
think I'll be fully awake if I talk about it some more.

185
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,760
I got it. Go to sleep.

186
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:22,000

187
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,110
 Let's settle on getting married.

188
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,050
 Then, let's first print the wedding invitations right away.

189
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,790
 Aren't you rushing it?

190
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,530
 When should I visit your father to say hello?

191
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:02,730
 It's been over ten years since I last contacted him.

192
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:07,190
 This is a good excuse to contact him, isn't it? A wedding.

193
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,460
 Hey, you punk, are you recording this now?

194
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,490
 Were you really recording it?

195
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,320
 How can I trust you?

196
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,030
 If you are trying to write an article or trying to come on to me...

197
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,070
 I should've known...

198
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,430
 Hey, you are not my type and I have a girlfriend!

199
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,560
 I even made her breakfast this morning!

200
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,960
 You could be two-timing.

201
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,240
 Okay.

202
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,390
 I do like that attitude of mistrust.

203
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,050
 Do you really think you can fool my father

204
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,780
 with this awkward first-time hand holding act?

205
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,530
 You are something else.

206
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,240
The wedding was fake.

207
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,950
Where does her true self start?

208
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,980
It's impossible to tell with her.

209
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,970
Is that why she is dangerous?

210
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:17,470
 Aren't you done yet? Hurry it up, please.

211
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,410
 I am done. Done.

212
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,140
 I'm getting married.

213
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:15,390
 468934... it's the passcode.

214
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:20,670
 Now, it's done. Park Jae Geun, it's over for you now.

215
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,150
 Team Leader, I will go over there now with the video.

216
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,930
 I'm sorry, Honey. Let's just deliver this and go eat right after.

217
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:53,110

218
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,890
About the wedding invitation... sorry.

219
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,850
But... can't we just leave it buried?

220
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,020
If I keep it buried...?

221
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:14,830
It would be peaceful... for you... and for me.

222
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:24,140
That's what I thought as well.

223
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,630
But Baek Soo Jeong died.

224
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:32,640
The things that we buried ten years ago without resolving...

225
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:36,710
they were rotting all this time.

226
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:43,860
Do you... think that Baek Soo Jeong died because of what happened back then?

227
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,910
Well, we will soon find out.

228
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:56,820
Soon, I have a feeling that the culprit will come looking for me.

229
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:14,210
 If Kang Yeo Joo is not the culprit...

230
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:17,100
 then who killed Baek Soo Jeong?

231
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,670
This product line is for moisturizing and hydrating skin.

232
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:55,390
These are natural and organic products.

233
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,010
It's time to go to school.

234
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:16,190
I don't think there'll be any time for me to draw anymore.

235
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,420
Put in for a leave of absence.

236
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:25,300
Honey, where did you go so early?

237
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,950
Oh.

238
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,640
I'm eating bread right now.

239
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,010
Yes.

240
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,260
But, Honey,

241
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,660
today is...

242
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,440
Never mind.

243
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,380
Come home safely.

244
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,130
Okay. Okay.

245
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,110
Today is my birthday, though.

246
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,730
That's right.

247
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,180
Oh, Woo Seong, you're here.

248
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,880
Yeah. Are they doing construction?

249
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,190
Oh, the interior? The owner of the building changed and it's said that their taste is quite particular.

250
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,530
It's good for us though.

251
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,480
Oh, really?

252
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,630
You would need to come into work regularly to know.

253
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,630
It smells nice I guess.

254
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:04,120
Are they going to raise our maintenance fees because of this?

255
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,530
I won't let them.

256
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,320
You know me.

257
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,710
Put a few paintings up, too.

258
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,270
Yes.

259
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:41,110
Did he eat seaweed soup? 
 (T/N: Koreans eat seaweed soup on their birthdays)

260
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,270
It's his birthday.

261
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:53,050
Usually, you can't eat here because it's too full. This is new.

262
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,850
That's true.

263
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,960
- Why are you hitting me? 
 - It's your birthday punch.

264
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,200
Did you at least eat seaweed soup this morning?

265
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,830
Well, my wife made some so I did.

266
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,300
Really?

267
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,700
Excuse me.

268
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,330
We only have seaweed soup on our lunch menu today.

269
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:15,520
Oh, that's great. Please give us that.

270
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,050
Okay, I'll prepare it.

271
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,820
But we ordered the lunch set...

272
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,220
Yes, this is the set menu you ordered.

273
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:55,060
Excuse me, are you sure this is the ₩8,000 ($8) set menu?

274
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,210
Yes, it is the ₩8,000 set menu.

275
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,420
Please eat well.

276
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:03,460
Wow. Amazing.

277
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,560
Let's eat. Wow.

278
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,380

279
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,880
Please have one.

280
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:28,140
You don't seem to have the investigative report on the CEO of the agency Baek Soo Jeong belonged to.

281
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:32,350
Ah, we tried but she wouldn't cooperate.

282
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:37,030
She made such a ruckus at Baek Soo Jeong's funeral telling us to quickly catch the culprit but...

283
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:41,910
She's not at her office, or at her house, and she doesn't answer her phone either... Geez.

284
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,260
I met her yesterday.

285
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,010
Excuse me?

286
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:56,580
 If it's to catch the culprit who killed Soo Jeong, I'll help however I can.

287
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,490
 My husband's primary is right around the corner...

288
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,650
 An interview would be difficult but...

289
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,850
She said she would cooperate with the police investigation.

290
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:16,100
She said she would... cooperate?

291
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:19,110
What's going on?

292
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,370
But... she has a condition.

293
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,640
A condition?

294
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,960
What condition?

295
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,800
She said that Writer Kang Yeo Joo has to personally come over.

296
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,600
She said to bring me?

297
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,850
To her house. Why?

298
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:42,190
We would find out the reason when we go there.

299
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,530
That's okay.

300
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:47,830
I don't want to take time away from my busy work to find out the reason.

301
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:50,320
You are not... going to go?

302
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,110
You said you can't record either, right?

303
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,970
We could obtain an important lead.

304
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,810
A lead...

305
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,840
And after obtaining the lead?

306
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,190
After obtaining a lead! W-We should catch the culprit.

307
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:04,810
Lower your voice, seriously!

308
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:11,720
You think I'm the culprit, but you want me to catch the culprit...

309
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:21,660
Ah, damn! Seriously!

310
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,810
I'm a little busy, so if you will excuse me.

311
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,710
We never concluded that you were the culprit! Did we?

312
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,670
That's right.

313
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:42,290
So... are you asking for a favor? For me to accompany you?

314
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:45,700
- It's not that we are asking for a favor— 
 - Yes, yes.

315
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,580
That's right.

316
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,770
We are asking you for a favor.

317
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,460
I will go in my car.

318
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,690
 Then, the two...

319
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,810
 Are you dating?

320
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:59,830
I don't want to be awkward riding with you.

321
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,970
We don't have that kind of relationship.

322
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:04,270
With her, it's just business—

323
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,420
It's okay for me to bring my assistant, isn't it?

324
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,860
What did you say?

325
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:11,420
That's right. You don't even want me to meddle in the investigation,

326
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:14,270
so it would be too much for me to bring my assistant as well. Right?

327
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:18,190
What do you mean "meddle"?  It's "help."

328
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,090
She was going to call him anyway...

329
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,990
Why bother asking?

330
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:30,030
Soo Ho?

331
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,930
 Yoon Hyeong Sook is the only person who triggered Kang Yeo Joo's trauma.

332
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:11,480
 She is... Kang Yeo Joo's Achilles heel.

333
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:21,980
What is it?  Why do you have the window open?

334
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,650
Because it's stuffy. I can't even get off work...

335
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:28,220
Do you want to get off work forever?

336
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:56,280
Yes, this is Attorney Han Woo Seong.

337
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:02,330
Pardon? A supermarket raffle giveaway?

338
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,860
You must've entered. That's why you got the prize.

339
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,900
I don't remember though.

340
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,110
Maybe your wife did it?

341
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:15,170
No, she's not the type to do it.

342
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,570
Ah, that's right! I did it.

343
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,490
No, really.

344
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:28,910
Really, writing the attorney's name on papers became a habit...

345
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,160
Don't lie.

346
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,670
I was mistaken. This is my car.

347
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:35,370
This is my car.

348
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:37,450
Ah, I remember! I remember.

349
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:41,690
I did it, last month. I entered it last month, right?

350
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:44,910
- Which supermarket is it? 
 - It's V Mart.

351
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,090
- Let me get in! 
 - Get away.

352
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,500
- You can't! 
 - C'mon.

353
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,060
No, you can't!

354
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,720
- Ah, you punk! 
 - Here, here.

355
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,240
 Try wearing this.

356
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,170
 Wear it.

357
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,760
- Hey, it looks pretty good. 
 - If it's cute, have it.

358
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,920
Hello, nice to meet you.

359
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,010
Anyway, it feels good to get a new car.

360
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,290
Then give yours to me.

361
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,190
- How much are you going to give for it? 
 - What?!  Hey!

362
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:13,660
My family was almost broken up because of you!

363
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,470
Let me see what was your wife's phone number—

364
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,480
- Here. 
 - Oh!

365
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,770
Drive it for just one month.

366
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:30,300
Whichever car I don't like, you can keep!

367
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,780
Yes!

368
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,240
Woo Seong's flex! Yes!

369
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:00,510
This is tea for the guests.

370
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:06,500
Be careful. The tea set is valuable.

371
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,420
Yes, Ma'am.

372
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,690
You brought plenty of handcuffs, didn't you?

373
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:20,100
Why do we have to have plenty?

374
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:23,350
Because Yoon Hyeong Sook always has bodyguards with her.

375
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:25,730
What about it?

376
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:28,810
Because Yoon Hyeong Sook might be the culprit.

377
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:32,720
The one who killed Baek Soo Jeong and kidnapped the manager.

378
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:39,060
You take care of yourselves. I only need him.

379
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:43,730
You said you killed someone before, didn't you?

380
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,950
When did I?

381
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,480
No, I didn't.

382
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:14,780
 Yoon Hyeong Sook is Kang Yeo Joo's mother... legally.

383
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:18,310
 Because Kang Yeo Joo is Congressman Park Jae Geun's daughter.

384
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:23,940
 Then, why is her last name "Kang"?

385
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,600
 She changed it to her biological mother's last name.

386
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,830
 Why?

387
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:32,690
 Every family has its complicated story.

388
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:53,090
Are you not feeling well?

389
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,210
I should be writing my book,

390
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:06,770
but I am doing the work that should be done by the cops. It's making me very tired.

391
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:10,860
If you're going to do this, at least my taxes should be reduced.

392
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:19,990
You seem very tired so we, the cops, will ring the bell for you.

393
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:22,090
Ring the bell for her.

394
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,830
How long has it been?

395
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:11,240
Please enter. I've prepared tea for you.

396
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,620
They seem a lot closer than I thought.

397
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,760
Don't get close.

398
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,320
Please enter.

399
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:25,400
Heaven was touched by my loyalty and gave me a car.

400
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,650
But this car has its good points and that car has good points as well.

401
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:33,480
Which should I pick— Ah, I don't know!

402
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,030
What is this?

403
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:19,450
I've prepared milk tea.

404
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,660
You still like it, don't you?

405
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,670
 Try some.

406
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:56,390
Ah, I will take coffee.

407
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:58,320
Yes.

408
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,280
Bring some coffee.

409
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,750
Then, I will have some as well.  Thank you.

410
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:06,460
- Two cups of coffee. 
 - Sit. Sit.

411
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:17,210
Then, Yeo Joo will have to drink all the milk tea by herself.

412
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:42,440
What are you doing? Sit here.

413
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,410
Are you all right?

414
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,540
What do you mean?

415
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,870
You don't look good.

416
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:18,000
By chance, are you still not well?

417
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:23,290
Mrs. Kang Yeo Joo, are you sick?

418
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:46,580
She even went to a mental hospital for a long time.

419
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,660
A mental hospital...

420
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:15,030
 What did you see?

421
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:28,860
 She's like this.

422
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:33,700
 Since her mother's death, she is not able to talk at all.

423
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,920
The view is nice.

424
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:27,780
I have a sunlight allergy.

425
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:34,580
Is that right?

426
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:38,090
Despite how I appear, my skin is a bit sensitive.

427
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:50,380
If you are going to be that sensitive, you should have just gone outside.

428
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:54,820
Why would you open up an umbrella indoors? What a strange person.

429
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:02,570
I heard you first discovered Miss Baek Soo Jeong.

430
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:16,110
I heard that you worked with her since her debut.

431
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:26,400
Then, you should know everything about Baek Soo Jeong. Do you know about the special fan?

432
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,040
"Special fan"?

433
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,920
 To be honest, I came back because I miss the fans.

434
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:06,760
Why? Is it very uncomfortable here?

435
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:10,240
By chance, do you still think about the past?

436
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,810
It must be hard to cure that illness.

437
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:20,190
If it's like this... is everyday life possible?

438
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:23,220
I thought it might be uncomfortable.

439
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:27,670
He says he has a sunlight allergy. I should at least show that much consideration.

440
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:29,530
Let's go.

441
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,430
This hidden camera was found inside the back seat.

442
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:54,800
The location tracker was found under the car.

443
00:47:56,670 --> 00:48:01,610
She was monitoring you in the open. You didn't notice it at all?

444
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:08,880
As expected, your wife is a level above you.

445
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,680

446
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:26,110
The day before Baek Soo Jeong disappeared, there was an award ceremony.

447
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:31,500
Baek Soo Jeong received the Hallyu Broadcaster Award.

448
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:35,460
It's been a while since she received an award, so she must have been very excited.

449
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,520
No one seems to be paying attention to the award ceremony.

450
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:02,330
Although Baek Soo Jeong disappeared after receiving the award.

451
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:05,840
 Thank you.

452
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:12,330
 Although it has not been very long since I returned, you gave me such a big award.

453
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:18,500
 First of all, I want to thank the fans for not forgetting me even during my long absence.

454
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:23,690
 To be honest, I came back because I miss the fans.

455
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:28,600
 I will share this happiness with the fans.

456
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,250
 I'm already excited.

457
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:35,100
 It's a happy night. Thank you.

458
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,600
 Crazy wench.

459
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,420
 She dug her own grave in the end?

460
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:46,360
 Turn the car around. Turn the car around right now!

461
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:06,320
Baek Soo Jeong tried to meet someone after the award ceremony.

462
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:08,550
 I'm here.

463
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:10,290
 Hold onto her.

464
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:12,560
 Don't let her get away!

465
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:15,620
 Let go!

466
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:17,120
 You can't go now, really!

467
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,470
  - Move aside! I don't have time! 
 - Ah, just a minute!

468
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:21,100
 If the CEO finds out—

469
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,590
 How would the CEO find out?

470
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:24,960
 She's on her way over.

471
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:28,750
 Why would the CEO come over?

472
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:33,170
 You... by chance...

473
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:36,730
 have you been reporting where I've been going?

474
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:42,780
 You are with them too, aren't you?

475
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:46,920
 I trusted you.

476
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,920
 But you were a spy they planted to monitor me, weren't you?!

477
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:13,020
Why, on the trophy,

478
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:16,120
was the manager's blood found?

479
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:22,060
Do you know... the reason?

480
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:29,390
Because the manager prevented Baek Soo Jeong from meeting the fan.

481
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:37,130
 She threw it at me.

482
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:40,900
 I think she misunderstood something.

483
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,450
 She was upset with me...

484
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:51,020
How do you know that? It's not like you were at the broadcasting company.

485
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:54,120
I heard it directly from the manager.

486
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:59,710
 The CEO told me to hold onto Soo Jeong.

487
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:02,620
 I only did what I was told to do.

488
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:05,580
I contacted him through the president of the fan club.

489
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,160
 Tell him to call me... if he wants to live.

490
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:23,640
How boring... the story you are writing this time.

491
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:30,530
Then... should I write it more interestingly?

492
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:33,060
About that fan?

493
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:38,000
 Who is the fan?

494
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:41,750
 I always had a lot of fans.

495
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:44,330
 You know who I'm asking about, don't you?

496
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:47,290
 The special fan.

497
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:51,120
 The one you met secretly in the secret prayer room.

498
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:58,390
 If you know, would you be able to handle it?

499
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:00,390
 A politician?

500
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:02,630
 It's more than that though.

501
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:05,110
 Whoever you might be thinking.

502
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:08,930
 It can't possibly be...

503
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:34,030
That fan is in this room.

504
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:44,860
By chance...

505
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:52,860
That's right.

506
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,530
You are saying that fan is your father?

507
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,220
No.

508
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:12,580
The president?

509
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:17,180
You are crazy. Crazy.

510
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:22,580
 It's the president.

511
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:30,220
Are you crazy?

512
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:33,270
That's what I said, too.

513
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:38,690
 You are crazy.

514
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:46,140
 I'm going to make him get a divorce.

515
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:01,230
 A divorce? Are you in your right mind?

516
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:03,640
 Do you think that's even possible?

517
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:07,040
 Just wait and see, if it's possible or not.

518
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:11,810
 He says he's still my fan. We even saw each other in the US.

519
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:17,410
 Don't you remember... that you almost died nine years ago?

520
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:22,900
 At that time... he said that his underlings misunderstood something.

521
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:31,060
 How idiotic!

522
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:33,750
 You are going to end up dead if you keep this up.

523
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:36,130
 Wake up.

524
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,440
 You should take care of your own affairs well.

525
00:55:54,220 --> 00:56:00,490
If Baek Soo Jeong... had a scandal with the president...

526
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,730
could the next president come from the Minjin Party?

527
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:19,450
The strongest candidate in Minjin Party for the primary... was Congressman Park, wasn't he?

528
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:30,530
I'm sure that there was no ill intention.

529
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:34,980
She just wanted to prevent it as the wife, isn't that right?

530
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:43,660
 It's me. What's the passcode for Baek Soo Jeong's house?

531
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:52,370
 We decided to see each other again.

532
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:55,290
 He can never leave me.

533
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:03,730
 So, are you going to become the First Lady or something?

534
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:06,670
 Why not? Can't I?

535
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:09,720
 You have a death wish.

536
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:14,860
 Don't you remember crying and begging for your life to be spared?

537
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:19,180
 The situation is different now.

538
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:22,990
 Ah, seriously!

539
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,540
 You can never be any more than just a mistress.

540
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:28,600
 Like you?

541
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,690
 What?

542
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:31,870
 That's not bad.

543
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:38,280
 I can just kill the First Lady and take her place, too.

544
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,810
 This wench!

545
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:52,680
So... I am the culprit?

546
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,440
I'm just saying that there is a probability.

547
00:57:57,130 --> 00:58:02,970
It's boring. How long are you going to tell a story?

548
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,990
We are just at the climax.

549
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:33,190
You still misunderstand... me.

550
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:34,990
Misunderstand?

551
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:39,410
Is it my fault that your mother committed suicide?

552
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:44,240
Why are you trying to frame me? Even bringing the cops!

553
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:52,050
You are the one who called me.

554
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:57,030
Why did you call me? What is the reason?

555
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:07,450
I wanted to ask... who killed Baek Soo Jeong.

556
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:15,960
To me?

557
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:23,480
You know who the culprit is.

558
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,580
Isn't that right?

559
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:38,960
Now, I know what you want.

560
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:43,300
The puzzle is complete.

561
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:49,630
You mean "the story."

562
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:04,050
Yes, hello?

563
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:07,640
Turned themselves in?

564
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:15,690
Killed Baek Soo Jeong?

565
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:17,710
A confession?

566
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:36,050

567
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,550

568
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:43,730
♫  The times when you shook me up have passed  ♫

569
01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:46,960
♫  I'm frozen in the memories of the past  ♫

570
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:50,820
♫  All the moments fill the vision before me  ♫

571
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:54,180
♫  At the end of the road I didn't take  ♫

572
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:56,920
♫  Don't go away  ♫

573
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,240
♫  Yeah  ♫

574
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:04,260
♫  Come back to me. Don't go away  ♫

575
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,930
♫  Yeah  ♫

576
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:07,920
 The blood would have splattered in all directions,

577
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,580
 but the clothes are too clean.

578
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:11,140
 Don't you think that there is some intent?

579
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:15,020
 It means that your wife saw your image captured at the studio apartment.

580
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:17,090
 Is she trying to take revenge?

581
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,930
 You need to help me.

582
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:22,250
 I'm not doing this because I want to. Writer Kang asked me to do it.

583
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,140
 Are you going to just let Yeo Joo go wild like that?

584
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:25,930
 I'm telling you that Yeo Joo is a time bomb!

585
01:01:25,930 --> 01:01:28,770
 We are dealing with Jin Seong group's Seo Jae Ha.

586
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:30,750
 Please don't worry. We will win.

587
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:34,620
 Was the actress successful in taking her revenge?  Did she seduce the attorney?

588
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:37,090
 That way the wife can take an act of harrowing revenge.

589
01:01:37,090 --> 01:01:40,520
 My readers want that.

590
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:44,299
