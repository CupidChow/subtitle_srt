1
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:27,920

2
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,570
Attorney Han! Attorney Han!

3
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:21,040
Attorney Han! Attorney Han! Are you all right? Are you all right?

4
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,350
Are you all right? Just lie down, lie down.

5
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,610
It's a little fast.

6
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,460
That's good.

7
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,150

8
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,540

9
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,350
You must be busy. You should leave. Thank you for today.

10
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,750
Take care of your health. It's important, right?

11
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,820
Yes, it's important.

12
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:17,290
But... the student who saved me...

13
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,350
Shouldn't I thank her?

14
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,320
She said she was late for her part-time job and left.

15
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,140
I thanked her on your behalf.

16
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,270
- Should I give you her phone number? 
 - No, no.

17
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,040
I-I'm sure you took good care of it.

18
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,750
Honey.

19
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,490
Oh, you came.

20
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,350
You look okay, despite everything.

21
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,270
Oh, my head...

22
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,480
I'm sorry. You were alarmed, weren't you?

23
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,170
That's what happens when you associate with someone like Nam Gi Ryong.

24
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,340
Do you know Director Nam?

25
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,650
He's a bad person.

26
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,910
Excuse me!

27
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,860
You left this behind.

28
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,410
It doesn't belong to us.

29
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,730

30
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,820
- This... 
 - Is it yours?

31
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,500
I was wondering if Director Nam left it.

32
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,240
Anyway, with a sharp eye,

33
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,210
you can tell that it obviously belongs to a female student.

34
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:40,770
It's stained with paint. Maybe an art student?

35
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,740
Director Nam had someone with him. A female student.

36
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,910
I'm okay to drive, though.

37
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,410
No. You have to rest a bit.

38
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:09,100
I have somewhere to drop by on the way. Is that okay?

39
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,150
Yes. Then, I'll sleep for a bit.

40
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,520
Yes, that's good.

41
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,790

42
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,680
 I have to return her bag to her.

43
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,720
Honey...

44
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,300
You're... being careful, right?

45
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,080
About what?

46
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,400
The angle of your head.

47
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,220
My head?  What...

48
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,600
Then, I'll sleep.

49
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,660
Go to the back seat and sleep comfortably.

50
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,140
Hey. What are you, my boss?

51
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,260
That you're sleeping in the backseat?

52
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,070
I'm not sleeping, just thinking.

53
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,440
Thinking, my ass.

54
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,690
Hey! What kind of relationship do you have with Baek Soo Jeong?

55
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,320
What do you mean by a relationship? That's nonsense!

56
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,250
It's only been a day since her disappearance but since the start of the investigation,

57
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,480
you've been acting suspiciously. There's something, right?

58
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,240
Look. Even now, you're overly excited.

59
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:45,560
She's pretty. I'm just her fan. Her fan.

60
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,350
Since when? Have you ever watched any of Baek Soo Jeong's movies?

61
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,550
Well...

62
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,830
Do I even have the time to watch movies? Seriously!

63
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,410
Suspicious...

64
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,350
Hey! Don't say anything.

65
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,760
Just go to sleep quickly if you really want to sleep.

66
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,300
You're really suspicious.

67
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,670
Suspicious, suspicious.

68
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:23,610

69
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,230

70
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,460
 Hey!

71
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,030
 Do you really have to open that?

72
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:01,010
 I'm carrying out official duties. I don't have the time to chat with you.

73
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,060
 Wait!

74
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,680
 Don't move.

75
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,860
 Do you even know how to use a gun?

76
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,760
 All you are is a traffic cop.

77
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,720
 Usually, you're supposed to shoot the leg, but...

78
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:45,340
 It's my first time, so I don't know if I'll do it properly.

79
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,620

80
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:12,010
What? Cha Soo Ho disappeared?

81
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:14,090
And with no contact, too?

82
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,770
I've told you enough to understand.

83
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,710
The source of an AI infection was discovered nearby, so this place is closed. 
 (T/N: AI = Avian influenza)

84
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,800
You have to turn around.

85
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,770
I don't know what I'm doing right now, really.

86
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,750
Hey, can mountain herb roots catch AI, too?

87
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,250
I mean, how could AI infect a neighborhood that doesn't even have a single duck?

88
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,910
There's no neighborhood without ducks.

89
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,810
- Right? 
 - Yes.

90
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,650
If Chief Ma finds out...

91
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:44,020
I thought he ordered us to do this.

92
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:48,030
Don't worry. Baek Soo Jeong's body being found only puts Chief Ma in a tough spot.

93
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,670
Right?

94
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,640
But why did you disagree with the chief again?

95
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,980
 Delete all evidence.

96
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,540
 Delete all traces of evidence against Kang Yeo Joo. Immediately.

97
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,330
 Before the police finds anything.

98
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,820
 It's also a crime to protect a criminal.

99
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,430
 - That's romantic. 
 - Why are you protecting Kang Yeo Joo?

100
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,980
 Is she that important?

101
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,230
 Don't waste your time.

102
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,900
 After all, the police won't be able to find the body there.

103
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,080
 There's no evidence, too.

104
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,280
 Body?

105
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,700
 Is Baek Soo Jeong dead?

106
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,670
 I only reported that Baek Soo Jeong's blood was found.

107
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,220
  Where is "there"?

108
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,210
 Where the police can't find the body?

109
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:52,190
 It seems like you even know where it's buried.

110
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,050
So, where are you going to dig?

111
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:00,220
Anywhere you dig here, you'll find a body.

112
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:09,450

113
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,750
You said you were bringing equipment.

114
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,970
He's not equipment, he's a soldier.

115
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,410
He even got special training in Germany.

116
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:18,420
- What is he, a German mercenary? 
 - Yeah.

117
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,890
He should be here by now...

118
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,260
Oh, he's coming. Here! Over here!

119
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,830
He looks Korean.

120
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,440
Huh? He's of pure German descent.

121
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,840
Second Lieutenant Hunter.

122
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,790
He can distinguish smells up to 12 meters underground.

123
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,670
 Move aside!

124
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,900
Corpses from the water are the worst.

125
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,190
The first person to discover it was a reporter?

126
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,160
Yeah. A political journalist.

127
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,360
He said there was an event nearby.

128
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,370
Could it really be Baek Soo Jeong?

129
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:53,350
All the other ships went to investigate,

130
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:57,370
but our ship couldn't move even though there was nothing wrong with the engine.

131
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,080
We stopped the engine and looked...

132
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,730
 What is that? Could it be...?

133
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,390
  A yellow dress was floating.

134
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,080
Okay. Thank you.

135
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,450
It seems like there's really something here.

136
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,260
Let's dig here.

137
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:59,260
Hey. You look as if you've lost your girlfriend.

138
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,880
It's sad when anyone dies.

139
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,840
As if this is the first or second time we're seeing this?

140
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,700
I feel like I'm looking at my elementary school classmate.

141
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,320
She doesn't know me, but I saw her on TV every day.

142
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,660
Stop it. You might hit a pipe.

143
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,510
Where am I?

144
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,880
Honey, where are we?

145
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:53,810
Huh? Where am I?

146
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,750
What's happening?

147
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,900
Where am I...

148
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,880

149
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,640
Honey!

150
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,640

151
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,040
Soo Jeong?

152
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,940
Excuse me. Are you okay?

153
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,490
Yes.

154
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,330
I'm sorry, but can you move over?

155
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,140
What?

156
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,740
 Come on, get a shot!

157
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,120
 Please don't do that!

158
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,870

159
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,420
 Why, of all nights, last night...?

160
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,600
 Please move aside.

161
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:57,020
  The body of Baek Soo Jeong who disappeared was discovered at the Han River.

162
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,210
 Several stab wounds were found on the body.

163
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:04,210
 It's being investigated by the police as a murder case.

164
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,380
She was at the Han River?

165
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:11,450
We did all that for nothing.

166
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,890
Oh my god!

167
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,650
Baek Soo Jeong must've committed suicide.

168
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:40,520
We'll have to eat out another time.

169
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,510
Why again?

170
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,550
I have to go and meet Woo Seong. I'm sorry, go home.

171
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:50,440
What?

172
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,560
 Where are you going?

173
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,380
No! No!

174
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,490
You should've married Attorney Han!

175
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:05,110
Wow!  Wow—

176
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,580
 Broadcaster Baek Soo Jeong found dead at the Han River.

177
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,580

178
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,530
The question of whether I should be involved in this investigation has already been decided.

179
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,740
I guess I need to talk to Team Leader Hong.

180
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,120
There's no point.

181
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:58,760
Why are you so interested in this case?

182
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:04,630
By any chance, do you have any kind of relationship with Baek Soo Jeong?

183
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,590
Aren't you the one who has a relationship with Baek Soo Jeong,

184
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:09,090
Detective Jang?

185
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:18,100
Excuse me.

186
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:23,320
Why did you hide the fact that Attorney Han was your husband?

187
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,700
I also don't know who your wife is, Detective Jang.

188
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:31,230
We're not even close, so why do we need to know that?

189
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:40,440
- If you're going to keep being like this— 
 - Hey, hey, hey!

190
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,720
Let's go. You know corpses from the water decompose quickly.

191
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,920
Allow me in the coroner's office.

192
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:52,050
I won't participate beyond that.

193
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,030
Or should I go to the reporters?

194
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,850
Because I know a lot about this case.

195
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,780
Only up to the coroner's office.

196
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,880
Only up to the coroner's office.

197
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,690
Did you get some sleep?

198
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,200
I took a taxi since you seemed busy.

199
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:57,750
Jin Ho was worried, so I'll head home after seeing him.

200
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,580
Okay.

201
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,140
Okay. See you at home.

202
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,520
Did you see her yourself?

203
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,760
Yeah.

204
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,470
This is... not a dream, right?

205
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:27,150
 The light's not working?

206
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,570
I was only worried about the CCTV footage.

207
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,600
Even though a person had disappeared.

208
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:44,440
Worrying about the person should have been first...

209
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,120
I never thought she would show up like that.

210
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,990
There are no fatal injuries to the front of her body.

211
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:41,530
Please don't touch.

212
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:50,530
Sorry for making you wait. Let's begin.

213
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,530
It's all in the past. What's the use in talking about it?

214
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:58,690
Just keep living the way you did.

215
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,070
You said being caught cheating is

216
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,810
worse than cheating itself.

217
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:05,850
You said that a woman wants to be fooled, even when she knows the truth.

218
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:13,060
I know. But a person has died.

219
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,300
Baek Soo Jeong died.

220
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,580
Is it right to only care about

221
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:21,230
keeping myself clean?

222
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,410
If she died unfairly, we need to bring it to light.

223
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,290
It's a deep wound.

224
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:45,940
Yes. She would have suffered a lot of hemorrhaging.

225
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:49,590
There's a wound from a blunt weapon on her head.

226
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:59,750
A hammer or... something like it?

227
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,870
The trophy?

228
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,880
I won't know the exact causes until I carry out the autopsy.

229
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,180
- If there's anything I can help with—  
 - There will be no need for that.

230
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,090
Thank you.

231
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,780
Goodbye.

232
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:30,250
When will the autopsy take place?

233
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:36,020
Don't concern yourself with it. We won't need to see each other anymore.

234
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,390
I hope for that, too.

235
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,220
Seriously...

236
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,440
Please stop following us.

237
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,810
You said you wouldn't bother us anymore.

238
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:08,920
It might be bothersome, but could you please step away from my car?

239
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:27,690
You're aware of what happened at the Hallyu Awards, right?

240
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,880
Like what?

241
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,940
Baek Soo Jeong...

242
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,710
I don't want to bother you. Then I'll be off.

243
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:45,100
What about Baek Soo Jeong? Wait. That...

244
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:49,120
Ah, damn!  That arrogant... That...!  We should catch her and...!

245
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,690
Stop it.

246
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,200
Let's go.

247
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,350
Damn it.

248
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,990
Sister-in-Law! 
  (T/N: Can be used to refer to a close friend's wife)

249
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,390
- You drank a lot. 
 - Yes.

250
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,810
Where is my husband?

251
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:29,840
He's inside. You know,

252
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,450
men are such animals.

253
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:38,570
They always lose to their instincts.

254
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:39,970
So what I mean is that—

255
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:43,280
Hurry up and end it before your wife finds out.

256
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,760
Pardon?

257
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,360
Do you know, "An Assembled Man"?

258
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,980
No.

259
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:54,880
It's my novel. It will help you come to a decision.

260
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,790
It features a man whose package is cut off after cheating.

261
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,690
Wow!

262
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,370
Woo Seong must be really scared.

263
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,800
Wow!

264
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,480
Honey, let's go.

265
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,840
Honey, I'm sorry.

266
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,900
Why did you drink so much?

267
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,920
Because I felt sorry toward you.

268
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,150
I live with the Nation's Husband. What are you sorry about?

269
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:10,150
Sorry for being the Nation's Husband.

270
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,020
What are you saying?

271
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,310
Honey, do you want to go for a drive?

272
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,640
 What are you going to do?

273
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:36,830
 I'm going to confess that I cheated.

274
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,790
Will this guy be okay?

275
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,030
She's not going to let him go.

276
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,340
I don't know.

277
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,160
Seriously...

278
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,380
Did she change the code?

279
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,400
Honey!

280
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,490
Honey! Open the door!

281
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:20,560
Ah, really!  What time is it now?!

282
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:26,740
Standing me up for a dinner that happens once in a blue moon wasn't enough? Now he comes home drunk?

283
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:30,270
 Open the door!

284
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:33,790
So embarrassing.

285
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,680
What's wrong?

286
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,110
Don't wake up our kid and leave quietly.

287
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,540
To where?

288
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:49,310
You don't make a lot of money or help out at home. I don't even expect that much from you.

289
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:51,980
You should at least come home on time!

290
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,280
But I don't cheat on you.

291
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,010
I'd rather you did!

292
00:30:56,010 --> 00:31:00,520
You... really shouldn't say that so easily.

293
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:05,140
- Ow! My foot! 
 - Oh, your foot!

294
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,990
It's okay.

295
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,900
Ah, damn!

296
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,640
Split up and obtain CCTV recordings from all the nearby streets, shops, garages.

297
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,280
Tell your family you won't be home for a while.

298
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,440
Rock, paper, scissors!

299
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,660
We don't have time! Take it quickly! Divide them like this.

300
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,830
Hold on, hold on!

301
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,900
Wait, wait!

302
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,870
- Just take some more. 
 - Let's organize them a bit!

303
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:31,920
When will you finish?

304
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,610
It's too much!

305
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:36,420
If it wasn't for that computer virus, we would have caught the culprit already.

306
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:39,840
By the way, why are you spending so much?

307
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,320
What do you mean? I'm sure I spent the same.

308
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,630
You're spending the most on the team!

309
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:49,290
-  You spent 500,000 won ($500) on the last stakeout!  
 - Hey.

310
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:51,690
Do you see him as a man now, too?

311
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,600
 Why did you spend so much? This is too much!

312
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,480
That wrist.

313
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,720
-  I didn't.  
 -  And it's always you!

314
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,390
It's bothering me a lot.

315
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,850
- What about it? 
 - He's turning it.

316
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:07,530
Doesn't it seem familiar to you?

317
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,350
The cafe's CCTV footage...

318
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:20,300
When we were at the autopsy, Kang Yeo Joo was doing that.

319
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,270
 Be careful about what now?

320
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,200
Hey!

321
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,200
You know I have a girlfriend, don't you?

322
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,920
Cut the crap. Let go.

323
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,360
Oh, sorry.

324
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,710
I'm too busy for this. Seriously.

325
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:06,210

326
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,540
Have you brought back some mountain herbs at least?

327
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,960
I'm not entirely empty-handed.

328
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,410
Grass doesn't grow underneath the soil...

329
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:02,170
but above it.

330
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:04,360
What does that mean?

331
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,040
I plan to look into it starting now. What this means.

332
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:29,550
This person doesn't suit our line of work...

333
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,970
and keeps making issues bigger.

334
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,970
Do you want to grab some tea first?

335
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:52,110
No.

336
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:56,260
I don't think I can talk if the car stops.

337
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,740
What do you want to talk about when you're this drunk?

338
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:07,380
Like... how I've been living all this time...

339
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:11,540
how it's been...

340
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:15,210
Let's... Honey...

341
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:18,610
Let's go look at the sunrise in Yeosoo.

342
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:20,720
At this time of the night?

343
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:32,050
I want to be born as a totally new person.

344
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,900
Should we then?

345
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:40,140
Should we go and destress?

346
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:50,640
♫  You tried so hard to hide it, your little secret  ♫

347
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:57,850
♫  I pretended not to know and ignored it.  
You got used to it over time   ♫

348
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,050
♫  I'm sure you thought it was perfect  ♫

349
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:08,070
♫  I bet you never even looked back  ♫

350
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:12,140
♫  And I had to watch you do it all,  ♫

351
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:15,150
♫  I'll make sure you get what you deserve  ♫

352
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:23,400
♫  Feel my cold gaze.  I'm never gonna love again  ♫

353
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:31,500
♫  Try playing around with those lips again.  
I'm never gonna love again  ♫

354
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:35,940
♫  Sweet temptation like sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

355
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:40,010
♫  You melt sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

356
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:44,190
♫  I fall again sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

357
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:46,660
Oh, oh!

358
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,900
So they do fight!

359
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:52,200
♫  Sweet temptation like sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

360
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,380
♫  You melt sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

361
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:00,340
She's really angry.

362
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:03,480
♫  Leave me alone  ♫

363
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,690
I feel like my eyes are going to pop out.

364
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:16,290
Normally, people turn the pen with their index and middle fingers, or around the top of the thumb.

365
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,070
Magnify it one last time.

366
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,070
Stop, stop, stop...

367
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:34,290
No matter how many times we look at it, it looks like the middle and ring fingers are being used to turn the pen.

368
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:36,280
Right?

369
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:42,130
Kang Yeo Joo was doing exactly that.

370
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,230
I think it's Kang Yeo Joo.

371
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:11,960
Sir, you can't sleep here.

372
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,200
Sir. Sir?

373
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,850
Sir! Are you okay?

374
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:18,010
Are you okay?

375
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:21,000

376
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,430

377
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:30,530
 He was found on the roadside. I think he was ignored because he looked drunk.

378
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:34,840
Let me know when he wakes up.

379
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,680
Yes, Doctor.

380
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,150
Did I tell her about Baek Soo Jeong last night?

381
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,550
 It was an accident.

382
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:41,020
 Get out right now!

383
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:46,680
 But we're on the highway! How can I get out?

384
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:17,270
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

385
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:19,370
Who are you?

386
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:22,770
Oh, I'm Writer Kang's assistant.

387
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:25,260
Right, I was told about you.

388
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,310
 He's randomly good-looking. Did she pick him for his looks?

389
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,770
 And why is he so well-proportioned?

390
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,650
 Why when I'm looking my worst...

391
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:49,560
 He just got up, but he's so stylish.

392
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,440
 And what's up with that natural and decadent aura?

393
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:27,390
Attorney, Sir, you just got up?

394
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:32,260
Yes. Could you make me some hangover soup?

395
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:43,450
Honey, do you want some coffee?

396
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,500
She won't even speak to me.

397
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:08,340
Think of yourself as lucky. At least she didn't kick you out.

398
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:12,500
I thought you'd at least be in a cast.

399
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:16,400
If I told her, there's no way she'd let it go like this.

400
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,880
You said she was really angry.

401
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:23,560
I feel like I did tell her I cheated...

402
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:27,560
But... I can't seem to really remember...

403
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,630
Drink this and wake up.

404
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:36,860
You're going to ruin our business at this rate. Let's work already.

405
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,780
Right, we have a trial today!

406
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:46,100
It's a female judge. I'm sure going in there stinking of alcohol will really win her over!

407
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,270
Drink it up and come in quickly.

408
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:08,450
Yes. This is Attorney Han Woo Seong.

409
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:14,520
 Hello. I'm the student who was riding in the ambulance with you yesterday.

410
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,880
Ambulance?

411
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,750
At the Han River?

412
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,680
Yes.

413
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:32,830
I'm indebted to you, and I didn't get a chance to thank you.

414
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:35,040
It's all right.

415
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,080
I heard you had my bag...

416
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,820
Oh, that plastic bag?

417
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:43,560
I asked at the hospital, and they told me you took it with you.

418
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,450
You have it, right?

419
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:48,590
I took it because I was afraid someone would throw it away.

420
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:51,630
After the trial's over, I'll bring it to...

421
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,720
Trying to make a move again...

422
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,460
Pardon?

423
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:02,080
Nothing, nothing. Should I send it over by courier?

424
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:05,510
If you leave it with your assistant, I'll come and pick it up.

425
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:07,400
I know where your office is.

426
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:11,070
Okay. Then I'll leave it with my assistant.

427
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:13,920
Okay.

428
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:25,540
Wait a minute. Where did I put that plastic bag?

429
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,130
Plastic? I threw it away.

430
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:34,550
 Why would you throw it away? Someone is looking for it.

431
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:38,150
Never mind that. Where would you use that thing?

432
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:42,330
 You can buy a bag anywhere these days for so cheap!

433
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:46,050
 Who carries around that kind of a plastic bag these days?

434
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,820
It's a student, so she doesn't have any money.

435
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:53,460
She seemed like a student who barely makes money for school with a part-time job.

436
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,430
 Then why don't you buy her a new bag?

437
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:58,670
 He's looking for the plastic bag?

438
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,830
I guess he can't remember anything.

439
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:04,430

440
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,060
Just apologize for everything!

441
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:14,380
I can't apologize if I can't remember what I told her!

442
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:21,160
Why are you taking it out on me! Don't hold back!

443
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:25,280
Fight! Sue her like the attorney you are!

444
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,240
Is the plaintiff's attorney present?

445
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:32,260
Yes, I'm Attorney Han Woo Seong.

446
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:00,860
What is this smell?

447
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,660
It's been cleaned up.

448
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:59,060

449
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:02,210
Where did she put all the books?

450
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:19,110
 I'm sure it's a book that's been published before.

451
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:24,760
Try and find it right away.

452
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,120
What are you trying to find right away?

453
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,510
Materials. Materials.

454
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:49,900
I mean, a junior colleague of mine is well-educated in that area,

455
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,320
so I asked him to help me.

456
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:59,330
You were suspicious from the start. I felt like you were hiding something.

457
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:00,990
 Did she catch on?

458
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:05,930
Acting like you're working hard searching for materials in front of me,

459
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:13,260
but in the end, you made your junior colleague do it instead.

460
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:24,420
I hired you as my assistant, not your junior colleague.

461
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,590
I'm sorry.

462
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:45,390
You have an expression of someone who's just caught his assistant doing something extremely wrong.

463
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:48,120
It's upside down!

464
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,950
Geon (heaven) and Gam (moon) are on top!

465
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:51,870
Like this!

466
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:55,490
Really?

467
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:00,600
Are you sure you're a writer? How do you not know something so basic?

468
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,640
Are you usually unable to control your anger?

469
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,180
How can I not be angry?

470
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:07,510
Don't you know what we had to do to protect this flag during the Japanese colonial era?

471
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:10,700
While waving this flag, by the knife of the Japanese...

472
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,780
What a patriot.

473
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:37,870
But it's not Foundation Day or Korean Proclamation Day.

474
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:40,700
I don't think it's a national holiday.

475
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:43,190
Police Day?

476
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:44,730
Local government day?

477
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:46,120
Dokdo Day.

478
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,830
I don't think that's it either.

479
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:51,030
It's our wedding anniversary.

480
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:55,990
- Pardon? 
 - It's more important to me than a national holiday.

481
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:08,330
You can relax. She's putting up the flag.

482
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:15,470
I guess if she's thinking about our wedding anniversary, I didn't make a huge mistake.

483
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:18,260
Did something happen?

484
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:20,810
I think so, but I can't remember.

485
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:23,120
Should I try to find out for you?

486
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,500
 Auntie!

487
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,450
Let's hang up! Yes?

488
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:31,290
Do you know what solution cleans leather?

489
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:32,690
What leather?

490
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:34,810
My leather car seat.

491
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:40,290
I need to get the smell out, too. Isn't there a good air freshener or something?

492
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:42,440
I can never drive it the way it is right now.

493
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,860
What happened to the seat?

494
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:46,750
What smell is that exactly?

495
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,720
You're talking about it like you've smelled it. Were you in my car?

496
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:59,320
I did, last week. When we went to the publishing house.

497
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:05,010
That was a good smell. A new leather smell. What it's like now is

498
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:09,050
the smell of vomit when you grind down alcohol and food together and ferment it.

499
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:15,560
 It's only been two weeks since I changed the seat covers!

500
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,940
 Sorry.

501
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,490
 Give me a plastic bag.

502
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:30,260
 How can you do this on the highway?! Try and hold it in!

503
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,290
 Well, it's just that...

504
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:39,040
 Sorry. It was an accident.

505
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,440
 Get out right now!

506
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,460
 We're on the highway. How can I get out?

507
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,430
Oh, but that's expensive.

508
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:02,670
This is more expensive.

509
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:06,460
What are you talking about? If you go to the market, there are tons of these bags.

510
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:10,400
Not just any bag, it's a limited edition from the last fall/winter collection.

511
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,220
Also, this bag. It's about ₩1,500,000 ($1,500)?

512
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:16,560
It should be over ₩2,000,000 ($2,000) by now.

513
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,090
This old thing?

514
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:21,500
Vintage Chanel. The price goes up every year.

515
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:26,560
And yet Attorney Han threw up on this very expensive bag.

516
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:34,130
My world... Do people spend money on these things?

517
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:36,890
I feel lightheaded from the smell.

518
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:57,460
I thought we weren't going to see each other again.

519
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,810
I was hoping for that, too, but...

520
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:04,660
We need you to come to the station with us.

521
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,290
₩450,000 ($450)...

522
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:27,390
Maybe it's too expensive and will feel burdensome...

523
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:33,950
Do you have any backpacks that college students might like?

524
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:36,210
This is a set of five items.

525
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:40,670
If you buy this, you get a pouch worth 10,000 won.

526
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:44,530
- This is nice. Give me this, please. 
 - Sure.

527
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:46,390
It's cute.

528
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,540
What? What's that?

529
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:56,430
It's not my birthday or my wedding anniversary. What is it?

530
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:58,400
She'll come to pick it up. Give it to her.

531
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,470
Tell her not to feel burdened. It's a thank you gift.

532
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:03,070
A girl?

533
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:05,800
- It's not like that. 
 - Then what is it?

534
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:10,460
It's not like that, I said! How can I do that right now with my head so frazzled?

535
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:16,950
It is a woman. That bastard.

536
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:21,870
Doctor, the patient has regained consciousness!

537
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:23,520
Oh, really?

538
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,300
Where is the patient?

539
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:56,560

540
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,410
Don't you have any green tea?

541
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:34,570
All right. We do have it.

542
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:44,940
Baek Soo Jeong used to be every man's fantasy.

543
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:49,980
Attorney Han's generation is like that. Even that punk, too. No more explanation is necessary.

544
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:54,040
Are you telling me to be suspicious of my husband and Baek Soo Jeong's relationship?

545
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:59,610
Isn't that... what you're already suspicious of?

546
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:08,510

547
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:11,470
I keep getting a call.

548
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:12,450

549
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:14,940
031?

550
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:17,770
What's the matter? You're not answering it?

551
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:19,770
I don't know this number.

552
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:22,620
- Go do well. 
 - Okay.

553
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:39,030
You're questioning me as a reference witness, right?

554
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:42,240
And I have no obligation to answer.

555
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:45,550
You asked if I suspected my husband.

556
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:47,960
Why? Do you want to answer?

557
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:51,020
I'm curious about many things in this case, too.

558
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:55,140
Let's take turns asking questions.

559
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:01,270
When I saw the photo, I could definitely tell.

560
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:07,420
The angle was... one-sided.

561
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:10,460
That Baek Soo Jeong was the only one interested?

562
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:15,090
You met PD Nam in the morning. What did he say?

563
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:22,270
 It was one-sided. For Soo Jeong.

564
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:26,120
 You could say... she was pushing herself on him.

565
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,460
It's my turn now.

566
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:33,830
Did you find any blood on the trophy?

567
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:37,650
Yes.

568
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:44,210
Now, it's our turn to ask.

569
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,690
Did you meet with Baek Soo Jeong?

570
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:49,830
I invited her to my house for dinner.

571
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:53,630
I was wondering why my husband was so uncomfortable...

572
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:02,330
Now that I think about it... I understand.

573
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:06,300
That's it, right? You didn't meet her again?

574
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:08,210
I can't remember.

575
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:35,110
 The person you're calling is not available, and...

576
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:46,060
Great job today.

577
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:48,450
Did it go well?

578
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:51,470
It's one obstacle after another.

579
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:54,320
I keep getting a call.

580
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,870
It's the same number.

581
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:59,970
Just answer it. Seeing how they keep calling, it doesn't seem like a sales call.

582
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:02,250
It could be urgent.

583
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:05,630
Wait. Hold on.

584
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:07,460
Hello?

585
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,380
Attorney Han Woo Seong?

586
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:14,390
Yes. Who is this?

587
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:16,680
Did you forget me already?

588
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:21,320
Mr. Property Manager?

589
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:26,500
You killed her, didn't you? Baek Soo Jeong.

590
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:32,140
You ordered him to kill me too, didn't you?

591
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:35,290
Do you think I would fall that easily?!

592
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:41,440
I'm going to tell the police everything! You just wait.

593
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,590
It's over for you.

594
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:53,850

595
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:58,860

596
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:07,170
♫  Feel my cold gaze.  I'm never gonna love again  ♫

597
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:15,220
♫  Try playing around with those lips again.  
I'm never gonna love again  ♫

598
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:19,760
♫  Sweet temptation like sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

599
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,220
♫  You melt sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

600
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:23,630
 I'm going to tell the police first.

601
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:25,180
 You have to help me now!

602
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:26,920
 The USB in my drawer, too?

603
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:30,190
 There's a chance the blood isn't from the victim but the assailant.

604
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:31,660
  You're type A too, aren't you?

605
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:34,750
 I've never been so angry that I'd kill Baek Soo Jeong.

606
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:37,690
 I was meeting someone without you knowing.

607
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:39,920
 I had suspected.

608
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,190
 Marital life is hell. If there's no trust between the couple.

609
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:45,780
 I found it! Is Attorney Han on the suspect list, too?

610
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,400
 Who said that?

611
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,960
 Then, what did you do with it?

612
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,130
 Are you saying Baek Soo Jeong's body was kept inside a kimchi fridge?

613
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:56,900
 It's big enough for an adult body to fit into.
