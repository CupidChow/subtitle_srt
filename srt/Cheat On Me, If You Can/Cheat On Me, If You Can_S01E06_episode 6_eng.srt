1
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,790

2
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,290
 Why isn't he coming? Try calling him.

3
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,140

4
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,980
 Wait. Where's my cell phone?

5
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,460

6
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,710

7
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,420
 The call cannot be completed...

8
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,650
 Ah, damn!  Did I ask for too little?

9
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,120
 He's an attorney so he should have a lot of money...

10
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,920
 I should've asked for 100,000,000 won ($100,000).

11
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,540
Geez...

12
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:16,320
 He must be stressing out because I'm not showing up.

13
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,850
 Ah, damn!  What is this?

14
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:35,820

15
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,610
 You ordered him to kill me, too. Didn't you?

16
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,500
I am going to tell everything to the cops.

17
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,260
You just wait.  It's over for you.

18
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,250
Hey, what did he say?

19
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,620
- It seems that he became a little strange. 
 - What is it?

20
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,850
He asked if I killed Baek Soo Jeong.

21
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,470
What?

22
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:19,000
He seems to be worse than I thought.  Isn't he trying to pull something to get more money?

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's not going to work because I will tell the cops first.

24
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,500
Why did you meet Miss Baek Soo Jeong?

25
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,870
We just... had a cup of tea.

26
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:02,490
In the middle of the night... you just had a cup of tea?

27
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,420
A bit of counseling about some worrisome matter, as well.

28
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,550
What kind of worrisome matter was it? To be specific.

29
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,700
Ah, I can't even remember what I did yesterday—

30
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,030
Please take your time and think.

31
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,780
We have plenty of time.

32
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:40,080
If you tell the cops, your wife will hear about it as well.  What are you going to do then?

33
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,460
Ah, I don't know.  I'll tell my wife about it today.

34
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,660
I think it was about the dress for the award ceremony.

35
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,170
I gave her some advice since she has an issue with indecisiveness.

36
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:30,510
I have eyes for that kind of thing.

37
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,190
What, the dress?

38
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,490
Look, Mrs Kang Yeo Joo!  Are you playing games with us?

39
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,960
Okay, it's my turn. Right?

40
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,880
The blood that was on the trophy, whose is it?

41
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,680
The result of DNA analysis will take at least one week—

42
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,640
You know the blood type at least, right?

43
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,610
It's type A.

44
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,830
And for reference, Baek Soo Jeong had blood type B.

45
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:57,630
It's possible that it's the blood of the assailant, not the victim.

46
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,810
Perhaps, does the manager have blood type A?

47
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,640
Mrs Kang Yeo Joo, you have type A blood as well, don't you?

48
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,230
Customer, are you all right?

49
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,640
Shouldn't you go to a hospital?

50
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,780
Mind your own business,

51
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,710
and just concentrate on driving!

52
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,340
Because I have type A blood, are you suspecting I'm the culprit?

53
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,950
40% of the world's population has blood type A, though.

54
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,640
Let's just say that we're imagining it, not suspecting—

55
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,910
Ah, it's the worst imagination.

56
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:17,180
In your novel, you wrote as though you've killed someone before.

57
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,950
Because I'm the best in this field.

58
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:23,350
And because of that, I would not have left any evidence.

59
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,280
Looks like this case will remain unsolved.

60
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,660
The police will not just sit back and do nothing.

61
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,240
That's why it's the worst.

62
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,360
How badly would I feel if I were the culprit? Watching the police diligently investigating?

63
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,140
Look, Mrs Kang Yeo Joo...

64
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,270
Hey, you are too emotional.

65
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:53,000
We'll soon get the attorney's fee, so with that money—

66
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,940
Since Soo Jeong is dead, hiding the CCTV footage is tampering with the evidence.

67
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,160
Even if the judge looks the other way, it's a crime of concealment.

68
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,520
Is this your professional conscience?

69
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,690
It's conscience as a human.

70
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,050
If it's a wedding anniversary, how about something like this?

71
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,230
Wow, you will get hurt if you get hit with this.

72
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,330
Do you have anything else?

73
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:43,520
Something without thorns, and something fluffy, delicate and feeble...

74
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,130
You even wrote that Physical Injury Waiver, didn't you?

75
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,220
I shouldn't have gotten it notarized.

76
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,190
This is the most popular model these days.  You can touch it.

77
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,720
How heavy is this?

78
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,470
Please give me something that might break if you pull lightly on it.

79
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,720
Yes. I understand.

80
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,230
Something like a thin chain necklace...

81
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,690
Ah, would she kill you or something?  It's your wedding anniversary after all.

82
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,090
What is my motive for murder that you two are imagining?

83
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:45,080
I've never been angry enough to kill Baek Soo Jeong...

84
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,240
If your husband... had an affair with Baek Soo Jeong...

85
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,480
would you be angry?

86
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:59,040
If he had asked for a divorce, you would have been even angrier.

87
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,880
 I happened to overhear by chance, so I am not sure of the full conversation

88
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,730
 but I am sure that they talked about divorce.

89
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,420
Divorce?

90
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:15,830
You write fiction better than I do.

91
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,760
He only has eyes for me to the point of being almost annoying.

92
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,380
You know, "Nation's Husband"?

93
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,700
Do you really... trust your husband?

94
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,390
You're not married yet, are you?

95
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:36,680
Married life is hell... if there's no trust between the couple.

96
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,060
Isn't that right, Detective?

97
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,860
It seems that you were expecting a morning soap opera kind of story, but I am sorry to disappoint you.

98
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,160
I have a date with my husband, so...

99
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,870
Honey... I am really sorry.  I had too much to drink yesterday...

100
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,160

101
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,560
What do you think of that couple?

102
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,770
Despicable. He's making such a big fuss.

103
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,310
  Soo Jeongie...

104
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,240
He said "Soo Jeongie," no doubt. 
 (T/N: Calling someone, Soo Jeongie or Woo Hyunnie, is a type of endearment.)

105
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,690
Not Baek Soo Jeong... Not even Miss Soo Jeong...

106
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:15,960
- What is it? 
 - Han Woo Seong... Isn't he considered handsome?

107
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,020
It's because he's wearing a suit. His face isn't less handsome than the average.

108
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,630
How do you think he'll look with a sweatshirt on?

109
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,480
A sweatshirt?

110
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:33,770
  The door to apartment 1820 opened and a man came out.

111
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,320
  He was wearing that sweatshirt.

112
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,200
He went in through the front door of the convenience store...

113
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,260
and came out the back door, that good-looking, sweatshirt guy.

114
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:46,870
Good looking? Yeah, right. Why didn't I think of this?

115
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,370
He's probably caught on the convenience store security camera.

116
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,010
We already watched it through.

117
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,190
We didn't think of Han Woo Seong then.

118
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,500
Six cameras at the convenience store, multiply by 24 hours, multiply by seven days in a week...

119
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,490
Jeez, do we have to watch that boring thing again?

120
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,330
- Yeah. Let's get a room. 
 - Damn...

121
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,170
Thank you.

122
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,340
Here.

123
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,620
Happy anniversary.

124
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,130
Happy anniversary, Honey.

125
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,820
Honey.

126
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,880
There is...

127
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,300
You're making a face like you did something wrong.

128
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,260
  Should I get on my knees?

129
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,940
If it's really serious, don't tell me.

130
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,150
This place is a little... dangerous.

131
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,970
Honey, there's a security camera here.

132
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:01,300
That's why it's dangerous. There'll be evidence.

133
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,820
I don't know if you'll like this or not...

134
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,930
Ta-da.

135
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:19,260
Thick necklace chains are the trend this year.

136
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,030
Next year, as a countertrend,

137
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:27,450
I heard that thin chains that look like they're about to break will be popular.

138
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,770
- Really? 
 - Yes.

139
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,320
  To lighten up the mood...

140
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,820
Honey, do you remember our first kiss? It was here.

141
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,380
Was it?

142
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,730
That day, we got into a fight and almost broke up.

143
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,050

144
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:57,870
I don't know anything about you besides your name, Kang Yeo Joo!

145
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,380
Is it so wrong to ask about your family?

146
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,500
To the point of breaking up?

147
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,480
Break up?

148
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,830
Are we even in a relationship?

149
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,990
I'm just saying, let's not see each other moving forward.

150
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,650
Wow.

151
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,530
Seriously, wow.

152
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:11,040
  I thought we were going to break up.

153
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,690
  I actually made up my mind then.

154
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,600
  To not ask you any more questions.

155
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,410
  No matter who your parents were or how you'd lived.

156
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:32,690
  I just... wanted to hold your hand.

157
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,610
♫   We're here   ♫

158
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,930
♫   We're here now   ♫

159
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:42,050
♫   Between you and me, maybe   ♫

160
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:46,140

161
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,600
♫   Today goes by   ♫

162
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,790
♫   With no worries   ♫

163
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,880
♫   By your side   ♫

164
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,760
♫   At times, I was   ♫

165
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,310
♫   Afraid we'll grow distant   ♫

166
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:08,300
♫   Near but from far   ♫

167
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:13,660
♫   I just stood there holding your hand   ♫

168
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:20,730
♫   As if a memory of the missing part was scattered   ♫

169
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,380
♫   It's all forgotten   ♫

170
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,880
♫   Leaning on the faint sight again   ♫

171

180
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:59,290
Is there something here to break up now?

181
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:02,600
♫   I won't let go anymore   ♫

182

♫   Let me listen to your whisper   ♫

188
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,580
♫   Today passes by   ♫

189
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,730
♫   With no worries   ♫

190
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:32,780
♫   By your side   ♫

191
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,500
We're happy, right?

192
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,220
I'm happy. Aren't you?

193
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:57,500
Sometimes, I feel unsure. Whether this is happiness or...

194
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,290
Why?

195
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,990
I wonder if it's because we don't have children.

196
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:16,520
Should we have one? A child?

197
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,690
Are you serious?

198
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,010
Thank you, Honey!

199
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:37,300
I felt the most envious towards fathers.

200
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,280
Are you sure you're confident about raising a baby?

201
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,310
Of course. Babies these days are raised by their dads.

202
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:51,220
It's a lot of work raising a child. You just focus on your projects.

203
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:55,220
Leave all the parenting to me!

204
00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:01,400
But... I can't make one by myself.

205
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,330
I'll cooperate with you on that.

206
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,010
Speaking of which... Here?

207
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,190
Can't you see the security camera?

208
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,490
Then... let's get home fast.

209
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:27,450
Didn't you have something to say? You looked like you did.

210
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,670
Oh...

211
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,670
I don't think I'll be home tonight.

212
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:42,850
What do you mean am I going out, you know it's for work.

213
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:48,030
I know! I didn't forget, tomorrow is your...

214
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,580
Our anniversary! I know, how could I forget.

215
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,270
I'll be home tomorrow.

216
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,290
Hey, your turn.

217
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,650
No, it's... What do you mean you heard a female voice.

218
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:06,830
It's the sergeant. Hey, Sergeant Kwak!

219
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:11,400
Yeah, yeah. We're at a motel. I have to go, I'll call you!

220
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,470
- I told you to be careful. 
 - Sorry.

221
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,820
Just go home, I'll watch it all.

222
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:21,160
Hey. How can I go home trusting you? You're not good at anything.

223
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,010
This is mine. That's yours.

224
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,720
What do you think you're doing?

225
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,520
Why do you get the bed?

226
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,670
My back hurts.

227
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,490
My back hurts, too!

228
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,760
Mine hurts...

229
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,580
more than yours!

230
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:43,400
I also take up a lot of space.

231
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,940
This is...

232
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,420
enough space.

233
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,140
You can be here.

234
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,990
Here's good, too. Can I have a pillow?

235
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,000
Right, a pillow.

236
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,360
Talk now.

237
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:21,390
I'll forgive everything.

238
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,780
- Everything? 
 - Mhm.

239
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,000
Everything.

240
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:37,390
That... That is...

241
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:43,470
I... Without you knowing...

242
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,620
I was seeing someone.

243
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:53,680
It... It wasn't anything serious.

244
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,740
- It was casual... 
 - I had suspected.

245
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,750
I found him.

246
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,750
Let's see.

247
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,930
That's him.

248
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:37,870
No wonder he was being so good to his wife.

249
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,970
Because he's guilty about something, right?

250
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,960
Is Han Woo Seong on the list of suspects now?

251
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,310
Of course!

252
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,870
I'm sorry.

253
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,570
Why are you being so dramatic?

254
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:10,230
But... how did you know?

255
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:18,950
When I ran into Nam Gi Ryong, I was sure.

256
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,530
That you were meeting politicians without me knowing.

257
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:34,470
- Honey, that's not what I... 
 - Stop making a fuss and get up.

258
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:37,990
That's not...

259
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:44,730
You won't do that anymore, right? Politics?

260
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,350
Y-Y-Yeah... No.

261
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:50,550
I won't do it anymore.

262
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:54,780
But... That's not what I was saying...

263
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,990
Did he cheat on her with Baek Soo Jeong?

264
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:04,560
I'm getting a hunch. It's just like the Cafe Moon incident.

265
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,770
Like when the cafe owner's and the customer's eyes met—

266
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,360
- And he was beaten to death by a frying pan! 
 - Yeah!

267
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,140
I heard that the owner kept threatening him to get a divorce.

268
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:14,670
Exactly! This is 100% Han Woo Seong as the culprit.

269
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:19,650
It's Kang Yeo Joo! Do you remember the Eunpyeong-dong incident?

270
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:23,030
She looked for and killed the woman who her husband cheated on her with and buried her in their water tank.

271
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,690
She even poured cement over her!

272
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:27,520
Well, it's suspicious that Kang Yeo Joo is participating in the investigation.

273
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,820
That's what I'm saying!

274
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,980
Let's have a scientific investigation.

275
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,320
Right? Detectives need to speak with evidence.

276
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,980
Oh! What happened with Baek Soo Jeong's manager?

277
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,820
- Nothing yet... 
 - Ban him from leaving the country!

278
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:49,140
Only if the prosecutor approves it! It's not like the trophy came up with Baek Soo Jeong's DNA...

279
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,790
Just catch him first! Everything comes out when we torture them.

280
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,430
This isn't the old days...

281
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:57,710
- What? 
 - I'm going.

282
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,110
Thank you.

283
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,510
That little...

284
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,630
Team Leader, I said it.

285
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,180
What are you two doing?

286
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,810
- I told you that Kang Yeo Joo wasn't allowed. 
 - We're leaving.

287
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:07,760
- Hurry up and leave! 
 - Hurry up!

288
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,400
They're no help. No help.

289
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:16,360
What? A confession to cheating?

290
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,770
It's craziness. Craziness.

291
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,400
But it's better than finding out from someone else...

292
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,940
It should've stayed hidden by keeping mouths shut!

293
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,170
Still, can't you take that into consideration?

294
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:34,910
What's worse than cheating is having the audacity to confess!

295
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,490
Those guys all have to go to prison.

296
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:43,260
I don't feel like it's being audacious. I feel like it's very regretful and remorseful...

297
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:55,780
But who is this story about? It's not one of your juniors, right?

298
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:03,000
You thought I wouldn't know?

299
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,780
This is about Jin Ho.

300
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:33,750
We're probably the only ones to hoist the flag on an anniversary.

301
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:38,170
Today's like National Foundation Day for me.

302
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:43,010
The day I was born as a completely different person.

303
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,230
I'll take it down now.

304
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:56,840
 In front of the proud Taegeukgi,

305
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:02,120
 I'm burying my involvement with Baek Soo Jeong for forever.

306
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,840
 For the sake of my family's happiness.

307
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:23,680
Sir! Sir!

308
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,660
Property Manager! Are you hurt?

309
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,090
Pay him and send him off.

310
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,220
What?

311
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,270
Sir! Aren't you paying for the taxi? Geez, really.

312
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,960
How much is it?

313
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,380

314
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,230
Property Manager!

315
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,740
Where's all my stuff?

316
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,820
Why?

317
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:24,630
Your wife asked us to get all your items and send them to her, so I sent them to her.

318
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,890
Even the USB in my drawer?

319
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,840
I sent it all.

320
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:36,430
He was two steps ahead of me! He was two steps ahead of me!

321
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,860
I heard that you were quitting, Sir.

322
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:42,460
He saw my wife calling the office!

323
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:46,500
Manager! What's wrong?

324
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,530
Are you okay? Should I call for an ambulance?

325
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:51,900
What?

326
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,820
Call the police...

327
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,010
Manager!

328
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:58,000
Manager! What's wrong?

329
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,640
Manager!

330
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,590
Manager! Stay with me! What do I do?

331
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,720
What are you doing at my house?

332
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,910
- Chief Ma— 
 - What does Chief Ma want?

333
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:19,920
He said to report on what you're doing, but I don't have anything.

334
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,720
You're not even answering your phone.

335
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,090
So you're here to watch me?

336
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,250
Anyway, I have to give him a report.

337
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,970
Piss off.

338
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,800
Your house is amazing.

339
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,590
I'm still in a one-bedroom.

340
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,050
You're so shameless in your surveillance.

341
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,970
Do you like fried chicken?

342
00:29:54,970 --> 00:30:00,230
Save it. Take your shoes off before coming in.

343
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,620
You're really not going to eat?

344
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,800
I found something while analyzing the CCTV footage.

345
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,910
Attorney Han Woo Seong is an interesting guy.

346
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,900
Han Woo Seong was seen on the convenience store's CCTV footage.

347
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:02,060
Every Monday and Wednesday, he bought water at the store in Baek Soo Jeong's building.

348
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,300
Was he thirsty while jogging?

349
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,530
But it always takes him an hour and a half to buy water.

350
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,860
He was having an affair.

351
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:22,720
And very intelligently at that.

352
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,730
What? Did you leave something behind?

353
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:53,970
I forgot I left the laundry in the machine. They must all be wrinkled.

354
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:56,290
I'm so scatterbrained these days.

355
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:59,130
You can just wash them again tomorrow.

356
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:01,880
No, I can't do that. They'll smell.

357
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:12,910
Damn... Terrible bastard.

358
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:18,100
Kang Yeo Joo even raised the flag for their anniversary.

359
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:22,560
Can't men cheat, though?

360
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:27,000
That's disrespecting men. Men have principles and beliefs, too!

361
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,740
Why get married if you're going to cheat?

362
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,100
That's true.

363
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,070
Yes, Writer.

364
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:44,280
Is it possible for a woman to strangle a man?

365
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,230
The neck is thicker than two hands.

366
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:52,090
I see. It's not the size of the hands but the muscle strength.

367
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:58,030
But if your hands are weak, is it impossible to put enough pressure on the artery?

368
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:02,630
Why would you use your hands when you can use a clothes-line?

369
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:07,570
Rather than putting pressure on the artery,

370
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:13,030
it'll be quicker to kill by cartilage fracture since that would close the airway.

371
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:17,430
If you're lucky, his heart could stop, too.

372
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:20,090
Parasympathetic nervousness?

373
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:23,030
Then, he could die from shock?

374
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,810
Okay.

375
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,710
No way...

376
00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:00,040
She didn't strangle her husband to death, did she?

377
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,890
Is the seasoning good?

378
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:07,140
Yeah. It's perfect.

379
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,830
Good.

380
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:16,700
You found the fountain pen.

381
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,340
Oh, this?

382
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:24,510
 A male student. He was big. A wrestler.

383
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:27,290
A wrestling athlete found it for me.

384
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:31,150
Anyway, I'm glad.

385
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:34,220
I was a little sad when you said you lost it.

386
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:38,280
You gave it to me. How could I lose it?

387
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,000
When I die, I'm going to take it with me to my grave.

388
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,650
Are you busy right now?

389
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,930
I have to get to... work.

390
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,640
I just need a moment.

391
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,290
Really?

392
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,700
Good morning!

393
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,340
Honey, I'll be back.

394
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,100
Bye.

395
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,860
Why are you here so early?

396
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,440
You told me not to be late.

397
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,810
But don't show up early either.

398
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:22,120
Wait!  Is she pretending not to know or...

399
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,340
is she acting like that because she really doesn't know?

400
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,800
You're leaving for work now? Why are you taking this car?

401
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,500
I decided to take this car until the smell goes away.

402
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:44,360
It does smell seriously bad.

403
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,770
Did you make up? She was really angry.

404
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:53,180
Oh, yesterday was our anniversary, so I got forgiven pretty quickly.

405
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:57,490
Wow, it's unlike her to be so generous!

406
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:02,380
- Well, stop drinking so much from now on. 
 - Yes, I will.

407
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:05,360
- Goodbye, then. 
 - I'll be going.

408
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:15,860
Woo Seong.

409
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:18,720
Someone's here to see you.

410
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:49,040
I know it's an important event,

411
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,960
but from now on... I've decided...

412
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,120
not to get involved in politics.

413
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:04,280
Sorry. You helped me so much... I apologize.

414
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:09,260
Is there a problem? For example...

415
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,330
An extramarital affair?

416
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:23,460
Oh, it's not that.

417
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,200
Well, I understand. I'll leave for now.

418
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,170
Thank you for everything.

419
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,610
Hold back your final goodbyes.

420
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:47,190
You never know if you'll need me for something.

421
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:51,230
- Thank you for offering. 
 - I'm an expert in police matters.

422
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:56,110
Whatever the problem, I'll resolve it for you.

423
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:59,020
Police matters?

424
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:04,880
 I'll tell the police everything! You wait, it's over for you!

425
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:12,110
I mean that as an example.

426
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:30,430
Is the preparation for the event going well?

427
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:36,410
Cancel? No, please proceed as planned.

428
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:38,590
Attorney Han Woo Seong...

429
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:42,490
will definitely be showing up.

430
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:54,710
Why was Baek Soo Jeong's DNA found here?

431
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:06,920
A female body is possible. An adult can definitely fit in it.

432
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:15,870
Then, you're saying her body was stored in the kimchi fridge?

433
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,590
What is it?

434
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:26,740
 She was probably trying to keep it from decomposing since she had little time to take care of the corpse.

435
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,490
And then what?

436
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,110
 She moved it to the cemetery.

437
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:42,160
Didn't you say the body was found at the Han River?

438
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:47,560
 No, the body was definitely buried there.

439
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:51,190
Second Lieutenant Hunter didn't make a mistake.

440
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:53,620
Who?

441
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,730
You don't need to know.

442
00:40:55,730 --> 00:41:00,010
Anyway, Baek Soo Jeong's body was moved later.

443
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:02,080
To the Han River.

444
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:21,880
Burying her in the cemetery and digging it back up again... Moving a body is not some child's play, you know?

445
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,030
It means they knew.

446
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:26,850
That I would find Baek Soo Jeong's body.

447
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:29,400
What? How?

448
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:37,030
 This person keeps making issues bigger...

449
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:40,980
I'm sure there's a relation.

450
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:44,210
Internally...

451
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:47,810
Internally?

452
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:54,540
This is addictive. There's a reason Kang Yeo Joo only eats this.

453
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,750
I don't think it's that good.

454
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:03,820
I don't know about rapport building. I think she won you over. Your sense of taste has become strange, too.

455
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:08,190
But... why are you following me again?

456
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:10,410
I'm walking you back.

457
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:13,960
It's a dangerous world, after all.

458
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,560
What's your true identity?

459
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,760
Are you siding with Chief Ma or with me?

460
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,090
I'm not siding with anyone.

461
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:25,190
Whoever it is, I just do my best.

462
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:28,690
Whether it's Chief or you.

463
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:31,470
That's how our job is.

464
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:34,210
So you're not on my side, right?

465
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:36,560
Why? Should I be?

466
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:41,830
No, no. Side with Chief Ma.

467
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:44,010
You're not my type.

468
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:47,820
You're not mine either.

469
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,800
Sae Rom!

470
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,980
Mom!

471
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:34,030
Did you have fun? Did you go on the slide a lot?

472
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:36,820
Let's go.

473
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,220
I'm working. I can't talk for long.

474
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,440
I think he found out that the body was moved.

475
00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:04,350
Hey... You think he found out or he has found out? Report properly.

476
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:06,650
I'll find out for certain and report back.

477
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:08,600
Never mind.

478
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,940
I'll have to take care of it either way.

479
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:27,230
Sae Rom, should we go home and eat?

480
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:28,830
Yes!

481
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:24,990
Auntie. Auntie!

482
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:29,270
Did you really throw it away?

483
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:31,700
When did I throw it away?

484
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,360
Then, what did you do with it?

485
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:40,720
An elderly was picking up boxes, so I gave it away!

486
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,960
Which elderly?

487
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:52,140
Why? You want to get it back and use it again?

488
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:02,330
Are you really going to use it again?

489
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:08,830
Never mind. Never mind! Do whatever you want from now on!

490
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:11,970
I'll just leave and not see you again!

491
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:17,820
Auntie... I'm a writer.

492
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:24,360
I don't know anything about all that fancy stuff. My little kid, Kang Yeo Joo...

493
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:28,500
I've seen you since you were six. You're like my family.

494
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:34,020
I'll die before seeing you breakdown again!

495
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:40,360
It's not that I can't write because you threw that book away.

496
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,400
I have a file.

497
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,160
Really?

498
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,840
I'm too stupid, so I thought it'll all be over if I threw the book away.

499
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:54,000
You're so great, so you take care of everything then.

500
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:01,190
Even Kang Yeo Joo has someone she clings to...

501
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:07,010
- I am going to court.  I will be back. 
 - Hey, hey!

502
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,660
It's about Shim Moon Gi, right?

503
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:11,390
Yeah.

504
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:18,120
You're not taking the request document for child support?

505
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:24,480
If you were half as good at your job as you are in cheating, we would already be a huge law firm!

506
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,560
No more about the dark past. No more nagging either.

507
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,170
How could I not nag?

508
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:32,170
That's enough, Sir.

509
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:34,600
Goodbye!

510
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:54,930
Welcome!

511
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:02,800
Hello.

512
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:09,850
I came to get my bag. Attorney Han said he'd leave it here for me.

513
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:16,020
Oh, the owner... of the bag was you.

514
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,780
She must have stopped by to get her bag.

515
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:52,340
It's good enough that she got it.

516
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,670
Is she hurt?

517
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:02,000
Excuse me!

518
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:09,390
Sorry about the...

519
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:21,050
Sorry about the bag.

520
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:22,970
Do you like it?

521
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,950
Yes.

522
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:29,110
That's a relief.

523
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:31,540
Which way are you going? I'll give you a ride.

524
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:35,190
No, it's fine. There's a bus nearby.

525
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:38,960
You saved my life.

526
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,450
You really don't have to worry about me.

527
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:47,660
Please get in.

528
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:49,660
Sorry!

529
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:04,930
Thank you for giving me a ride.

530
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:06,830
We're going in the same direction.

531
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:10,960
But... why are you going to Cheongdam-dong?

532
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,060
For a part-time job.

533
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:24,070
I forgot to buy an air freshner.

534
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:26,090
Sorry. It smells a lot, right?

535
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:28,420
No, it's okay.

536
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:36,030
There should be a perfume in here somewhere.

537
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:39,360
I have some.

538
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,200
It-It's got a nice scent.

539
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:05,880
You work here?

540
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,790
Yes.

541
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:13,340
You're hurt though. Wouldn't it be better to take a break?

542
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:18,430
I could lose my job. I can't go to school then.

543
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:27,990
Do you want me to find you another place to work?

544
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:33,360
Do I... look poor?

545
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:38,570
Oh, tha-that's not what I meant.

546
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:42,390
Sorry, if I hurt your pride.

547
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:44,930
It's not that, but...

548
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:48,300
I'm embarrassed.

549
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:54,100
I... got to go to school comfortably thanks to my parents.

550
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:55,940
Thank you for the ride.

551
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:58,430
It's okay. Don't mention it.

552
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:01,600
Goodbye.

553
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:20,130
It's nice to see you living so diligently! Fighting!

554
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:21,310
Thank you.

555
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:23,190
Good luck!

556
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:41,820
♫  Time stood still  ♫

557
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:47,930
♫  when I saw you  ♫

558
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:00,560
Let's wash in the morning, huh?

559
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,760
Then, are you letting me go home at night?

560
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,990
Did you get anything on Han Woo Seong?

561
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:08,330
There wasn't much.

562
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:11,750
Do you know Bae Jeong Sik?

563
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:12,930
I don't.

564
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:16,170
He's the Property Manager of Baek Soo Jeong's building.

565
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:20,990
- He's a little bald and leaves work on the dot, right? 
 - Yeah.

566
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:22,910
He's at the hospital. Go and pay him a visit.

567
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:24,600
We're not that close.

568
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:29,790
Still, go pay him a visit! He claims that he knows who killed Baek Soo Jeong.

569
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:32,540
Wha—

570
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,250
Get up.

571
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:46,450
What is it?

572
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:50,260
We received a report. Someone knows who killed Baek Soo Jeong.

573
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:54,910
Someone knows? Who is it?

574
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:16,230
Should we change the heels for loafers?

575
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:21,230
No, people will talk again if I go looking like this.

576
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:50,530
Miss, you're going straight to the department store, right?

577
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:51,860
Yes.

578
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:53,610
All right.

579
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:55,760
Wait a minute!

580
00:56:57,730 --> 00:57:00,250
You left this behind.

581
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:05,740
This isn't hers. Throw it away.

582
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:07,630
Give it to me.

583

♫  ...saw you  ♫

586
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:50,160
 It's a little dusty...

587
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,720
Why is this here?

588
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:17,510
 You left this behind in room 7508 in the Sae Mirae Hall.

589
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:20,980
 It looked important, so I'm returning it to you.

590
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:42,310
Ambergris and citrus scent.

591
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:57,570

592
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:01,670

♫  You melt sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

597
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:28,920
 Please don't tell anyone. If it becomes a big deal, I can't attend school.

598
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:32,000
 There's someone who saw you coming out of Baek Soo Jeong's house.

599
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,230
 Killed Baek Soo Jeong and tried to kill me, too...

600
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:36,980
 - It's Han Woo Seong. 
 - Mr. Office Manager.

601
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:39,860
 Wasn't there an accomplice? What kind of woman? What did she look like?

602
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:41,970
 A prayer room hidden in some church.

603
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:46,740
 Because of a secret that can't get out, people kill and get killed.

604
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:48,010
 Secret Prayer Room?

605
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:51,000
 Why did you call? I told you not to unless you're in danger.

606
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,050
 If you want to live.

607
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:56,090
 The secret you wanted to take to your grave will soon be revealed.
