1
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,170

2
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,090
Excuse me, I'm a police officer and I'm looking for someone.

3
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,390
He has a round face and...

4
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,140
Never mind. It's okay.

5
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,910
Ah, Doctor!

6
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,540
- Ah, Doctor, it really stings. 
 - It's okay.

7
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,270
Ah, Detective Cha!

8
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,530
I was about to call you.

9
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,280
I was really scared to death.

10
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,510

11
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,340
 - Here it is, sweet and sour pork. 
 - Thank you.

12
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:07,080

13
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,800
 Please sit wherever you'd like.

14
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,890
 No!

15
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,560
 No, you can't!

16
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,160
 No! Please!

17
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,980
 Don't hit me!

18
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,480
 Don't hit me!

19
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,750
 Hey, get him up.

20
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,890
 Did he swallow the sweet and sour pork without even chewing?

21
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,940
 Hey, take him to the bathroom.

22
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,920
 Ah, so heavy!

23
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,170
I managed to escape

24
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,630
through the bathroom window.

25
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,560
Who are they?

26
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,710
I've never seen them before.

27
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:45,570
Wouldn't they probably be people from an errand center?

28
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,750
They seemed professional when beating me up.

29
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:56,100
You don't have any idea who hired them, either?

30
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,350
I do, but...

31
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,540
Who?

32
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,910
I'm not certain.

33
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,440
You detectives probably don't know her.

34
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,160
I only met her by chance, too.

35
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,580
A woman?

36
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,630
Do you know her name? Or...

37
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,460
perhaps, even just the last name...?

38
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,920
Kang...

39
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,080
Yeo Joo.

40
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,040
- Who? 
 - Kang Yeo Joo?

41
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,370
Kang Yeo Joo?

42
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,790
Sister-in-Law,

43
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,490
I know it's very easy for you to misunderstand this situation.

44
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,140
Please use cool rationality—

45
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,460
I'm not misunderstanding.

46
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,630
Ah, you are not.

47
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,400
Ho-Honey, wh-what happened is—

48
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,280
I know already.

49
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,150
The girl who was here brought that, right?

50
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:39,010
The same shoes that you wear, except for a bigger size.

51
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,050
Why? What's wrong?

52
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,040
I'm scared.

53
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,700
Yeah, but...

54
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,380
- There is a s-story— 
 - I'm getting bored already.

55
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,730
I said I know... without having to hear everything.

56
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,810
B-But, Honey, how did you know... her name?

57
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,850

58
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,380
 How can I help you?

59
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,330
 I have something to confirm, please.

60
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,080

61
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,410

62
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,480

63
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,320
 So, you are the one.

64
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,270
 Western painting major, class of '20, Go Mi Rae.

65
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:49,190
 We're following up on how satisfied they were with the lecture.

66
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:53,080
 Our attorney makes sure to record such feedback.

67
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,500
 Ah, I see.

68
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,730
How did I know?

69
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,970
Is that important now?

70
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,450
Please do not forget about the dinner plan.

71
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,120
Yes, sure.

72
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,780
We will discuss today's incident then.

73
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,380
With cool rationality.

74
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,980
Yes.

75
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,440
Goodbye.

76
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,560
How did she learn my name?

77
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,140
Is someone chasing after you or something?

78
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,440
Do I look like a person on the run?

79
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,280
You look like someone who committed a crime or something.

80
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,830
That's right. Why am I nervous?

81
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,450
I'm feeling self-conscious, sorry, and concerned.

82
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,770
The other person should be conscious of you and worried.

83
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,810
Don't you know your position?

84
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,080
What is... my position?

85
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,370
Miss, you can want anything and you can have anything.

86
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,820
Whether you buy it with money or take it away from someone.

87
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,380
Buy it...

88
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,310
or take it away from someone?

89
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,330
If I were in your position, I would live my life bossing people around to the fullest.

90
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,750

91
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:04,170
Erase all evidence that would throw suspicion on Kang Yeo Joo, right away.

92
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,500
Before the police find something.

93
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,190
Why are you protecting Kang Yeo Joo? Is she that important?

94
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,020
 Chief Ma knows Kang Yeo Joo the best, doesn't he?

95
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,020
 Hello?

96
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,410
 Why is Kang Yeo Joo communicating with Chief Ma?

97
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,340
It's not just surveillance.

98
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,740
The chief and Kang Yeo Joo.

99
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,220
It's more than that.

100
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,330
 You think you are really smart, don't you?

101
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:06,770
 You think that you are living a happy and great life, don't you?

102
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:11,730
 So... do I look pathetic?

103
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,220
 That happiness of yours...

104
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,050
 won't last long.

105
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,720
 Because I'll take it away from you.

106
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,440
Why did you make such a foolish choice?

107
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,830

108
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:48,430
By chance... are you Yeo Joo?

109
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,690
Park Yeo Joo?

110
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,350
What brings you here?

111
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,860
Are you in some kind of trouble these days?

112
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,450
Such as the police bothering you or something.

113
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,300
Let me know if you need my help.

114
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,750

115
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,290
 So you are Yeo Joo.

116
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,690

117
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,870
 Do you want my autograph?

118
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,460
Park Yeo Joo.

119
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,250
We have that much power at least.

120
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,430
I am Kang Yeo Joo.

121
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,830

122
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,270
She's still the same.

123
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,020
Are you all right?

124
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,530
Excuse me!  Would you like me to call the ambulance?

125
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,930
Are you all right?

126
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,500
What do you mean?

127
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,830
Is she not feeling well?

128
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,260
She looks sick.

129
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,360
Yeah.

130
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,610
Ah, Writer Kang, I found all the material.

131
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,520
Where are you?

132
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,580
I'm close by.

133
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,780
I'm watching you.

134
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:25,950
- Where? 
 - Behind the back of your head.

135
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,930
Behind the back of my head?

136
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:41,390
I'm saying I'm always watching, so don't fool around.

137
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:45,790
If you are all done, stop wasting your time calling me and just help Auntie.

138
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,020
I shouldn't have let her go like that.

139
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,460
How shocked she must have been.

140
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,770
She looked so pale.

141
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,550
I wonder if she didn't collapse as she was leaving.

142
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,210
Really? Did she look that way?

143
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:27,300
I felt so bad. She looked so weak, too.

144
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:33,030
She has gotten weaker these days because of her work.

145
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,470
Are you talking about your wife right now?

146
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,160
Yeah.

147
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,830
Let's just go.

148
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,970
Not at all.

149
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,140
She did not look surprised at all.

150
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,940
She is different than the way she looks. She is so delicate.

151
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,490
Delicate? Wow!

152
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,740
If she was any more delicate,

153
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,690
she would roast us alive and eat us.

154
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,220
 I didn't put you in a difficult position, did I?

155
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,490
 I was worried.

156
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,440
Trendy design and colorful sense of color are the characteristics of the

157
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,720
 eco-fur and eco-fur mustang designs,

158
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,010
 and since last year have continuously been popular.

159
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:24,330
 We are now on our second round of production for this line.

160
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,920
 In addition, consumers are looking for professional wear without regard to season.

161
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,240
 Fitted tops in short lengths...

162
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,130
 It's okay, please do not worry.

163
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,930
 Therefore...

164
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,320
 - Are you rebelling? 
 - That's enough.

165
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,540
 If you are dissatisfied, say so.

166
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,020
 Why waste the paint?

167
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,150
 That's not it...

168
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:50,120
 Ah, I threw it.

169
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,900
 I thought it would give it something extra.

170
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,760
 - Excuse me? 
 - Maybe I was wrong?

171
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,320
 Sorry.

172
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,860
 Tomorrow, are you coming to the mural completion ceremony?

173
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,880
 -    
 -

174
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,080
 Are you not able to come?

175
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,250
 I think I will be going.

176
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:02,560
 Tomorrow, will you be coming to the mural completion ceremony?

177
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,260
- Are you going? 
 - Are you crazy? With everything going on?

178
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,220
Then, why are you hesitating?

179
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,780

180
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,370
No way!  Are you starting again?

181
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,040

182
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,150
We will resume the meeting in a little while.

183
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,420
But...

184
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,870

185
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,690
Eh, you...

186
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,610

187
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,220
 Attorney Han!

188
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,040
Hello?

189
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,140
My cellphone was on mute, so I saw the call late.

190
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,090
You are coming tomorrow, right?

191
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:07,380
Tomorrow... I have something to take care of, so I don't think... I can go...

192
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,370
Ah, I see.

193
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,170
Ah, and...

194
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:21,290
My wife is a little sensitive these days so...

195
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,560
from now, calls or texts...

196
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,530
will be... difficult.

197
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,240
Sorry?

198
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:35,350
Ah... I'm sorry.

199
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,280
No, I'm the one who's sorry.

200
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,050
Thank you for the shoes, though.

201
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:47,600
Just throw them out, please. They are the wrong size anyway.

202
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,170
Pardon?

203
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:54,060

204
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,960

205
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,930

206
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,080

207
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,670
Here.

208
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,500
Uh, I think I'm going to live.

209
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,300
My goodness, didn't you at least eat there?

210
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,900
I like your food the best.

211
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,930
But where is Soo Ho?

212
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,310
How would I know?

213
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,800
As soon as you left, he left.

214
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,640
My goodness, he must have something good outside.

215
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,000
So, he called to play hooky?

216
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:26,410
Seeing that he is always out and about, it's a sure thing.

217
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:29,210
He has a woman.

218
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,370
A woman?

219
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,270
Who might you be?

220
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,360
By any chance... are you the assistant who, because of busy work and personal life,

221
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,220
comes and goes as you please, like a boss?

222
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,810
I'm sorry.

223
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,670
Find out who sent it.

224
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,370
The sender's address is—

225
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:36,280
That's why I want you to find out.

226
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,790
If you want to become a writer, you should be able to investigate at least this much.

227
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,550
- Right now? 
 - Why?

228
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:46,160
Do you have a date with your girlfriend or something?

229
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,310
I don't have one... a girlfriend.

230
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,730
Then, what about the convenience store girl?

231
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,780
She's just my junior.

232
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,740
Not a girlfriend, but just playing the field?

233
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,170
No, it's neither.

234
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,830
I got it. You can go.

235
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,840
Today... aren't you going?

236
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,760
I should complete the mural.

237
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,900
Bro,

238
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,630
why are you so afraid of my wife?

239
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:42,770
How could I not be afraid? You are afraid of her, too.

240
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:49,400
That's because I did wrong, so I'm being careful.

241
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,990
Ohhh... you look like a professional.

242
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:03,280
You can't do this just with strength. It's a skill.

243
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,550
Is it true that Attorney Han cooks well, too?

244
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,900
Doesn't Jin Ho cook?

245
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,920
Cook? I wish he would at least take his socks off correctly.

246
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,000
He doesn't lift a finger.

247
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
He's always stuck to the couch like a sea cucumber

248
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,880
and tells me to bring this and that.

249
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,910
I wish he would go on business trips often! He's such a bother.

250
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:33,040
What if he had an affair with a young lady?

251
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:37,770
What young lady would? An older man with a gut?

252
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,130
 No matter how I get tortured,

253
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,270
 I will never open my mouth about the affair, so don't worry.

254
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,460
I'll just tell her to take him if she wants him.

255
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,810
So that she can try washing socks that are inside out every day.

256
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:01,190
Hey, what if your wife asks about you?

257
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,670
You have to deny, of course.

258
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,700
You said she can always tell if you are lying.

259
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,260
Even then, it's only a suspicion. There is no evidence.

260
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,480
You keep thinking that he will really cheat on you.

261
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,510
Just tell him not to get caught.

262
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:17,750
If he is caught, would you divorce him or something?

263
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,640
Mom!

264
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,630
I told you not to run!

265
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,630
You... If that scary lady from downstairs comes up again...

266
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:36,260
Run. There is no lady scarier than me here.

267
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,200
Yes!

268
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:46,840
How can I get a divorce when I have that troublemaker?

269
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:54,270
If a divorce is difficult realistically...

270
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,420
you just have to make him not able to cheat on you.

271
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,290
How?

272
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,090
You just have to get rid of the source of trouble.

273
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:15,520
♫  You tried so hard to hide it  ♫

274
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:20,680
But would I... be able to deny it to the end?

275
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,520
You said you can endure any torture, didn't you?

276
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,090
Right! I don't need to get nervous.

277
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:28,250
It's not like I'm being tied up and tortured.

278
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:33,440
♫  I'm sure you thought it was perfect  ♫

279
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,550
♫  I bet you never even looked back  ♫

280
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:41,520
♫  And I had to watch you do it all  ♫

281
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:48,170
♫  I'll make sure you get what you deserve. Feel my cold gaze  ♫

282
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:52,460
♫  I'm never gonna love again  ♫

283
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:56,190
♫  Try playing around with those lips again  ♫

284
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:01,070
♫  I'm never gonna love again  ♫

285
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:12,630
Eat slowly. Slowly. Slowly.

286
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,210
Well, that...

287
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:20,030
According to the property manager...

288
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,730
you're the one who kidnapped him.

289
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,770
That's not true. I just drove.

290
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:28,970
Why did you drive?

291
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,720
Because he told me that he was a detective.

292
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,840

293
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,570
 Because he said that he was on his way to arrest the suspect.

294
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,650
Did you believe that?

295
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:46,110
Since he showed me the police department ID, I thought it was true.

296
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:57,060
But... it was a little strange.

297
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,010
When the guy tried to escape,

298
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:01,470
he pointed a gun at the guy.

299
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:06,080
I heard that... there was a woman amongst the accomplices.

300
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,860
Did you see her?

301
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,080
 Why are you so late? I waited for a long time.

302
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,000
By chance...

303
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:40,880
 It's almost time for patrol. Hurry up and move him.

304
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,920
Kang Yeo Joo?

305
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,420
At a quiet place that can never be found,

306
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,500
you bury him.

307
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:04,220
That should work!

308
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,200
Attorney Han, never cheat on your wife.

309
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,310
- Pardon? 
 - She says she will bury you in a quiet place.

310
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:51,050
Can we believe his testimony?

311
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:54,340
It is certain that Kang Yeo Joo went to the cemetery.

312
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,460
The timeline matches as well.

313
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,630
I'll need to ask a little more about Kang Yeo Joo.

314
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,400
Sis, please tell me, too.

315
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,970
The place to quietly bury someone.

316
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,430
Are you going to bury Dad?

317
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,670
Depending on how he behaves.

318
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:21,980
Eh, really... What nonsense are you spouting in front of a kid?

319
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:26,450
This book will be a reference.

320
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:34,310
As an appendix, there's a list of places that are good for burying a cheating husband.

321
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:37,690
You can come to borrow the tools needed for burial at any time.

322
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,990

323
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:45,920
Why? Are you feeling guilty about something?

324
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:50,570
W-What are you talking about "feeling guil-guilty"?

325
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:55,690
Sister-in-Law, if you are going to bury him, I recommend a cemetery.

326
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:57,770
That's the safest place, I hear.

327
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,450
She said if I come back to Korea, I'll die.

328
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,770
 Instead of getting buried alive here,

329
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:18,590
 it would be less painful to get shot with a gun there.

330
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,100
Then, why did you come back?

331
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:30,350
I visited the fan cafe online after a long absence.

332
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:33,170
 - Benji, did you start the game? 
 - Yeah, I started.  Hurry up and get in.

333
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:35,030
 Hurry up and log in. I'm at the bottom of the base.

334
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,520
 Wait. Where is your character?

335
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,740
 Okay. Wait.

336
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,040
 Okay. Wait.

337
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,980

338
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,860

339
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,970

340
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:51,290

341
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,880
 What are all these?

342
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:59,150
It really wasn't me.

343
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,820
I can't even kill a cockroach at home,

344
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,510
so how can I kill someone?

345
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:09,390
And Sister Soo Jeong of all people?

346
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:15,130
I'm so sad for Sister Soo Jeong.

347
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,440
So you are going now?

348
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,170
You never know what he might try to pull. Watch the manager well.

349
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:31,770
Can you handle her by yourself? It's Kang Yeo Joo.

350
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:39,190
Why did you go to the cemetery at dawn?

351
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:45,810
Don't you think that'll be enough to make her squeak?

352
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:47,030
Seriously!

353
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,700
What are you two doing at the workplace?

354
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,950
What are you talking about?

355
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,910
No, continue what you were doing.

356
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:59,830
The crime of adultery needs to be revived. In the old days...

357
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:03,100
In broad daylight, in a police station!

358
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,730
You couldn't even dare dream about it.

359
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:08,350
That punk, really!

360
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,840
Honey, let's clean this up, and let's hurry up and go.

361
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,760
Thank you for the meal.

362
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:18,200
By chance... when you opened the wardrobe closet to change clothes,

363
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,040
did you ever find a pretty female college student hiding inside?

364
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,870
No way! What nonsense!

365
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,820
Shall we talk about that over a cup of tea?

366
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,890
To see if it is nonsense or not?

367
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:44,780
Mom.

368
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,560
My marinated short rib...

369
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:54,580
Go to sleep. I will make sure that no one eats your short rib.

370
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,340
The tea is delicious.

371
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:21,700
Honey, that time... the incident with the cabinet... I'll explain it.

372
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,480
Why explain something like that? It's obvious.

373
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,480
It's an appropriate place, to hide something in a hurry.

374
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,350
Why aren't you drinking?

375
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:38,380
 They say if you eat it, you can see a brilliant yellow color while you are dying.

376
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,930
H-Hot. Because it's hot.

377
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:50,230
At first, I was surprised.

378
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:53,580
Auntie, grandmother, young female, student.

379
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:57,980
I've seen many corpses hidden in a closet...

380
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,990
but it was my first time to see a live woman.

381
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,920
She's not a woman you know well...

382
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:10,060
I was concerned that it might bother you, so I overreacted.

383
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:14,140
You met her at the Seoyeon University lecture, didn't you?

384
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:18,690
Yes.

385
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,920
 She is trying to find out something.

386
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:24,390
 If she was 100% certain, she wouldn't ask this kind of question.

387
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:26,820
 There are things that she does not know.

388
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:31,790
You are busy enough with the broadcast, but you even give lectures...

389
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:36,250
Did you think that it was an opportunity to meet a young and pretty female college student?

390
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:46,280
These days, the attorney fees are not coming in well.

391
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,400
They said they will pay well for the lecture...

392
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:57,960
It's not because there are a lot of pretty female students at Seoyeon University?

393
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,400
I was only thinking about the anniversary gift.

394
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,810
Brand name purse...

395
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:11,190
I felt ashamed that I couldn't even buy you one...

396
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,430
and felt shabby.

397
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:21,240
But you... weren't working to earn money

398
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:25,500
but were leisurely enjoying boat riding at the Han River with the Party leader.

399
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:40,440

400
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:49,410
Don't say that you went into politics to try to buy me a brand name purse.

401
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:56,400
At first, it was because of the lecture, but I made it clear to Manager Nam that I'm not going into politics.

402
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,360
Now, I'm not even looking south. I don't go to Gangnam.

403
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:07,500
So that's why you went to paint the mural yesterday,  with Go Mi Rae.

404
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:38,970
Really, there is nothing between me and that female college student.

405
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:41,110
I know that it's not a serious relationship.

406
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:45,010
Seeing that she doesn't even know your correct shoe size...

407
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:51,030
But... the start is always like that.

408
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,640
Honey, you know that she's not my type.

409
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,770
She has a common face so I can't even remember it.

410
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,620
Then, why did you give her a ride in your car?

411
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,290
Did you give her a ride?

412
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:55,850
It's my fault. I should have just left that day.

413
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:59,110
She had a cast on her leg... Whether she limps or not...

414
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,130
Even though it's an area with frequent traffic accidents...

415
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:07,120
It's her own fortune. Why did I get nosy and try to help...

416
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,560
You are saying that you helped her because she injured her leg?

417
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,130
The CCTV at the building should have captured the image.

418
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:15,560
There should be plenty of witnesses as well.

419
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,060
It was also Go Mi Rae who returned your fountain pen, wasn't it?

420
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,550

421
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,890
But why did you say it was a wrestler?

422
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:33,240
Wasn't it because you were interested?

423
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:41,110
Bro, didn't you say it was a wrestler?

424
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:54,670
Well... a woman can wrestle, too.

425
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,560
The last puzzle has been solved.

426
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,550
As expected, it was what I suspected.

427
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,030
It was someone else who was interested in Go Mi Rae.

428
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,700
Me?

429
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:35,290
She is young and pretty.

430
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:40,020
Enough for your heart to wander for a short while.

431
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,670
You know that you aren't even allowed that, right?

432
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:46,510
Of course!  I am... substandard.

433
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:52,530
It's unjust.  What do you mean by "wandering heart"?

434
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:54,260
If not?

435
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,310
That's... Woo Seong!  Woo Seong!

436
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:02,000
I did it because he might cheat on you again!

437
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,390
 Again.

438
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:07,500
Just...

439
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,230
Just...

440
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:17,590
Just an interest.

441
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:22,720
It all starts that way... cheating.

442
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:26,600
That's not it.

443
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:35,420
Really!

444
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:40,760
I will keep it a secret from Yoon Hui, so please end it quickly.

445
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,600
That's why I invited you here on purpose.

446
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,970
 Let's go now.

447
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,880
Ah, Honey! Honey!

448
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,890
- That's not it. 
 - What's not it?

449
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:58,940
I said that's not it. Honey! Honey!

450
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,090
Honey!

451
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,360
Ugh, seriously!

452
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,190
- I said hear me out. 
 - Hear what? Hear what more?

453
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:07,290
Ah, I said that's not it.

454
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:09,880
- He's crying! 
 - Don't cry.

455
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,040
Don't cry. Ah, don't cry!

456
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,250
Why are you yelling at him?

457
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,830
Wasn't it too much?

458
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:23,390
It's not as if he cheated on her.

459
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:27,670
Jin Ho is 39 years old.  He should be careful.  His age has the number nine. 
 (T/N: 19, 29, 39, etc. are thought to be ominous years)

460
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:32,200
Statistically, 39 is the age when most people cheat.

461
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:36,020
He should be careful.

462
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:39,470
You should be careful as well. You are 2 years away.

463
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:45,140
You are not going to continue seeing her, Go Mi Rae, are you?

464
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:49,400
I wasn't seeing her. I ran into her a few times by coincidence.

465
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:55,050
Coincidence? Be careful... of that female college student.

466
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,960
I wonder when it started.

467
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:41,640
♫  We are here. Here now  ♫

468
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:48,840
♫  You and me. Us. Maybe. Let me hear your whisper  ♫

469
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:54,490
♫  The day is passing by. I have no worries  ♫

470
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:58,180
♫  At your side. Your whisper  ♫

471
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,680
♫   I'm on your side   ♫

472
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,270
Was it from the beginning?

473
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:07,330
♫  I won't lose you now  ♫

474
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:09,760
That I started...

475
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,790
waiting for him...

476
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:17,690
♫  Your whisper in my ear  ♫

477
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:20,580
♫  We are here  ♫

478
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:23,640
♫  Your whisper  ♫

479
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:27,320
♫  Let me hear your whisper  ♫

480
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:32,900
♫  The day is passing by. I have no worries  ♫

481
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:37,620
♫  At your side, your whisper  ♫

482
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:42,690
You must be tired. Go in and rest. I'll clean up.

483
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:45,460
I see that you cleaned the paint off.

484
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,240
Sorry?

485
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:56,830
You got paint on your shoes while painting the mural, didn't you?

486
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:14,000
 It was blue paint, right? And Go Mi Rae did it.

487
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,140
 That's why she bought the shoes, right?

488
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,690
You are as accurate as if you were there.

489
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,880
I saw the article.

490
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:28,120
But there weren't any reporters there.

491
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:53,970
 Why is he here again?

492
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,610
I thought we were done talking about Pilates.

493
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:15,110
Why did you even come to my house and...

494
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:18,210
What about Pilates?

495
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:29,310
It seems that you didn't know he was doing Pilates.

496
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:33,900
Are you doing Pilates? Since when?

497
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,330
Oh, what do I do?!

498
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:41,210
It must have been a secret! Woah, my big mouth!

499
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,670
Why would you hide the fact that you are exercising?

500
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,570
Because the instructor is a female...

501
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:55,420
You seemed kind of sensitive these days so I could... couldn't te-tell you.

502
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,990
Don't you know that I become more suspicious when you do that?

503
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:03,430
That's why I quit. I'm not doing it anymore.

504
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:15,400
Excuse me, but I came to meet Kang Yeo Joo today.

505
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:20,390
Why... my wife?

506
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:54,630
Why did you go to the cemetery at dawn? (speaking informally)

507
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:58,390
Did we speak informally to each other? (speaking informally)

508
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,450
Why? (formalizing the question)

509
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:06,470
To investigate. (speaking informally) I did. (formalizing the answer)

510
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:12,260
It's because, as you are well aware, a cemetery appears often in my stories. (speaking informally)  That's why. (formalizing the answer)

511
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:17,450
The manager who was hiding in the Philippines,

512
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:21,280
- is at the police station now. 
 - Fuc...

513
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,840
Is he in Korea now?

514
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:32,140
When we fed him a bowl of blood sausage soup with rice, he told us everything.

515
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:36,040
What did he say?

516
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:42,180
What was it he said? It seems like he said a lot...

517
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:46,230
That you are the real culprit.

518
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:53,720
If you follow quietly,

519
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,630
I'll put these back in.

520
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:18,750
It's a 2011 model.

521
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:21,760
It has the special characteristic of having a double sawtooth.

522
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,880
I believe there was a culprit who uncuffed his handcuffs because of the wear on the sawtooth.

523
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:31,280
You are still using that? Why don't you just use shoelaces instead?

524
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,880
- Then, try uncuff— 
 - What about the warrant?

525
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:38,060
It's being issued now.

526
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:42,540
Then... I will be selecting a lawyer meanwhile.

527
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:47,270
Uh, suddenly, I feel like traveling abroad.

528
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:52,480
If I'm going to confess anyway, I would prefer to do it at a  Hawaiian beach rather than in a dark interrogation room.

529
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,880
How about it? A business trip to Hawaii?

530
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,700
 If you feel that it's not going well, just plead with her.

531
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:02,950
 We don't even have a warrant and we just have a testimony.

532
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:11,230
Would you please at least... give us a witness interview...

533
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:14,020
All right, I will cooperate.

534
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:18,460
- In return, I want a face-to-face with the manager. 
 - Fuc...

535
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:30,540
What do they have to talk about for so long?

536
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:33,850
Did a witness come forward saying they saw me?

537
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,420
Honey!

538
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:44,360
I'm going to the police station for a bit.

539
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,260
Why?

540
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:48,800
I'll need to go and find out as well... why they want me to come.

541
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:57,890
How can you do this to me?

542
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:04,720
Did you torture him or something?

543
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:09,540
What torture? What era do you think this is? Geez.

544
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:12,180
Then, why does he look like this?

545
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:14,350
He says that you ordered it, Writer Kang.

546
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:16,200
I did?

547
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:23,300
I suddenly remember.

548
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,510
Ah, that's right, I ordered it.

549
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:28,450
Ah, am I getting old? My memory isn't what it used to be.

550
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:30,770
Forgetful.

551
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:38,190
I want to talk with him alone.

552
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:41,560
That's a little difficult.

553
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:45,840
You might threaten him and...

554
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:49,200
Threaten him? Who? Me?

555
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,390
He is twice my size, though.

556
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:53,960
That's the rule.

557
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:58,950
So, that's the rule...

558
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:06,780
Where are you going?

559
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:12,670
Where are you going in the middle of a conversation?  Really!

560
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:15,480
Please work without missing your meals.

561
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:19,830
It's cold so dress warmly as well.

562
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:23,190
That's all I have to say.

563
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:27,270
You said you would cooperate...

564
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:30,640
If you do this, I will call 911.

565
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:34,130
Since I will receive a shock from the abuse of public authority.

566
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:37,420
I am thinking about being hospitalized for about two days...

567
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:52,450

568
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,310
Yes, Attorney Hong.

569
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:02,050
Why aren't you coming? We have our reunion today.

570
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:04,840
 Ah, that's right! It's today, isn't it?

571
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,670
He's not coming?

572
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:11,020
Something came up at home...

573
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,390
I don't think I can make it.

574
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:17,830
I will see you next time. Sorry.

575
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:20,340
Yeah.

576
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:26,340
You! You have some connections at the police, right?

577
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:28,690
Seodong Police Station?

578
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:32,690
I'm not sure... Okay, I'll look into it.

579
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:35,460
Okay.

580
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:37,990
Did something happen at home?

581
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:40,150
He says his wife is at the police station.

582
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:41,520
What?

583
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,310
Do you know anybody at the Seodong Police Station?

584
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:47,240
I might if I look into it...

585
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,780
Then... you look into it.

586
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:04,150
Sure. What good are colleagues?

587
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:21,580
That's right. I had people kidnap you from a soup-and-rice restaurant.

588
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:24,180
It was a Chinese restaurant.

589
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:27,830
Whatever kind of restaurant.

590
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:31,000
But how did you get free?

591
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,700
Through a bathroom window.

592
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,090
It's recording well, right?

593
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:48,690
Of all the bathroom windows I know, there isn't one that is big enough for you to go through.

594
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:53,750
How many did I hire?

595
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:56,060
Five.

596
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:58,340
That's right. I did.

597
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:01,120
But I shouldn't pay them the remainder.

598
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:05,500
How is it possible for five of them to lose you?

599
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,310
Unless they set you free on purpose.

600
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:25,910
Who ordered it?

601
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:42,390
That... What the hell is she doing?

602
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:50,410
What did you say?

603
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,400
Ask him yourself.

604
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,950
This woman threatened you, didn't she?

605
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:03,400
No, no!  She didn't. I'm the culprit.

606
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:07,000
I'm saying that I killed Sister Soo Jeong.

607
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:17,060
Then...

608
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:20,870
It looks like I've cooperated plenty.

609
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:26,950
You... were going to do this from the beginning, weren't you?

610
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:34,000
My husband is waiting. I can go, right?

611
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:39,130
Let her go. It's okay for you to leave.

612
00:55:57,110 --> 00:56:00,910
Honey! Is anything wrong?

613
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:04,110
Well... I assisted the police with the investigation.

614
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,770
Why did he intimidate you when they needed assistance?

615
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:11,170
It's okay. It's not like I was afraid or anything.

616
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:21,610

617
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:25,990
Go ahead. I'll take a taxi.

618
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:29,340
Why? Where... are you going?

619
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:32,020
There is someone I need to see.

620
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:34,400
I'll give you a ride.

621
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,380
You go ahead. I'll take a taxi.

622
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:59,390
Why is she riding a taxi at night? Making me worried.

623
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:04,160
The world is so rough now! She doesn't even have fear...

624
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:43,320
You waited for a long time, didn't you? There was a minor accident.

625
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:47,210
You don't need to worry. It's all been resolved.

626
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:13,300

627
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,710
Did she come here for work?

628
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:12,720

629
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,590

630
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:20,940
♫   I can't hide it. Let me down   ♫

631
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:25,090
♫  All right  ♫

632
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:29,340
♫  I can't hide it. Let me down  ♫

633
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:33,970
♫  Get away from me  ♫

634
01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:41,200
♫  Never mind just get away  ♫

635
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,870
 This... Is it a threat?

636
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:44,120
 You want to go all the way to the end?

637
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:46,760
 You want to stop me with that kind of long-forgotten past?

638
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:49,020
 You are still wearing it... that ring.

639
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,910
 Those were the good times.

640
01:00:50,910 --> 01:00:54,310
 I thought you should see the completed mural.

641
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:56,220
 Ah, what do I do? Why is this...

642
01:00:56,220 --> 01:01:00,450
 I already talked to your wife. She agreed to support you fully from now on. Didn't you know?

643
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:02,650
 My wife is not that simple.

644
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:04,990
 Why does Kang Yeo Joo have a business card from a detective agency?

645
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:06,930
 They said they can do anything for pay.

646
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:10,550
 Office of Gwak Jung Moon. Would they really be able to kill someone?

647
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:12,200
♫  Can't you hear my rough breathing  ♫
