1
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,310

2
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,400
Can I check something?

3
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,470
Did he really die?

4
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,450
Okay.

5
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,370

6
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:59,860

7
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,260

8
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,180
Are you guys wearing couple outfits?

9
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,760
Hey, you crazy bastard.

10
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,460
Do you think this situation is funny?

11
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,180
A suspect died in the police station.

12
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,030
Well, okay, so what? Should I cry then?

13
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,450
Why are you putting me in handcuffs? I didn't do anything wrong.

14
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,490
What do you mean, "I didn't do anything wrong"?

15
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,970
I didn't do anything. I was just talking to him.

16
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,970
What the heck do you mean, you didn't do anything?

17
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,660
Don't you know that you are not allowed to bring in food?

18
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,110
A guy who calls himself a lawyer, really?

19
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,640
Let's go.

20
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,270
But how can you... without any evidence... arrest me like this?

21
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,590
This is in violation of Article 124 of the Procedural Code!

22
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,070
 Just be quiet, please!

23
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,450
It's going to be a bit of a headache to interrogate him... since he's a lawyer.

24
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,340
And on top of that... his wife is Kang Yeo Joo.

25
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,220
She's not answering?

26
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,730
It doesn't seem like she's taking the call.

27
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,890
She's not answering.

28
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,570
It's just that... I think my wife... would be worried.

29
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:29,420
Can't you make the call just one more time?

30
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,280
Sure. Seriously.

31
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,530
Ah... I don't think she would answer anyway.

32
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,060

33
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,200
She's not answering.

34
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,670
Excuse me,

35
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,140
who made the food?

36
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,440
I made it.

37
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,640
Usually, I'm the one who cooks.

38
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,370
I see.

39
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,300
How did you end up becoming Mr. Kim Deok Gi's attorney?

40
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,630
 I even submitted the General Power of Attorney in your name.

41
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,470
 Because the cops wouldn't allow me a visitation.

42
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:48,420
Since I had worked with Miss Baek Soo Jeong before...

43
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,690
I had a lot of interest in this case.

44
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,160
It wasn't because Mrs. Kang Yeo Joo told you to do it?

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,290
You seem to be asking leading questions.

46
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,020
Why do you keep trying to get my wife involved in this?

47
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,440
Before Mr. Kim Deok Gi died...

48
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,880
he revealed the culprit who kidnapped him.

49
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,520
He named Mrs. Kang Yeo Joo.

50
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,490
My... wife?

51
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,390
 Didn't you know?

52
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,220
 The reason was pretty serious.

53
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,030
 Kidnapping, subornation of violence, burial?

54
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,150
Seeing that you weren't able to arrest her,

55
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,520
there must not have been anything solid. Right?

56
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,040
Yes, you can say that...

57
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,070
On the day Baek Soo Jeong died,

58
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,190
she met with Mrs. Kang Yeo Joo.

59
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,470
There was even a witness

60
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,960
who saw them fighting.

61
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,810
You have a guest.

62
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,130
Who?

63
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:32,350
He said he is the producer for "Unanswered Questions."

64
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,180
Ah, I forgot.

65
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,240
Have him come here.

66
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:45,330
Why did you kill Mr. Kim Deok Gi?

67
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,740
Why did you poison the food?

68
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,650
Me?

69
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,370
Was poison discovered in the food?

70
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,450
Are you sure? Do you have evidence?

71
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,870
Someone who was perfectly fine

72
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,720
died immediately after eating the packed food.

73
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,440
Whether it was poison or whatever else,

74
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,980
it wasn't me.

75
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,950
I know nothing about poison.

76
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,840
I only studied law. Law.

77
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,540
Don't just insist that it wasn't you.

78
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,770
Tell us the truth, please.

79
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:30,260
Are you... really... the one who made the food?

80
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,170
Yes. It was me.

81
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,660
I made it... with my own hands.

82
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,280
Hey!

83
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,180
Look here, Sir.

84
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,530
You have just been arrested in the act.

85
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,040
An anniversary special?

86
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,970
Yes. We're humbly making the request.

87
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,710
I'm a little busy because of my new work-in-progress.

88
00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:00,150
The case is complicated, so you have to do this.

89
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,310
Thank you.

90
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,890
What kind of case will you be featuring?

91
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,030
It's the Baek Soo Jeong murder case.

92
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,580
Even though you are a lawyer,

93
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,270
there is no way to get out of this.

94
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:45,150
If you want to at least reduce the sentence... confess.

95
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,610
Confess!

96
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,260
Just a moment.

97
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,930
Step out for a moment.

98
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,880
How can a member of the Republic of Korea's peacekeeping force

99
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,670
be so violent?

100
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,320
Wow, how did he become a cop?

101
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,830
Does he not know anything about the law?

102
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,510
Look...

103
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,260
Even a tiny piece of evidence is good.

104
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,450
Isn't there anything you know?

105
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,280
I'm going to go crazy. Seriously.

106
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,580
There isn't.

107
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:46,470
But... why wouldn't your wife answer the phone call?

108
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,910

109
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,550
This is not a simple case.

110
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,280
That's why we are doing a special edition.

111
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,070
You must've gotten hired after passing a difficult test.

112
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,480
Can you put your producer's position on the line?

113
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,630
My father owns an orchard. He says he is short on workers.

114
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,800
How did you get hold of this kind of material?

115
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,300
Ah...

116
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,320

117
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,160
 I have a condition.

118
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,140
 Please cast Writer Kang Yeo Joo.

119
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,060
I was luck... lucky.

120
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,360
Do you know that I was a suspect as well?

121
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,760
Then, you would know the case well. Right?

122
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,390
The broadcast... are you going to do it?

123
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,660
I'm thinking about it.

124
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,450
Can you not do it?

125
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,400
Why?

126
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,990
Well, you said you don't even have time to sleep because of the new book you are writing.

127
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,680
You know Baek Soo Jeong, don't you?

128
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,250
They are dealing with that case.

129
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,950
There is no one who knows as much as I do about that case.

130
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,620
Hey, don't get any more involved with that Baek Soo Jeong case.

131
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:53,620
I've been curious for a while, but why don't you like Baek Soo Jeong?

132
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,680
Me?

133
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,700
You told me to be careful of Baek Soo Jeong, didn't you?

134
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,780
 That... That kind of demure face you have to be careful of them.

135
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:11,560
 You shouldn't trust your husband too much, either.  You know that, right?

136
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:17,420
That's just... I was talking about her physiognomy.

137
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:22,690
You can just tell that she would seduce someone who's already taken.

138
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,360
You read physiognomy well.

139
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,080
Skin discoloration and airway obstruction.

140
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,390
It looks like poisoning, although I would need to perform an autopsy for the details.

141
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:01,160
Just before dying, he ate a prepared lunch box.

142
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,620
Then I should take a look at the contents of the stomach first.

143
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,460
Gosh, did I eat something that was off?

144
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:31,160
It's kind of ticklish.

145
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,830
What's this?

146
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,140
This is...

147
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:05,170
 These are talismans to block the acts of having an affair.

148
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:13,410
 The respondent put it not only on the petitioner's underwear but also on his bed,

149
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,280
 his pillow, and she even...

150
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,710
 burned it and mixed it into the food he ate.

151
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,880
 Your Honor, delusional jealousy is...

152
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,590
 an important hindrance to maintaining a married life.

153
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:38,780
Why was this talisman sewn onto my underwear?

154
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:44,650
Was she really aware... of the fact that I've been seeing other women?

155
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,160
Why would the "nation's husband" who only looks at his wife,

156
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,170
call this office manager who eyes only female college students?

157
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,620
Childish? I'm childish? Hey!

158
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,410
Because of you, my close-knit family is at risk!

159
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:06,490
What? You said "jailed" not "childish"?

160
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,750
What's the accusation?

161
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,910
What? Murder?

162
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,500
My wife's not answering the phone.

163
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:24,350
I'm worried that something might've happened. Could you go over to my house and find out for me?

164
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,110
Please.

165
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,780

166
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,440
This soon? Please give me some time.

167
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,350
Jae Ha brought them.

168
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,830
No, this person has no relationship with me at all.

169
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:52,780
- He's just someone I'm thankful for helping me— 
 - If you're thankful to him...

170
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,790
Don't cause him any harm and leave quietly.

171
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,550
Aren't there plenty of ways to have fun without causing a ruckus?

172
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,400
It's not like I'm asking you to do anything.

173
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,030
I'm just asking you to not cause any trouble. Is that too much to ask?

174
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:37,250
You seem to enjoy breaking into someone else's house.

175
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,600
I see you changed the door lock.

176
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,620
It took some time to unlock.

177
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,630
I should get a refund.

178
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,050
They said it could never be picked.

179
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,850
- You don't know yet? 
 - Know what?

180
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:06,450
- Kang Yeo Joo's husband was taken into custody on emergency arrest for suspicion of murder. 
 - Excuse me?

181
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:09,280
But the real culprit is probably Kang Yeo Joo.

182
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,820
 She probably stacked the cards to frame Han Woo Seong as the culprit.

183
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,360
I'll do it.

184
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,280
These cost more than you do.

185
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,920
If you want to show off your strength, move the things by the entrance.

186
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,570
Spy camera.

187
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,730
Camcorder.

188
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,810
Cutter.

189
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,120
What's that?

190
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,210

191
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,900
Pesticide?

192
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,940
What does she use all these for?

193
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,270
 You suspect her as well, don't you?

194
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,410
 Kang Yeo Joo bought tetrodotoxin poison to kill her lover

195
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:39,010
 and killed her fiance by disguising it as a car explosion.

196
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,510
It's odd to see you looking so serious.

197
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,940
Thanks for coming.

198
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,790
I wanted to talk about the lawsuit but couldn't reach you.

199
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,970
What is it? Say what you have to say and go.

200
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,970
The date for the trial has been set.

201
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:21,860
But... if the attorney doesn't make an appearance, it would be too easy of a win.

202
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,600
It won't be an easy win since I will be released soon.

203
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:36,890
Before coming here, I met briefly with the team leader for the criminal division.

204
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:39,730
The situation seems to be taking a strange turn.

205
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,210
What is happening?

206
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:52,030
The reason for Kim Deok Gi's death is...

207
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:37,530
Where should I put these books?

208
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,670
Throw them away. I don't need them anymore.

209
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:46,310
I figured out all that I needed to.

210
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,350
- Can I help you with that? 
 - No need.

211
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,570
She took a revenge for cheating on her.

212
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:04,450
Baek Soo Jeong is dead and Han Woo Seong is framed for murder.

213
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,510
It is a Kang Yeo Joo's style of story.

214
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:12,410
There isn't even any solid evidence, is there?

215
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,100
We'll find out...

216
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,570
what happens to Han Woo Seong.

217
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,750
She said she was going to organize the storage.  Should I call her?

218
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,900
Does it hurt?

219
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,790
Yes.

220
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,890
You're heavy.

221
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,450
How much longer will you stay like this?

222
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,430
Oh, yes.

223
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,880
Are you okay?

224
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,830
Help me up.

225
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,250
When you come to work tomorrow morning, start by cleaning this up.

226
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,900
Don't think about disappearing again.

227
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:27,140
She just left without saying thanks.

228
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:47,780
Shouldn't we look into getting a lawyer?

229
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,520
He's a lawyer.

230
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:55,460
But still... to leave him to take care of it himself is...

231
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,610
If he is innocent, he will be released soon.

232
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:06,390
But... aren't you worried?

233
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,830
Staying a few days inside a holding cell,

234
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:12,020
would be a good experience for a lawyer, wouldn't it?

235
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,470
"A good experience for a lawyer"?

236
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:30,500
How can you say such a thing, he's still your husband.

237
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:48,000
No, no, no.

238
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,360
That's right. I didn't see anything.

239
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,150
Ah, seriously.

240
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:11,010
 They said Kim Deok Gi's cause of death... was anaphylaxis .

241
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:15,530
 Really? Then it's not murder, it was an accident.

242
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:19,000
 If it was put inside the food on purpose, then it's a different story.

243
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,840
 The food you gave to Kim Deok Gi... did you really make it yourself?

244
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:49,650
 Don't you think it's too dramatic?

245
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:54,800
 Like a story... it's too perfectly put together.

246
00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:02,370
 In your wife's stories... don't all the men who cheat get revenge exacted on them?

247
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,970
 Either they get murdered...

248
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,660
 or get framed for a murder.

249
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:26,120

250
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,590

251
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:40,640
 According to Woo Seong, he ended up like that as soon as he ate the lunch box.

252
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,570
 Lunch box...

253
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:53,870

254
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:01,990
- Do you want some more soup? 
 - Yes.

255
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:11,300
- Auntie. 
 - Yeah?

256
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,550
By chance, in the sautéed zucchini you made yesterday,

257
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,940
did you put dried shrimp?

258
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,320
No, why?

259
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,820
Nothing, just checking.

260
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,040
Team Leader!

261
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,080
- Oh, you're here. 
 - Hello.

262
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,910
- Have you been well? 
 - Yes.

263
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:55,100
So what happened?

264
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:59,060
We even enlisted National Forensic Service and Provincial Police Forensic Team,

265
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:03,200
but no poisonous substance was found in the food.

266
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,540
Based on the autopsy result, an allergic shock was suspected...

267
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,410
 Even the corpse's posterior lung was filled with water.

268
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:13,010
 It looks like the airways were swollen, so there was breathing difficulty.

269
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,800
 It's a symptom of anaphylaxis.

270
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,770
 It is unusual to have the symptom show up in such a short time though.

271
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:23,550
Nuts, dairy, seafood, shellfish.

272
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:26,200
Nothing was found.

273
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,820
It must not have been easy to make food avoiding all those.

274
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:34,710
It seems that they were purposely left out while making the food.

275
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:38,770
Then how exactly did Kim Deok Gi die?

276
00:27:55,270 --> 00:28:00,630

277
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:07,100
Honey! Honey...

278
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,190
H-Honey!

279
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,980
How did the manager die?

280
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,420
Explain in detail.

281
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:27,160
Th-That's...

282
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,380
Did you eat shrimp?

283
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:35,760
N-no, I didn't. Maybe there are bugs inside the holding cell?

284
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,400
Are you sure about that?

285
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,690
Based on the result so far.

286
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:01,000
Yes, Ms. Kang Yeo Joo.

287
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Has the analysis of the lunch I packed been completed?

288
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,730
The lunch box... You're the one who made it?

289
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:14,250
That's right. I'm the one who made it, all of it.

290
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:18,500
Mr. Han Woo Seong said he made it himself.

291
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,160
That's what a married couple is.

292
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:25,599
I'm at Seodong Police Station... to take my husband home.

293
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,640
I packed the lunch box.

294
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:35,710
You are going to confess now.

295
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:38,240
There seems to be a misunderstanding. I didn't come to confess.

296
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,220
I came to protest.

297
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:45,190
Ah, seriously.

298
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,180
Why don't you release my husband right now?

299
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:52,220
Well, because it's possible that he is an accomplice...

300
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,020
An accomplice?

301
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,610
On what charge?

302
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:02,170
There wasn't any poison found in the packed lunch.

303
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,410
You seem to be so sure about it.

304
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,220
We don't even know the result of the analysis.

305
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:11,350
Of course... because I didn't put anything in it.

306
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:15,750
Not only poison, but I left out all ingredients that may cause an allergic reaction.

307
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:21,730
So the fact that the manager is allergic to shellfish...

308
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:24,100
is something you knew about.

309
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,800
How?

310
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:29,020
I was talking about my husband.

311
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,360
He is mildly allergic, but...

312
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,940
the manager was allergic to shellfish?

313
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:49,940
If allergy was the problem, not the poison,

314
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:53,280
then it was for sure that the intended victim was the manager.

315
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:01,770
Then, you figure out how to catch the culprit.

316
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:05,140
My husband and I will just go home and have dinner.

317
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:09,440
You'll have to dine on your own tonight.

318
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,440
Mr. Han Woo Seong still needs to be questioned.

319
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,360
I'm thirsty.

320
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,030
This room doesn't have a water purifier.

321
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:30,520
There is a place for it, though.

322
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,180
 Did you eat the meal with him?

323
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,510
 No, I just drank water.

324
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,390
By chance...

325
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:56,650
did someone die after drinking the water from the water purifier or something?

326
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:59,550
Is that why it's all being tested?

327
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:09,510
 Highly condensed chitosan was found in the water purifier.

328
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,870
 It's a recently developed research drug.

329
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:17,440
 The rate of absorption is fast, so it causes an allergic shock instantly.

330
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,350
 To a person who is severely allergic to shellfish, it is fatal.

331
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:27,000
 It is a symptom of chitosan allergy. The symptom appeared so fast that the airways got blocked.

332
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,930
That's why

333
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:37,150
my husband, who did not eat the packed lunch, had an allergic reaction.

334
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:41,570
 Ah, that... that is...

335
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:46,190
The manager who was severely allergic to shellfish...

336
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,900
Mr. Kim Deok Gi! Mr. Kim Deok Gi!

337
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,910
Ah, you are going to be put in a difficult position.

338
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:03,510
A suspect died after drinking water from a police station water purifier...

339
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:06,160
If the reporters find out...

340
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:17,910

341
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:26,270

342
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:30,700
There is something there for sure...

343
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:37,290
Doesn't it seem like that woman is playing a game with us or something?

344
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,400
Every time, it's too dramatic... like her stories.

345
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:58,720
She probably had someone put something in the water purifier.

346
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,120
Was the lunch box a bait?

347
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,310
To make him drink water.

348
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:16,640
 Honey, I'm sorry for leaping to the wrong conclusions about you, even briefly.

349
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:09,530
 The person you are trying to reach...

350
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:19,280
- Where did he say the USB was? 
 - What?

351
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,250
Didn't the manager talk about the USB?

352
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,260
 You were captured on the CCTV.

353
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:30,770
 I saw your image on the USB saved files.

354
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:35,360
Ah... Ah... I did ask about it.

355
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,700
But... he ended up like that right after...

356
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,840
You should have asked about that first.

357
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,900
I'm sorry.

358
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,810
Honey, you go in first. I'll go buy some medicine.

359
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:08,210
- I think I need to take some allergy medication. It's itchy. 
 - Okay.

360
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:11,410
Do you want me to get you something?  Do you need anything?

361
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:14,410
Yes, you know my beer. Right?

362
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,950
Yes, of course.

363
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,790
- I'll bring a straw, too.
 - Okay.

364
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:37,050
 I said I wouldn't call. I am sorry.

365
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,690
 I thought this might be the last time.

366
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,530
 It seems that you are the only one to bid my farewell.

367
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,290
 Thank you for everything.

368
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:52,250
 I won't forget you.

369
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,440

370
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:06,280
Did something happen?

371
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:18,960

372
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,730
Mi Rae.

373
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,990
Mi Rae.

374
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,810
Mi Rae.

375
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:10,920
Hey, Go Mi Rae!

376
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:18,220
Why don't you answer me, Mi Rae?

377
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:40,450
M-M-Mi Rae.

378
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:49,530
S-S-Secretary Cha!

379
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:54,190
Secretary Cha! Secretary Cha! Secretary Cha!

380
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:14,890

381
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,220
- "Unanswered Questions"? 
 - Yes.

382
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,900
They proposed a broadcast, but it's making me worry a little.

383
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:27,890
Why would you worry about it? You should do it.

384
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:32,190
You... are only writing your book these days. It's making me worry.

385
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:37,100
Do the broadcast and meet people, and it will be good to take a little break.

386
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,930
Should I?

387
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,360
By the way, do you know Attorney Park Hye Kyeong?

388
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,820
W-Why?

389
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:53,790
She is the consulting attorney for "Unanswered Questions." They said she went to the same training center for lawyers as you.

390
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,750
Ah, yes.

391
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:08,970
Ah, come to think of it, Honey...

392
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:13,330
I think it will be better to do the broadcast after you finish writing your book.

393
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,790
Isn't CEO Yang making a ruckus about suing you?

394
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:18,380
I changed my publisher, remember?

395
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,410
That's why... t-that's more of the reason why you shouldn't.

396
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:25,410
As soon as you sign the contract, instead of writing, you are going to appear on a broadcast program,

397
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:27,660
what kind of editor-in-chief would like that?

398
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,230
CEO Yang let it slide because she was close to you.

399
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:34,120
On a day like this, you need to have tofu.
  (T/N: Koreans eat tofu after being released from jail or prison.)

400
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,390
Ah, really.

401
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:39,650
Don't eat it.

402
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,390
- Why not? 
 - Why not?

403
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:43,590
The tofu marinade has oyster sauce in it.

404
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:48,150
There's a high possibility of cross allergy with shellfish and clams.

405
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:53,670
Anyway, it's not good for your allergy.

406
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:05,080
Ah, then... should I bring some tofu marinated in soy sauce at least?

407
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,570
It's in the basement storage.

408
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,040
Gosh, you startled me!

409
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,910
Auntie.

410
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,030
What?

411
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:34,060
What is this?

412
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,860
It looks like traditional Korean medicine.

413
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:49,670
They said it's good for your body so...

414
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:52,510
Auntie.

415
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:00,630
They say it reduces a man's vigor.

416
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,970
I found this in his underwear.

417
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:12,620
This is a talisman that prevents cheating, isn't it?

418
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,150
They say it really works.

419
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,390
Why are you so suspicious?

420
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:26,100
He even signed a Physical Injury Waiver before marriage.

421
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,890
I know. But still...

422
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:31,130
If I saw him cheating,

423
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:33,950
do you think I would just sit back and watch?

424
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:36,820
I would have buried him already.

425
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:44,000
Don't do this kind of thing.

426
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:55,090
They are expensive. There is no need to throw them out.

427
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:00,480
When she doesn't even know...

428
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:05,630
Gosh, it's cold.

429
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,420
First things first.

430
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,880
USB. USB.

431
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,700
USB.

432
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:27,570

433
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:41,270
 There's an old telephone booth in front of the level crossing.

434
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:44,800
 Open the light fixture cover.

435
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:48,520
 I taped it there.

436
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,470
Here it is.

437
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:32,680
Here it is.

438
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,430
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

439
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:03,810

440
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:05,290
This... This...

441
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:07,570
Wh-Wh—

442
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:09,390
Ah, damn!

443
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:11,470
Hurry. Hurry.

444
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:35,500
Where did he go in the middle of the night?

445
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:48,460
What are you doing there?

446
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:01,070
What is that?

447
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:05,990
It's n-nothing.

448
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,870
What is it?

449
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:20,450

450
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:28,420
I couldn't sleep... so I was going to smoke just one.

451
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,910
I'll really quit now.

452
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:47,740
I h-haven't smoked it yet.

453
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:53,100
I-I w-will never do anything to upset you.

454
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:54,800
Gosh.

455
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,030
A lie.

456
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,870
A lie.

457
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:14,190
Must you... work at this hour?

458
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:16,100
Do it tomorrow.

459
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,440
I'm a little busy tomorrow.

460
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,550
Honey.

461
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:30,830
When are we going to make our baby?

462
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:32,770
You go to sleep first.

463
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,250
Why, of all times!

464
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,680
What is this?

465
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,710
W-Where did it go?

466
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:35,900
Did I... n-not plug it in earlier?

467
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,590
Wait a minute.

468
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:42,800
What is this?

469
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,710
Ah, damn!

470
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,010
What are you doing?

471
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:26,120
I thought I saw a cockroach.

472
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:36,740
Is that right? I better spray some roach repellent.

473
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:44,790
If you see one cockroach, there are actually hundreds in hiding.

474
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:46,510
Right?

475
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:09,380
Yesterday, you were looking for something on the terrace.

476
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,920
Cigarettes.

477
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:17,290
Did you smoke again?

478
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:19,510
No, I found them and threw them out,

479
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:21,490
to quit smoking.

480
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,050
- Auntie. 
 - Yes?

481
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:32,750
We better put down some roach repellent.

482
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:36,990
He says he saw a cockroach on the terrace.

483
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:39,800
Shouldn't we call a company or something?

484
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:45,210
There aren't any in the kitchen though.

485
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:48,530
It's not that bad...

486
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:52,890
I could've been mistaken...

487
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:23,810
 By chance, did Yeo Joo find out something?

488
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:26,500
 Why is she that chilly?

489
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,960
I'm a little late.

490
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:36,920
I'll see you later.

491
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:09,220
Honey, I'll see you later.

492
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:15,610
We should go together... I'm gathering materials.

493
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:17,410
Did you forget?

494
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:20,150
Ah, that's right.

495
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:22,930
Wait for me.

496
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:43,590
Honey... I think we need to talk.

497
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:45,250
♫  Your little secret  ♫

498
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:48,190
These days, we were both too busy.

499
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:55,240
♫  I pretended not to know and ignored it  ♫

500
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,130
♫  You got used to it over time  ♫

501
00:54:57,130 --> 00:55:01,350
♫  I'm sure you thought it was perfect  ♫

502
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:05,390
♫  I bet you never even looked back  ♫

503
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:12,420
♫  And I had to watch you do it all 
 I'll make sure you get what you deserve  ♫

504
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:20,720
♫  Feel my cold gaze. I'm never gonna love again  ♫

505
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,030
♫  Try playing around with those lips again  ♫

506
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:28,900
How about a drive? It's been a while. I want to get some fresh air.

507
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,590
Sure!

508
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:31,790
Please get in, Madam!

509
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:37,890
♫  I'm going to let you go, I'm sick of the way you look at me  ♫

510
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:42,000
♫  Love is a lie, go away memories  ♫

511
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,240
♫  I don't want to look for you anymore  ♫

512
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:55,060
♫  Feel my cold gaze. I'm never gonna love again  ♫

513
00:55:55,060 --> 00:56:02,760
♫  Try playing around with those lips again 
 I'm never gonna love again  ♫

514
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:09,160
♫  Sweet temptation like sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

515
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:12,020
Why do we need these for a drive?

516
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:15,970
♫  I fall again sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

517
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:17,980
♫  Leave me alone  ♫

518
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:20,000
♫  There's no use  ♫

519
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,210
♫  Sweet temptation like sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

520
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:28,660
♫  You melt sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

521
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:32,320
♫  I fall again sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

522
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:35,320
♫  Leave me alone  ♫

523
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:49,000
If it's a trap set by Kang Yeo Joo, didn't he get out too easily?

524
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,830
She must have another plan.

525
00:56:53,730 --> 00:56:57,280
It became more dangerous for Han Woo Seong anyway, didn't it?

526
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,610
More than being in a holding cell.

527
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,180
Would she do something reckless when the police are watching?

528
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:16,250
When the National Intelligence Service has her back,

529
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:23,740
what does she have to worry about? Your job is to clean up after Kang Yeo Joo, isn't it?

530
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,550
Don't you agree?

531
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:50,940
Why is our organization being led around by the nose by Kang Yeo Joo?

532
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:54,910
It's not Kang Yeo Joo...

533
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:57,970
We are being led by the nose by Congressman Park.

534
00:57:57,970 --> 00:58:02,280
Kang Yeo Joo's father, Park Jae Geun.

535
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:06,620
He could become the next president.

536
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:09,470
Wouldn't that be enough to make the National Intelligence Service tiptoe around him?

537
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:14,990
As long as she has Park Jae Geun behind her,

538
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:17,560
Kang Yeo Joo is untouchable no matter what she does.

539
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:33,000
Left turn here?

540
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,670
Yes.

541
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:47,850
Wow, the air is nice!

542
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:52,780
How long has it been since the last time we went for a drive like this?

543
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:01,890
But this place... looks familiar.

544
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:06,320
I kind of smell bellflower root, too.

545
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:09,440
It's lanceolate root, not bellflower root.

546
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:16,130
The smell is very strong.

547
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:18,980
This place is famous for lanceolate root.

548
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:30,370
I heard that lanceolate root is better for you than bellflower.

549
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:46,110

550
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:51,400

551
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:56,140
♫  I can't hide it. Let me down  ♫

552
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:04,270
♫  I can't hide it. Let me down  ♫

553
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:08,830
♫  Get away from me  ♫

554
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:17,260
♫  Never mind just get away  ♫

555
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:20,500
 Please don't do this. I was wrong. I was wrong.

556
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:24,160
 It's not just the knife that disappeared. The perfume disappeared as well, didn't it?

557
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,490
Do you know anything about that perfume?

558
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:28,230
 Why did we come to a cemetery?

559
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:30,440
 I'm going to tell you my secret.

560
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,850
 It's an emergency situation. Is it okay to reveal myself?

561
01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:35,960
 - Should I shoot? 
 - I know Kang Yeo Joo the best. If anyone shoots, it's going to be me.

562
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:39,590
 If I don't put an end to him, he'll always become a cause for trouble like that.

563
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:44,460
 It's all because of that wench. She should have watched out for that demure face!

564
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:47,070
 Spider lily's root gets filled with poison in the winter.

565
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:49,580
 Soon, it'll be time to get ugly.

566
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:52,200
♫  After looking at me you  ♫
