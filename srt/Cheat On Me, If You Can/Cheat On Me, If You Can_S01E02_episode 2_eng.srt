1
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,760

2
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,020
This is very nice.

3
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,640
Please, put this inside the dessert.

4
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,220
Yes, Sir.

5
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,650
What should I do about the music?

6
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:40,500
Please make the music dramatic when I pull the ring out. You know what I mean?

7
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,140
- Then we'll start the performance right at that moment. 
 - All right!

8
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,640
Oh, and it's a surprise, so please make sure she doesn't find out.

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,290
- Of course. 
 - Yes.

10
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,880
Thank you.

11
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:57,660

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,620

Your blueberry cake has arrived.

13
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,550
Wow, it looks delicious. Right?

14
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,460
The cakes here aren't very good.

15
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,860
They buy them in bulk.

16
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,830
Isn't that so?

17
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:19,110
I'm not in that department, so... have a good meal.

18
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,290
Thank you.

19
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,460
I heard blueberries are great for your eyes.

20
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,700
Don't you need your eyes to write?

21
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,690
Eat up.

22
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,250
Have some more.

23
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,860
Why? Why do I have to eat more?

24
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,360
Did you put a ring in there?

25
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,100
How did you know?

26
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,330
The cake tastes like iron.

27
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,040
It's not iron, it's gold.

28
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,430
- Let's end it. Our relationship. 
 - What?

29
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,120
Wh... Why?

30
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,000
Why today of all days?

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,610
I even prepared a ring to propose to you.

32
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:22,190
Propose, as if. Propose to the young lady who gifted you those shoes.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,440
Looking at the trendy design, she must be in her early 20s.

34
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,670
If she can buy handmade shoes from Sungsudong, she must be quite well off.

35
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,460
She probably looks good with you.

36
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,410
I'll throw these away right now!

37
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,010
I got them from a friend I knew a while ago.

38
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,020
An old shoemaker who has worked in Sungsudong for 20 years said

39
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:49,270
he designed those shoes himself one month ago.

40
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,990
That's right.

41
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,320
So it wasn't a while ago.

42
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,720
It wasn't a while ago, but it was just a friend I knew.

43
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,140
We have no relationship.

44
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:11,480
It was a graduation gift...

45
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,100
Oh, what a great excuse.

46
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,960
But what can you do? Girls, gifts: that's enough.

47
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,990
Murder and attempted murder are the same to me.

48
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,420
I mean... is receiving a present such a big crime?

49
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,330
That's not a crime.

50
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,430
It's just a small crack.

51
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:41,040
But if those build up, everything crumbles.

52
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,640
Why should I wait for the rainy season to come?

53
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,670
Give it to that girl.

54
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,530
Listen to me!

55
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,760
Oh, right.

56
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,880
I can't return all the presents that you've given me during our time.

57
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,080
I crushed them, ripped them apart, and burned them all.

58
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:18,380

59
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,590
Your legs and arms are so thin!

60
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,060
No, no! I gained weight!

61
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,110
- Something's moving! 
 - Really?

62
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,000
- It's a boy. 
 - Are you listening to us in there?

63
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,980
Hey! Why are you acting like this at a wedding?

64
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,110
Are you at a funeral? Huh?

65
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,530
I told you I sent her an invitation!

66
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,670
But why isn't she coming?

67
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,020
She won't answer my calls or meet me.

68
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,980
I've never seen such a difficult woman.

69
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,000
I really feel like I'm going to die.

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,810
Can't you just congratulate me?

71
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,070
Congrats! Congrats on your wedding.

72
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,470
I'm really jealous of you for the first time in my life.

73
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,480
 - Everybody gather around!  
- Wow, I'm so excited.

74
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,650
 Groom! Groom, where are you?

75
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,270
Let's go take a picture.

76
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,810
 Come on!

77
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,650
 Quickly!

78
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:48,240
Excuse me. I made a mistake at that time.

79
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,770
I know.

80
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:54,130
Please give me a chance.

81
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,260
People aren't like shoes. You can't just fix them.

82
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,640
Wait!

83
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,830
Is this enough?

84
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,510
Are you joking?

85
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,190
Joking?

86
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,570
I feel like I'm going to die.

87
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,440
I even got it notarized.

88
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,810

89
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,010
Noona, please marry me.

90
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,220
Are you sincere?

91
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,790
- Your life... It's really mine? 
 - Yes!

92
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:06,720

93
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:11,530

94
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,420
She kept this all this time.

95
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,810
I had forgotten all about it.

96
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,870
Ow, that stings! It stings!

97
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:44,610
Okay, okay, okay!

98
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,320
Aigoo.

99
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,710
What's wrong now?

100
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,160
I told you not to read the hate comments.

101
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,130
He's not alarmed at all.

102
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,620
What is it? Do they say the murder scene isn't believable?

103
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,750
They said I don't know sh*t about it. Because I haven't been to the military.

104
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,330
You don't kill people in the military.

105
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:14,990
By any chance, is there somebody you would like to get rid of?

106
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,960
 See you tomorrow in Room 1820!

107
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:26,380
I'll kill them for you. I'll even cover for you.

108
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,280
I think what I need is experience.

109
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,260
But... why is this contract...

110
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,270
I got inspiration for my next work.

111
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:47,130

112
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:51,220
"If you cheat, you die!" How is it?

113
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,910
Doesn't it sound like it'll be a thrilling work?

114
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,820
I don't think it'll sell. Who would kill because of cheating?

115
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,270
I would.

116
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,750
This waiver...

117
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:11,520
is still valid. Be careful, Honey.

118
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,830
Why so scary...

119
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,510
I only have you, Honey!

120
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,150
Do you remember the day you put the ring in that cake?

121
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:29,200
Of course. It was the worst day of my life.

122
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,080
It's blowfish soup.

123
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,340
Auntie made it because you like it.

124
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,690
It smells good.

125
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,240
I bought tetrodotoxin that day to kill you. 
  (T/N: s neurotoxin found in pufferfish, porcupinefish, ocean sunfish, and triggerfish)

126
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,370
At that time, I had such little experience that it was the only poison I knew.

127
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:59,940
If it was now, I would have used a completely untraceable poison.

128
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,120
Are you okay?

129
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,900
It's hot.

130
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:16,810
But then... why am I still alive?

131
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:23,450
When I thought about it, I didn't love you enough to want revenge.

132
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:27,870
I dated you because you clung to me. It wasn't love.

133
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,170
It doesn't make me that happy that I'm still alive.

134
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,650
Sorry. That was back then.

135
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,790
What about now?

136
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,080
I love you, Honey.

137
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,230
Enough to kill you.

138
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,310
Eat up, eat up.

139
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,390

140
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,980

141
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,860
She even came to my house to cause trouble...

142
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,320
So why did she disappear?

143
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,000
If your tail is long, you are bound to get stepped on.
 (T/N: More chances you take, more likely you will get caught.)

144
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,940
 Hello. I am Announcer Shin Se Rin who's going to be with you for today's program of Beautiful Morning Talk.

145
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,450
 I am hosting today instead of Miss Baek Soo Jeong who is unavailable due to personal circumstances.

146
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:03,330
She blew off the broadcast. She's causing big trouble.

147
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:07,490
Although I'm not as skilled as her, I will try my best today.

148
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,260
 These days, around me...

149
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:14,030
A live show and she dares to disappear?

150
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,500
She's got to be crazy.

151
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,540
So, today, we'll discuss how to treat insomnia and...

152
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,810
At 2:00 in the morning, while the kids are all asleep,

153
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,910
he brings a bunch of his friends over

154
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:28,170
and tells me to "go buy some alcohol," "make snacks to go with the alcohol," "doesn't taste good so make it again"...

155
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:31,400
Yeah, but I would feel better if my husband drank at home.

156
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,250
Who knows what happens outside the home...

157
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,250
- Our enemies. 
 - Yes, they are enemies.

158
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,690

159
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:42,470
Why is the credit card bill so high?

160
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,220
I should stop drinking or something... I feel awful.

161
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,850
Stop drinking so much.

162
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,050
In Korean society, is it possible to work without alcohol?

163
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,270
Why are you the only one working with alcohol?

164
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:12,230
Doesn't Attorney Han do the grocery shopping before going home?

165
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:17,240
- The reason he does that is all because of— 
 - All because of what?

166
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,020
No, never mind.

167
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,260
Why did you use the credit card so much?

168
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,330
Mom.

169
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,110
Mom, feed me.

170
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,710
- Wait. 
 - Just feed him.

171
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:34,310
I will feed him, but I am asking you why you used the credit card so much?

172
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,230
- Just feed him. 
 - I am asking you why you used the credit card so much?!

173
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,490
Return in good health. 
  (TN: Using very formal speech)

174
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,520
Oh, good boy.

175
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,310
It's not like I am not coming home because I am goofing off.

176
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:54,180
Then you shouldn't nag me to get a promotion.

177
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,770
I need to catch the culprit to raise my price.

178
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,860
If I just keep following you around,

179
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,670
does a culprit fall from the sky already handcuffed?! Do they?

180
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,800
Or you can just handcuff the culprit and bring him yourself!

181
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,370
Why don't you make a neighborhood announcement that you are on a stakeout!

182
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,650
I wasn't talking to you, Honey.  Hang up for now.

183
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,060
- Hey you! Hey! 
 - Why? What?

184
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,940
You dare hit your senior?!

185
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,730
What a load of crap!

186
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,060
"Crap"?!   "Crap" to your big bro?!

187
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,090
That's why I told you to go home!

188
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,270
You know that we just end up fighting and that's why I don't go home!

189
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,730
If you were going to do that, why did you get married?

190
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,850
Then, don't ever get married and live alone all your life!

191
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,700
Never mind.

192
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:33,530
At least just change your socks.  The smell is killing me!

193
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:37,090
Do I have to buy socks for you while on a stakeout?

194
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:40,660
- Did I ask you to buy me socks? 
 - What was I supposed to do when they smell?!

195
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,440
I have clean socks. These are only three days old.

196
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,640
- Three days? 
 - Smell them. 
 - Three days?!  Really!

197
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,300
You must be crazy!  You disgusting punk!  Ah, so suffocating!

198
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,930
"Punk"?

199
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,300
- What?! 
 - He's here.

200
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,940
I said he's here.

201
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:13,140
Put your shoes on and take your time.  I will deliver him to you.

202
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,550
Crazy!

203
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,960
I am here to read the gas meter.

204
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,630
 Please come back another time.

205
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,130
This is already our third time.

206
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:37,120
If you don't let us check this time, then we will have no choice but to shut the gas off.

207
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,490
Are you there?

208
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,980
Ah, really...

209
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:53,340
Cops don't know how to upgrade their tactics.

210
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,320
Ah, that...

211
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,910
Wow, he's damn slow!

212
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:08,550
Come on down!  Why go back up?  Come down.

213
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:13,450
Hey, I don't want to bother with handcuffing you and taking you down so just go back down.

214
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,490
Aren't you going down? Well, aren't you?

215
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,470
You have the right to remain silent.

216
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,910
You can do this and that...

217
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,750
Hey!

218
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,360
Hey, you really...

219
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,840
Hey, don't throw those!

220
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,460
Hey, you crazy wench!

221
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,820
- "Crazy wench"? 
 - What you just said... it can be used!

222
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,650
It can be used against you in court.  You know that, right?

223
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:41,770
You have the right to counsel but you don't have the money to hire a lawyer anyway, right?

224
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,300
- So just— 
 - Hey! Don't!

225
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,590
No, don't do that! Hey!

226
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,900
Ah, really that...

227
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,190
What are you doing throwing that?!

228
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,530
Hurry up and come down!  Hurry down!

229
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:57,180
She will throw something even bigger, really!

230
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,520
Hey, wait!

231
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,070
- Hurry up and come here! 
 - I am going down.

232
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,380
Oh, it's heavy.

233
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,090
Good job.

234
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,900
You really almost died.

235
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,920
She's a lunatic. She's not normal.

236
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,980
How could you throw an iron?!  Are you nuts?!

237
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,070
That...

238
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,540
Does she think that she is still a Hallyu star?! 
   (T/N: a big Korean celebrity)

239
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,910
- For sure, there must have been an accident— 
 - That's none of my concern.

240
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:46,200
Baek Soo Jeong is done in this industry.  I will make sure of that.

241
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,860
I will personally take responsibility and...

242
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,170
You?

243
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:58,900
What pull do you have that

244
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,420
you take the responsibility?! Insolent!

245
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,610
Hey, go.

246
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,040
Go!

247
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,160
Hey!

248
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,500
- Oh, Attorney Han! 
 - Hello.

249
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,900
What brings you here?

250
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,810
I was passing by so I wanted to say hello.

251
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:45,110
Then, you are doing the new program with us, right?

252
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,750
No, my schedule is still...

253
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:52,610
Please work with us.

254
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,960
It doesn't seem like a bar.

255
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:09,570
Where did he spend ₩500,000 ($500)?

256
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,180
Ho... Hotel?

257
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,400
Please just cover this one well for me.

258
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,760
What joy is there coming to work now when I can't even hear about your affairs?

259
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,080
Hey, "he" is here.

260
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,360
- "He"? 
 - Con... sul...

261
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,210

262
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:52,590
- Hello. 
 - Yes.

263
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:55,940
- Do you enjoy playing golf? 
 - Yes.

264
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,570
From now, try sports like marathon running.

265
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:05,160
Ah, should I?  I heard marathon running is good for your health...

266
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,320
It's good for the vote, right?  It is a sport that attracts a lot of people.

267
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,040
Especially, many young people.

268
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,240
That's true.

269
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,080
You will need to redo the office interior.

270
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:22,440
Furniture should be simpler

271
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,660
and unpretentious.

272
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:29,910
From now, this office will appear often in broadcasts.  It's important, right?

273
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,520
Yes.

274
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,860
There is a lot more to do than I thought.

275
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,570
Your opponent is running for the fifth time.

276
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:42,620
I am just a baby chick in this arena.

277
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:46,450
But then again, your opponent will look aged.

278
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,830
Would he?

279
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:54,980
To make it look that way is my job.

280
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:59,470
I'll tell you about our plans gradually.

281
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,710
Okay. Then. Goodbye.

282
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,660
Okay.

283
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,740
Oh, right.

284
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,780
I think you should go to a university and give a lecture today.

285
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,160
A university?

286
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,860
You should meet lots of young people.

287
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,940
That's important, right?

288
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,910

289
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,500
Detective Jang!

290
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,910
Are you Detective Jang Seung Cheol?

291
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:41,110
Do you know him?

292
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,300
No.

293
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:51,460
You know the actress Baek Soo Jeong, right? I'm her manager.

294
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,550

295
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,940
Are you sure she's missing?

296
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,140
I couldn't get in touch with her starting last night.

297
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,000
Last night?

298
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,810
She's not missing. She's probably sleeping in.

299
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:20,980
Wait a little longer and come again later.

300
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,910
She missed the morning broadcast.

301
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:26,670
This could ruin her career!

302
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:30,360
She even came to work on the day her sibling died.

303
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,750
But why did you come looking for me?

304
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,730
A while ago, she...

305
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,160
 - Big Sis! 
 - You came?

306
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,630
 How long have you worked for me?

307
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,220
 Three months.

308
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,560
 Then you're a full-time employee, right?

309
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,160
 Congrats on becoming full-time.

310
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,910
 Thank you. This place is delicious.

311
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:22,930
 Can I ask you for a favor? Please hear me out.

312
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:25,060
 Of course.

313
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,870
 If...

314
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:35,420
 something happens to me...

315
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:42,110
Why would she tell me to find you?

316
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:47,090
"If something happens to me, find him."

317
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:51,180
Then, she knew something would happen to her?

318
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,000
I'm not very sure...

319
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:06,760
But do managers usually know house passwords?

320
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:10,570
Well... this isn't her house, it's her personal studio.

321
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:14,740
Big Sis is scared of her house, so a couple of months ago we bought this apartment.

322
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,040
Let's go in.

323
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,680
Shoes.

324
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,880
Why was she afraid of her house?

325
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,080
It's in a remote location, and she's a woman living alone.

326
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:48,460
She was scared, but she didn't move and just got a new house?

327
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,220
I'm sorry.

328
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,310
I don't know very much about her.

329
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:58,870
I have no right to be her manager.

330
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,830
What did you say?

331
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:07,700
No, how can you back out of it now?

332
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:11,850
Hello? Hello?

333
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,570
What brings you here?

334
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:25,230
I came after seeing this.

335
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,360

336
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,650
Wow.

337
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,290
Are you for real?

338
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,780
Yes, Ma'am.

339
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,440
No.

340
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:45,900
You look a little old and have a face that Writer Kang would dislike.

341
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,310
She doesn't like good-looking people.

342
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:55,900
He even tipped us off when Writer Kang disappeared.

343
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,860
We can get information about her new work

344
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,820
and keep an eye on her and report to us.

345
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,750
You're right.

346
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,470
You're in!

347
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,820
This won't be easy.

348
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,700
Don't call me early in the morning. I'm not going to answer.

349
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,770
Thank you.

350
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:23,210
- You might end up hating me later. 
 - What?

351
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:26,230
Nobody can last a month here.

352
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:28,330
Why?

353
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:32,580
It's  a bit hard to explain,

354
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,850
but it's just like that.

355
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:46,040
Thank you. Yeah, I'm here,

356
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,690
but I don't know what I'm supposed to lecture on.

357
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:53,100
Do I just talk about my life?

358
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,920
Girls?

359
00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:00,920
What are you talking about? These are kids who just got out of their high school uniforms.

360
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,800
A pretty girl?

361
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,220
Pretty girls? Well—

362
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:18,500
Sorry.

363
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,740
Student! Are you okay?

364
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,670
Sorry, sorry.

365
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,740
Follow me.

366
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,380
Yes, Ma'am.

367
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:08,080
Brace yourself and don't be surprised.

368
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,800
Okay? No matter what you see inside.

369
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,420
What? What will I see?

370
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,280
How would I know?

371
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:20,920
It's a relief you don't look like you'd get scared easily.

372
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:33,310
It's that room over there. Go on.

373
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,360
Thank you.

374
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,090
Why did they send a young man who looks like that?

375
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,860
Yeah?

376
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:22,540
Auntie, I think I should go for a modern work next.

377
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,310
How about a yoga instructor?

378
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:30,070
On the way back from learning yoga in India,

379
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:36,330
they bought poison or spices and brought them back.

380
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:45,130

381
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:50,470
CEO Yang sent a spy.

382
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:53,990
I knew something was fishy when she told me I had to work with you.

383
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,480
You're assisting me?

384
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,700
Yes, Ma'am.

385
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:05,220

(T/N: Part of the MeToo movement focusing on school sexual harassment cases)

386
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,450

(T/N: Part of the MeToo movement focusing on school sexual harassment cases)

387
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,760

388
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,490
Wow, I need to get a hold of myself.

389
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,430
Sae Mirae Hall...

390
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:27,520
Is it somewhere around here?

391
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,650
Excuse me. Do you know where the Sae Mirae Hall is?

392
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:35,300
I don't know. How would I know?

393
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,860
Whatever. I'm hanging up. Let's just talk later.

394
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:42,870
You don't know, of course.

395
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:45,790
Are you looking for the New Lecture Hall?

396
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,880
What room are you looking for?

397
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:02,790
7...5... What was it again? One second.

398
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:07,690
Uh... 7508.

399
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:10,940
Oh. 7508?

400
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,860
Good. Follow me.

401
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:18,560
You don't have to. I can find my own way...

402
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:52,090
I normally don't stare at people.  It's tiring.

403
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:57,170
Because I learn too much about them.

404
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:59,490
Okay.

405
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:04,080
You said you work at the convenience store, but is the store yours?

406
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,690
I'm sorry?

407
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:08,100
I am asking are you the owner?

408
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,740
No.

409
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:14,300
Is that so? Then, why are you working there?

410
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,920
- I need the money and... 
 - Money?

411
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,880
You need money?

412
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:24,010
Doesn't everyone need money?

413
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,330
Your work at the convenience store...

414
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:31,230
Does it cover the cost of your shampoo and soap?

415
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:34,380
I'm not exactly sure what you mean.

416
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,330
You know, I'm actually quite sensitive to scents.

417
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:42,190
The scent of the shampoo and soap you're currently using,

418
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,850
I can tell they are excessively expensive.

419
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,000
And that white T-shirt that's been stretched loose at the neck...

420
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,540
That's a pretty expensive one, right?

421
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,090
And it's a simple design, but the watch is a limited edition.

422
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:01,140
It seems like you have a little money.

423
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:06,450
From the injuries on your hand, it seems that you didn't live an uneventful life.

424
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,570
Who are you?

425
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:21,860
As I said before, we are born within the boundaries of the law.

426
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:28,050
When we are young, we are protected by the Child and Youth Protection laws.

427
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:33,900
For family relationships, family law applies.

428
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,210
If you experience unfairness,

429
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:46,330
civil or criminal laws protect us.

430
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:50,550
You all have your identification cards, right?

431
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:54,450
You work at the convenience store that I go to,

432
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:57,880
you got into the publishing company that I work with,

433
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:02,050
and now you're sitting in my library wanting to be my assistant...

434
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,920
Are you a stalker?

435
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:08,070
I'm definitely not a stalker.

436
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,320
Is that so?

437
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,500
I was wrong then.

438
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,900
All right. You can go.

439
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,060
I will be of help to you for sure.

440
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,230
I won't see you out.

441
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,750
Hey, kid, what are you doing now?

442
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:48,010
That's not a toy.

443
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,630
Yesterday, I...

444
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,880
saw something.

445
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,730
Auntie!

446
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:17,450
Ah!  What was that sound?  Did something happen again?

447
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,230
Is this how you do it?

448
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,560
Why don't you try it one more time?

449
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,410
- Like this? 
 - No.

450
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,500
Like this.  From the bottom, up.

451
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,570
That way you can stab the vital spot.

452
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,310
Okay.

453
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:44,570
- Like this. 
 - That's right.

454
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,550
You have a talent.

455
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,870
Is that so?

456
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:52,770
Fiction writing or whatever is a terrible thing. Terrible.

457
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:56,060
I thought something happened so I came in a hurry.

458
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,840
What do you want to drink?

459
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,620
Coffee, please.

460
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,570
I'll have coffee as well.

461
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,920
Get rid of the knife, will you!

462
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,320
It's a prop so you can't get hurt.

463
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,590
It looks like it might last a while this time.  He doesn't seem ordinary.

464
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,600
If the angle isn't right, there's a big chance that you'll fail.

465
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,840
People don't die that easily.

466
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:31,290
Yesterday, I couldn't sleep because of malicious comments and it was this easy all along.

467
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,770
I also saw that comment.

468
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:37,600
But the person who left the comment wasn't actually an expert.

469
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,060
I will have to make a revision for the next edition.

470
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:44,930
Do you really need to go that far when everyone seems to get it wrong?

471
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:48,550
How many writers do you think there are who have killed someone?

472
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:56,780
You said you were in the Special Forces, right?

473
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,400
Yes, I was deployed overseas for a while, too.

474
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,520
I also worked part-time at a detective agency.

475
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,800
So, have you ever killed a person?

476
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:14,500
That's something I can't easily answer.

477
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,010
Law...

478
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:18,820
I know the law is a tough subject to crack, but...

479
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:22,080
In all our lives and our daily lives, too,

480
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:26,870
I wanted to tell you that we all have a close connection.

481
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:30,080
Do you have any questions?

482
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,040
Since there are no questions, this will be the end of today's session.

483
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,090
Good work.

484
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:58,340
Attorney Han!

485
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,910
Excuse me.

486
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,690
 He's coming! He's coming!

487
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,450
 What's your relationship with the female college student?

488
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:10,970
 Does your wife know about this? Will you be resigning?

489
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:13,160
 When did it start?  Please tell us.

490
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,680
 Please answer us!

491
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:20,590
Attorney!

492
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,770
Attorney!

493
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:41,380
 Thank you!

494
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,270
How do I give him this?

495
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,590
Let's do well.

496
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:03,760
I'll work hard.

497
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,790
It's not that I believe in you.

498
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:09,390
It's because I need your help.

499
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:11,500
You're very straightforward.

500
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,640
It would be better not to do anything suspicious.

501
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,150
My skills have never fallen below 20/20.

502
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,460
Oh my god.

503
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,720
Have I been like this the whole time?

504
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,910
- Yes, as far as I remember. 
 - Then why didn't you say something?

505
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,440
What would I have said?

506
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,590
Did you... enjoy this?

507
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:35,860
- No, why is that something I would enjoy? 
 - Then what was it?

508
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:38,220
What's that face? Do you think you saw something you shouldn't have?  That you ruined your eyes?  Is that it?

509
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,490
No. I didn't mean it like that.

510
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,340
She's totally out of her mind.

511
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,550
Yes. It was successful.

512
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:33,460
There isn't any unusual sign but it seems that she doesn't have the topic for her next work.

513
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:37,050
 Be careful.  She is a dangerous woman.

514
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:39,590
Yes. I will contact you again.

515
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,630
What is so dangerous about her?

516
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,980
A tutu, then...

517
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:24,340
Is the main character a ballerina this time?

518
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:28,600
I'm sorry, but I can't show you our lodging information.

519
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,810
Then, please show me the CCTV.

520
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:37,210
I'm sorry, but I can't show you that without a warrant.

521
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:44,260
Going to a university for the first time in a while reminded me of my college days. It was nice.

522
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,580
Yes.

523
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:51,030
But because of the broadcast schedule,

524
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:55,430
doing a lecture next week will be a bit difficult for me.

525
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:57,800
Yes, okay.

526
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,240
Yes. Goodbye.

527
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,730
There's no broadcast next week.

528
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:07,410
Why? There weren't any pretty female students?

529
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,230
Grow up.

530
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:13,340
How old are you that you're still talking about young female students?

531
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,640
I can't believe I'm getting that advice from you. Makes me want to drink. Wow.

532
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:19,650
I'm not who I used to be.

533
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:23,960
It doesn't matter if I meet a student who's pretty and has long straight hair.

534
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,870
Are they women?

535
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:33,580
If they are university students, then they're just newborn babies.

536
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:36,720
They just barely graduated high school.

537
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,240
Can't you like them in an uncle/niece kind of way?

538
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,940
What the heck is uncle/niece or friends

539
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,230
between a man and a woman? Talk sense, will you?

540
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:48,530
Why are you over-reacting? Did I say you should date her?

541
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:03,130
Mom, what are you doing?

542
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:05,610
Nothing.

543
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:08,710
Aren't you going to make dinner? I'm hungry.

544
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:11,220
I'm out of my mind.

545
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:14,740
I'll make dinner soon.

546
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:22,220
Can you really run for the National Assembly? 
  (TN: Similar to Congress in the U.S.)

547
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:25,230
You're total trash when it comes to women.

548
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:29,410
You mean "sexy" trash.

549
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:48,330
There's nothing different between you and me.

550
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:51,030
You're cheating with your eyes right now.

551
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:55,350
I just kind of follow up with my body.

552
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:56,760
It's a thin line.

553
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,940
That is a big difference, you know.

554
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:01,480
According to the law, you're like this.

555
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:06,620
The law? That'd be a problem if it got there.

556
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:10,430
Think about it. I feel sorry about it, and so I'm better to my wife.

557
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:13,820
And because I'm good to my wife, our home is happy. It's a virtuous cycle.

558
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:17,050
You said Baek Soo Jeong came looking for you. Is that a virtuous cycle? It's an evil one.

559
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,590
It's because she's strange.

560
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,890
With all the other girls, it ended really cleanly.

561
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:24,000
Is it possible to end things cleanly between a man and a woman?

562
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,720
Nothing's "cool" between a man and a woman.

563
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,670
I ate well!

564
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:34,370
Hey! We have a moderator for tomorrow, so

565
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:36,810
- don't forget. 
 - Fine, fine. Go.

566
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:37,910
All right.

567
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:39,780
In 20 minutes?

568
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:44,320
Okay.

569
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,900
Attorney Han!

570
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,070
You guys go inside first.

571
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:53,620
Oh.

572
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,730
Seems like you drank a lot.

573
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,560
Attorney Park.

574
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,880
Our cool Attorney Park, what brings you here?

575
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,760
Company dinner.

576
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,480
This is great timing, I have a question for you.

577
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,250
Huh?

578
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:15,480
I met some reporters from Dong Min Daily yesterday for some drinks.

579
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,930
Who did you say was the reporter from Dong Min Daily that was on our tail?

580
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:24,520
The... name...

581
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,890
- Hey! 
 - "Hey"?

582
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:29,890
I was the salutatorian at the training institute.

583
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:32,850
And your scores were always much lower than mine.

584
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:35,930
And on top of that, you're a married man. The more I think of it, the more ridiculous it is.

585
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:38,550
What's wrong with you, Attorney Park?

586
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:41,280
You dare dump me in that way?

587
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:45,490
I had a reason.

588
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:47,310
I heard you're going into politics.

589
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:48,670
How did you know that?

590
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:52,350
Don't chase wild dreams. You'll never get that seat.

591
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:55,050
I'm going to be on the opposing team.

592
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,500
Attorney Park! Attorney Park!

593
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:04,250
We ended it so well. What's wrong with her?

594
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:10,700

595
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,030
Are you an attorney?

596
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:24,080
No. I just work in the office.

597
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:37,870

598
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,710
Did something happen?

599
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:50,230
I'm not so sure myself.

600
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,120
Well, she's been supporting you through this study dorm life for five years. It makes sense.

601
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,280
It's about time.

602
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:03,230
She even took the day off from work. It's obvious what she's here to stay.

603
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:08,060
She even made food for you because she felt bad.

604
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:24,670
Mom, why did you marry Dad?

605
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,640
Because I loved him.

606
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,580
Does love feed you? 
  (T/N: Proverb that means love isn't all you need in life)

607
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:36,070
Where did you learn that?

608
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:39,610
- You should have gotten married to Attorney Han. 
 - What?

609
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:43,760
He makes a lot of money and even goes on TV.

610
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,020
All Dad does is drink every night.

611
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:52,080
But if I never met your dad,

612
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:56,030
I wouldn't have met you!

613
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:13,210
Is it bad?

614
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:17,830
No, it's delicious.

615
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:23,830
I saw that expression a lot while in the military.

616
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:26,630
They were all going through a breakup.

617
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,130
You said you had something to say.

618
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:40,110
I'm ready for it.

619
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:47,940
I know your exam is coming up soon, but...

620
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:54,400
- we no longer... 
 - You're right...

621
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,040
Let's break up.

622
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:03,180
Oppa.

623
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,650
Thank you.

624
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:30,930
Excuse me, Ma'am! Can I buy some grapes?

625
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:33,560
For your kids?

626
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:37,520
- Because my wife likes them. 
 - You are so sweet.

627
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:45,500
Don't cry for a guy like me.

628
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:49,160
Have a great life.

629
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:56,610
Meet someone with a lot of money

630
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:01,740
and talent.

631
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:08,860
- Yoon Hee. 
 - Live well?

632
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:11,530
How?!

633
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:15,160
I'm already four months pregnant,

634
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:17,480
but you want me to meet someone else?

635
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,180
Baby? Whose?

636
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:23,840
- My baby? 
  - If it's not yours,

637
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:28,360
are you saying that I cheated on you?

638
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,300
Oppa!

639
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:46,110
Why did you come outside?

640
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:47,940
What's that?

641
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,650
For Dong Ho.

642
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:56,630
- What about dinner? Have you eaten? I made kimchi soup. 
 - Wow.

643
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:59,010
It's always kimchi soup.

644
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:07,730
Oppa, by any chance...

645
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:10,440
What?

646
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:15,960
It's nothing.

647
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:19,540
Here.

648
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,430
You got a bonus?

649
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:30,110
No. It's for my credit card bill.

650
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:34,410
We have a client who lives out in the country, so I used my card to get a hotel room for them.

651
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:36,360
 Here.

652
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:40,230
 Hey! How much did you even use?

653
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:43,400
 My wife told me the credit card bills were huge.

654
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,480
 You didn't tell her I borrowed the money, did you?

655
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:49,500
 If I did that, she would go straight to your wife.

656
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,630
 Just help me out this once.

657
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:53,850
 I won't borrow your card in the future.

658
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:58,390
 Aw, what fun will work be now? I won't get to hear your stories about cheating anymore.

659
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:00,300
 Nice, you put an extra one in here.

660
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:06,890
I see.

661
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:09,960
Shouldn't you use your savings for something like that?

662
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:13,850
It's tight enough to pay off our loans. Savings? What savings?

663
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:22,350
Oppa, should we...

664
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:26,720
do it today?

665
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:32,370
What's wrong with you?

666
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:36,880
Family shouldn't do that to each other.

667
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:43,700
  There was nothing to suspect.

668
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:47,600
- Oppa, Dong Ho's sleeping! 
 - What're you trying to do?

669
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,360
- Dong Ho's sleeping. 
 - Okay.

670
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:55,240
Yes, I saw Baek Soo Jeong yesterday near dawn.

671
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:59,180
She was arguing with someone on the phone.

672
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:03,760
I do not know who she was arguing with, but it seemed like a woman.

673
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,110
  Whose fault do you think this is?

674
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:07,880
While I was rotting away in America,

675
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:12,440
who was the one living a happy life with a young husband?

676
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:20,720
Seeing as to how you're showing off, it seems like you don't know what's going on.

677
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,060
  Your husband...

678
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:30,890
  Forget it, let's speak in person.

679
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:37,390
After she said that, she left right away.

680
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,530
You sure have a good memory.

681
00:54:41,530 --> 00:54:47,390
I heard that Baek Soo Jeong lives around here, but it was my first time seeing her in person.

682
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:49,960
I wanted to get an autograph.

683
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:54,190
Which door did she use to head out?

684
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:56,980
That door there.

685
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:02,720
Even if we go through the CCTV, there won't be anything.

686
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:06,960
It's nearby. Somewhere within walking distance.

687
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:14,900
If she were to take her car, she would've left using the store's other door;

688
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:18,540
because if she were going to the underground parking lot, she would need to take the elevator.

689
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,220
This is going to be a lot easier than I thought it would be.

690
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:23,760
There aren't that many stores open late in this area.

691
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,740
Being a celebrity, she wouldn't want to stand out.

692
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:29,770
Let's finish up and go for a drink.

693
00:55:29,770 --> 00:55:32,470
- Wait a second. 
 - What?

694
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,310
Are you paying?

695
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:38,700
You cheapskate!

696
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:43,400
You have to answer if you want me to follow you.

697
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,240
Hurry up!

698
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:47,540

699
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:50,380
Why are you buying all this?!

700
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:52,830
I told you to buy a kimchi refrigerator.

701
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:57,730
This year, all the kimchi froze so you won't even be able to eat it.

702
00:55:58,370 --> 00:56:01,260
I already ordered one. The kind with drawers.

703
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,810
Is that right?

704
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:07,040
The one with drawers is great.

705
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:12,460
Well then, tomorrow I'll make the kimchi.

706
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:15,650
And with the aged kimchi, I'll make dumplings!

707
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,010
I want to eat your dumplings.

708
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:20,410
It's strange, isn't it?

709
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:24,900
I've been eating them since I was 6, but I don't get sick of them.

710
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:28,450
Madam also liked my dumplings so much that—

711
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:34,400
Before the fridge comes in,

712
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,000
I should totally clean out the basement.

713
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:11,200
Should I clean out the refrigerator?

714
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:21,820
What is this?

715
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:31,300
What is this?

716
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:36,060
Is it kimchi sauce?

717
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:39,510
Seriously.

718
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:42,620
  Auntie!

719
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:45,250
Yes. What?

720
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:48,410
The broth is boiling.

721
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:53,840
I must've lost my mind. Oh my goodness.

722
00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:31,720
Excuse us. We're the police.

723
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:36,560
You know Baek Soo Jeong, right?

724
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:21,830
I remember. They came late last night.

725
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:25,730
I rang the bell and they did not come for their order.

726
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:29,310
So I had no choice but to take it to them.

727
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:33,870
  I will make sure you get divorced.

728
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:43,410
I just happened to overhear so I'm not sure what they were talking about,

729
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:46,210
but I am sure they mentioned divorce.

730
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,930
Do you remember anything else?

731
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:53,120
I don't know. I just went to drop off their drinks.

732
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:56,380
Do you remember who she met with?

733
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:04,530
Can we see the CCTV over there?

734
01:00:05,070 --> 01:00:06,610
One, two. One, two.

735
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:08,230
- One, two. 
 - Careful.

736
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:10,460
Slowly, slowly.

737
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,670
Who delivers so late at night?

738
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:18,680
Orders are being delayed and there aren't enough drivers.

739
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,370
We're struggling, too. Sorry for the inconvenience.

740
01:00:20,370 --> 01:00:21,800
- Where should we put it? 
 - Over here.

741
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,350
Okay, let's go.

742
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,630
She's coming in.

743
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:35,290
It seems like they know where the CCTV camera is.

744
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:45,820
What is that shiny thing over there?

745
01:00:49,870 --> 01:00:53,050
It looks like she's playing with something in her hands.

746
01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:11,240
Last night, Baek Soo Jeong returned to her apartment.

747
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:13,370
The guard on duty saw her,

748
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:16,490
but there's no trace of her leaving.

749
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:18,900
Wait a second.

750
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:23,340
- Let's confirm. 
 - Confirm what?

751
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:25,080
It's in the car, isn't it?

752
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:29,700
- The luminol? 
 - Come on. I'll buy the next meal.

753
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:31,550
My gosh.

754
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:35,120
- Careful not to bump into that. 
 - Watch the ceiling!

755
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,370
Grab it over there.

756
01:01:36,370 --> 01:01:38,160
Got it.

757
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,800
A little lower.

758
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:42,340
Get it from the back.

759
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:55,160
Wow, it's nice and tall.

760
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,330
Yes, it's the kind with drawers.

761
01:01:57,330 --> 01:02:01,370
Wow, you have a lot of refrigerators in this house!

762
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:13,770
One, two, three.

763
01:02:14,970 --> 01:02:16,920
One, two.

764
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:21,850
Is that all the strength you guys can use?

765
01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:24,010
What did you put in here for it to be so heavy?

766
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:27,500
- It should be empty.  
 - There's no way it's empty.

767
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,910
Now, turn off the lights.

768
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:50,240
If it's this much blood...

769
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,880
It'd be difficult to stay alive.

770
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,650
All righty...

771
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,290
Nice!

772
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,960
I definitely took everything out.

773
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:13,270
I really don't think there's anything in here.

774
01:03:22,190 --> 01:03:29,310

775
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:35,090

776
01:03:35,090 --> 01:03:39,400
♫  I'm never gonna love again  ♫

777
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:43,210
♫  Try making fun of that mouth again  ♫

778
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:47,770
♫  I'm never gonna love again  ♫

779
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:52,340
♫  Sweet temptation like sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

780
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:55,470
♫  You melt sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

781
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:57,030
 Baek Soo Jeong is missing.

782
01:03:57,030 --> 01:03:58,340
 It should've been captured on the CCTVs.

783
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:00,880
 If the investigation starts, isn't everything going to be revealed?

784
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,630
 Who's the guy in sweats lurking around?

785
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:03,860
 Is he a married man?

786
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:05,380
 - Did you see their face? 
 - I did.

787
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:07,730
 What if an independence movement fighter is a serial killer?

788
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:08,910
 That doesn't make any sense!

789
01:04:08,910 --> 01:04:10,580
 Are you crazy?

790
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:15,010
 I want to look charismatic and sexy to you at all times.

791
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:18,890
 It's the same scent. Citrus and ambergris.

792
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:21,100
 A young woman. A gift. It's obvious.

793
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:22,170
 He's hiding something.

794
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:23,500
 I met some detectives.

795
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,500
 What do you think I saw?

796
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:29,300
♫  I bet you never even looked back  ♫
