1
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,450

2
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,800
Honey,

3
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,630
have you ever given a ride to a woman?

4
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,550
N-No, I haven't. Why?

5
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:38,910
It's nothing.

6
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:48,880

7
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,950
 What is that? That expression?

8
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,280
Cha Soo Ho,

9
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,230
put your gun down.

10
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,420
Why are you looking for me?

11
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,650
What do you want to know?

12
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,510
It's been a long time since I was assigned to Kang Yeo Joo.

13
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,290
Black?

14
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,030
Where's my wife right now?

15
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,430
She's in the garden, watering the flowers.

16
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,020
All right.

17
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,750
No, not the study. She's outside.

18
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,570
Ah, right.

19
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,900
She erased it all.

20
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:19,200
Chief Ma knows Kang Yeo Joo best. Why are you looking for me?

21
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,560
What is that bastard, Chief Ma, planning?

22
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,350
I'm not acting under Chief Ma's orders.

23
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,610
Then, why are you digging up information?

24
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,570
You weren't even ordered to.

25
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,710
Because it's my duty.

26
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,740
Drink some tea.

27
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,320
My goodness...

28
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,460
Did something good happen?

29
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,910
No.

30
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,770
A complicated situation has been cleared up a little.

31
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,480
Was something bothering you?

32
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:20,250
Auntie, do you remember when I failed the police exam?

33
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,220
Police exam?

34
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,540
Oh!

35
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,260
I was so worried about you back then.

36
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,960
Before the results came out, I was worried to death about failing.

37
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,820
But after failing,

38
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,070
I felt calm.

39
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,900
That's exactly how I feel right now.

40
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,500
What was your assignment?

41
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,640
Why were you watching her?

42
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,270
If you can't shoot, just put it away.

43
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:04,120
It would create a problem for you if you made noise to disrupt the neighbors, wouldn't it?

44
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,830
Especially if you want to continue to appreciate the garden in that house.

45
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,690
I'm slowly becoming bored with just watching.

46
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:20,900
Kang Yeo Joo's writing a new novel these days, right? Do you know what it's about?

47
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,260
Are you trying to bargain?

48
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,270
Thank God you failed the exam.

49
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:44,620
Really, a police officer? That's so dangerous.

50
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,920
Everything beyond your blankets is dangerous.

51
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,670
I take it back. There's danger under the blankets, too.

52
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:56,580
Who knows if the person sleeping with you under the same blanket is a serial killer?

53
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:02,160
This again? Why do you say such scary things every time you open your mouth?

54
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,950
I'm heading inside.

55
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,610
Auntie.

56
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,300
What?

57
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,300
Auntie, you're not tricking me about anything, are you?

58
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,840
What?

59
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,210
Why would you say that?

60
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:20,660
What do I have to gain by tricking you?

61
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,050
I know. I'm just asking.

62
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,030
Other than the title, nothing has been revealed about Kang Yeo Joo's new book.

63
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,120
What's the title?

64
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,650
"If you cheat, you die."

65
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:57,530
Now tell me about your assignment from ten years ago.

66
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,150
I'm starting to get sleepy.

67
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,380
Ten years ago...

68
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,280
It was so boring.

69
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,810
 All I did was go through the trash every day.

70
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:17,880
 I would report on the plot of the story Kang Yeo Joo was writing.

71
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,750
 Don't most women like sweet romance stories?

72
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:29,300
 But all Kang Yeo Joo wrote about was murder, revenge, blood, and dismemberment.

73
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,130
 Once, I found out that Kang Yeo Joo had purchased TTX. 
 (T/N: Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a potent neurotoxin.)

74
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,780
 That caused a big uproar.

75
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,070
 Why would she buy tetrodotoxin?

76
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,440
She wanted to kill her boyfriend.

77
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,890
What?

78
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,480
She suspected that he was cheating on her.

79
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:08,670
She formed a very meticulous plan to poison his wine.

80
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,850
Is that boyfriend alive today?

81
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,600
 He married Kang Yeo Joo, without any fears.

82
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,720
 How dangerous of a person is Kang Yeo Joo?

83
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,340
 She's done a lot of strange things,

84
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,030
 but nothing improper has ever been revealed.

85
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,640
Honey, aren't you going to sleep?

86
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,260
I thought flowers shouldn't be watered at night.

87
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,180
I think I'll be a bit busy tomorrow morning.

88
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,700
Wow.

89
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,980
The flowers have finally bloomed.

90
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,400
It's pretty.

91
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,060
Do you know what this flower's nickname is?

92
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,570
What?

93
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,830
Bloodstained finger.

94
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,620
What?

95
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:11,400
They say that when you eat it, you see a brilliant yellow before dying.

96
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:15,280
They say the taste isn't bad either.

97
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,830
The flower became famous after a housewife boiled it into a tea,

98
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,420
for her despicable husband.

99
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,360
Be careful. The flower behind you is the wolf flower.

100
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,170
If the petals touch you, we have to call 911. It's inconvenient.

101
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,580
It's a historic and reliable poison.

102
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,630
I like to use classic murder methods.

103
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,290
Aren't these too dangerous to grow at home?

104
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,680
I'm growing them because they're dangerous.

105
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:15,460
  Kang Yeo Joo is a crazy murderer.

106
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,450
A crazy murderer?

107
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,800
If not that, she's a very troubled woman.

108
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,570
That's what the person who psychoanalyzed her said.

109
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,090
What bullshit is that.

110
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,180
Those are all useless predictions.

111
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,270
Don't you think so?

112
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,330
Nothing much happened after she married,

113
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,160
but why are we keeping tabs on her?

114
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:47,570
This marriage is quiet, but...

115
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,340
Excuse me?

116
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,060
There was a previous marriage?

117
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,650
Kang Yeo Joo married more than once?

118
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,200
But there was only one marriage registration.

119
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,220
I want to read Kang Yeo Joo's new novel.

120
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,980
It's still in the early stages.

121
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,470
Okay.

122
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,380
That's a shame.

123
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:39,100
 I can't communicate with anyone and... I am afraid.

124
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,350
 The people here... even carry guns.

125
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:47,990
It's too quiet... and he hasn't been calling either.

126
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,350
I have a bad feeling about this.

127
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,630
Where is the USB?

128
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,910
Gu... Gun!

129
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,060
Who are you?!

130
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,450
Why are you doing this to me?

131
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,880
Please spare my life!

132
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,210
It tastes good.

133
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,030
Banana!

134
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,380
I'm sick of it!

135
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,050
Black bean noodles!

136
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,550
Sweet and sour pork...

137
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,490
He ran away, Sir.

138
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,600
 What about the object?

139
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,540
I'm sorry, Sir.

140
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:26,410
You... find it right away.

141
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:33,300
Kill him or let him live, bring me the USB.

142
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,000
Sister Soo Jeong,

143
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,950
I am sorry.

144
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,610
I was going to reveal your death with this...

145
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,550
Shall I confirm it now?

146
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:17,160
Events that took place that I didn't know about.

147
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:42,300
 You... might not be her first husband.

148
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,620
Do you already know or...

149
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,350
are you being fooled?

150
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,810
What about "being fooled"?

151
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:54,230
- Excuse me? 
 - You said "being fooled," didn't you?

152
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,340
Writer's stories... that the readers are easily fooled by them.

153
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,840
Writer, she's in her study. Right?

154
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,890
She left long ago.

155
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,940
Where to, so early in the morning?

156
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,600

157
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,430

158
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:27,820

159
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:53,660
 When we are young, we are protected by the Children and Youth Protection Act.

160
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:59,130
 In a family relationship, we are protected by the Family Law.

161
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:23,180
Did you meet here?  The two of you?

162
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,170
 Attorney Han!

163
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:54,000
It must have been like a scene from a movie.

164
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,460
How can I help you?

165
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,010
I need to confirm something, please.

166
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,790
It's a sunny morning already.

167
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,920
Do you have any sunscreen?

168
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,680
Here.

169
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,030
You should use a good one.

170
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,370
It's better than it looks.  It smells delicious as well.

171
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,600
Mi Rae, then, me too...

172
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,830
Thank you.

173
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,370
- Let's go. 
 - Yes.

174
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,430
- Yes. 
 - Hey, wait for me!

175
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,510
Finally, I know who you are.

176
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:58,990
Now that I put all the puzzle pieces together, all that is left is to straighten them out.

177
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,660
 Ah, I should've worn a pair of shorts!

178
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,640
 Why is it so hot?

179
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,520
 We'll be boiled alive!

180
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,650
 Right?

181
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:12,020
♫   Time stood still   ♫

182
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,580
♫   when I saw you   ♫

183
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:24,760
♫   When I saw you   ♫

184
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:31,010
Why in the world do young girls nowadays like a peach scent?

185
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,230
Attracts fruit flies...

186
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,130
They were captured by the store's CCTV.

187
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,770

188
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,400
The pictures came out clear.

189
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,550
- But Attorney Park really doesn't want to settle? 
 - No, she doesn't.

190
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,060
She will lose for sure if we go to court.

191
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,030
What does she have that she doesn't want to settle?

192
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,900
Don't you know?

193
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,440
"I will crush you."

194
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,930
"I will crush you!"

195
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,730
You're saying she's taking her revenge on me or something?

196
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:09,090
There will be frost in the month of May or June. 
  (T/N: Refers to a Korean saying, "A woman's vengeance can cause frost in the month of May or June.")

197
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:12,630
It's not like Attorney Park is a kid.  She should separate business from personal life.

198
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:17,140
Separate business from personal, my foot.  Let's say if Attorney Park goes to your wife

199
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,140
- and takes care of things personally, what will you do then? 
 - Come on...

200
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,750
Attorney Park can't be that irrational.

201
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,990
She's being irrational right now, Attorney Han Woo Seong.

202
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,870
Hello?

203
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:39,760
Honey, where are you?

204
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,430
At your office?

205
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,650
Is Jin Ho there as well?

206
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:48,130
Ah, that's right!  I forgot to tell him.

207
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,140
Just a minute, please.  I will ask him now.

208
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:50,790
What?

209
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:56,270
My wife wants to have dinner together the day after tomorrow.

210
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,130
Why?

211
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,300
I don't know.  She just wants to have a meal together, that's all.

212
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,520
No... No matter what, I have a prior engagement.  I can't.

213
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,630
What do I tell her then?

214
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:07,830
I don't know! You come up with an excuse.

215
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,550
Hello.

216
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:16,620
Ah, unfortunately, he has a prior engagement.

217
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,550
No. No, why would he avoid you?

218
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,470
No, no.

219
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,780
Because I'm afraid.

220
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,360
Yes, I got it.

221
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,570
Yes, Honey. Yes.

222
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,590
Why, all of a sudden, does she want to have a meal together?

223
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,670
She has never done that before.

224
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,770
I don't know.

225
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,450
I have no idea what she wants either.

226
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:42,560
You're her husband, that's you!  Who would know if you don't?

227
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:46,070
It's your wi-wife.

228
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,680
What do I do?

229
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,880
Answer it.

230
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,620
If you don't, she will come here.

231
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,380
Ah, hello.

232
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:04,010
What a shame.  The day after tomorrow, it's my mother-in-law's birth—

233
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,480
You spoke with Yoon Hui?

234
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:18,030
My mother-in-law's birthday is next week?

235
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,790
I am so forgetful lately.

236
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:25,330
Very forgetful...

237
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:28,270
Next week... No, no, I will see you the day after tomorrow.

238
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,830
Yes, yes.

239
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,520
Goodbye.

240
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,530
 They are here!  Here!

241
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,080
 - Quick, quick! 
 - Hey, start shooting!

242
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,870
 Shoot!

243
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,560
 Move forward!

244
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,900
 Who is in there?

245
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,260
 Excuse me, sir!

246
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,900
 - Stay back! 
 - Why won't you let us film?

247
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,830
 Get back!

248
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,650
Actress Baek Soo Jeong's corpse

249
00:20:53,650 --> 00:21:00,970
  just arrived at the funeral hall. The late Baek Soo Jeong, who was found dead at the Han River in the late afternoon last Monday,

250
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,290
 has been transferred to this funeral hall at Han River Hospital

251
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:06,030
 after the completion of the autopsy by the National Forensic Service.

252
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,450
 The funeral is expected to be held soon.

253
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:12,910
 The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, through a press conference,

254
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:18,350
 announced that they received an initial opinion of death due to excessive bleeding from a cut to carotid artery, based on the NFS' test result.

255
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:22,820
 They expect the final result next week.

256
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,900
 In other news, the prime suspect, Manager Kim, is said to have fled to the Philippines.

257
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,050
 KBN News, this is Jeong Hye Jin.

258
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,860
 Con-Confirm?

259
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,810
Ah, it's been twenty years, so...

260
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:02,160
I am not sure...

261
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,180
Did she ha... have plastic surgery?

262
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:15,450

263
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:19,160
This is right.  It's Baek Soo Jeong.

264
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:27,770
I worked up some numbers.  For a funeral parlor, most people nowadays go with 60 pyeong. 
  (T/N: 1 pyeong is approximately 35.58 square feet or 3.30 square meter.)

265
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:31,260
Hey, don't think about ripping me off!

266
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,440
Why is such a big space necessary, huh?

267
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,230
Flowers, limousine...

268
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,660
We don't need any of that.

269
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,510
A lot of people now—

270
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:45,320
Is the best here 240 pyeong?

271
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,990
Anyway, give me the biggest.

272
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,000
Hey, Lady!  Who are you to...!

273
00:22:54,630 --> 00:23:01,130
Wait, uh!  Yoon Hyeong Sook, right?

274
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:05,320
Flowers at the front of the altar. The limousine will be a Lincoln.

275
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,740
Clothing for the deceased is to be made with 100% Andong fabric. 
  (T/N: Most expensive fabric for deceased clothing).

276
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,220
You are really... movie actress... Yoon Hyeong Sook...

277
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,710
Right?

278
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,630
I stopped acting long ago.

279
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,970
I am the CEO of Soo Jeong's agency.

280
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,700
Wow!

281
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:30,960
Ah, but... my Soo Jeong... left behind some inheritance. Right?

282
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,570
But why... would her agency... manage that...?

283
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:38,450
Provide the best for everything, please.

284
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,560
So that she can at least go in style.

285
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:46,250
She grew up getting beaten up every day by this trash.

286
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,250
What do you mean, "trash"?!

287
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:53,260
Be quiet.  Escort him outside quietly.

288
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:57,130
Soo Jeong, she lived all her life in chaos.

289
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:00,250
At least, let's have a quiet funeral.

290
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,370
Can't you just advance ₩30,000,000 ($30,000) for me?  Just ₩30,000,000?

291
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,820
Wait, wait! It's really urgent!  Let go!

292
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:16,030
What about Kang Yeo Joo's movements?

293
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,800
Nothing special, Sir.

294
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,940
 Any women in Chief Ma's life?

295
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:26,500
 It didn't seem like he had any. He's not married and he doesn't have a girlfriend, either.

296
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,390
 He's not married and doesn't have a girlfriend, either,

297
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,980
 but why is he wearing a ring?

298
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,100
Do you have anything more to say?

299
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:50,200
Sorry?  No, I don't.

300
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,060
- If you don't have anything more to say, leave. 
 - Yes, Sir.

301
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,620

302
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,140
He doesn't seem like he is the type to be loyal to Chief Ma, either...

303
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,300
I will soon bring him over to our side.

304
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,840

305
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,700
You got a letter. Should I take it to your study?

306
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,200
No. Let me have it.

307
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,140
When did I get this?

308
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,800
Just now, I took it out of the mailbox.

309
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:26,550

310
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,820

311
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,020
 I'm getting married.

312
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:42,150
 If I'm not busy, I will attend.

313
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:50,640
 Don't feel pressured.  I thought you should at least know who your future son-in-law is.

314
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:04,260
Why? Did something get delivered wrong?

315
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,740
No.

316
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,760
 It's all over now.

317
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:18,170
I thought it was all over then.

318
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,260
Ah, that...

319
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,490
How could you make such an important decision without discussing it with me?!

320
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:37,590
Ah, whatever! How can I back out now?

321
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:42,600
How about... we celebrate mother-in-law's birthday a little earl—

322
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,400
Okay, bye.

323
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,940
Are you going to the funeral?

324
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,890
Yes, with you.

325
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,450
With me?

326
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:03,360
I've never even met Baek Soo Jeong. Why would I go?

327
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,160
If I go alone, people will notice.

328
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,030
You are in the legal profession.  How could you—?

329
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,650
Wow, seriously!

330
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:25,140
But why is the atmosphere at a funeral like this?

331
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,230
It seems that the CEO of Soo Jeong's agency came, too.

332
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:32,060
Apparently, she has a close relationship with a famous gangster.

333
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:36,970
Then... what I saw on Celebrity X-File is true?

334
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,750
Come here!

335
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,720
Hurry up and come here!

336
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,300
Thank you for coming.

337
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:50,190
I am sorry.  I am sorry.

338
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,130
Poor thing...

339
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:57,860
She finally got back on her feet...

340
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,960
just when she was doing all right...

341
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,700
Oh no, no!

342
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,230
Soo Jeong!

343
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,930
How upset you must be!

344
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:17,470
And I feel the same.

345
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,180
But you and our Soo Jeong,

346
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,960
what is your relationship?

347
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:44,030
It's not much of a relationship.

348
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:48,020
Well...

349
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,730
Excuse me!

350
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,720
Please have some spicy beef soup before you go.

351
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,720
We are busy so...

352
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,140
I prepared a lot of food...

353
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,670
but there aren't any mourners...

354
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,360
who are hungry...

355
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:52,160
I will divide the wall for you.

356
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,190
You three, that way.  You can do it all the way to the bend.

357
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,720
- Understood. 
 - You two work here.

358
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,290
- Understood. 
 - Yes, Ma'am. 
 - And you two, here.

359
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:02,890
And you can do it from here up to there.

360
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,670
All of that?

361
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:10,780
I will help you.

362
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:14,540
Hey, as for you, you see that over there...

363
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,820
that is where you need to work.

364
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:29,090
 What should I paint?

365
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,220
Should I paint a river?

366
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,580
♫  We are here  ♫

367
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,980
♫  We are here now  ♫

373
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:18,730
♫  Sometimes we were Like this   ♫

374
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:23,310
♫  In case we grew further apart  ♫

375
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:28,240

388
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:26,690
It tastes good.

389
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:31,550
Decorative steamed rice cakes, grilled dried pollack; the food is all high class.

390
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:36,570
A celebrity funeral sure is different.

391
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:39,330
Finish up. I have another appointment.

392
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,160
Are you going to meet Manager Nam again?

393
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,400
Yesterday, he told me to lecture.

394
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,400
Today, he told me to paint a mural.

395
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,590
He's saying he knows your weakness.

396
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:51,670
But did you get your wife's permission to go into politics?

397
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,930
I couldn't find the right timing.

398
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,900
She's sensitive these days.

399
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:03,280
I should have gotten involved from the beginning.

400
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,480
I left it up to the cops,

401
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,850
yet they haven't caught the criminal.

402
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:15,100
Stop drinking. At least, have some food with it.

403
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,000
Brother,

404
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,750
Soo Jeong is like my own sister.

405
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,320
You know that, right?

406
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,710
Of course.

407
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:28,350
If she was my close friend, then she is your close friend, too. Right?

408
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,850
That's right.

409
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:34,060
Find him for me.

410
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,720
Who?

411
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:39,510
The one who did that to Soo Jeong.

412
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:45,600
A punk or wench, whoever it is,

413
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,190
find and end his or her life for me.

414
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,090
Do you have to go that far?

415
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,840
Until that happens,

416
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,280
I can't sleep comfortably.

417
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,290
Her killer comfortably eating rice with beans in jail...

418
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,610
How can I stand to look at that?

419
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,470
I think I can live now.

420
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,920
I am talented. I am talented.

421
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,920
It's actually fun.

422
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,590
We called reporters

423
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:03,520
but I don't see any.

424
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,380
- An article about this? 
 - Yes, of course.

425
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:10,160
We came here to paint with the Seoyeon University painting club for that reason.

426
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,800
A mural just makes a good picture overall, doesn't it?

427
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,530
I... haven't even had a chance to tell my wife...

428
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,100
If she finds out I'm doing this...

429
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,920
She might divorce me right away...

430
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,240
You do not need to be concerned about your wife.

431
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,220
I think you're saying that because you don't know my wife, but...

432
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:37,530
From now on, she will wholeheartedly be supporting you.

433
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,960
Just trust me.

434
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,940
What are you painting?

435
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:32,940
I'm sorry.

436
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,170
What are you doing there?

437
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:50,980
Are you a reporter?

438
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,120
Are you not?

439
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,520
If you are not a reporter, how could you take pictures of others without their consent?

440
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,450
Mister!

441
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:01,040
Excuse me!

442
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,040
The road to the cemetery does not have any side road or a traffic camera.

443
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,080

444
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,510
There's a camera at the crossroads.

445
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:11,600
But in order to go to the cemetery, you have to use that road anyway.

446
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,370
Then, can we take a look at the material, please?

447
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,100
Yes.

448
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:29,090
Are you sure that it's Kang Yeo Joo's car?

449
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,540
Yes, that's right. I'm sure.

450
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,940
We checked three times.

451
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,720
Do you think it's a coincidence?

452
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,960
That, in the middle of the night, she went to the cemetery by coincidence?

453
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,100
On the same day no less?

454
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,420
Right...

455
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,700
Yes, hello.

456
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,090
Detective Cha?

457
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,840
What? Baek Soo Jeong's manager?

458
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,080
You son of...

459
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,330
Where are you?

460
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:51,840
Is this the right one?

461
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,790
Yes, it is.

462
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,800
Excuse me. What are you doing?

463
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,390
Oh, so sorry.

464
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:15,040
I am going to buy this.

465
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:18,130
Please ring me up.

466
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:21,100
Yes, Sir.

467
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,050
I need to break them in.

468
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:26,530
My feet are a little weak.

469
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:40,160
Why did she do that? Is she angry?

470
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,910
Why did I do that?

471
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:52,430
Do what?

472
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:56,080
Nothing.

473
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,360
 I'm sorry.

474
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:06,770
 You aren't still mad, are you?

475
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:08,680
 Not at all.

476
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,430
 Again...

477
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:14,250
It's okay.

478
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,760
 Blue looks good on me.

479
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,720
Seriously.

480
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,270
What is wrong with her?

481
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,080
I have something I need to buy before we go to the shop.

482
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,310
What is it?

483
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:43,170
Shoes.

484
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:54,220
 Don't go anywhere until I get there.  Eat whatever you want.

485
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:00,410

486
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:16,300
- Why isn't the sweet and sour pork coming out? 
   - It's coming.

487
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:22,300
- Fried dumplings are coming out, too. Right? 
   - Yes.

488
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:31,930
You are the police, right? Please come quickly. Please.

489
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:45,950
We are cops.

490
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:51,970
Wow, you really are fast.  I just reported.

491
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:59,820
I was bringing out the fried dumplings...

492
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:11,660

493
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,710
 There is no USB card.

494
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:21,510
Check that CCTV over there.

495
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:35,910

496
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,960
Oh, are you going somewhere?

497
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,710
I have somewhere to go with my husband.

498
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:06,620
Then while you are out, ask him to buy you something delicious.

499
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:08,720
All right.

500
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,350
Are you going somewhere?

501
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:13,730
She is going on a date with her husband.

502
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:16,920
If you have time, help her out.

503
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,250
Today, she is making crabs marinated in soy sauce.

504
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:21,600
Yes. Have a good time.

505
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,390
See you later.

506
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:31,870
They see each other every day, why go on a date again?

507
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:34,490
What? Are you jealous?

508
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:37,690
Then, you should hurry up and get married, too.

509
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,680
What do you mean that you'll come and find me?

510
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,870
I'm busy right now.

511
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,440
Ah, why bring underwear? I'll just buy some—

512
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,340
Hey, do you want to eat soybean sprout soup and ri—

513
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,890
Soybean sprout soup and rice?

514
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:06,050
It must taste good. You said you are busy?

515
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:08,470
What are you doing here?

516
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:14,620

517
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:17,200
Ah, damn!

518
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:24,490
Hey. You need to know who you are being suspicious of. Do you call that a girl?

519
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:26,430
Then, is she a man?

520
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:31,270
- No, not that woman— 
 - You dare blabber at me with that mouth?

521
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:33,620
Oh, you are totally misunderstanding—

522
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,180
You call this a misunderstanding?

523
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:40,100
Wow!  It looks like a scene from back when adultery was a criminal offense.

524
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:43,340
I used to do well back then, too.

525
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:45,460
What does that mean?

526
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:51,390
You are drinking that, why would you give it to me?

527
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,180
You even drink out of the same instant ramen bowl with that punk.

528
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,160
Because he's my wif—

529
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:58,900
my partner.

530
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:04,120
I wonder why he is fighting with his wife, then?

531
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:14,380
Oh my.

532
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:19,500
My goodness! What is this?

533
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:23,890
Our Writer Kang really likes crabs marinated in soy sauce.  Great!

534
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,420
Writer Kang and her husband seem to have a good married life.

535
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:30,860
Could it be because she got married late?

536
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:35,430
She married late because she was writing fiction, or whatever.

537
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:37,570
Writer Kang must have been popular.

538
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:41,390
As if she had an interest in any man...

539
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:45,960
I was always so worried that she might die and become a virgin ghost.

540
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:53,110
Our Writer Kang, if it weren't for Attorney Han, she wouldn't even be married.

541
00:48:54,110 --> 00:49:00,000
She talks about men a lot in her books and so, I thought she was married before.

542
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:04,970
Why would you say something like that?

543
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:10,790
- What is it? What is it? Am I a doll now? Am I invisible now? 
 - Wait a moment. Yes.

544
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:13,340
Keep it down for a bit.

545
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:15,000
What?

546
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:22,050
I ended things with my girlfriend.

547
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:24,620
And?

548
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:28,410
Wow. That is hot.

549
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:30,150
Hey!

550
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:31,860
What is it?

551
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:34,070
Someone saw the manager.

552
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:36,950
I'll go, you look busy.

553
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:38,610
Well, I—

554
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:45,770
Excuse me. I understand that you might be misunderstanding something, but I have high standards.

555
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:51,050
Hey, hey! Don't you know that two per team is the regulation?

556
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:53,460
We are talking!  Where do you think you're going?

557
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:57,480
I am a detective. If a culprit shows up, I have to go even when I am eating,

558
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,540
and I have to go even in the middle of a conversation.  That's a detective!

559
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:03,270
Hey!

560
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:12,090
I... have been working for over thirty years in other people's houses.

561
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:17,090
But there is nothing to be gained by knowing too much about other people's business.

562
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:20,550
Pay close attention to what I'm saying.

563
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,200
Ok-Okay.

564
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,650
My goodness, I forgot to buy black pepper!

565
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:28,300
If you want to help me,

566
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,120
hurry up and go buy black pepper.

567
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,660
All right.

568
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,350

569
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:58,350
I have to be careful in the meantime because she's suspicious of me.

570
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:01,380
What kind of suspicion?

571
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:04,680
I don't know.

572
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,580
But I'll know soon.

573
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:13,460
What about Kang Yeo Joo's call logs for this week?

574
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:36,600
These days he doesn't really talk about Kang Yeo Joo.

575
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:42,460
My wife called me.

576
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:44,300
You couldn't answer it because of the trial?

577
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:46,140
Yes.

578
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:47,950
Wait a minute.

579
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:52,620

580
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,350
She's not picking up.

581
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,110
Hello, Attorney Han.

582
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:13,660
That student came again.

583
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:18,000
Mi Rae, what are you doing here?

584
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:40,800
You're not, are you?

585
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:44,830
No. Is this the time for that?

586
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:52,570
I wanted to give you this.

587
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:56,180
What is all this?

588
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:06,190
They're very clean... your shoes.

589
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:11,250
Yes. I have a special way of doing it.

590
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:20,590
But this... It must have been expensive for a student to buy.

591
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:25,620
Do you take your shoes off just anywhere?

592
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:28,160
No. It's not like that.

593
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,590
If you take your shoes off, it means you took everything off.

594
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:32,950
Go bring us some coffee.

595
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:35,750
What will you do while I bring the coffee?

596
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:43,130
I'm in your way, right?

597
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:45,260
Since I've given this to you, I'll take my leave.

598
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:49,380
No, please stay for a cup of coffee before you leave.

599
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,560
Why are you so surprised?

600
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,890
M-Me? Wh-Why?

601
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:25,170
Seeing my sis... sister-in-law...

602
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:29,030
wouldn't... I be sur-surprised to see... you?

603
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:30,860
He's inside, right?

604
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:34,550
I'm really sorry about the shoes.

605
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:39,160
No. It's good to have new shoes, thanks to you.

606
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:48,890
 Woo Seong is inside, Sister-in-Law!

607
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:51,310
 Sister-in-Law!

608
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:55,090
It seems like someone is here to see you and so, I'll go now.

609
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:18,680
But... you must be busy...!

610
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,280
Sister-in-Law! what brings you here?

611
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,810
Here... why... Sister-in-Law?!

612
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:27,680
Woo Seong!

613
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:32,540
Your wife is here!  Hurry out!

614
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:34,640
I'll just go in.

615
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:44,680
Honey, what's going on?

616
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:48,610
You weren't answering my calls, so I was worried.

617
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:52,100
I was worried...

618
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,570
I was driving.

619
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,300
 Citrus mixed with ambergris.

620
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,750
The shoes have the same design.

621
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:27,610
They are so comfortable for my feet and I like them so much.

622
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:31,580
The size is a bit big.

623
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,230
 So the size isn't right.

624
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:40,130
My feet swell easily these days.

625
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:41,870
Is that so?

626
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:46,890
Seeing you outside the home,

627
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:51,370
makes my hea... heart flu... flutter again...

628
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:54,140
You're so pretty.

629
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:56,340
I am so proud of you.

630
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:05,160
Han Woo Seong, Han Woo Seong, Han Woo Seong.

631
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,220
Auntie...

632
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:13,350
This is CEO Yang at the publishing company.

633
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:15,230

634
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:18,170
She really has simple human relationships.

635
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:33,170
What's this number?

636
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:36,770
It could be a burner phone.

637
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,800
Hello?

638
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:02,350
Hello?

639
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:13,480
Who could it be?

640
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:18,650
The only person who knows this number...

641
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:24,070
is Kang Yeo Joo.

642
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:47,600
Why is Kang Yeo Joo communicating with Chief Ma?

643
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:53,990
 Doesn't Chief Ma know Kang Yeo Joo best?

644
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:57,000
There was a relationship between those two.

645
00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:01,170
Something that I am not aware of.

646
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:16,900
Wow, you are so dressy today!  Are you going somewhere nice?

647
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:19,520
I'm going to Baek Soo Jeong's funeral.

648
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:22,970
I see.

649
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:29,330
You should go as well.

650
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:31,920
I only did a talk show with her.

651
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,300
Do I really need to go?

652
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:37,430
Okay. I'll go alone.

653
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:42,200
There is a new hot restaurant in the next building.  Shall we have dinner together?

654
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,580
I will just eat at the funeral hall.

655
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:46,410
Sure.

656
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:51,620
Why am I doing this?

657
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:54,130
I didn't do anything wrong.

658
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:11,410
Hello, Miss Go Mi Rae. I've finally met you.

659
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:23,160

660
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:29,090
 If you cheat, you die.

661
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:34,390
♫  I can't hide it. Let me down  ♫

662
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:38,620
♫  All right  ♫

663
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:42,970
♫  I can't hide it. Let me down  ♫

664
01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:47,730
♫  Get away from me  ♫

665
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:51,730
♫  Yeah... Yeah...  ♫

666
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:53,490
 You just need to get rid of the source of trouble, right?

667
01:00:53,490 --> 01:01:00,390
 If a divorce is difficult realistically, bury him at a quiet place that can never be found.

668
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:02,340
 Why did you go to the cemetery early in the morning?

669
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:04,160
 It is certain that Kang Yeo Joo went to the cemetery, isn't it?

670
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,820
 He said that there was also a woman among the accomplices.

671
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:08,000
 Who?

672
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,770
 Kang Yeo Joo?  Kang Yeo Joo!

673
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:14,370
 Miss, it's okay for you to want anything and you can have anything.

674
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:15,790
 Whether you buy it with money or take it away from someone.

675
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:17,480
 Buy it or take it away from someone?

676
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:22,030
 It's not simple monitoring, the relationship between Chief and Kang Yeo Joo. It's much more than that.

677
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:24,100
 Perhaps... Are you Park Yeo Joo?

678
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:28,520
 Are you in some trouble these days? Let me know if you need my help.

679
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:32,240
 But I'm Kang Yeo Joo.

680
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,400
♫  Turn around  ♫
