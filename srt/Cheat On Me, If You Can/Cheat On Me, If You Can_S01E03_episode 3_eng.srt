1
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:26,670

2
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,250

3
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,650
 The next stop is Euljiro 4

4
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,000
Sorry.

5
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,050

6
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,140
 The target is moving. Standby at your stations.

7
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,220
 The target is moving. 11 o'clock direction.

8
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,350
 White shirt. Blue jeans bag.

9
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,420
 He's crossing the road.

10
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,580
 He's disappeared from view. Confirm his location.

11
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,360

12
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,710
 Found him. Confirmed target. White shirt.  2 o'clock direction.

13
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,970
 Lost the target. I believe we've been exposed.

14
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,850
Hurry up and find him.

15
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,620
- We found the target. 
 - Really? Follow him.

16
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,930
I've found him on the CCTV.

17
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,640
He changed his clothes. He's wearing a black suit and carrying a black bag.

18
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,900
Alert everyone.

19
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,700

20
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,730
 The target has changed his clothes. He's wearing a black suit and carrying a black backpack.

21
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,170
 Found him. Confirm target.

22
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,190

23
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,300
What the hell are you doing in front of someone else's house?

24
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,630
Where is he?

25
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,800
Don't shoot.

26
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,500
Don't shoot. Don't shoot!

27
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,360
It hurts!

28
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,380
What's wrong with all the kids you chose this time around?

29
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,450
Oh, she might be useful.

30
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,610
Sorry.

31
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,250
What the heck? You ruined my shirt.

32
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,950
Big Bro, you need to teach those kids again.

33
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,770
Why am I being treated this way?

34
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,470
What are you saying? You're our best agent.

35
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,780
I was working at a convenience store, and now I'm a writer's assistant.

36
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,360
What kind of special agent gets treated like this?

37
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,170
Just keep your eyes on Kang Yeo Joo, and don't worry about anything else.

38
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,310
How did you know?

39
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,810
That I'm spying on Kang Yeo Joo.

40
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,480
What?

41
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,790
Man, I'm dizzy. I'm going to wash it off.

42
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:16,050
- You know something, don't you? 
 - What the? Stop! Stop! No, there's nothing! Come on!

43
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,110
What's up with this mission? Why is that woman dangerous?

44
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,450
Turn on the water!

45
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,380
Hey, jerk!

46
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,980
It's so hot! Are you crazy?

47
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,830
Why on earth would I have to write a will and get assigned to a special mission

48
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,450
just to spy on a neighborhood woman?

49
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,680
Damn, that stings.

50
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,530
Gosh, you scared me.

51
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:44,660
Listen. That woman is not just an ordinary neighborhood woman.

52
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,260
I know. She's a strange neighborhood woman.

53
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,470
But in terms of personality, my sister is strange.

54
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,280
Kang Yeo Joo is a writer, though.

55
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,470
- My sister is a writer, too. 
 - Since when?

56
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,800
She wrote "Knitting My Baby A Hat."

57
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,910
Really?

58
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,070
It's because of "Secret Prayer Room."

59
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,430
- Prayer room? 
 - Yeah.

60
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:21,810
 - Apologize! 
 - Hallelujah!

61
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:26,260
 Glory, glory Hallelujah!

62
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,580
It didn't seem like she was close with the church...

63
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,750
You won't squeeze anything more out of me even if you roasted me alive.

64
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,020
Go ask the chief.

65
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,560
Here he comes. Damn.

66
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,230
Where are you going?

67
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,450
Let me go. I even use the toilet on a different floor to avoid that guy.

68
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,900
Let go.

69
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,540
Geez.

70
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,930
My goodness!

71
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,040
The salted sumac is all done.

72
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:36,490
You look like you need a lawyer.

73
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:41,480
I can be your divorce attorney for free.

74
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,950
Wouldn't it be nice if I had a husband to divorce?

75
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,980
What's wrong?

76
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,570
In the basement...

77
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:03,070
No, no. Don't worry.

78
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,350
There are no luminol marks in the bathroom.

79
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:16,270
That means the body wasn't injured here.

80
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,780
It could have been a kidnapping.

81
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:28,680
Either way, it wouldn't have been easy to move her, since she lost a lot of blood.

82
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,720
Moving an adult body would require a luggage bag about this size.

83
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,650
One at the end of the hallway.

84
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,930
Two at the corner.

85
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,970
One in the elevator.

86
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,620
That makes four CCTV cameras in total.

87
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,380
Wait! Wait a second!

88
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,830
There are so many risks with moving a body using the elevator.

89
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:10,620
It stops on every floor. It's slow.

90
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,840
Then let's go to the emergency stairs.

91
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,610
Stop, stop.

92
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,980
This time, you get in the bag.

93
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,860
Hey,

94
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,540
Soo Jeong is a woman.

95
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,970
Don't you think the suspect could be a woman?

96
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,850
Are all violent criminals men?

97
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,000
Do only crazy men exist? There are many crazy wenches, too.

98
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,200
You don't even have any strength.

99
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,120
- And yet you insisted. 
 - Why are you so heavy? So freaking heavy.

100
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,650
You're going down?

101
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,050
Be careful with your wrist.

102
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,960
The emergency stairs are much better, for many reasons.

103
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,160
It's pretty close too.

104
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,210
Come on!

105
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,930
Looking at the CCTV camera angle, room 1820 must have been caught on tape.

106
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:30,790
- It'll be all over if we just get the CCTV footage. 
- Hey!

107
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,670
Have you even seen the footage? We need to check it first.

108
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,930
You make me do all the dangerous things.

109
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,580

110
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:52,890
- Hello. How are you? 
 - Hello.

111
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:57,210
We're the police.

112
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:00,800
Could we see the CCTV footage?

113
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,400
Only the chief knows the passcode for the server.

114
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,320
He just got off work.

115
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:18,390
Excuse me,  I'm with the police.

116
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,940
Could we see the CCTV footage?

117
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,470
- My working hours are over. 
 - It'll only take a minute.

118
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:27,040
Come tomorrow.

119
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,480
Wait, I'm Detective Jang Seung Cheol! Please, Sir! Elder!

120
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:37,000
- It'll only take a minute. 
 - Hey, hey, hey.

121
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,170
Let's come back tomorrow.

122
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,980
- Hi, honey. 
 - You're back?

123
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,790
Sorry.

124
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,210
What are you doing?

125
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,350
It's because I always want to look attractive

126
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,980
and sexy for you.

127
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:26,310
But what about you? What is with these PJs that are stretched out at the knee?

128
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,410
- Why? Does it feel unfair? 
 - Yeah, it does. 
 - What?

129
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,660
Since you're still sexy.

130
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,700
I feel like such an easy man.

131
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:42,550
Oh, stop it!

132
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,920
Seriously,

133
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,600
I can't watch this.

134
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:06,120
Why do I have to watch another couple acting cheesy?

135
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,980
She knows how to smile when she's with her husband.

136
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:47,010
Dinner was really good.

137
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,300
Really?

138
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,490
 The wife's support is the most important thing to a politician.

139
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:21,710
Wow, your skin is even better. It shines.

140
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,870
What do you want to tell me?

141
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:34,150
What do you think being a politician's wife would be like

142
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:37,430
instead of a lawyer's wife?

143
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,370
- That'd be the worst. 
 - Why?

144
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:45,690
You have to follow the husband around at every election with a fake smile.

145
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,090
What if I got into politics?

146
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,900
Divorce.

147
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,130
I see.

148
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:01,740
My wifey-wife.

149
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,760
Why are you being so clingy today?

150
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:11,830
Do you want to go out for lunch tomorrow?

151
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:16,520
- But you have a taping tomorrow. 
 - I'll be done with it in the morning.

152
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,870
But... when you think about it,

153
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:26,400
politicians would have the hardest time cheating.

154
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:31,650
There are so many people watching. And they have to think about votes.

155
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:37,310
- It's worse for entertainers. 
 - There are so many cheaters among entertainers!

156
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:42,460
Have you ever heard of a cheating politician? You'd be ousted right away.

157
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,970
Not even the president would be safe.

158
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,000
That's true.

159
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:54,070
Oh, you look so pretty today.

160
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:06,390
I'm.... the arms and legs.

161
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:13,320
Why are we watching her? Why are you curious?

162
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,180
In order to carry out my assignment better...

163
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:23,710
- I'm... the country's arms and legs. 
 - I'm aware of that.

164
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,720
So... why are you trying to use your head?

165
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:36,040
Arms, legs... just move as you're told.

166
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,180
Don't think about it.

167
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,470
The head is...

168
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,180
all the way up on the top...

169
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:58,490
Fine. The head is all the way up on the top.

170
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,090
Thinking is not something I need to...

171
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,300
do.

172
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,900
You're a little late.

173
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,690
 Is it the Joseon Dynasty this time?

174
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:46,870
I was inspired when I woke up. What do you think about a murder in the palace?

175
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:51,530
- It's a common subject matter. 
 - Not your average palace murder,

176
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:56,320
but something where power and illicit love is intertwined. 
 - That's an old style.

177
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,330
When the queen is committing serial murders?

178
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:06,200
- Pardon? 
 - That's new, right?

179
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,110
Well... yes.

180
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,670
Look at the queen's clothes.

181
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,440
What weapon couldn't she hide?

182
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,510
- She could manage to hide even an automatic rifle. 
 - Right!

183
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:30,850
Look at this, right here. These are almost like knives.

184
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:33,560
Pull out the knife and...

185
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,940
You could even hide an ax in here!

186
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,740
Right here, you take out the ax.

187
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:49,140
 What am I doing here?

188
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,600
 Why do I have to listen to stories every day where the main character keeps changing?

189
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,080
Put them both in at the same time, and pull them out together even!

190
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,240
What do you think? Not bad, right?

191
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,970
- Where did it go? 
 - Hey, Woo Seong, can you check...

192
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:14,240
- What are you looking for? 
 - My fountain pen. 
 - Fountain pen?

193
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,570
Yeah. I got it as a present from my wife. It's made of black marble and gold.

194
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,500
Oh, right! No, I haven't seen it.

195
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,740

196
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,960
I can't throw it away...

197
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:47,510
It bothers me. I think it's special to him.

198
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,280
 Mr. Attorney!

199
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,180

200
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,540
Did he really not hear me?

201
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,340
I found all the materials.

202
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:34,910
I think I shouldn't do the Joseon Dynasty.

203
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,440
What?

204
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,230
Do you know how hard it is for me to find these—

205
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:43,560
Right? Exactly. It's too hard to find materials.

206
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,750
That feels so much lighter.

207
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:51,240
Oh, I'm so tired.

208
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:57,120
The Joseon Dynasty doesn't suit me.

209
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:05,780
Keep finding materials. I'm going out for lunch.

210
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,910
Yes, goodbye.

211
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,180
What about the time of enlightenment?

212
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,570
It's boring.

213
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,180
Japanese colonial era.

214
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,160
No different.

215
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,520
Even when an independence fighter is committing serial murders?

216
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,790
How does that even make sense?

217
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,750
Are you by any chance... crazy?

218
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:39,050
You're the first assistant who spoke to me this way.

219
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:43,350
I can withstand everything else but not if you're insulting independence fighters!

220
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,970
You said you couldn't withstand Moon Geun Young being criticized either!

221
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:47,550
I'm from an independence fighter family!

222
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:50,290
Oh, I see.

223
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:52,490
At least you're consistent.

224
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:05,520
The couple gets along very well. Going out for meals so often.

225
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:26,250

226
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,640

227
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,810
Welcome!

228
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:57,610
Excuse me. Is this Attorney Han's office?

229
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:02,720
Oh, yes, it is. This is Attorney Han's office.

230
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,610
Please sit here.

231
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,090
That's okay.

232
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,860
Tea or coffee?

233
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:15,840
You look like a student. Are you here for divorce counseling?

234
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:21,140
No, I'm here to give Mr. Han something.

235
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:26,060
He's currently at the broadcasting station.

236
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,770
I see.

237
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,040
Well... then this...

238
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,070
Please give it to him for me.

239
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,630
Okay.

240
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,990
Goodbye.

241
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:48,710
Woo Seong... again?

242
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:54,920
What are you going to do? But why is she so pretty?

243
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,040
I-Is she a model or what?

244
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:42,220
She's elegant.

245
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,970
Welcome.

246
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:54,120
Oh! What brings you here?

247
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:58,550
Wow, you look so great today.

248
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,860
Yes.

249
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:03,100
You're always so chic.

250
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,500
Where is he?

251
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,100
He should be here soon.

252
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:17,340
It's the same scent. Ambergris with citrus.

253
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,770
Citrus scent.

254
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,980
Oh, it's so dusty.

255
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,610
Even when I clean up. Since I have to do it myself,

256
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:47,190
it's too much to handle.

257
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:51,350
I try to be clean, but...

258
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:04,410
It'd cost at least ₩500,000 ($460). But with ambergris, it'd be ₩1.7million ($1500).

259
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,690
She's a woman in her early 20's.

260
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,720
I'm sure she's not someone who likes very fancy things.

261
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:29,330
Oh... would you like some tea?

262
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:36,030
 Do people like that style these days?

263
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,600
Honey, have you been waiting long?

264
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,460
I just got here.

265
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:49,360
Woo Seong, come over here. There's something you have to see.

266
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,590
Did you meet her?

267
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,140
Who?

268
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,410
No. Thank goodness you didn't meet.

269
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,450
Seriously...

270
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:11,490
Honey, I'll be right back.

271
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:19,070
 That expression. No doubt, he's hiding something.

272
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:24,450
 A young woman. A gift. A secret. It's obvious.

273
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:28,690
 I didn't see him as that kind of person.

274
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,990
There are weapons everywhere.

275
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,530
I didn't think I was getting dinner with a show, too.

276
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:19,500
Honey, should I quiz you?

277
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:27,870
How much special privilege do you think a congressman receives?

278
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,790
A lot, I guess.

279
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:36,640
If it's state-owned, trains, airplanes, ships, they're all free.

280
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,850
That's been abolished. In 2014.

281
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:42,800
Oh yeah. It's been abolished.

282
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,450
But...

283
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,050
why do you keep talking about politics?

284
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:59,300
Shouldn't it be taken for granted that citizens of a democracy would be interested in politics?

285
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:04,870
The meat is very tender. It's so juicy.

286
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,660
Here, a big piece this time.

287
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,500
Oh, you eat so well.

288
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,860
 The real estate professionals, in such a short time...

289
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,400
What about my assistant?

290
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,140
He's in the study. Should I call him?

291
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,410
Let him be.

292
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:26,450
Was lunch all right?

293
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:30,690
It was so greasy. Your food is much better.

294
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:34,660
Here, have some sweet rice drink to help with your digestion.

295
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:51,650
You should throw away that old refrigerator.

296
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,490
Can't we just... leave it?

297
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:05,100
What do you want me to do with something that's broken? Did you put something important inside there?

298
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:11,550
- Hold on. 
  - Breaking News: Actress and TV presenter, Baek Soo Jeong, is confirmed missing.

299
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:16,730
 Ms. Baek couldn't be contacted after attending the Korean Media Awards last Wednesday.

300
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:23,130
 - Ms. Baek's manager reported her missing to the police.  
 - Baek Soo Jeong? That fox-like woman is...

301
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:27,810
My goodness, how could this happen?

302
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,250
Hey, Woo Seong!

303
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:37,010
What?

304
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:39,520
Baek Soo Jeong is missing!

305
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,560
 Actress Baek Soo Jeong, last Wednesday,

306
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,470
 after attending the Korean Media Awards, Ms. Baek could not be reached.

307
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:49,410
 Ms. Baek's manager contacted the police last Thursday around 11:20 a.m.

308
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,250
 He reported her missing.

309
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:53,480
Maybe she's just staying off the grid. It's only been three days.

310
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,320
There must be something else if they're investigating.

311
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,310
It can't be anything bad, right?

312
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,840
But...

313
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:07,770
when they start investigating, won't your relationship with her be revealed?

314
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:10,650
It must have been caught on CCTV.

315
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:13,380
These days, there are no buildings without CCTV.

316
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,840
But... don't they usually store CCTVs for only one week?

317
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,930
You broke up with Baek Soo Jeong last week.

318
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:25,140
That's right.

319
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,530
That's it. You're good.

320
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,430
But...

321
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:39,870
I went there at dawn... a few days ago.

322
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,950
She wasn't home, though.

323
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:44,360
It seems like in the end, there's no such thing as a perfect crime.

324
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,540
You were so careful.

325
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:50,200
I'm so screwed.

326
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,470
Don't be scared!

327
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:56,210
There's nothing to be scared about. Adultery was decriminalized a long time ago.

328
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:00,850
Who cares about the law? If my wife finds out, I'm dead.

329
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:05,010
I even signed away my life to marry her.

330
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,790
You know that!

331
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,190
What do I do?

332
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,840
Murder.

333
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,030
Arson.

334
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:22,160
Poison.

335
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,590
Weapons.

336
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:32,180
All she thinks about is murder.

337
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:37,820

338
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,420
Yes, Director.

339
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,660
Yes? Right now?

340
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,170
Where's Ms. Kang?

341
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:56,690
It seems like she went to the basement.

342
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,290
I see.

343
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,750
What?

344
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,820
What are you doing?

345
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:26,580
Is something wrong?

346
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,600
I'm going to go for a modern murder mystery.

347
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,450
Ah, okay.

348
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:42,210
The main character is... a reporter.

349
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:45,400
 Then tomorrow she'll be dressed like a 90's political activist.

350
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,220
Sorry, but something suddenly came up at home...

351
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,580
I'm a little bit busy right now.

352
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,050
Sort it out yourself.

353
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,950
These boxes...

354
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:08,100
should be folded like this before being thrown away!

355
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,880
These people make us do the work for them!

356
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,900
I know!

357
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:17,870
This tape should be taken off like this. How frustrating! People these days!

358
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:22,090
So, you saw someone coming out of room 1820?

359
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:23,990
Yes.

360
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,800
Was it a month ago...?

361
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,660
He was wearing sweats.

362
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,030
 Watch yourself.

363
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:47,770
 I think he held a water bottle in his hand.

364
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:51,730
She had a parcel delivered to her, but she didn't pick it up for so long,

365
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:54,360
I went up to give it to her myself.

366
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:58,480
Just then, the door to room 1820 opened

367
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,270
and a man came out.

368
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:05,220
It was that man in the sweats!

369
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,120
Did you see his face?

370
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,120
I saw it.

371
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,900
What did he look like?

372
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:26,280
He was soooo handsome.

373
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,670
And his height was just—

374
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:31,450
How was he handsome? Can you explain it in detail?

375
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:34,230
- Say it in detail. 
 - In detail?

376
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:42,570
Ve... ry... good looking.

377
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,420
Good...

378
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,740
Then... what about his height?

379
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:54,950
How do I know someone else's height when I don't even know mine?

380
00:36:55,670 --> 00:37:00,670
They should wash this before throwing it away!

381
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:03,120
Seriously!

382
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,500
Hey, where are you going?

383
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,470
To her apartment.

384
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,100
Hey! Hey!

385
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,450
Wh-What are you going there for?

386
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:11,890
I can't do nothing!

387
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:14,280
Woo Seong, don't do it! Don't do it!

388
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,520
What are you going to do?

389
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,800
Steal the CCTV evidence.

390
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:21,820
Can you even joke at a time like this?

391
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:25,580
I'm not joking. Whether I buy it or steal it,

392
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,730
I'm going to do what I can.

393
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,510
Woo Seong, don't go.

394
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,600
Don't go. Hey! Hey!

395
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,470
Woo Seong!

396
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,170
Woo Seong!

397
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,660
- Excuse me, where is the mechanical room? 
 - Oh, the mechanical room...

398
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,940
The mechanical room? You can just go downstairs.

399
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,660
 No, I can't.

400
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:05,540
 I'm telling you, we're the police. The police.

401
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,420
 And I'm telling you, no.

402
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:12,470
 We're police officers, but you still want a warrant before you show us the CCTV footage?

403
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:16,560
Look here! Not too long ago, a resident said he got a scratch on his car,

404
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:22,410
so I showed him the CCTV, and I nearly got sued by the other driver!

405
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,340
Then, we just need to bring the paperwork. Right?

406
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,560
A warrant.

407
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,060
Getting a warrant is easier said than done.

408
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:34,460
Nothing is easy in life.

409
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:38,190
I don't think it's time to get off work yet.

410
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:42,030
It's Saturday. I don't usually work on Saturday.

411
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,290
Finish up.

412
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:45,390
Take care.

413
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,880
Excuse me!

414
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:05,160
Excuse me.

415
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,690
 Did he perhaps see me on CCTV?

416
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:21,650
A-Are you the lawyer who appears on TV?

417
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,260
Yes.

418
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:27,470
Oh my! It's so nice to meet you!

419
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:30,470
Meeting you at such a place! Hold on.

420
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:32,700
- Can you please give me your autograph? 
 - Yes, yes.

421
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,030
Yes, of course.

422
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:36,270
- Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

423
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:39,720
You're so tall and very good-looking as well.

424
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,430
There are a lot of celebrities in this building.

425
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,720
I suppose...

426
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,980
Here you go.

427
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,710
Thank you. Yes.

428
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:52,810
Yes, that's right. You're Attorney Han Woo Seong.

429
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:54,580
Good luck to you!

430
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,610
Work hard! This is amazing!

431
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,840
Sorry, sorry.

432
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,090
Excuse us.

433
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:15,160
Nothing is working out.

434
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,510
Do you think the warrant can be issued soon?

435
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,640
Team Leader will take care of it.

436
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,170
If we just get the CCTV tape, this case will be over.

437
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:28,050
Who could it be that went in and out at dawn in a tracksuit?

438
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,540
Well, it was probably her lover.

439
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:35,180
But why did he go through the convenience store?

440
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,920
He must have wanted to hide himself going in and out of her place.

441
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,730
A married man?

442
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:50,950
Hey! Of course, it was.

443
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:54,380
A married man who goes around in a tracksuit carrying a water bottle.

444
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,200
I have to steal it.

445
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,670
I have to steal it!

446
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,030
I have to!

447
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:19,400

448
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:37,210
What am I supposed to steal?

449
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:48,260

Damn it!

450
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,390
Hello?

451
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:55,960
 - Where are you? 
 - Th-That is...

452
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,560
I was on my way, but I left something at the office.

453
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,030
You're still at the office?

454
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:06,020
 I'm hungry!

455
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,400
 We're hungry!

456
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,170
Everyone is waiting for you.

457
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:18,470
When will he be here?

458
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:20,500
We're all set to go.

459
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,560
Please hurry.

460
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,040
 I'm sorry.

461
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,910
I'll make sure to be there

462
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:30,620
before the event is over.

463
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:33,020
I apologize.

464
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,770
 How do I know where the file is to erase it?

465
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:49,140
Erasing things that quickly only happens in movies!

466
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,870
The police are going in and out of there! I can't take the whole machine with me!

467
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:55,590
And I keep getting calls from Director Nam!

468
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:57,780
Wouldn't it better to give up on the nomination?

469
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,290
If your relationship with Baek Soo Jeong is uncovered—

470
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:03,660
The nomination isn't the problem. It'll be all over for me!

471
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,980
What's my nickname?

472
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,000
The Country's Husband.

473
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,780
Right? That's what I'm saying!

474
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:14,140
I have to do something before the warrant is issued, but what do I do?

475
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:17,330
Ask your wife for help! She's a pro at police matters!

476
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:20,550
Son Jin Ho, are you nuts?

477
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:23,420
What nonsense are you talking about?

478
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:31,000

479
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,280
 Enjoy your food.

480
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,830

481
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:44,560
Please smile.

482
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,340
They're taking pictures.

483
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,700
Act appropriately.

484
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:56,790
If you keep that kind of expression, people will think you're being forced to do this against your will.

485
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:58,190
Enjoy it!

486
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:00,110
- Thank you! 
 - Of course!

487
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:01,350
Thank you!

488
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:03,660
Enjoy it!

489
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,490
Hello.

490
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:07,430
Hello.

491
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:12,250
The green aprons are members of Green Ivy.

492
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:16,070
Eat with them next time.

493
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,420
Yes, Sir.

494
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,800
Please smile.

495
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,850
Enjoy your food.

496
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:27,360
Two eggs?

497
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:38,350
There you go.

498
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:40,710
Enjoy your food.

499
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,410
Attorney Han?

500
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:57,870
Did Kang Yeo Joo meet with Baek Soo Jeong?

501
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:00,660
Yes, Sir. Three days ago.

502
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,990
Kang Yeo Joo met with Baek Soo Jeong...

503
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:24,620
Incorrigible until the very end.

504
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,340
Does Kang Yeo Joo know anything about the missing person case?

505
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,420
Not yet.

506
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,310
Find out and report back.

507
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:35,100
Yes, Sir.

508
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:38,730
Congratulations on the exclusive.

509
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:44,130
But how did you know that Baek Soo Jeong was missing and that it was being investigated?

510
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:46,160
Manager?

511
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:50,450
Reporter Park? Covering the fan club?

512
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:52,230
Did you find out anything?

513
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:53,770
There's a witness?

514
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:56,090
Who is it? Conditions?

515
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:58,920
Fine. How about an exclusive interview with me?

516
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:03,920
Team Leader Hong, I heard you're in charge of Baek Soo Jeong's missing case.

517
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,950
How did I find out?

518
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:09,400
There's nothing about the police world I don't know.

519
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,800
I have a lot of interest in that case.

520
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,100
We're already done with the on-site inspection.

521
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,500
It doesn't matter.

522
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:20,650
I didn't tell my men, so you have to do this quietly and leave. Okay?

523
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,950
I'm always quiet.

524
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:25,300
Wait, Team Leader!

525
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:28,220
- Oh, Lieutenant Jang! 
 - Warrant.

526
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:32,010
Ms. Kang Yeo Joo?

527
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:33,430
Do you know me?

528
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:36,600
Since you're so famous, Writer Kang.

529
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,220
Kang Yeo Joo?

530
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,460
"We want to Know?"

531
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:44,670
 What we need to focus on in this case is that the

532
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:49,210
 incompetence of the police led the victim to her death.

533
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:51,810
 - What we're sure about is that the police... 
 - The police investigation was lacking.

534
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,210
 It's a tragedy.

535
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:56,740
 The police made mistakes that...

536
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:57,830
 Human rights are...

537
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:00,630
 Excessive confrontation.

538
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,360
She just wants to take a quick look.

539
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:09,260
Team Leader, are you not aware of what type of person she is?

540
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,180
I know, that's why I'm doing this!

541
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:14,090
It's better than her making a ruckus elsewhere. We are being so cooperative.

542
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:18,390
She wouldn't bad-mouth us when we're helping her out like this.

543
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:22,290
You're speaking freely as if I'm not here.

544
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:25,690
Also, you never know, she might be of some help to the case!

545
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:28,540
Writer Kang has identified the culprit many times!

546
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:31,840
What help could that amateur be to us?

547
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:36,130
Since there's so much pushback, I'll just join the "We Want to Know" team.

548
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:39,190
Writer Kang, please!

549
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:45,060
Why are you two so selfish? My exam for promotion is coming up!

550
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:48,390
Just answer that call, please.

551
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,920
It's the writer from "We Want to Know."

552
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,270
Writer Kang!

553
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:01,370
Kang! Kang! Kang!

554
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:02,950
Kang.

555
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:05,920
What's the matter with him at his age?

556
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,410
Doing nothing but acting all cutesy.

557
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:13,670
Ms. Kang isn't back yet.

558
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:15,320
Are you going home now?

559
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,270
Yes. She told me to go home since she'll be late.

560
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:19,380
Where is she?

561
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:24,790
I don't know. She says she's nearby but then she says she's in Gangnam and then Gangbuk.

562
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,780
It looks like the prop room at a TV station.

563
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:37,460
What's this?

564
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,990
Blood?

565
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:08,560

566
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:20,570
You know not to touch anything, right?

567
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:23,380
There's a reason why some things have been covered with white sheets.

568
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:26,000
You nearly touched the book, didn't you? You can't.

569
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,700
- It'll cause issues. 
 - I want to be alone.

570
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:36,340
This is a crime scene.

571
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:38,740
But you're done with the inspection.

572
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:43,430
And you two are busy with work.

573
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,100
I'm sorry.

574
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:11,990
Why is this in the kimchi refrigerator?

575
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:28,490
 It's because of "Secret Prayer Room."

576
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:31,620
The secret prayer room was...

577
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:34,440
a book?

578
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:39,290

579
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:46,790
It would've been hard for her to survive this.

580
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:49,690
Are you sure it's Baek Soo Jeong's blood?

581
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:54,780
Yes. Well... type B.

582
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:57,350
What about the DNA?

583
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:59,710
Forensics.

584
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:04,160
So you're unsure as of now.

585
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,820
Where's Baek Soo Jeong's manager right now?

586
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:20,000
Jangheung.

587
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:24,360
Taping.

588
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:27,460
Why are you asking that now?

589
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:31,010
The person that made the report is also an important suspect.

590
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:34,660
 They said he didn't show up at the taping.

591
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:48,000
He won't answer.

592
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:56,570
Do you know what a top seed is?

593
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,710
Top seed? Well...

594
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:03,410
isn't it like a stalker fan?

595
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,330
 He's a stalker fan that succeeded.

596
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:13,360
 He was famous for going all out, but since his face wasn't known,

597
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,930
 the management didn't even know about him.

598
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:20,820
The manager was the worst of Baek Soo Jeong's top seeds.

599
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,550
Did you know?

600
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:33,160
How am I supposed to know all that?

601
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,800
It's clean here.

602
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:43,520
The manager was the last person to see Baek Soo Jeong, right?

603
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:49,780
But why is he not a suspect?

604
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:53,400
Don't be so sure he was the last person to see her.

605
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,590
It's not certain.

606
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:58,150
Don't be so sure it's not certain.

607
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:01,540
You still didn't get your hands on the CCTV.

608
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:05,350
How did you know that?

609
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:07,580
I used to be a reporter.

610
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:10,780
I have many colleagues I can chitchat with.

611
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:14,120
We did get it. We're going there to collect it now.

612
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,190
We're late.

613
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,650
Then let's go to check out the CCTV.

614
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,820
Why would you go?

615
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,450
To catch the culprit.

616
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:26,180
That...

617
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:29,890
Are you crying?

618
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:36,570
The CCTV is usually kept in the Emergency Room in the basement, right?

619
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:44,340
What's up with her?

620
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:46,770
How would I know that?

621
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:11,560
 Smell of food.

622
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,300
Honey.

623
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:32,060
 That smile.

624
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:33,340
You're home.

625
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:35,060
 Speaking formally.

626
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:37,410
You must be tired.

627
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:42,470
 Smile. It's dangerous tonight.

628
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:44,690
Did something happen?

629
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:47,640
Well... it was average.

630
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:50,100
Wash up and come down.

631
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:54,090
 I'm in trouble.

632
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:06,040
The meat's not done yet.

633
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,510
We'll wait for it, then.

634
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:10,590
I'm not that hungry, so...

635
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:15,740
What... did you do today?

636
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:18,750
Other than... cooking meat.

637
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:21,430
I met with some detectives.

638
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:26,210
For what?

639
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:29,630
Baek Soo Jeong is missing.

640
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:31,600
You saw the news, right?

641
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:36,610
I decided to take part in the investigation.

642
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:45,040
Baek Soo Jeong's missing person case? Why?

643
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,900
I was bothered.

644
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:50,660
She was just here eating with us a few days ago but then disappeared.

645
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:05,280
I was on-site at the scene of the incident earlier, too.

646
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,690
The scene?

647
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:10,430
Baek Soo Jeong's apartment. They were done with the inspection.

648
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:12,440
 There's going to be fingerprints.

649
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:17,350
I even went to see the CCTV footage with the detectives, too.

650
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:21,300
You saw... the CCTV footage?

651
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,360
What's the matter?

652
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:28,640
You can get in trouble watching the CCTV.

653
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:35,530
The maximum fine for violating the Privacy Act 50,000,000 won ($50,000).

654
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:39,400
I went with the detectives. They had a warrant.

655
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:43,620
What... did you see?

656
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:55,930
What do you think I saw?

657
00:58:57,730 --> 00:58:59,680
Guess.

658
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:06,160
I didn't get to see... anything.

659
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,950
Why not?

660
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:17,070
The hard drive was erased because of a virus.

661
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:23,170
It's the tragedy of the digital age. How could 10-days worth be lost at once?

662
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:27,730
Virus... Viruses are a problem.

663
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,590
Virus...

664
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,580

665
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:34,260
Aren't you getting that?

666
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:35,830
It's okay.

667
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:38,130
It's probably a call asking me to buy insurance.

668
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,220

669
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,950
What is it?

670
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:02,140
Oh, the meat is burning!

671
01:00:07,490 --> 01:00:12,130
Well... I'll go make a call then.

672
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:25,460
Who... are you?

673
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:27,590
 Don't you know me?

674
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:32,230
 We met before. We even shook hands.

675
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:35,030
 It's so nice to meet you!

676
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:38,930
 Wow, it's a pleasure!

677
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:45,800
You look great on the screen.

678
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:51,560
To be honest, I was a little disappointed after seeing you in person.

679
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:06,810

680
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:11,440

681
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:19,730
♫  Feel my cold gaze. I'm never gonna love again  ♫

682
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:27,900
♫  Try playing around with those lips again. 
 I’m never gonna love again   ♫

683
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:32,360
♫  Sweet temptation like sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

684
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:35,430
♫  You melt sugar, sugar, sugar  ♫

685
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:38,340
 I found blood in Kang Yeo Joo's basement.

686
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:39,970
 Maybe it's related to the missing person case.

687
01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:42,730
 If not, she could be trying to hide something.

688
01:01:42,730 --> 01:01:44,770
 I'll find the trophy for you.

689
01:01:44,770 --> 01:01:47,550
 Baek Soo Jeong's room was missing that trophy.

690
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:49,880
 But why don't you know about the missing trophy?

691
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:53,030
 She's an expert in crimes. She'll fall into this case's maze.

692
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:56,240
 There's no better place to hide a body than a cemetery.

693
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:57,640
 The DNA results are out.

694
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:00,050
 Erase all traces that could make Kang Yeo Joo a suspect.

695
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:02,270
 The person who came by with the fountain pen, was it a female student?

696
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:09,540
  It's cool. Every time I walk, I get on someone's nerves.

697
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:10,800
♫  And I had to watch you do it all  ♫
