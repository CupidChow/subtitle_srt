1
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,920
Where are we going now?

2
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,760
We're

3
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,920
going to...

4
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,720
Welcome to Thailand.

5
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,440
Why didn't you two

6
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,280
make that "whoa" sound?

7
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,740
We haven't started shooting yet.

8
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,120
Then I'll take you to

9
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,320
a very special restaurant in Thailand.

10
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,080
Dinosaur egg.

11
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,960
Black sand.

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,360
Your teeth are all black.

13
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,280
No, they're not.

14
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,680
Black Teeth Restaurant.

15
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,560
It's so white that it's glowing.

16
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,640
Look at yours.

17
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,800
Look, it's not particularly
bright on my side.

18
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,340
Those things I sent you...

19
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,880
that you need to help me shoot,

20
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,480
have you learned how to do it?

21
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,890
But it's mainly about the vibe.

22
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:09,960
Look at me.

23
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,400
I look very natural like this.

24
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,000
Smiling.

25
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,200
Look at me.

26
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,720
You're not really...

27
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,440
You think you look natural,

28
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,170
but actually

29
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,680
how it appears on camera

30
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,410
is like this.

31
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,840
I said look at me,

32
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,300
and then you're like this.

33
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,440
No way.

34
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,440
Where? Let me see.

35
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,320
I didn't capture it.

36
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,600
But it's just like that.

37
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,000
See how natural it looks?

38
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,320
You need to do dynamic poses with me.

39
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,450
I need to do this too?

40
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,320
You do your own cool pose.

41
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,160
No, I can only learn and imitate.

42
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,560
What?

43
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,020
Why do you keep doing that?

44
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,320
I can't capture your clothes.

45
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,120
My hairstyle today

46
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,920
is a sleep-friendly hairstyle.

47
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,640
Why?

48
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,360
It won't get messy.

49
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,490
It's already messy.

50
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,800
Handsome Zhao and Pretty Mu.

51
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,840
She'll only play around

52
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,760
for 10 more minutes.

53
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,880
Then she'll be out of energy.

54
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,640
I can force myself to stay energetic

55
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,700
and talk non-stop.

56
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,040
Talk about what?

57
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,280
Talking to yourself?

58
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,920
Talking to you.

59
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,450
Talking to someone nearby.

60
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,840
She'll only play around

61
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,970
for 10 more minutes.

62
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
Are you sleeping?

63
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,080
I'm going to Thailand first.

64
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,880
Stop talking.

65
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,960
We're almost there.

66
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,800
Let's go.

67
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,279
I ran into a female celebrity

68
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,680
on the plane.

69
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,459
What are you doing?

70
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,540
Touching up my makeup.

71
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,880
Keep going.

72
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,760
Zhao, are you going to eat
the in-flight meal later?

73
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,720
I won't eat it.

74
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
Will I eat it then?

75
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,120
You'll just fall asleep.

76
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,380
Probably won't eat it.

77
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,080
Don't keep trying to set me up

78
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,320
to feel sleepy.

79
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,000
I won't fall asleep.

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,040
I'm excited.

81
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,240
Let's go.

82
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,040
You need to look handsome.

83
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,440
Okay.

84
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,480
Let's go.

85
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,560
I'm going to Thailand first.

86
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,680
Do I look good?

87
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,540
Yes. Not puffy.

88
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,260
Going back to Thailand again.

89
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,560
Where are we going now?

90
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,440
We're going to...

91
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,840
Shanghai.

92
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,240
How long did you keep this pose?

93
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,440
Hold on.

94
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,080
Hold on!

95
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,640
Let's just go

96
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,400
and ignore him.

97
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,720
Hold on!

98
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,360
Are you okay?

99
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,760
Are you okay?

100
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,440
Are you okay?

101
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,080
Are you okay?

102
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,560
No, let's do it together.

103
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,720
Come on.

104
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,960
Okay, together.

105
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,720
Time to dance.

106
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,120
Dance.

107
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,200
Come on.

108
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,080
Dance!

109
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,080
Dance!

110
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,640
Come on.

111
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,560
You need to join us.

112
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,650
This is Thailand's welcome ceremony?

113
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,760
No matter how sweet Thai coconuts are,

114
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,490
they're not as sweet as
the looks between you two.

115
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,720
There's more.

116
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
There's more?

117
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,200
There's more.

118
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,040
Welcome to Thailand.

119
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,560
Welcome to Thailand.

120
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,360
Thanks, bro.

121
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,280
Welcome back to Thailand.

122
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:30,800
Flowers.

123
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,320
Welcome back to Thailand.

124
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,180
Are you hungry?

125
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,040
Yes.

126
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,720
Okay.

127
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,560
Then I'll take you to

128
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,120
a very special restaurant in Thailand.

129
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,360
What restaurant?

130
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,080
My restaurant.

131
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,520
Then let's go.

132
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,780
Okay, let's go.

133
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,280
Let me.

134
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,040
Okay.

135
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,720
Welcome to Thailand.

136
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,240
Back in Thailand again.

137
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,040
Well...

138
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,840
We need some music in this car.

139
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,280
Singing. Karaoke.

140
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,520
Okay.

141
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,360
Lin Sui, is this your car?

142
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,720
Of course not.

143
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,240
Welcome to Thailand.

144
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,440
Welcome to Thailand.

145
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,200
Welcome to Thailand.

146
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:33,840
What?

147
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,280
Bye.

148
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,800
I'll play you

149
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,320
a Thai song I loved when I was little.

150
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,800
Okay.

151
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,040
Thai song?

152
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,120
Before... Mong kon orn aen...

153
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,400
What?

154
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:54,920
What?

155
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:00,040
Mong kon orn aen lae mong kon rong hai...

156
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,080
Is this Thai?

157
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,720
Yes.

158
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,920
It's that song.

159
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,840
I've heard it.

160
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,680
Have you heard it before?

161
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,340
Yes, I have.

162
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,240
Mong kon orn aen...

163
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,000
What is this?

164
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,240
I'm going to continue
taking photos of you.

165
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,440
Mong kon orn aen...

166
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,080
Right?

167
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:23,880
Good.

168
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,320
Nice.

169
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,980
Good. Look this way a bit more.

170
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,980
Sawadee krab (Hello).

171
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,520
It should be "kop kun krab (thank you)."

172
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,920
Kop kun krab (Thank you).

173
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,600
Why didn't you two

174
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,440
make that "whoa" sound?

175
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,900
We haven't started shooting yet.

176
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,370
We haven't started yet.

177
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
Let's reshoot!

178
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,400
We're here.

179
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,880
Tell me,

180
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,740
what kind of reaction
should we have when we get out?

181
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,000
It looks a bit like...

182
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,080
a mecha head.

183
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,040
So fancy.

184
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,080
Such a magnificent restaurant!

185
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,080
Come on, let's take a photo

186
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,080
for our check-in.

187
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,040
Are we the first customers?

188
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,360
Yes.

189
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,280
Wow.

190
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:38,760
Let's go.

191
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,720
Let's go.

192
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,560
You look so beautiful.

193
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,160
Okay.

194
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,080
Hello.

195
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,210
She's so beautiful.

196
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,040
First,

197
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,040
you need to take

198
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,640
this lamp.

199
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,080
This lantern is for you.

200
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,320
Thank you.

201
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,440
It's a place with a great atmosphere.

202
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,640
It's like an escape room, right?

203
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,040
It's so cool here.

204
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,800
Isn't it?

205
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,800
Hello.

206
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,880
Wow.

207
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,240
Okay.

208
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,560
First, we have a welcome drink.

209
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,560
This is our welcome drink.

210
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,120
Gold dust.

211
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,560
What's this?

212
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,640
Dry ice.

213
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:12,960
And then,

214
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,920
you can drink it.

215
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,320
I need to remove the base, right?

216
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:18,880
Yes.

217
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,080
Cheers.

218
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,840
Cheers.

219
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,520
Welcome to Thailand.

220
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,720
Welcome to Thailand.

221
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,480
Welcome to THAI SWEET.

222
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,240
THAI SWEET.

223
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,840
Try this first.

224
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,120
What's this?

225
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
Just try it first.

226
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,360
Try it first, then guess.

227
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,840
I'm afraid.

228
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,720
You try it first.

229
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,960
Just eat it like this?

230
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,520
What's that expression?

231
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,930
What does that mean?

232
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,240
It has a mysterious flavor.

233
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:01,960
What?

234
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,160
It's soft and bouncy.

235
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,240
Pomelo jelly.

236
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,720
Pomelo.

237
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,360
Pomelo.

238
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,520
Pomelo.

239
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,360
Next we're having a...

240
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,160
bread.

241
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:17,800
Bread?

242
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,640
It's very special.

243
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,560
Next one, right?

244
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,040
Is it Thai bread?

245
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,840
Eyes of the dragon.

246
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,480
Eyes of the dragon?

247
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,800
Ice of the dragon?

248
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,760
It's dragon...

249
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,720
Dragon's eye.

250
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,480
Longan.

251
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,120
Longan.

252
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,520
Longan.

253
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,560
Yes.

254
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:34,960
Longan.

255
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,600
Longan.

256
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,400
Longan.

257
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,880
Dragon hand.

258
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,120
This is not longan.

259
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,560
I think we've misunderstood.

260
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,720
Eyes.

261
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,800
Eyes of the dragon.

262
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,360
Longan.

263
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,640
Do you want to...

264
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,120
Light it?

265
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,640
I'm afraid to.

266
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,240
No.

267
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,920
You do it.

268
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,650
I don't dare.

269
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:05,960
Do you dare to do it now?

270
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,520
Yes.

271
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,840
This is very cool.

272
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,440
Right?

273
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,040
Let me tell you,

274
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,080
this is edible.

275
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,040
Which one is edible?

276
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,680
The candle is edible?

277
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,120
This one.

278
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,050
Is it chocolate?

279
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,080
No,

280
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,240
this is butter.

281
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,000
How do you say butter in Chinese?

282
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,760
Huangyou.

283
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,720
Huangyou.

284
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,840
Black butter? Never seen that before.

285
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,200
Won't it turn your teeth
black after eating?

286
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,930
No, it won't.

287
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,260
Try one. Let me see.

288
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,200
Okay.

289
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,600
There's also this inside.

290
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,200
Let me see.

291
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,170
There's cheese inside.

292
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,120
Your teeth are all black.

293
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,760
No, they're not.

294
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,800
Take a look.

295
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,210
That's why we have mirrors.

296
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,560
So that's how it's designed.

297
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,200
Come on.

298
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,200
What's wrong?

299
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,210
This bread is quite delicious.

300
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,480
The bread is good.

301
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,720
The butter is salty.

302
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,840
I'm going to make the next dish myself.

303
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,480
I'll change my clothes first.

304
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,880
Thank you.

305
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,820
I know this one.

306
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,720
Okay. First, there's a lobster.

307
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,880
Lobster.

308
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,840
Then there's a Thai-style steak.

309
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,040
Are you ready?

310
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,900
Yes, I'm ready.

311
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,120
Mike looks so charming

312
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,720
when he's focused.

313
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,600
Yes.

314
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,460
Do you think so?

315
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,730
Super charming.

316
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,080
Zhao,

317
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,880
when can I taste

318
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,210
the food you cook for me?

319
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,560
Didn't I make you

320
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,290
stir-fried eggs and tomatoes?

321
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,280
You mean in the show?

322
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:19,880
Yes.

323
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,780
Then I'll cook something for you.

324
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,680
Let me serve you in person.

325
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,140
What would you like to eat?

326
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,000
I don't need to eat anything.

327
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,920
Just enjoy your cooking.

328
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,600
Please sit down.

329
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,100
I'm Avatar.

330
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,440
Sit down.

331
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,280
I know you too well.

332
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,880
You just want to play around.

333
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,600
Too sweet!

334
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,770
It's burnt, bro.

335
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:09,640
Mike!

336
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,880
Look, I was watching you chat

337
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,400
and I forgot.

338
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,160
I'm telling you...

339
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,359
I completely forgot!

340
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,720
It should be fine. You can cut it.

341
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,319
You can just trim off the outer layer.

342
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,920
It's fine.

343
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,680
Do you really know how to cook?

344
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,440
I do.

345
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,319
Add some butter for me.

346
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,380
Turn down the heat.

347
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:27,480
Okay.

348
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,820
It's too burnt.

349
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,160
It's fine. We can eat it.

350
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:46,840
It's done.

351
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,440
Done?

352
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,320
Okay.

353
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,200
Try this first.

354
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,020
It's okay. Let me do it.

355
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,680
Thank you.

356
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,720
It looks nice.

357
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,400
It tastes sweet

358
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,600
because it has cream.

359
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,720
Thai delicacy.

360
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,280
It looks so delicious.

361
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,440
This is lobster mousse.

362
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,280
You made it look nice.

363
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,520
The way you drizzled the sauce,

364
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,050
you've clearly practiced.

365
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,800
I'm not joking.

366
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,800
You've learned it for a long time.

367
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,600
Not really.

368
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,260
Delicious.

369
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,960
Does it taste authentically Thai?

370
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,280
Yes.

371
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:35,800
Yes.

372
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,280
Right?

373
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,480
I never expected Mike to be so handsome,

374
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,280
cook such delicious food,

375
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,360
be so patient,

376
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,160
so dedicated to his work,

377
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,680
and so charming.

378
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,140
This restaurant will surely become famous.

379
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,840
You guys.

380
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,920
Come rest.

381
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,880
Stop working.

382
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,480
Alright.

383
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,240
Good job.

384
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,200
Well done.

385
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,080
And you can eat...

386
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,440
this one first.

387
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,280
Open this.

388
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,640
Moonlight Box.

389
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,560
Is it beautiful?

390
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,440
Yes, it is.

391
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,960
It's so pretty.

392
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,160
It even has gold foil.

393
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,840
Dinosaur egg.

394
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,880
Black sand.

395
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,840
This is fish.

396
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,280
Here's another beautiful one.

397
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,840
Each of his dish designs
is quite interesting.

398
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,320
Abalone.

399
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,360
This is abalone.

400
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,040
Black rose.

401
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,640
This one is quite beautiful.

402
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,240
Let me take a good photo of it.

403
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,920
Open it.

404
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,450
Okay. Then eat it like this.

405
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,610
Eat it like this.

406
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,000
How do I eat it?

407
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,960
Just eat it directly.

408
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,560
Is this the only way to eat it?

409
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,200
This also has a sweet and sour taste.

410
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,560
It's Thai flavor.

411
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,480
Sweet and sour.

412
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,040
Yummy.

413
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,700
We're really good at
exploring restaurants together.

414
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,720
And it has coconut.

415
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,140
It's tasty.

416
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,480
Can I eat this now?

417
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,560
Can I eat it now?

418
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,000
Yes. This is fish.

419
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,440
This is delicious. It's also spicy.

420
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,760
It's good, right?

421
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,320
There's a sword.

422
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,400
Thank you, Zhao.

423
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,240
This will make our teeth
black again after eating.

424
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,840
Black Teeth Restaurant.

425
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,640
Black Teeth Restaurant.

426
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,840
So what do you think about my restaurant?

427
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,840
Any suggestions?

428
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,240
I do have a suggestion.

429
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,900
It's about the presentation.

430
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,120
Everything is too black.

431
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,360
If I want to post on social media,

432
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,920
it's all black.

433
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,840
You should have some other colors.

434
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,600
But not white.

435
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,920
Not white.

436
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,200
You could add some purple.

437
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,760
Black-purple, black-red.

438
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,920
And silver, right?

439
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,650
Black-blue.

440
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,440
Okay.

441
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,560
Good.

442
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,600
Do you want to go for a walk?

443
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,200
Or should we

444
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,640
continue eating?

445
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,240
We can go for a walk.

446
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,480
Weren't we planning to go to...

447
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,200
Chinatown?

448
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:14,920
Chinatown.

449
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:15,880
Chinatown?

450
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,920
The place where we filmed.

451
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,760
Let's take a stroll there.

452
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,440
Okay.

453
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,600
Xin.

454
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,120
I've prepared a surprise for you.

455
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,880
You guys,

456
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,840
turn around.

457
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,520
Look.

458
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,280
Let's go to Chinatown.

459
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:37,640
Okay.

460
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,200
Isn't this where we filmed?

461
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,800
Yes, this is the place.

462
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,320
Right.

463
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,640
I want to play Mu once.

464
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,800
Let's switch roles.

465
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,800
I want to play too.

466
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,920
Zhao,

467
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,160
why don't you ever compliment me?

468
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,020
What exactly do you want me to say?

469
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,720
I miss you.

470
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,680
Me too.
