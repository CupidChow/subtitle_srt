1
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,440
Guess who I am.

2
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,720
You must be...

3
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,280
Mu?

4
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,440
That's right.

5
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,160
Do you prefer independent travel
or group tours?

6
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,200
Independent travel.

7
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,000
Do you prefer juice or coffee?

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,880
Coffee.

9
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,340
You're following me on purpose,
aren't you?

10
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,240
Call him now.

11
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:21,600
Okay.

12
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,440
Hello.

13
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,400
We're about to arrive in Thailand.

14
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,560
We're about to arrive in Thailand.

15
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,200
Can you come pick us up?

16
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,640
What?

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,730
Let's order some drinks first.

18
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,160
Hello.

19
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,420
Hello, sir, what would you like to drink?

20
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
Two iced Americanos.

21
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,120
Sure.

22
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,840
Great, thank you.

23
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,440
Hello, your coffee is ready.

24
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,280
This cafe serves orders really quickly.

25
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,340
These came out right after I ordered.

26
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,960
Hello.

27
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,320
Didn't we agree to pretend?

28
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,120
Then why'd you say hello when you came in?

29
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,360
Turn around.

30
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,560
I'll walk in again.

31
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,280
Now I'm supposed to

32
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,680
pretend I didn't know
she was coming, right?

33
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,280
Or what am I supposed to do?

34
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,160
Guess who I am.

35
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,600
You must be...

36
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,320
Mu?

37
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,000
You must be...

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,720
Mu?

39
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,560
Mu?

40
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,720
That's right.

41
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,080
Long time no see.

42
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,960
Long time no see.

43
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,880
Is this the gift you prepared for me?

44
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,360
This is the gift I prepared for you.

45
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,820
It's not Lightning, is it?

46
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,040
How could I bring a live animal?

47
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,160
What's this?

48
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,680
This is...

49
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,480
Open it.

50
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,010
I'm opening it then.

51
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,920
A helmet!

52
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,000
I could tell just by looking at

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,920
the edges of it.

54
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,560
Long time no see.

55
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,520
Me or the helmet?

56
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,440
You!

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,240
I've never seen this helmet before.

58
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,040
Now...

59
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,000
You don't already have it, right?

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,280
Guess what color it is.

61
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,159
Blue.

62
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,560
Take a look.

63
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,440
Black?

64
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,600
Take a look.

65
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,620
I can't tell like this.

66
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,760
I don't have this one.

67
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,640
This is called

68
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,480
"Five-Stars Big Eyes".

69
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,360
I don't have a helmet like this

70
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,020
but I really like this helmet.

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,360
Who should you thank?

72
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,400
Thank you...

73
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,200
Thank you, Mu.

74
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,930
Say it again.

75
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,320
Thank you, Mu!

76
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,560
You're welcome.

77
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,160
Here, try the milk skin I brought.

78
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,640
Do you like dairy products?

79
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,640
I can enjoy them.

80
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,040
This is the really delicious milk skin...

81
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,920
Are you cold?

82
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,580
That's been really popular in Shanghai
lately.

83
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,800
Try it.

84
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:29,960
Is it good?

85
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,720
It's quite sweet.

86
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,280
Let me open your gift, Zhao.

87
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,760
It's a

88
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,600
printer.

89
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,720
And it's pink.

90
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,720
So it works with any phone, right?

91
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,200
Any phone...

92
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,560
Just connect with Bluetooth.

93
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:51,880
Great.

94
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,960
Then we can take photos today

95
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,920
and print them out.

96
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,320
Sure.

97
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,120
1,218 photos.

98
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,159
Okay.

99
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,160
If you run out, just look for me.

100
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,760
Thank you for your gift.

101
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,760
I really like it.

102
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,080
Who should you thank?

103
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,160
Thank you for Zhao for the gift.

104
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,800
I love it.

105
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,160
Dear Mu and Zhao,

106
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,200
if you had been a little braver back then;

107
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,920
if you had never separated,

108
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,800
would the pages of your story
have changed?

109
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,880
We crafted

110
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,680
a Thailand trip centered on
the theme of “What If.”

111
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,000
When "what if" is no longer a hypothesis.

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,600
This time,

113
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,600
seize the pen that charts your new path

114
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,080
and return to where you first met.

115
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,159
May you walk through the winds of Thailand

116
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,720
and transform imagined "what ifs"

117
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,159
into every step of your present moment.

118
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,520
Before the journey begins,

119
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,560
to help you understand each other better,

120
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,680
build more rapport,

121
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,240
please complete the following test.

122
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,640
We look forward to seeing you
connect on the same wavelength.

123
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,400
Connect on the same wavelength!

124
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,130
Do you prefer independent travel
or group tours?

125
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,800
Do you prefer juice or coffee?

126
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,760
Coffee.

127
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,220
You're following me on purpose,
aren't you?

128
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,160
Do you prefer the sunrise or sunset?

129
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,120
Sunset.

130
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,560
Getting up early.

131
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,490
Staying up late.

132
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,280
You like getting up early?

133
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,080
I like the idea of it,

134
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,640
but I can't do it

135
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,240
so I still stay up late.

136
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,720
But I like it.

137
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,220
Do you prefer adventurous challenges
or aesthetic experiences?

138
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,640
Three, two, one.

139
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,000
Aesthetic experiences.

140
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,600
You're just...

141
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,520
Going along with whatever you say.

142
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,280
Yeah.

143
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,400
Do you prefer expressing your thoughts
or making people guess?

144
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,960
Three, two, one.

145
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,360
Expressing my thoughts.

146
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,400
Do you prefer to accommodate others
or stick to your own views?

147
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,120
Stick to my own views.

148
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,840
You also like to stick to your views?

149
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,440
Because my view might be right.

150
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,240
But you don't like to
accommodate others either.

151
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,560
Then as travel companions...

152
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,480
No, listen to me.

153
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,440
We'll definitely argue.

154
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,880
Both sides' views

155
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,960
might actually be

156
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,520
the same.

157
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:56,920
The same.

158
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,520
Right?

159
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,400
Isn't that being on the same wavelength?

160
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,000
Most people wouldn't think like you do.

161
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,440
But what if, right?

162
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,840
That was just a warm-up.

163
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,100
Next, we're levelling up the questions.

164
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,200
Who said hello first when you first met?

165
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,640
He first gave me

166
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,200
a very kind look.

167
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,520
Then I did this to you.

168
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,720
You spoke first,

169
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,080
but I greeted you first.

170
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,720
You looked at me first.

171
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,720
He had this look

172
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,360
like he knew me from somewhere

173
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,840
but also didn't know me at the same time.

174
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,720
After all, I've seen your shows,

175
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,680
right?

176
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,640
So how did it feel when you first met Mu?

177
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,840
When I first met Mu,

178
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,679
it felt like déjà vu.

179
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,280
Because I've seen so many...

180
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,280
Tell the truth.

181
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,039
You clearly said that

182
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,360
I'm prettier in person, didn't you?

183
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,280
She's prettier in person.

184
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,539
Better than on camera.

185
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,640
When I first met you,

186
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,000
I thought you seemed a bit ditzy.

187
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,040
I seemed ditzy?

188
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,240
Ditzy how?

189
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,040
Because when we were all
reading the script together,

190
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,760
and this person would speak,

191
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,480
you'd look at them like this,

192
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,000
then that person would speak,

193
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,840
and you'd look at them like that,

194
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,480
then another person would speak,

195
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,520
and you'd look at them too.

196
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,050
Isn't that just a reaction?

197
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,180
I had to see what they were saying.

198
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,040
I can take care of others.

199
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,320
I think for big things,
I take care of you,

200
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,880
and for small things, you take care of me.

201
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,540
What big things have we faced?

202
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,080
For example,

203
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,160
if there's a conflict,

204
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,720
I'm always the one who makes peace.

205
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,440
I just don't say anything.

206
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,520
That's not making peace.

207
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,160
But that's not bad either.

208
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,400
Once you say let's make up, we make up.

209
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,320
I'm the one who takes the first step.

210
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,200
What about me?

211
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,360
You sulk.

212
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,040
Didn't I already say that?

213
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,880
I don't sulk.

214
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,600
I'm the one who...

215
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,760
Waits to take the first step, alright?

216
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,960
Waiting for Mike to take the first step.

217
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,960
Do you recall any instances

218
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,040
where you took care of someone?

219
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,640
Where I took care of someone.

220
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,120
There are many little things.

221
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,600
Like when I'm dieting,

222
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,640
he would share his

223
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,120
diet steak with me

224
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,240
and give me a couple bites

225
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,640
when I was really hungry.

226
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,440
I really hate being hot.

227
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,720
So she would take
those little cooling patches

228
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,160
and stick them here and here

229
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,040
like she's doing

230
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,920
acupuncture,

231
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,080
all around my neck,

232
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,480
and then point a fan at me.

233
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,920
I'm probably not someone

234
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,320
who's really good
at taking care of others.

235
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,320
But I think within

236
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,680
my line of sight,

237
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,560
if I feel that

238
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,320
you need care,

239
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:05,840
I will

240
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,300
generally look after you.

241
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,640
That's true.

242
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,760
For your upcoming trip,

243
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,800
who do you think
will take care of whom more?

244
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,560
Who will take care of whom more?

245
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,680
I think we'll take care of each other.

246
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,720
I might do a bit more.

247
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,800
I'm a guy after all.

248
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,460
I should take care of the girl.

249
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,480
No, when I travel...

250
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,160
Oh, what?

251
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,120
I have more travel experience.

252
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,880
This isn't a survival show.

253
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,280
Well then,

254
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,600
I'll just wait to be taken care of.

255
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,240
You take care of me.

256
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,770
Feel it, feel the "what if".

257
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,320
Who takes better photos?

258
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,480
Do you even need to ask

259
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,280
this kind of question?

260
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,080
This is definitely

261
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,240
something I have authority to speak on.

262
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,400
About taking photos.

263
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,440
Back then,

264
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,970
many of the photos
were actually taken by Xin.

265
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,280
Some muscle photos weren't taken by me.

266
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,200
I took those muscle flexing photos myself.

267
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,080
Can Mu improvise right now

268
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,400
and take 3 photos for Zhao?

269
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:56,960
Right now?

270
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,840
Of course.

271
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,840
When it comes to taking photos,
I'm never tired.

272
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,900
I haven't taken photos in a long time.

273
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,280
Look at me.

274
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,370
Boyfriend's perspective.

275
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,880
We're waiting for our food now.

276
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,560
Let's clink glasses.

277
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,880
You can look ahead.

278
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,720
Put that hand down.

279
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,080
Put that hand down.

280
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,080
Yes.

281
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,280
I'll hold this.

282
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,080
Yeah.

283
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,480
That's it.

284
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,360
Done!

285
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,490
The photos are done.

286
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,220
Let's look at the results.

287
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,900
Does he look handsome?

288
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,060
It's really vibey.

289
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,810
All about the vibes.

290
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,320
Done!

291
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,680
Thanks.

292
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,320
Who is better at providing
emotional support?

293
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,920
It depends.

294
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,920
Are we talking about happy times

295
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,480
or sad times?

296
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,640
I feel that

297
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,360
you're the kind of person

298
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,920
who is able to answer most questions.

299
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,920
For example, what are you doing now?

300
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,160
I don't know.

301
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,840
At least she'll say that she doesn't know.

302
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,960
She actually responds.

303
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,600
Everything gets a response.

304
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,320
Why are you fidgeting with your hands?

305
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,480
I'm nervous.

306
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,360
See? She always...

307
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,490
She always answers.

308
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,920
Share a moment when the other person

309
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,520
made you feel emotionally supported.

310
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,800
She tells these jokes

311
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,840
that others might not find that funny,

312
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,570
but I think they're hilarious.

313
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,360
When setting camera positions,

314
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,040
my position might be slightly off,

315
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,240
then...

316
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,960
You do this.

317
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,040
What's so funny about that? It's...

318
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,680
She could just say

319
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,360
move back a little,

320
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,680
but instead she uses a whole set of

321
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,680
bizarre,

322
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,160
complicated body language.

323
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,600
There are many things
I don't even understand about myself,

324
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,440
but he understands them.

325
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,160
And when he expresses it,

326
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,560
I somehow feel...

327
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,680
Like you resonate.

328
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,080
Few guys can understand
what makes me tick.

329
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,260
Who's better at being cutesy?

330
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,080
Do you even need to ask?

331
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,240
Three, two, one.

332
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,560
If on the trip there's something
that Mu wants to try

333
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,360
but Zhao doesn't want to do it,

334
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,490
how would you act cute to persuade him?

335
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,640
Want to go ride a motorcycle?

336
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,440
You're already starting to act it out,

337
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,520
right?

338
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,280
No, I'm not going.

339
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,440
So how would you act cute?

340
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,000
I'd just say, come on.

341
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,600
If you don't want to go, forget it,

342
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,860
I'll just go by myself.

343
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,360
I'm actually just okay.

344
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,040
I'm not really...

345
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,360
I'm not particularly good at acting cute.

346
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,680
She'll make her own case,

347
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,400
like we'll have a great time there.

348
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,040
It's not really acting cute.

349
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,120
I feel like she'll recommend things.

350
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,360
I'll talk up something as super fun,

351
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,200
like we'll catch shrimp like this,

352
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,560
and then

353
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,600
when we actually get there, we find that

354
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,120
it's just okay.

355
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,880
Just okay.

356
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,800
When have my plans ever been just okay?

357
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,560
That time we went

358
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,080
out to sea.

359
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,800
Out to sea.

360
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,330
She planned it really well.

361
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,280
We all got on the boat,
ready for a great time.

362
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,280
Then she was just sitting there,

363
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,440
seasick or something?

364
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,120
I fell asleep.

365
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,980
I was too tired.

366
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,000
By the afternoon,

367
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,930
the sea breeze was getting colder,

368
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,920
and we played in the water.

369
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,850
Overall, it was pretty miserable.

370
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,560
Really?

371
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:19,800
Really?

372
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
Not that it felt miserable, of course.

373
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,600
I mean the scene probably looked...

374
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,720
It was gloomy with no sun

375
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,920
and there was nothing.

376
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,320
So some of her plans

377
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,400
don't necessarily work out.

378
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,080
That's true.

379
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,960
But when she's planning,

380
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,890
she's extremely

381
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,800
enthusiastic and professional.

382
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,330
Her attitude is excellent.

383
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,840
The next step of understanding

384
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,440
is achieving cognitive resonance.

385
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,760
Next, one person will describe

386
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,080
and the other will answer.

387
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,160
We hope that in your cooperation

388
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,890
you'll show better chemistry.

389
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,880
This action.

390
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,480
Blinking.

391
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,320
Three words.

392
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,650
Making eyes at someone.

393
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,920
Excellent!

394
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,680
Six words.

395
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,800
Something people like to eat in summer.

396
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,560
Ice cream.

397
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,000
Yes, and there's
a square-shaped thing in front...

398
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,360
What kind of abs do you have?

399
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:03,880
What flavor?

400
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,560
Chocolate ice cream.

401
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,240
Correct!

402
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,920
That's a great description.

403
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,960
Do you still have them now?

404
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,820
Yes, I still do.

405
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,360
Something I love to say

406
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,320
to ask if something is true.

407
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,280
An internet slang.

408
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,240
Four words.

409
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,800
Cute version.

410
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,880
Four words?

411
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,840
For real?

412
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,480
Yes!

413
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,800
That really

414
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,520
came to mind instantly.

415
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,520
Girls all like to buy...

416
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,080
Bags.

417
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,540
And when a guy wants to say,

418
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,680
"Don't worry, I've got this,"

419
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,680
what does he...

420
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,560
what does he say?

421
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:39,720
One word.

422
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,840
Covered.

423
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,720
That's amazing!

424
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,160
Covered.

425
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,720
That super viral song

426
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,880
recently—

427
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,610
the one everyone's dancing to—

428
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,520
“Grand Ambitions."

429
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,080
Right.

430
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,680
Amazing!

431
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,640
Amazing!

432
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,170
That's a triple "amazing."

433
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,600
You two are the ultimate duo

434
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,840
and also the best travel partners.

435
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,900
Congratulations
on unlocking the Thailand "If" Trip.

436
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,800
Please plan your itinerary

437
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,680
based on Chapter One's theme—

438
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,920
"If We Meet Again."

439
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,400
Plan our itinerary...

440
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,160
I think

441
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,080
once we get to the airport,

442
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,720
we should start filming the vlog.

443
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,160
Yeah, we should start shooting
from the moment we leave.

444
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,200
Film the vlog, and then—

445
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,560
on the plane,

446
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,600
and after we exit the terminal,
help me get some good shots, too.

447
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,320
Okay.

448
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,320
I'll get good shots for you, too.

449
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,200
Then we'll go...

450
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,960
Is there anyone's coming to pick us up,

451
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,920
with

452
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,880
the flower garland?

453
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,120
Then we get in the car.

454
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,600
We can contact Mike (Wu Yige)

455
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,680
to pick us up.

456
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,560
He's a local.

457
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,120
Call him now.

458
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,480
Sure.

459
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,320
Hello.

460
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,250
We're about to arrive in Thailand.

461
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,080
Mike, can you come pick us up?

462
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,560
What?

463
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,000
We'll be in Thailand soon.

464
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,400
We're leaving any minute.

465
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,000
We're already in the airport lounge.

466
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,560
We're coming to Thailand soon.

467
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,160
See you in four hours.

468
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,280
Is it today?

469
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,240
Yes, today.

470
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,440
Can't you see we're all...

471
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,520
Look, we're all packed and ready to go.

472
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,980
We're already recording.

473
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,119
Is it really today or...

474
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,880
Are you joking?

475
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,359
No joke.

476
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,440
Why else would we be like this?

477
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,800
Alright, just kidding.

478
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,400
It's tomorrow.

479
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,079
The day after tomorrow.

480
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:19,920
The day after tomorrow.

481
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,079
The day after tomorrow.

482
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,520
We're leaving the day after tomorrow.

483
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,240
The day after tomorrow.

484
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,680
We're leaving the day after tomorrow.

485
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,319
What a chat.

486
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,180
Where are you planning to take us?

487
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,320
My restaurant.

488
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,480
What kind of food?

489
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,840
My restaurant isn't open yet.

490
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,800
But you...

491
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,440
you...

492
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,400
just come first.

493
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,720
Your Chinese is so good.

494
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,080
Really? No way.

495
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,800
My Chinese has gotten worse.

496
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,240
No one here

497
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,520
speaks Chinese with me.

498
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,450
In these five days,
we will make you improve rapidly.

499
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,280
Okay.

500
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,680
Mike(Wu Yige), bring us

501
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,680
the flowers.

502
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,240
Flowers.

503
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:56,920
Melon.

504
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,400
Flowers?

505
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,200
The welcome flower garland.

506
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,480
The "welcome to Thailand" one, right?

507
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:04,680
Yes.

508
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,200
Yes.

509
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,440
Okay.

510
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,440
See you the day after tomorrow, bro.

511
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,040
Okay.

512
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,120
Bye-bye.

513
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,040
Bye-bye.

514
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,570
Please check your hitcard in front of you.

515
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,480
Have fun on your "If" Trip to Thailand.

516
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,400
Hitcard?

517
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,840
Please do not read the contents out loud.

518
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,640
Don't read it. Just show me.

519
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,240
Don't read it. Just show me.

520
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,880
I won't.

521
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,080
No need to read it out.

522
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,280
I'll just take a look.

523
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,320
Do you think I'm stupid?

524
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,000
What is written on your card?

525
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,400
What is written on yours?

526
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,560
Okay, I get it.

527
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,640
Please capture five moments

528
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,440
where you beat him up on the trip.

529
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,440
Please capture your expression
when she beats you up.

530
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,240
"THAI SWEET!"

531
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,640
Let's head out together!

532
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,120
Let's go to Hao Xiang Lai.

533
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,760
Right here.

534
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,640
A snack paradise right outside my place.

535
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,920
Good food. Fun stuff.

536
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,720
Everything.

537
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,880
And super cheap.

538
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,760
I have one near my place, too.

539
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,480
Let's pick some tasty snacks.

540
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,920
I like chicken feet.

541
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,360
Let's get two small buns.

542
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,120
Okay.

543
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,120
This place has such a complete selection
of snacks.

544
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,050
They have everything I love to eat.

545
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,760
Take a few more.

546
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,320
Let's go, Zhao.

547
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,200
Let's go pay.

548
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,640
Okay.

549
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,240
I wonder how much this basket will cost.

550
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,240
This huge bag of snacks
only cost a little over 100 yuan?

551
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,440
Hao Xiang Lai is truly tasty,
fun, and cheap.

552
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,680
Xin, enjoy your snacks.

553
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,560
Thank you.

554
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,420
Come on, Zhao, help me take these.

555
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,560
Wait, Zhao.

556
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,160
What's that?

557
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,480
So cute.

558
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,960
This Kaka princess bunny,

559
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,800
the good little kitty,

560
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,880
and the tour-guide bear.

561
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,320
I like them all.

562
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,440
Which one should I choose?

563
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,560
Don't hesitate.

564
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,240
Take them all.

565
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,040
They're not expensive anyway.

566
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,640
Buying them all increases your chances.

567
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,280
Then I'll take a whole box.

568
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,720
I'll bring them to Thailand

569
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,240
to share with the locals.

570
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,480
Let's go pay.

571
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,180
Hello everyone, I'm Zhao.

572
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,920
We're getting ready to leave for Thailand.

573
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,840
Let me show you

574
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,170
what I've packed today.

575
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,480
Two sun-protection shirts,

576
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,320
the functional kind.

577
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,280
They can be inflated

578
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,120
and turned into neck pillows.

579
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,400
This is a sun umbrella.

580
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,080
I also brought two CCD cameras

581
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,140
for taking photos.

582
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,640
And mosquito repellent,

583
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,560
because

584
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,820
Thailand might have a lot of mosquitoes.

585
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,400
Okay, I'll go

586
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,080
pick up Mu,

587
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,810
and then we'll leave together.

588
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,240
Time to go.

589
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,160
Mu should be ready by now.

590
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,850
She probably got up earlier than I did.

591
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,520
Let me ask if she's up.

592
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:13,960
She's

593
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,820
definitely up.

594
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,880
I'm coming to pick you up now,

595
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,810
then we're heading to the airport.

596
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,880
How are you doing?

597
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,480
Mu is ready to go.

598
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,440
I heard someone's downstairs
to pick me up.

599
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,240
Go.

600
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:31,840
Go, go, go.

601
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,120
Pretty Mu's OOTD.

602
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,320
I'm almost there.

603
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,480
Come out quickly.

604
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,100
Coming.

605
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,520
Looks like she's really dressed up.

606
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,200
Where are you going?

607
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,720
Hello.

608
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,560
Good morning.

609
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,890
Let me take that for you.

610
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,640
Thank you, Zhao.

611
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,120
Are you going to Thailand with me?

612
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,680
That's...

613
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,000
that's

614
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,320
how Zhao talks today?

615
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,000
Let's go.

616
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,250
Look, I'm wearing this on my wrist.

617
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,410
Give it a detailed shot.

618
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,240
Because my neck is too thick.

619
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,480
If I wear it there,

620
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,210
it chokes me.

621
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,040
Look, this is

622
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,440
the moon.

623
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:56,970
The moon.

624
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,520
Because it's from Pretty Mu.

625
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,080
Pretty Mu.

626
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,210
Pretty Mu necklace.

627
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,760
Pretty Mu necklace.

628
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,090
Mu represents the moon.

629
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,400
I gave this to him five months early

630
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,680
as his birthday gift.

631
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,240
Then on his actual birthday,

632
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:12,840
I forgot.

633
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,560
Which activity
are you most looking forward to

634
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,960
on this trip?

635
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,400
I'm excited about the whole trip,

636
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,000
because I don't really know

637
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,660
what activities are planned.

638
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,040
Didn't I show you?

639
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,040
Didn't I show you?

640
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,160
I can't remember.

641
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,400
That sounds a bit formal.

642
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,320
Shrimp fishing.

643
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,250
Shrimp fishing.

644
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,200
Shrimp fishing is
what I'm excited about.

645
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,160
Because you're way too excited

646
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,160
about the shrimp-fishing part,

647
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,620
I want to see how you'll do.

648
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,960
That's something I did as a kid.

649
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,720
She's always excited for this part,

650
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,880
but when it comes,

651
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,160
she might not have the energy

652
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,840
and ends up missing it.

653
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,720
No way.

654
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,360
I'll definitely do the shrimp fishing.

655
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,800
My only concern is that

656
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,520
when I was little,

657
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,360
catching shrimp

658
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,880
was actually pretty hard.

659
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,920
I'm afraid

660
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,600
now my skills are too advanced,

661
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,280
I'll catch them too easily,

662
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,920
and it won't be as fun.

663
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,120
Welcome to Thailand.

664
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,400
No matter how sweet Thai coconuts are,

665
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,000
they're still not sweeter than
the way you two look at each other.

666
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,520
I'll take you to try

667
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,720
a very special restaurant in Thailand.

668
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,120
Dinosaur egg.

669
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,000
Black sand.

670
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,520
This is fish.
