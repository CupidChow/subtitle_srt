00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:21,610
[If a journey is an adventure,
it's good to have friends' companionship]

754
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,400
After being in the sun for so long today,

755
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,930
I need to do some
urgent whitening treatment.

756
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,080
Oh no. I've run out.

757
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,200
Don't worry.

758
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,570
I have extras here.

759
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,680
Great.

760
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,680
My sunburned skin is saved.

761
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:43,800
Nothing beats the Mageline Time Trilogy.

762
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,440
Repair, whitening, anti-aging.

763
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,280
All in one set.

764
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,880
8x whitening, 5x firming.

765
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:49,960
After using it,

766
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,000
skin becomes soft and glowing.

767
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,560
Tomorrow Na Na
will definitely be even better.

768
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,880
Keep it up!

769
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,140
[Next Episode]

770
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,740
To give this trip a perfect ending,

771
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,970
let's have one last party together!

772
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:01,970
Sure!

773
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,520
Sure.

774
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,540
We'll set things up.

775
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,200
All the heavy, tiring, hard work.

776
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,190
Let's all get ready separately.

777
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,590
Alright.

778
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,360
We can discuss

779
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,960
what kind of performance we should do.

780
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,960
That's so sudden.

781
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,080
Why don't we each prepare a surprise?

782
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,800
That works too.

783
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,680
Welcome everyone

784
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,160
to the THAI SWEET "If" Party.

785
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,120
Hello everyone,

786
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,400
I'm Jiang Mu.

787
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:25,050
Next, we'll have an award ceremony,

788
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,480
and there will be a little
surprise reveal.

789
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,240
We'll be giving each of

790
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,800
our good friends an award

791
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,760
related to the word "Thai."

792
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,040
Who is it?

793
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,800
