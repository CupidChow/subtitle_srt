Who wanted to go shrimp fishing?

570
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,250
The theme

is not about shrimp fishing.

572
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:11,530
Not shrimp fishing.

573
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:12,250
Then I have to think of something else.

574
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,620
That's too broad to imagine.

575
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,250
Just guess anything.

576
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,090

591
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,560
a bit too heavy today?

592
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,900
My makeup is smudged.

593
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:55,170
