[Basically me
when I'm not listening to the lecture.]

292

[Note: Elephants consume
around 400 kg of food daily,]

This is salt.

Elephants need to drink 100–200 liters
of water a day.

312

They often don't drink enough.

[Salt increases water intake.]

315

we give them salt

316
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,940
so they get thirsty,

317
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,400
and thirst makes them drink more water.

318
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:09,910
