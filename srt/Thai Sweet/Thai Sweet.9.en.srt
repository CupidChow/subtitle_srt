1
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,760
Hey, handsome guys down there!

2
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,800
His line was to tell me,

3
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,240
"I like Chinese girls,"

4
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,840
and then say

5
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,720
"interesting" to my back.

6
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,039
Did you say it?

7
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:11,120
Did you really say "interesting"?

8
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:11,840
Really?

9
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,360
Yes.

10
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,720
What's wrong? Not into it?

11
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,200
Water sports.

12
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,240
Take it easy on us two old folks.

13
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,920
Seriously.

14
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,720
Hold on.

15
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,800
He doesn't like hearing that.

16
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,560
It's fine.

17
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,200
You young ones go have fun.

18
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,320
Now you suddenly realize
you're getting older?

19
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,760
She took off.

20
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,880
Next trip theme:
If the journey is an adventure,

21
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,760
may you play to your heart's content,

22
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,720
laugh without restraint,

23
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,480
collect all the unexpected surprises,

24
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,320
and write your own story.

25
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,320
Hey, handsome guys down there!

26
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,680
Hello.

27
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,160
Hello.

28
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,000
Good morning.

29
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,280
What?

30
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,680
Let's strike a pose.

31
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,200
Come on, pose!

32
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,280
Nice!

33
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,680
Okay.

34
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,440
Let's go eat.

35
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:18,960
Let's go.

36
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,240
Time to eat.

37
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,120
Good morning, everybody.

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,480
This breakfast is amazing.

39
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,480
Cheers, everyone—

40
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,640
Good morning!

41
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,320
English in Dalian dialect.

42
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,360
Good morning.

43
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,560
Let's dig in!

44
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,520
Let's eat up.

45
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,640
It's salted egg yolk flavor.

46
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,960
Did you sleep well last night?

47
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,240
Pretty good—I was dead tired.

48
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,400
I went home and crashed.

49
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,360
I was totally out cold.

50
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,400
Same here.

51
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,200
Totally zonked out.

52
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,079
I thought you'd come chat,

53
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,480
but after waiting a bit, I realized

54
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,600
you weren't coming at all.

55
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,400
I was out cold too.

56
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,120
My guess was that you'd just
gone back and crashed.

57
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,200
She was already

58
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,480
fading fast on the way back.

59
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,880
Chill it for a bit.

60
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,200
As long as we're happy,
that's what matters.

61
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,240
That's the spirit! Me too.

62
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,200
I was exhausted.

63
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,680
I didn't even shower.

64
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,640
I just took off my makeup

65
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,480
and then passed out cold.

66
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,000
Next thing I knew, it was morning.

67
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,520
When I woke up this morning,

68
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,320
I had no idea where I was.

69
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,360
Everything felt so unfamiliar.

70
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,440
Do we look swollen today?

71
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,280
Do I look swollen?

72
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:40,960
Do I look swollen or not?

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,040
A little.

74
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,760
I don't think so, not really.

75
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,080
Not at all.

76
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,120
You're just saying that!

77
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,880
So swollen.

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,360
Who's swollen?

79
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,680
You look even more swollen.

80
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,680
No way. It can't be.

81
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,240
See?

82
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,800
Look at me.

83
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,640
If we had to film a drama

84
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,360
right after finishing this reality show,

85
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,880
it would be impossible—

86
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,920
we'd totally crack up laughing on set.

87
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,240
His line was to tell me,

88
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,680
"I like Chinese girls,"

89
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,160
and then say

90
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,040
"interesting" to my back.

91
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,800
Did you say it though?

92
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,920
Did you actually say "interesting"?

93
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,080
Yeah, I did.

94
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,720
Really?

95
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,400
Yes.

96
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,760
What's wrong? Not into it?

97
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,160
I am.

98
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,080
Interesting.

99
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,040
He's getting into character now.

100
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,760
Now he's in character.

101
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,600
The first time I met him was actually

102
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,640
during our first scene together—

103
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,120
it was literally

104
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,280
our first encounter.

105
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,400
What did you call each other

106
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,920
when you first met?

107
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,080
When you first meet someone here,

108
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,880
it's common

109
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,280
to call those older than you "Pii"

110
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,480
and those younger "Nong."

111
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,159
Nong Xin.

112
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,000
Nong.

113
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,760
Nong.

114
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,280
So is "little Nong"

115
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:53,960
the correct way to use it?

116
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,280
Small boy.

117
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,000
Well, in that logic
there's also "big Pii."

118
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,760
"Big Pii" for the older one.

119
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,680
"Big Pii" for the older one,

120
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,920
and "little Nong" for the younger one.

121
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,000
You really lead such an organized life.

122
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:15,720
What makes you say that?

123
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,400
It's just—you have everything
so well arranged,

124
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,600
even your home renovation.

125
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,160
You're into home renovation as well?

126
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,760
I'm obsessed with it.

127
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,320
I've been following
his home renovation posts

128
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
on Xiaohongshu.

129
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,120
Fei, how many months has your renovation
been going on?

130
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,880
It's done

131
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,360
and I've moved in.

132
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,280
Finished? How long did it take?

133
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,240
It took 9 months.

134
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,360
It's been five years for mine.

135
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,560
And it's still not done?

136
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,280
Nope.

137
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,360
Then you—

138
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,120
you...

139
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,480
I got scammed?

140
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,080
You got scammed.

141
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,680
Exactly.

142
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,920
I've been scammed 3 times.

143
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,000
Hurry up

144
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,960
and tell your agent

145
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,320
to take the contract
and talk to my agent.

146
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,080
Let's transfer

147
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,000
that renovation contract over.

148
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,360
Would you be able

149
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,680
to work on this in Thailand?

150
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,960
Well, then we might have
to reconsider the price.

151
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,760
Didn't you do

152
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,280
any background check on the company

153
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,720
before you chose them?

154
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,840
I never really had the time.

155
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,080
Then who helped you find this company?

156
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,800
No one—I handled it myself.

157
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,080
Right.

158
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,800
I designed it myself,

159
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,400
drew the plans,

160
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,120
even made the the 3D...

161
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,920
The 3D renderings.

162
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
The 3D renderings.

163
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,080
I had no idea renovations
could be this complicated.

164
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,720
Yes, it is.

165
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,040
I'm also super into renovation—

166
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:19,960
absolutely love it.

167
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,520
And I especially enjoy picking
out materials myself.

168
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,560
Right, it's so much fun.

169
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,800
Even the soft furnishing part
is really enjoyable.

170
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,520
You see the empty space

171
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,920
after the hard finishes

172
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,920
are done,

173
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,560
and you slowly fill it in

174
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,480
piece by piece.

175
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,920
That's the Virgo in you both.

176
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,920
The two of us just like taking photos.

177
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,440
Mike can come up

178
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,520
with all these wild ideas,

179
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,600
but he can't really execute them.

180
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,840
You can't follow through, right?

181
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,159
He's such a Sagittarius,
always coming up with things like,

182
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,000
"I want it like this...

183
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,560
wait, like that over there...

184
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:46,920
I want this and that...

185
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,159
Actually, by then
I'll need this to be different...

186
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:48,800
and here, maybe like this?"

187
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,720
But in the end,

188
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,760
the contractor gets the design drawings

189
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,800
and can't bring any of it to life.

190
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,240
No wonder it's taken 5 years.

191
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,640
Now

192
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,880
I've hired a Chinese company to do it—

193
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,160
they work much faster.

194
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,640
You should've hired
a film set design team—

195
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,440
they're super fast.

196
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,040
Set designers—

197
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,640
actually,

198
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,760
yeah, set designers.

199
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,520
They could finish it in a month.

200
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,040
You should invest in a screen project,

201
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,080
have them shoot at your place,

202
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,800
and get them to do the renovation

203
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,760
as part of the set design.

204
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,400
That's pretty clever.

205
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,320
Really smart idea.

206
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,000
That way the set gets built,

207
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,520
the show gets made,

208
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,200
and it even doubles as free advertising
for your place.

209
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,440
That's actually a great idea.

210
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,560
It actually is.

211
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,040
While the crew is prepping here,

212
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,320
your home renovation gets done too.

213
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,040
And all it takes is one production.

214
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,480
Once filming wraps,

215
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,680
just clean up the place

216
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,440
and you can move right in.

217
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,760
I'll show you

218
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,240
some pictures later.

219
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,040
Sure.

220
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,480
Where do you guys want to go today?

221
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,520
Water sports.

222
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,000
Something thrilling.

223
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,480
I think it'll be really fun.

224
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,360
I'm so looking forward to parasailing.

225
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,360
Me too, seriously.

226
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,919
Last time I wanted to try parasailing

227
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,520
but couldn't.

228
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,560
The parasailing?

229
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,800
But for that, it can't be windy,

230
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,680
and it can't be dark.

231
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,400
We'll join you for it today.

232
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,080
Should we head out now?

233
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,200
Alright, let's head out.

234
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,280
Let's go!

235
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,360
Go, go, go.

236
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,680
Go, go, go.

237
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,160
Let's move.

238
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,600
Go, go, go.

239
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,800
Go, go, go.

240
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,560
Come on.

241
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,480
Thank you.

242
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:12,920
Hop on.

243
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,120
Wait, we need to shoot a poster first.

244
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,040
Look over here.

245
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,760
Diamond.

246
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,120
Three, two.

247
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,800
Okay.

248
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,520
Mike, lean on his shoulder.

249
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,440
Alright, your turn.

250
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,400
Come on.

251
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,240
Come on. Alright.

252
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,160
Three, two, one.

253
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,680
Nice.

254
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,240
Beautiful.

255
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,680
Great shot. Look here.

256
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,480
One more.

257
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,920
Three, two, one.

258
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,000
It's a good one.

259
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,640
They have no free hands
to hold on to the truck.

260
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,640
Let's go.

261
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,040
We've arived.

262
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,760
Let's go.

263
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,480
That was fast.

264
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:35,880
Yeah.

265
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,560
We're all dressed in Thai style.

266
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,880
We look great.

267
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,480
Right.

268
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,280
Look who's directing now.

269
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,360
Thank you, Mike.

270
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,560
Thank you, Mike.

271
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,720
Thank you.

272
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,520
Thank you.

273
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,720
Thanks.

274
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,360
Who's more swollen—you or me?

275
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,320
Me.

276
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,480
I think I can go kayaking.

277
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:00,720
Come on,

278
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,640
Mike, walk faster.

279
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,400
Okay.

280
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:02,920
Pretty?

281
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:03,640
Looks good.

282
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,040
Hey, big brother.

283
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,600
Pii.

284
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,560
Pii.

285
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,400
This is my Nong.

286
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,440
Nong

287
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,320
Pii.

288
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,120
Such an adorable baby.

289
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,880
Look.

290
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,520
Hello.

291
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,200
What a cute baby.

292
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:25,960
High five!

293
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,320
So cute.

294
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:30,920
Lovely.

295
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,920
He must be of mixed heritage.

296
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:35,800
Yeah.

297
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,640
Let's go.

298
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,560
Go!

299
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,520
Let's go.

300
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,160
We're here.

301
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,280
This is the spot for water activities.

302
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,000
Activities: parasailing.

303
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,240
I want to go parasailing.

304
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,160
I'll take the kayak.

305
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,520
Since there are 3 teams,

306
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,320
let's start with a race.

307
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,120
Once that's done,

308
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,720
if we want to try something else,

309
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,480
we can decide by then.

310
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,760
Let's go.

311
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,840
Alright, let's make it a race.

312
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,040
How do we compete?

313
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,920
How should we split into teams?

314
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,480
Mike, how about you and I team up?

315
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,680
Do you want to win?

316
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,240
Yes, I want to win.

317
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,040
Then I won't be on your team.

318
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,840
Do you want to win?

319
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,040
I want to win.

320
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,400
We must win.

321
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,040
I don't want to win.

322
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,960
Why don't you want to win?

323
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,520
Guys get too competitive
when they want to win.

324
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,680
You'd be so focused,

325
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,200
you wouldn't even see me go overboard.

326
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,720
What about teaming up with Mike instead?

327
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,560
You could go with Mike too.

328
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,680
But Mike wants to win as well.

329
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,520
I'll look out for you. Don't worry.

330
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,320
Let's decide with "Pick or Flick."

331
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,360
Come here.

332
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,080
Pick or Flick!

333
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,480
Come.

334
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:42,880
Right.

335
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,480
Pick or Flick.

336
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,360
Okay, the flick one out first,

337
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,200
then the next person left alone

338
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,880
goes on your team.

339
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,320
Pick or Flick!

340
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,080
Take it easy on us two old folks.

341
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,360
Seriously?

342
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,240
Wait!

343
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:01,920
He doesn't like that.

344
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,320
He doesn't like hearing that.

345
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:02,760
It's okay.

346
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,560
He doesn't like hearing that.

347
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,200
Wait.

348
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,800
I'll paddle gently.

349
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,800
He doesn't like hearing that.

350
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,880
Come on.

351
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,440
Let's go.

352
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,320
You sit in the front.

353
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,560
Okay, this one.

354
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:11,960
Yes.

355
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,000
Which end is the front?

356
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,560
That end is the front.

357
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,880
Is that end the front?

358
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,200
Which end is the front, Sir?

359
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,480
Do we only get one paddle each?

360
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,080
Then who holds this one?

361
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,880
Are the waves so rough?

362
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,240
Do we in the front need paddles too?

363
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,040
No.

364
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,400
No paddle for the person in front?

365
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,480
We don't need one in the front?

366
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,880
Shouldn't the person in front
have a paddle too?

367
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,160
Then I'd be putting my life completely

368
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,240
in someone else's hands!

369
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,840
The front person does paddle, you know.

370
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,640
Why are you leaving? Wait a second.

371
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,600
Requesting to return to shore.

372
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,560
No,

373
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,880
we don't have a paddle.

374
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,480
What's going on?

375
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,160
Why do you only have one paddle?

376
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,240
Requesting to return to shore.

377
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,560
Wait, how come there's only one?

378
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:56,680
No,

379
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,120
this is kind of…

380
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,160
There's another paddle here.

381
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,880
I'll give you one.

382
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,240
Are you sure we won't tip over?

383
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,800
Hold on.

384
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,840
Careful.

385
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,120
Okay, we're going offshore.

386
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:24,720
Okay.

387
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,520
Left, right.

388
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,080
Left, right.

389
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,320
Instructor, should we

390
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,040
paddle on the same side at the same time,

391
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,000
or on different sides?

392
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,320
On the same side.

393
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,600
Won't we tip over paddling
on the same side?

394
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,320
Let's try it.

395
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,240
Start on the right.

396
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,840
Three, two, one,

397
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,080
go.

398
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,480
Right side.

399
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,560
One, two.

400
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,840
One, two.

401
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,000
Do we just keep counting?

402
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,720
One, two.

403
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,600
One.

404
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,160
Two.

405
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:57,800
One.

406
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,040
We're passing them.

407
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,200
Why can't we get through?

408
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,440
Turn right.

409
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:05,960
Turn right.

410
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,040
Let's go.

411
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,360
Okay. Come on!

412
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,200
Let's catch them.

413
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,560
Left, right.

414
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,000
Left, right.

415
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,760
Left, right.

416
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,400
Left, right.

417
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,120
Left, right.

418
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,480
We are advancing rapidly.

419
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,640
Left, right.

420
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,120
We're fast!

421
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,560
Aren't we competing?

422
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,200
Alright, we're coming up beside you.

423
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,760
Okay.

424
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,680
We're here.

425
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,320
We're coming.

426
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,000
Wait.

427
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,880
It feels great.

428
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,760
It feels great.

429
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,400
Come on, make some space for us.

430
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,080
Whoa, it's gonna crash!

431
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,960
Come on, make some space for us.

432
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,560
Whoa, it's gonna crash!

433
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,080
Crash!

434
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,000
We're wedged in.

435
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,560
This...

436
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,600
Are you ready?

437
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,360
Ready.

438
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,840
Now, where to?

439
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,880
Where to?

440
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,120
Wherever, I guess.

441
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,920
Don't think about it.

442
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,720
Ready.

443
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,800
Three, two, one.

444
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,840
Left, right.

445
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,480
Left, right.

446
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,320
Left first.

447
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,320
Left, right.

448
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,880
It's fine, we got this.

449
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,040
Let's go.

450
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,760
We're looking so professional right now.

451
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,680
No right.

452
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,480
Left first.

453
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,720
Let's go.

454
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,240
What's going on?

455
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,400
Are we the only ones actually racing?

456
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:25,840
Is that it?

457
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,120
Right.

458
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,640
This is chaos.

459
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,960
Left!

460
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,160
We've just been in a mess this whole time.

461
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,040
Let's head back up.

462
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,960
Let's go.

463
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,800
That's a real arm workout.

464
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,080
That's enough cardio for today.

465
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,000
Yes, cardio quota is filled.

466
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,960
Left.

467
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,360
Right.

468
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,520
Left.

469
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,800
Right.

470
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,280
Watch your hands.

471
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,440
Watch your hands.

472
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,800
Just brushed past them.

473
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,839
Hello.

474
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,000
Feels so relaxing.

475
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,079
Yeah, like you could just fall asleep

476
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:12,520
drifting like this.

477
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,640
Right.

478
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,760
Left.

479
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,920
Right.

480
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,720
We are heading to shore now.

481
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,800
We're going ashore!

482
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,680
Thank you.

483
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,359
That was so much fun.

484
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,040
Thank you.

485
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,240
Thank you.

486
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,720
Seriously, so much fun.

487
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,480
Back in the water again.

488
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,760
What do you call this angle?

489
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,440
A shot from behind.

490
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,480
Feels amazing.

491
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,400
Mike has already set off.

492
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,680
Is Mike coming back to eat later?

493
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,240
Let's go.

494
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,800
Is it fun?

495
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,400
It feels great!

496
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,440
Do you want to take

497
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,320
a couple of film shots by the seaside?

498
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,320
Just like this, okay?

499
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:42,800
Here?

500
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,480
Sure.

501
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,720
Three, two, one.

502
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,560
Okay.

503
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,520
Let's go.

504
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,280
We'll head to the pier over there

505
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,280
and take the boat for parasailing.

506
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,080
Time for parasailing.

507
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,040
Instructor, could you
give her a hand getting on?

508
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,720
Be careful.

509
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,320
I can do it.

510
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,080
No, you shouldn't.

511
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,480
Hold on.

512
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,400
Let me go first.

513
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,080
You go ahead.

514
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,240
Be careful.

515
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,040
I'm not taking part in parasailing.

516
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,480
I'll stay here with you and take pictures.

517
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:20,840
Thank you.

518
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,480
No problem.

519
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:23,960
Thank you.

520
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,360
I won't throw up up there, will I?

521
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,080
That would be quite a scene—

522
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,760
really dramatic.

523
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,040
Throwing up mid-air…

524
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,200
That would go viral for sure.

525
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,120
Who's going first for this activity?

526
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,920
Okay, you hold this.

527
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,040
Let's get this a bit tighter.

528
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,600
What's that?

529
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,400
She's about to start.

530
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:51,880
I'm heading into the water.

531
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,760
You're heading into the sky.

532
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,120
For a second there,
I thought you'd caught a fish!

533
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,000
Last time we went

534
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,120
for water sports,

535
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,560
I got held up by other things

536
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,040
and couldn't go parasailing.

537
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,400
So I'm really excited
to finally get to do it!

538
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,240
You can do this.

539
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,600
Who's next?

540
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,760
No, no, no.

541
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,240
None of you are going?

542
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,040
Come on, bro.

543
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,600
What, you value your life that much?

544
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,000
Come on, give it a shot.

545
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,800
You go first.

546
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,200
You go ahead.

547
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,000
You won't fall in—

548
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,080
you'll just glide up there for a bit.

549
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,800
You young folks go have fun.

550
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,680
Now you suddenly realize
you're getting older?

551
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,080
Now you admit you're getting older.

552
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,800
It got on my face.

553
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,240
A bit of extra salt, I guess.

554
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,840
So salty.

555
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,440
Sorry.

556
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,440
It seems fun.

557
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,760
Looking forward to it.

558
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,560
Are we gonna end up flying off

559
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,560
with the boat later?

560
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,920
You need to take off your shoes.

561
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,200
I'll take them off.

562
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,440
You've got this.

563
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,520
This...

564
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,920
Where do I hold on?

565
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:25,960
Wait a second.

566
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,560
Let go.

567
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,760
So worried.

568
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,120
Wait, isn't the wind a bit too strong?

569
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:32,640
Like this?

570
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,600
Yeah.

571
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,520
Go for it.

572
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,040
Go for it!

573
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,360
Come on.

574
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,360
She took off.

575
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,320
Awesome!

576
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,920
She looks so small up there.

577
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,960
That feeling of floating

578
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,000
in the sky with the wind—

579
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,080
it was pure freedom.

580
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,920
This trip is really worth it.

581
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,680
She looks so happy!

582
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,240
She doesn't look scared at all.

583
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,640
Is it fun?

584
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,640
So fun.

585
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,080
Your turn—

586
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,600
you go up too.

587
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,640
You go ahead.

588
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,360
My contacts
would definitely fly right out.

589
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,720
We're already here,
and the cameras are rolling.

590
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,320
I don't dare to.

591
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,000
Okay, Paipai,

592
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,240
you're next.

593
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,240
How do you feel right now?

594
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,240
I'm kind of looking forward to it,
not gonna lie.

595
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,080
Really looking forward to it?

596
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:49,760
Kind of looking forward to it.

597
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,160
What about you, Li Ao?

598
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,960
Easy and relaxed.

599
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:54,920
Easy and relaxed.

600
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,560
Right.

601
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,840
And then our Fei

602
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,040
is the next, right?

603
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,240
Aren't you filming anymore?

604
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:01,920
The smile just vanished.

605
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,880
Actually it's not that high.

606
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,280
It's acceptable.

607
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,280
It's acceptable.

608
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,840
The boat's slowing down,
and she's coming down.

609
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,320
Looks pretty nice up there.

610
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,400
Okay, she's landing.

611
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,360
Amazing!

612
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,880
Was it fun?

613
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,440
Was it fun?

614
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,280
Was it fun?

615
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,000
Yes, so much fun.

616
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,160
It's really comfortable up there.

617
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,200
Are contacts still intact?

618
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:32,920
Yeah, no problem at all.

619
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,560
Was it easier than skydiving?

620
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,360
Yeah. That sudden pull
when you take off is incredible.

621
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,160
Alright, my turn then.

622
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,800
I'll go now.

623
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,640
You go ahead.

624
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,400
You've got this.

625
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,400
You've got this.

626
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,200
Be careful.

627
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,840
Up you go.

628
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,360
So funny.

629
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,240
He seems so scared.

630
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,040
So cool.

631
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,880
Feels amazing.

632
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,160
Let's just…

633
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,880
take in the view.

634
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,720
So free.

635
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,000
Fun, right?

636
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,080
So much fun.

637
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,800
Hello,

638
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,600
it's me.

639
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,680
Isn't the wind crazy up here?

640
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,120
Why...

641
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,640
Why is it so shaky?

642
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,280
I feel like a bird

643
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,440
flying into a dark cloud.

644
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,720
Are you happy up there in the sky?

645
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,080
So happy.

646
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,760
So beautiful.

647
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,320
It doesn't feel that scary.

648
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,080
Was it fun?

649
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:35,160
How are you feeling?

650
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,720
Really great.

651
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,880
Then I'll give it a try.

652
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,600
Actually, it's fine—

653
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,920
it's just like doing wire work.

654
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,480
Is this done?

655
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,280
Is this done?

656
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,680
Wave your hand.

657
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,000
She's coming down now.

658
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,840
Let her savor the moment for a bit.

659
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,120
Bye-bye.

660
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,600
We're going night squid fishing.

661
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,280
What's up?

662
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,480
Are you secretly a fishing pro?

663
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:58,840
I caught one.

664
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,480
I got one here!

665
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,440
Really?
