[Learning right away]

765
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,810
[Footage from online sources]

766
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:09,680
Can you do it?

767
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:09,880
Got it.

768
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,370
[Learned in one go.]

769
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:11,770
He learned it super fast.

770
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,110
That fast?

771
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:40,560
Impressive.

772
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,320
[If you ever feel lost, those moments
of pure joy will light the way.]

773
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,450
Full of expression.

774
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,300
Exactly.

775
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,110
Na Na, look—
this mini card is so finely made.

776
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,290
Though this mini card from Hitcard

777
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,660
looks 3D,

778
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:57,630
it actually feels smooth
and flat to the touch.

779
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:58,510
Here, feel it.

780
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,750
Oh, you're right.

781
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:01,940
How did they do that?

782
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:02,870
This card

783
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,820
uses micro-nano-level
planar stereoscopic technology.

784
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,920
It creates a 3D visual effect

785
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,510
while the surface remains completely flat.

786
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,350
Yet it looks

787
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:11,130
much more vivid than regular cards,

788
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,160
with an incredibly strong 3D effect—

789
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,750
almost as if the image could jump
right out and interact with you.

790
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,870
The quality is really top-notch, too.

791
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:17,950
We can pack it up

792
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:18,990
after playing today

793
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:19,820
and use it again next time.

794
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,420
So much attention to detail.

795
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:25,820
Let's go check out the water activities.

796
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,630
[Next Episode]

797
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,450
Come on, make some space for us.

798
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:30,780
Whoa, it's gonna crash!

799
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,070
Hey, why the hitting?

800
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,090
So satisfying.

801
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,330
Mike, are you coming back to eat later?

802
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,540
You young folks go have fun.

803
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:47,350
Now you suddenly realize
you're getting older?

804
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,170
Are we gonna end up flying off

805
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,300
with the boat later?

806
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,210
Incredible.

807
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:55,690
Hello, everyone.

808
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:57,970
It's me.

809
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,600
