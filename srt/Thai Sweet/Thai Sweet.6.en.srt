two steps forward,

00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,320
steady side to her—

190
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,460
kind of like

191
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,130
a knight-errant vibe.

192
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:04,710
[Only I can see that side of her.]

193
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,070
He seems like someone

194
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,160
who's always laughing

195
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,760
and having fun with everyone,

196
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,840
but in reality,
he's a really thoughtful guy.

197
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:11,970
He

198
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:12,600
[A sensitive guy.]

199
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,200
has a knack

200
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,160
for picking up on things

201
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,600
others might miss.

202
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:15,920
He pays

203
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,440
attention to small details

204
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,000
and really takes care of everyone.

205
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,680
Like

206
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,720
when I first joined the crew,

207
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,400
to help us get closer,

208
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
he found out
which cartoon character I liked

209
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,520
and even bought me

210
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,290
something with that character on it.

211
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,970
[Broke the ice with a gift.]

212
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,040
"What do you think

213
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,680
is the biggest regret
in Mu and Zhao's story?"

214
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,800
I think the biggest regret

215
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,800
is that Zhao didn't

216
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,640
directly tell Mu

217
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,080
about his pain

218
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,880
and struggles back then.

219
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,920
Actually, that way

220
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,880
both sides suffered.

221
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,880
It would've been better to tell Mu.

222
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,280
And Mu...

223
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,280
I believe, in her heart,

224
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,340
Mu would've chosen

225
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,360
to stay by Zhao's side.

226
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,200
My regret is

227
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,710
that we didn't get to have

228
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,200
a wrap-up meal together in Thailand.

229
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:01,490
That's a lasting regret for me,

230
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,560
[No wrap-up meal in Thailand.]

231
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,760
a real heartache.

232
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:06,470
But honestly,

233
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,240
[We'll make it up this time.]

234
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,880
when we can still get together
for a variety show and have this much fun,

235
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,170
then maybe there aren't any real regrets.

236
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,650
[The unspoken regret,
once a tiny fracture in the heart.]

237
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:19,650
[Yet time, with gentle favor,
has tenderly sealed it shut.]

238
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,150
[Who is calling?]

239
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:23,970
I'll get it.

240
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,780
Why is it a phone call
and not a video call?

241
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,900
He's removed his makeup.

242
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,460
Hello,

243
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,690
why no video?

244
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,409
No, I don't want to video call,
because I have a surprise for you guys.

245
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:34,120
[Mike called with a surprise.]

246
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,440
What's the surprise?

247
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,360
Are you going to jump up from the sea?

248
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:37,680
No,

249
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,810
from the river?

250
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,000
You'd see it if it were a video call.

251
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,870
You're not going to descend
from the sky, are you?

252
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,450
Alright, come out already, Mike.

253
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,120
Didn't you hear
that gurgling sound just now?

254
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,159
Look to your left.

255
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,520

256

257
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,620
Hello.

258
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,720
I see you!

259
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,540
Right there.

260
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:55,570
Can you see me?

261
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,190
See a handsome guy?

262
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,570

-Yes.

265
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:02,570
Great!

266
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,280
Over there.

267
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,240
Hurry up and come over.

268

Get over here, you guys!

269
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,640
What's up?

270
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,760
Check out my surprise.

271
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,160
Okay.

272
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,360
Go!

273
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,360
Fireworks.

274
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,440
Beautiful, right?

275
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,720
Fireworks!

276
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,340
A fountain of sparkling fire.

277
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,000
Beautiful, isn't it?

278
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,580
Zhao, look!

279
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,559
It's stunning!

280
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:53,070
[To brighten their trip, Mike prepared
fireworks early for Mu and Zhao.]

281
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,760
Is that the one?

282
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,000
The pink light.

283
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,410
This is where we filmed.

This is the place I mentioned for singing.

287
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,200
Right.

288
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,960
And we filmed a kiss scene here too.

289
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,640
Yes.

290
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,270
[The set of this old place
remains just as it was.]

291
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,680

the tenderness left unspoken between us.]

THAI SWEET.

295
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,370
Mu, something urgent
just came up at home,

296
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,110
and I have to leave now.

297
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,590
But I've asked Lin Sui

298
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,080
to keep you company
for the next part of the trip.

is that check-in you've been waiting for—

303
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,480
getting photos in a Thai school uniform.

304
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,230

378
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,000
Thank you.

379
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,970
Where can I change?

380
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,230
Fitting room, inside.

381
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,880
Could you film a moving shot for me?

382
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,280
Sure.

383
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,860
Coming now.

Let's do it again.

395
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,400
I'll stand like this,

396
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,080
and you can

397
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,320
pan up from here.

398
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,450
A bit higher, right?

399
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,360
Yes, a bit higher.

400
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,000
Just tilt down

401
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,520
and you'll get my whole look.

402
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,160
Not bad.

403
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,720
One more time.

404
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,280
Okay.

Zhao,

418
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,720
I took some really cute photos
in the uniform.

419
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,650
I'm super happy.

420

Hello.

Are these samples

432
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,160
for us to paint from?

What do you want to paint?

443
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,370
We could paint on shoes.

how about we paint one together,

448

for Zhao?

these shoes together.

454
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,320
A larger size.

43...

Size 43.5.

460
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:45,750
How about this one?

461
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,410
That works.

462
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,560
Okay.

He likes blue.

[Picks the blue color that He Yu likes.]

465
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,630
And

he likes sharks.

467
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,220
Sorry, what?

468
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:55,430
He likes sharks.

[Remembers it clearly.]

470
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:57,470
Sorry, sharks?

The sharks in the water.

Oh, sharks.

00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,960
Yes, he likes sharks.

I think I can...

[What's done cannot be undone.]

476
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,180
I think I'd say…

"When water meets, fortune greets."

478
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,950
Sorry.

[Drawing meticulously.]

484
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,000
Should we text him later

485
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,530
and ask which one he likes better?

486
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,040
Sure.

487
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,730
But we can't—

488
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,730
we can't tell him who painted which.

489
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,590
Of course not.

490
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,370
From what I know,

491
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,010

[Zhao is gonna like mine better,
for sure.]

493
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,940
How would you know?

494
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,360
Just a guess.

495
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,040
I'm done.

496
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,090
You're done?

497
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,480
I painted it using his favorite color

498
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:21,570
and added a moon to represent Mu.

499
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:22,720

Are you done?

503
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:26,490
Yep.

504
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,610
Let's take a photo for you and the shoes.

505
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,610
A photo together.

506
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,200
Yes.

507
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,360
Let me ask Zhao

508
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,790
which pair he likes.

509
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,350
Alright.

510
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,690
[Zhao, which of these two shoes
do you prefer?]

511
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:45,600
Let's wait for his reply.

512
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,120
Okay.

513
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,140
Can I make a little beaded jewelry?

514
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,880
Okay.

515
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,600
I've never done this kind of thing before.

516
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,030
Really?

517
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,760
I mean this kind of handicraft.

518
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,050
Silver should look quite...

519
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,650
Actually, this gold and silver one
looks nice.

520
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,400
He said he likes this one.

521
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,730
[He wins.]

522
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,200
Zhao says he likes this one.

523
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,640
[Zhao chose Lin Sui's shark shoe.]

524
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,500
From what I know,

525
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,160
he'd definitely prefer mine.

526
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,359
See? I understand him well.

[The confidence of a champion.]

00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,440
Hello.

529
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,270
That's mine. I painted that one.

530
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:20,099
Let me continue making one for Zhao.

531
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,890
[This time, I'm going
to win Zhao's heart back.]

532
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:22,950
Who's that one for?

533
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:23,710
For you.

534
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,490
[The Master Balancer is now in session.]

535
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,880
For me? Great.

536
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,030
Then make one for me.

537
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,860
[Focused]

538
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,260
Do you think I've changed

539
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,730
from the person you met 8 years ago?

540
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,960
[From their 2017 collaboration:
the TV series My Amazing Boyfriend.]

541
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,820
Still the same.

542
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,140
Your  personality hasn't changed.

543
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,720
But I noticed your acting—

544
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,800
how do I put it?

545
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,480
Acting skills.

546
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,340
Acting skills.

547
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,320
Improved?

548
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:55,920
Improved.

549
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:56,710
[Sounds great; love it!]

550
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,320
Very much so.

551
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,320
Do you still remember how it was

552
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,760
When we were filming?

553
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,880
I couldn't cry.

554
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,640
You couldn't cry.

555
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,800
Was that the first time

556
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,640
you had trouble crying?

557
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,360
It was hard.

558
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,200
Back then, I still—

559
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,400
I still didn't know Chinese.

560
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,200
You actually did quite well.

561
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,760
You spoke pretty well.

562
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,640
I didn't.

563
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,920
I pronounced "Wo zhidao"
in a really awkward way.

564
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,210
[The untamable retroflex.]

565
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,320
But that's the lines—

566
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,860
