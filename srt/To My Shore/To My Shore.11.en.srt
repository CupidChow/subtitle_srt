1
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:17,479
A wind that only seems gentle

2
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:22,440
Your gaze shimmers with a dark undertow

3
00:00:23,479 --> 00:00:28,119
Who is laughing at my madness

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,560
yet indulges my startled heart

5
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:38,959
I see through your mask

6
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:44,159
and let you probe my limits

7
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,758
It is I who indulge

8
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,400
Love blazes like fire

9
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,839
spreading

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,879
Hard to say who crossed the line first

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,758
and who is waiting for whom to yield

12
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,598
Sharing rouge-scented smoke

13
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,638
and the flame that collides at our lips

14
00:01:07,639 --> 00:01:10,000
fiercer than any tender lingering

15
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,838
a duel that stakes our pride

16
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:18,080
whether a calamity decreed by fate

17
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:23,319
or sweetness bestowed by heaven

18
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,638
I still choose craving, wrath, and folly's

19
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:30,278
mad notion

20
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:33,400
made real

21
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:40,719
To hold your gaze is far too perilous

22
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,838
I walk devoutly toward my ruin

23
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:54,839
You are my abyss

24
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,918
You are my

25
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:08,479
sunshine

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
"To My Shore"

27
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:32,279
Shulang.

28
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,240
You're here.

29
00:02:34,645 --> 00:02:35,898
(Sugar Baby Contract)

30
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:37,160
Sign it.

31
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,936
What's this supposed to mean?

32
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,399
What it says on the page.

33
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,759
We're not… that kind of relationship.

34
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,679
Then what are we?

35
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,558
You still planning to
sleep with me for free?

36
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:51,559
Shulang.

37
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,599
I just want things back the way they were.

38
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,039
I want things back to
before I ever met you.

39
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,239
You can punish me,

40
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,079
but not by humiliating yourself like this.

41
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,679
I'm not humiliating myself.

42
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:06,905
I just want every debt between
us settled—clean, clear, on paper.

43
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:09,758
Fine,

44
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,759
I'll sign.

45
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,639
But let's flip it—you be my sugar daddy.

46
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:16,160
I don't have money to keep you.

47
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,639
No need.

48
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:19,800
Just cook for me.

49
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:25,639
If I'm the sugar daddy,

50
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:29,240
then I'm on top.

51
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,240
Deal.

52
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,919
Come here.

53
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,519
On your knees.

54
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:54,320
Everything's fine...

55
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,640
except that face.

56
00:04:58,119 --> 00:05:00,440
Looking at it pisses me off.

57
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,358
I picked up this mask on vacation

58
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:10,320
just because it looked unique...

59
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,959
I didn't expect it to be cursed.

60
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:16,479
Ever since I rear-ended you,

61
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,200
that hell-demon has been glued to me.

62
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,799
It suits you.

63
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,640
Put it on...

64
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:30,839
cover that face.

65
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,279
What's wrong...

66
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:29,079
did I not serve you well enough?

67
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:32,600
You served me very well.

68
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,480
Now

69
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:37,799
go wait for me on the bed.

70
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,600
Shulang's back at my side...

71
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:57,279
so why am I still panicking...?

72
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,500
(Episode 11)

73
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,200
Keep the mask?

74
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,600
No need.

75
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,238
Mask or no mask...

76
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:34,958
it's the same underneath.

77
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,079
Then the clothes...

78
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:38,720
do you undress me,

79
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,519
or do I do it myself?

80
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:44,359
Do it yourself.

81
00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:31,920
Shulang!

82
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,159
Scared?

83
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,080
Your turn.

84
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:39,919
I'm just amped up…
and a little nervous.

85
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:58,479
I'm really not turned on by you.

86
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,679
You make me sick.

87
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:10,118
A patron should act like a patron.

88
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:11,558
If I'm the kept one,

89
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:13,679
I can't let my patron leave disappointed.

90
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,239
I'll make you happy.

91
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:17,478
Get off me.

92
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:19,520
Fan Xiao, get off.

93
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,679
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

94
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,520
It's all my fault...

95
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:38,359
my sins are heavy.

96
00:09:38,719 --> 00:09:40,559
I'm tired.

97
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,919
Let's get it over with.

98
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:47,239
No. That's not us.

99
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,559
Okay—quit it.

100
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:59,000
This isn't who we are.

101
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,719
Shulang…

102
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:08,440
you're crying.

103
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,359
Where are you going?

104
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:36,320
The guest room.

105
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,760
No.

106
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,799
Shulang…

107
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,840
Go ahead.

108
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,119
Before he would've said,

109
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,280
“I'll finish my smoke and come back in.”

110
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,918
I'll head back in once
I finish this cigarette.

111
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:07,358
Wind's strong out here.

112
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:10,200
If you're cold, don't stay out.

113
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:36,399
Young President Qin,

114
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,879
I hear

115
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,439
this new Department Head You

116
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,159
is a real powerhouse.

117
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,879
Director You...

118
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,238
if you ever

119
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:47,279
get fed up working for Young President Qin,

120
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,358
my company's doors are always open.

121
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:50,959
Mr. Lin, you flatter me.

122
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,239
What now, headhunting right in front of me?

123
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:57,479
We're just being open with each other.

124
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:01,799
Mr. Lin...

125
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,760
let me introduce you
to someone over here.

126
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:07,359
Bottoms up!

127
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,520
Waiter.

128
00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:11,399
A chilled towel, please.

129
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,599
Right away.

130
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,400
You okay?

131
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,280
I just need a minute
to sleep off the booze.

132
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,799
You really drank a lot on my behalf.

133
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,080
But

134
00:13:21,081 --> 00:13:22,358
I already swapped yours

135
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:24,879
for water...

136
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,799
don't give it away later.

137
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:32,718
Mr. Lin—come, come.

138
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:33,879
We're not going home till we're drunk.

139
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,760
Fill them up!
Good, good!

140
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,159
Gotta go, see you.

141
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,080
See you later, goodbye.

142
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:43,359
Thanks to you tonight, Young President Qin,

143
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:45,479
otherwise who knows what state I'd end up in.

144
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:48,119
You did great.

145
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,760
From now on.

146
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,479
Stick with me.

147
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,119
I'm honored by your faith in me.

148
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,400
I'll see you to the car...

149
00:13:58,559 --> 00:13:59,679
rest early.

150
00:14:04,359 --> 00:14:05,479
See you tomorrow.

151
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,320
Shulang.

152
00:14:20,321 --> 00:14:21,520
I'm here to drive you home.

153
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:23,960
I told you not to.

154
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,159
I…

155
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:28,239
I happened to be eating nearby...

156
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:30,520
I wasn't waiting on purpose.

157
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:33,240
We're headed the same way.
Let me give you a lift, okay?

158
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,880
Fine.

159
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:37,280
Bring the car around.

160
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,879
I need a consolidated report on Q1

161
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,759
office supplies usage

162
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,599
and

163
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:00,880
the actual budget outlay.

164
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:03,640
Whatever relationship drama you've got,

165
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:05,718
don't let it affect work.

166
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:06,960
First thing tomorrow morning

167
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,799
I want all of that information
on my desk.

168
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:11,679
Yes, President Qin.

169
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,919
“Young President Qin,” huh?

170
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:17,199
Qin as in “Qin Xianglian,” [TN: intimating he's a heartless man]

171
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,759
or Qin as in “Qin Hui”? [TN: intimating he's a traitor]

172
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,038
Sorry—I may just be an overseas Hua person,

173
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,559
but I haven't read much,

174
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:25,519
so my knowledge of the
motherland's history is limited.

175
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,879
But even I know

176
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,798
this is his off-hours.

177
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,520
There's no reason to keep barking orders.

178
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,239
Ever heard of labor laws?

179
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:34,000
Drive.

180
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,200
Punk.

181
00:15:44,599 --> 00:15:46,880
I wasn't trying to meddle with your job.

182
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:49,880
I just can't stand that Qin

183
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,200
barking at you.

184
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,238
Why don't you come work for me?

185
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:55,960
Xu Zhong's got his fingers in everything

186
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,679
and never has my best interests at heart.

187
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,718
I've got too much to juggle,

188
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:01,719
and I can't be everywhere at once.

189
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,640
Shulang,

190
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,039
come help me—please?

191
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,839
You're pretty confident I'll help you.

192
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,358
You're not worried I'll team up with Xu Zhong

193
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:14,159
and gut your company?

194
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,039
There's no need for you to gut it.

195
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,840
If you want it,

196
00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:19,640
I'll hand you the whole company.

197
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,320
As if that's up to you.

198
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,400
I heard that Fan Yu's still auditing your books.

199
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:37,000
Enough talk...

200
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,400
let's go.

201
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,079
Thorough and meticulous.

202
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,279
I wonder if...

203
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,079
I ended up occupying your leisure time?

204
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,000
Not at all.

205
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,238
These were already sorted earlier...

206
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:04,800
I didn't have to work late.

207
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,680
I knew you were better than them.

208
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:11,680
My instincts are never wrong.

209
00:17:11,719 --> 00:17:15,479
My office is strictly business,

210
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,519
but today I'll make an exception.

211
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,920
Was that man last night

212
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,520
your boyfriend?

213
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,799
Even if you make an exception,

214
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,560
I can't.

215
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:27,399
At work

216
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,800
I don't discuss my private life.

217
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:31,359
As a subordinate,

218
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:33,160
you shouldn't talk back...

219
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:34,920
but I like you more for it.

220
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,159
I looked into it last night.

221
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,039
That man who hassled you

222
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,870
is named Fan Xiao.

223
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:45,191
(Pinfeng Venture Capital Details)

224
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,279
I've got

225
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,920
his family background,

226
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,560
plus the information
on the group he controls.

227
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:54,319
And

228
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,118
a suicide attempt video that just
surfaced online a few days ago.

229
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,999
You think I want to be up here?

230
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,640
You forced me!

231
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,000
Me and my dad—we were this close to luck.

232
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,839
Why else would I be
begging Fan Xiao for money?

233
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:11,719
He's blackmailing me because of you.

234
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,400
Now that you've ruined my plan...

235
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,839
you're trying to kill me?!

236
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,280
I can more or less infer
your enmeshment with Fan Xiao.

237
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,160
Judging from

238
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,680
your unwilling look last night,

239
00:18:28,793 --> 00:18:30,513
Let me go out on a limb and guess...

240
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,239
right now you're feeling that
you want to leave him...

241
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,199
but you can't.

242
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,560
Come in.

243
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,079
President Qin, your coffee.

244
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:53,959
Hold on.

245
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,439
President Qin?

246
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,880
Since someone else is in my office,

247
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,599
why'd you bring only one cup?

248
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:04,839
It's your coffee time,

249
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,759
and I noticed Director You prefers tea.

250
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,160
Then by that logic

251
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,478
you should have brought him tea as well.

252
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:13,198
Also,

253
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:15,438
there are many important documents on my right-hand side.

254
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:16,959
I told you yesterday.

255
00:19:17,273 --> 00:19:20,192
Seeing as how I once spilled coffee there,

256
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:22,359
you should place drinks on my left.

257
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:25,039
You didn't do that today.

258
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,159
I'm sorry, President Qin...

259
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,199
I forgot.

260
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,760
Memory is one of a secretary's
most basic skills they should posses.

261
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,680
I hope you don't forget again,

262
00:19:35,326 --> 00:19:39,007
otherwise I'll have your manager discipline you.

263
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,680
Dismissed.

264
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,079
Yes, President Qin.

265
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,079
Now—where were we?

266
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:51,239
Ah yes,

267
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,560
Fan Xiao.

268
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:54,719
He mocked and insulted me,

269
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,079
and questioned my competence.

270
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:00,680
That I cannot accept.

271
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,880
So

272
00:20:02,199 --> 00:20:04,358
I intend to correct his opinion.

273
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:06,119
It was a heat-of-the-moment jab.

274
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,880
No need to take it to heart.

275
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:10,520
Aren't you going to
ask how I'll correct him?

276
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,800
How?

277
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:16,839
Fan Xiao and I have
no overlap in work or life.

278
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,838
The only way to connect us—is
you, Director You.

279
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:21,959
Meaning?

280
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:25,238
If I “steal” you from his side,

281
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:26,520
you tell me...

282
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:29,280
doesn't that mean I win?

283
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,118
Young President Qin,
life's been too easy for you.

284
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:37,479
You can't handle the slightest slight.

285
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,439
To save face,

286
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,959
you'll even come up
with nonsense like this.

287
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,479
If there's nothing else,

288
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,880
I'll head out.

289
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:53,359
Director You,

290
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,359
I genuinely like you.

291
00:20:59,439 --> 00:21:00,479
Kid...

292
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:03,160
no one's got time to play
house with you.

293
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,000
I hope you can really hear what I'm about to say to you.

294
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
One:

295
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:09,640
I'm gay,

296
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,920
so we match.

297
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:12,119
Two:

298
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,760
you're rigorous;

299
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,920
I admire that.

300
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:15,959
Three:

301
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,560
I'm platonic...

302
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,520
I don't like physical contact.

303
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,719
I won't harass you.

304
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:23,718
All you need to do is cooperate,

305
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:25,358
and the one who called me “Qin Xianglian”

306
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:27,479
will regret it for life—for what he did

307
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,319
and what he said.

308
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,280
Be my boyfriend,

309
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:32,920
and I'll help you leave him.

310
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:36,479
President Qin.

311
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,199
Please listen carefully.

312
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,359
One:

313
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,599
I don't play childish games.

314
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,680
Two:

315
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,760
one lunatic in my life is plenty...

316
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:53,958
I'm not stupid enough to pick up a second.

317
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:55,000
Three:

318
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:59,680
I can give you a suggestion...

319
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:03,624
since you and Fan Xiao don't meet in business
or life,

320
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,599
pursue him directly

321
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,439
and win him over.

322
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,199
Wouldn't that be the most decisive victory?

323
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,599
Hello?
Shulang,

324
00:22:20,561 --> 00:22:21,759
it's Friday.

325
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,599
Do you still have a work dinner tonight?

326
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,958
Why?

327
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:26,078
No reason.

328
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:28,439
You've had a lot of banquets lately.

329
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,640
If you're free, come home early.

330
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:32,399
I'll make soup

331
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,640
and we'll spend the weekend in.

332
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:36,160
Okay.

333
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,839
Sweetened the way you like it.

334
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,680
Well?

335
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:09,359
Good?

336
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,119
President Fan,

337
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,160
your notifications say

338
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,719
people are calling you a scumbag.

339
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:12,399
President Fan, finally—you picked up.

340
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,639
We've all been calling nonstop.

341
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,359
What happened?

342
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,919
Our whole network's been hacked.

343
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,159
As soon as we boot,

344
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,599
the screens...

345
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,719
Show what?

346
00:24:23,618 --> 00:24:25,080
All kinds of insults—at you.

347
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:27,520
What?

348
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,598
President Fan,

349
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:32,160
Better go fix it.

350
00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:35,078
Otherwise that polished
image you built so hard

351
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:36,280
will crumble.

352
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:40,118
I'll leave after we eat.

353
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,239
No need.

354
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,199
I lost my appetite.

355
00:24:58,239 --> 00:25:00,039
Alright, that's it for today.

356
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,198
If you think of any more clues,

357
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:04,439
feel free to contact us anytime.

358
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:07,239
Little third,

359
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,880
who'd you piss off?

360
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:11,439
Aren't you usually cautious outside?

361
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:14,599
I've got it...

362
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,800
it must be Director You.

363
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:18,318
Not to rub salt in,

364
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:19,519
but after what you did to him,

365
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,800
calling you scum is fair.

366
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,238
Oh little third brother.

367
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:25,160
Your second brother

368
00:25:25,161 --> 00:25:26,879
is talking out of turn again.

369
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,159
Anyway,

370
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,040
Don't worry about respect...

371
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:30,920
just tell the police what you know.

372
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,199
This idiot...

373
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:47,239
well, look who it is.

374
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:49,239
Our very own Xianglian.

375
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,919
You may not know Hua history,

376
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,358
but you should know

377
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:55,598
slandering a person entails legal liability.

378
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:56,719
Slander?

379
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,520
You haven't even introduced yourself.

380
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,880
Maybe your name really is Qin Xianglian...

381
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,920
a paragon of faithful love in Hua history.

382
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:07,359
Hardly an insult.

383
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,800
I saw you with the police just now.

384
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,880
Trouble?

385
00:26:13,719 --> 00:26:15,520
Anything I can help with?

386
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,438
ไอ้เลวคน. (“Bad man.”)

387
00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:18,718
What did you say?

388
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:20,958
Your Thai grammar's off.

389
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:24,119
Looks like you used an online translator.

390
00:26:24,719 --> 00:26:26,239
It's not ไอ้เลวคน;

391
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:27,640
it's ไอ้คนเลว.

392
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,639
The first says “man bad”;

393
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,880
the second means “bad man.”

394
00:26:33,439 --> 00:26:35,358
Let me teach you how to write it

395
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:36,999
so you don't

396
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,079
embarrass yourself next time.

397
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,525
ไอ้คนเลว (bastard)

398
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,439
Be grateful

399
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,359
I've got bigger fires to put out...

400
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,319
I don't have time to waste on you.

401
00:26:56,439 --> 00:26:58,359
Don't you dare bug me again.

402
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,559
Xiaoyu, taking Director
You's flowers home again?

403
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,358
Yep. Still fresh.

404
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:27,999
Tomorrow they'll send new ones anyway...

405
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,559
shame to toss these.

406
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,959
He hasn't been here long,

407
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,999
but every day a bouquet of lychee roses...?

408
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,238
Which rich patron is spoiling him?

409
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:37,478
Why does it have to be a “patron”?

410
00:27:37,479 --> 00:27:39,239
Maybe it's a domineering CEO?

411
00:27:40,846 --> 00:27:44,007
Oh right, I heard from HR
that Director You's being

412
00:27:44,031 --> 00:27:45,919
promoted—to Special Assistant
to Young President Qin.

413
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,478
I heard that too.

414
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:49,239
He never had an assistant,

415
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:50,679
and now—out of nowhere… I'm here for it!

416
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,159
Same!

417
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,598
A fussy little princeling
like Young President Qin...

418
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:55,159
does not understand how real people live.

419
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,246
He needs someone steady and strong
like Director You to whip him into shape.

420
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,160
We're not headed the same way.

421
00:28:03,439 --> 00:28:04,319
I'm meeting someone.
Who?

422
00:28:05,199 --> 00:28:06,079
Where?

423
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:07,160
I'll take you.

424
00:28:07,439 --> 00:28:10,559
Do I have to report my every
move to you now, President Fan?

425
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,119
Then I'll wait at home.

426
00:28:12,719 --> 00:28:13,999
If there's a drinking thing tonight,

427
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Shulang...

428
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:16,479
go easy.

429
00:28:21,513 --> 00:28:24,072
Time really is a bastard.

430
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:27,599
We used to be hot stuff.

431
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,319
Now it's 365 days in the lab...

432
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,400
every day the same.

433
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:37,359
Feels like we're drifting
away from the real world.

434
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,478
We're lab rats.

435
00:28:39,479 --> 00:28:41,279
Only our genius You gets to live it up...

436
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,920
wine, dine,
beauties every night.

437
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,958
Please—if anyone's
around him, it's pretty boys.

438
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,679
Right, You?

439
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,039
Every reunion starts
with the same old jokes...

440
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,400
you guys never bored? Come on.

441
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,119
It's just us few in Bangkok.

442
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,118
Of course we recycle the lines.

443
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:02,358
Be honest—have you abused your position

444
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:04,640
to hold hands with pretty boys?

445
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,559
If you're jealous,

446
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,358
I can hold your little hand right now.

447
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:11,680
You bullies—always teasing him.

448
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,838
He's handsome.

449
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,279
If I said the same lines,

450
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,040
would you buy it?
That's true...

451
00:29:16,817 --> 00:29:18,800
I actually have a favor.

452
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:22,359
I'm looking to change jobs.

453
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:26,640
If any of your labs or teams need help,

454
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,640
I can come in at the ground level.

455
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
You...

456
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:31,639
you're quitting being an office director?

457
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,800
You're done?

458
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,680
I can't breathe with all these boys hanging around me.

459
00:29:39,854 --> 00:29:42,268
("Director You, the letter of resignation you gave HR was denied by President Qin.)

460
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:49,199
Or maybe I want to get close with researchers.

461
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,639
A toast...

462
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,680
to begging all you big shots for a chance.

463
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,759
If you want to hold my hand, just say it...

464
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,400
there's no need to dance around.

465
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:10,305
But You...
R&D teams are all about seniority.

466
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,118
If you only do basics,

467
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,880
the pay's peanuts.

468
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,880
(I won't send flowers anymore.
Then you won't have to quit.)

469
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:24,118
I'm not asking for a big salary,

470
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:25,040
just...

471
00:30:25,041 --> 00:30:26,279
Folks...

472
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,358
Come, come.

473
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:29,479
Let me introduce someone.

474
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,039
President Fan—big money,

475
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,319
he invests in pharma projects.

476
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,439
President Fan,

477
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,118
I want to introduce these people,

478
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:40,478
these are my college classmates
and alumni.

479
00:30:40,479 --> 00:30:42,799
For a bunch of reasons,

480
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,800
we all ended up in Bangkok

481
00:30:44,959 --> 00:30:46,399
and stayed close.

482
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,639
Money god!

483
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,958
Please, take the head seat.

484
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:49,839
Come, come.

485
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,040
Sit, sit.

486
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,280
Pleasure to meet you all.

487
00:30:59,439 --> 00:31:00,639
What were you chatting about?

488
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,199
It sounded lively from the hallway.

489
00:31:02,296 --> 00:31:03,082
Huh? Oh yeah.

490
00:31:03,482 --> 00:31:07,359
I stepped out for a minute
and you were about to blow the roof off.

491
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:09,279
We were teasing You...

492
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,000
that You...

493
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,719
saying he wants to hold pretty boys' hands.

494
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,880
If you're not kidding,

495
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:21,559
come to our team.

496
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,239
Pay's low, though.

497
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:24,999
With my background, getting in at all

498
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,760
would be a blessing.

499
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,880
Shulang...

500
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,680
come to my side instead.

501
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:31,640
Kunzi,

502
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:33,719
your project's already in the second half.

503
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,400
If Shulang joins, he won't
have much room to help.

504
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:37,919
I just kicked off a new project.

505
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,279
If he wants in,

506
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,479
he can really be of use.

507
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,159
If I'm competing with you for him,

508
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,400
I'll concede.

509
00:31:44,439 --> 00:31:48,599
Only because it's you.
I'll concede and let him go.

510
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,880
Shulang,

511
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,478
you'll definitely like the new direction.

512
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:53,838
If you're interested,

513
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:56,079
let's find time to talk.

514
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,838
Your compensation
will match your contributions.

515
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:00,839
Great...

516
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,400
let's discuss details another day.

517
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,438
And what's this gentleman's project?

518
00:32:06,439 --> 00:32:08,280
Forgive a businessman for being nosy...

519
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,000
we always want to probe.

520
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,679
These days

521
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,000
plenty of people hang a “research” sign

522
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:17,640
and swindle grant money.

523
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:22,040
Our Director You

524
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:24,920
isn't going just anywhere.

525
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,280
We're off!

526
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,319
Take care.

527
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,358
Bye. Find a partner by next year!

528
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:38,239
See ya.

529
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,736
Bye-bye. You too—don't drag your feet.

530
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,400
You...

531
00:32:40,832 --> 00:32:42,976
Think more about the job thing!

532
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,040
Bye-bye.

533
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,999
You—if you ever want
to hold my hand,

534
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,400
call me!

535
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,239
Bye!

536
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,318
Shulang,

537
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:02,079
If you need a job, come to me.

538
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:03,999
There's no need to bow and scrape to them.

539
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,079
Fan Xiao...

540
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:07,719
stop following me,

541
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,400
or I'll do something you'll regret.

542
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:32,079
Ms. Shi...

543
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,040
Don't move.

544
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:40,280
The one staring holes in your back...

545
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,680
is that your man?

546
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:44,760
The one Lu Zhen said broke you?

547
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,800
Ms. Shi,

548
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,839
what are you doing?

549
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,719
Helping you teach him a lesson.

550
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:54,358
You've lost so much weight.

551
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:55,920
Judging by your face,

552
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,198
he's been bullying you.

553
00:33:58,199 --> 00:33:59,718
I'll piss him off for you...

554
00:33:59,719 --> 00:34:00,920
make him jealous.

555
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,719
Ms. Shi,

556
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:04,119
I'm gay.

557
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,679
And what's between us isn't simple.

558
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,920
So what if you're gay?

559
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,639
Plenty of gay men still scam rich ladies.

560
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,279
As long as he still cares,

561
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,799
any “entanglement” you have with anyone

562
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,320
will torture him the most.

563
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,879
Look...

564
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,560
can't sit still already.

565
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,799
Secret admirer who sends flowers…

566
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,999
a young boss…

567
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,158
doting classmates…

568
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:37,120
and now a glamorous heiress.

569
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,199
Director You,

570
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,959
how many nets are you casting?

571
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,918
Am I the only fool

572
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:45,840
whose been caught out the deepest

573
00:34:45,841 --> 00:34:47,560
and the longest?

574
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,239
You,

575
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:57,560
come with me tonight,

576
00:34:57,879 --> 00:34:58,879
okay?

577
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,719
Okay, let's go.

578
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,520
Shulang,

579
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,718
about what I asked,

580
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:30,719
have you decided?

581
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:32,520
Will you come help me?

582
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,360
Qinghong,

583
00:35:33,439 --> 00:35:34,919
I don't want him targeting you.

584
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,560
Then let's be together.

585
00:35:37,919 --> 00:35:39,439
We'll face that madman side by side.

586
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:41,239
I want to protect you.

587
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,719
It's been years.

588
00:35:52,919 --> 00:35:54,959
Whatever puppy love we had

589
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,679
is long gone.

590
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,080
If I hadn't met Shen Gujiu back then,

591
00:36:01,439 --> 00:36:04,760
we might've been together
already.

592
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:11,280
Shulang...

593
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,280
you haven't come home in four days.

594
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,800
Come on, let's go home.

595
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,719
Fan Xiao, are you done?

596
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,079
When will you let me go?

597
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,080
“Let you go”?

598
00:36:22,081 --> 00:36:23,398
Haven't you figured it out?

599
00:36:23,399 --> 00:36:25,360
We're meant to be together—for life.

600
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,359
Fan Qinghong...

601
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,678
your Shen Gujiu is in the ICU.

602
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:30,759
He's dying.

603
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,719
You're not going to see him one last time?

604
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,520
You Shulang...

605
00:36:36,521 --> 00:36:38,040
ignore me again

606
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:40,000
and your boyfriend will die too.

607
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,360
Fan Xiao...

608
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,479
I can see our ending now.

609
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:48,479
If you don't drive me to my death,

610
00:36:50,399 --> 00:36:52,879
I swear I'll take yours.

611
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:54,719
Fan Xiao,

612
00:36:56,399 --> 00:36:59,199
I believe you now...

613
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,399
death might be the best redemption.

614
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:11,320
When I first heard
Shen Gujiu killed himself,

615
00:37:11,399 --> 00:37:13,159
I was beyond shock.

616
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,800
I thought it was a little cowardly.

617
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,000
Now I know...

618
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,000
when every light goes out,

619
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,678
all that's left is cowardice.

620
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:32,679
Shulang...

621
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,199
Shulang...

622
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,840
Shulang—don't go.

623
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,519
Don't go.

624
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,119
Everything I said before were lies.

625
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,760
Weren't you the one who said...

626
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,360
Weren't you the one who said...

627
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,000
“As long as you live,

628
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,719
someone will show you

629
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,320
this world isn't so bad...

630
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,000
it can be beautiful”?

631
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,398
Fan Xiao,

632
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,879
why rip open the wound again and again?

633
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,800
If we can't look at the sea, then we won't.

634
00:38:01,399 --> 00:38:03,359
We'll go back, shut the
windows, lock the door...

635
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,639
and we won't hear those damned waves.

636
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:07,000
Don't be scared.

637
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,439
I'm here.

638
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,639
I found him.

639
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:13,280
I finally found that person.

640
00:38:13,879 --> 00:38:15,039
I did.

641
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,560
I tried my hardest in this world.

642
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,439
But it was useless.

643
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:13,679
What new stunt is this...

644
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:15,520
self-harm?

645
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,080
Betting I'll soften?

646
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:27,958
All I feel is

647
00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:30,120
that the sound of you banging your head

648
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:34,639
is annoying.

649
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,799
Shulang...

650
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,040
Don't go.

651
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:45,559
Please.

652
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,879
Don't go.

653
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,599
In the crowd

654
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,159
I was spotted in an instant

655
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,678
The desolation in your eyes

656
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:15,839
Hiding the same fire inside

657
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,519
No need for words

658
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,840
No need to ask what's right or wrong

659
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,359
The moment we drew close

660
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,080
The outcome was already destined

661
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:37,760
Is the moth drawn to the light

662
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,120
Or the whale sinking into the deep

663
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:43,238
With nothing but solitary courage

664
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:45,800
I wager it all on tomorrow

665
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,799
The walls of the world

666
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,080
What does it matter if I break them down

667
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:56,519
My chest burns with heat

668
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,719
Screaming only for you

669
00:40:59,879 --> 00:41:02,519
I'll love you until it boils over

670
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,800
Loving without a care for the world

671
00:41:05,439 --> 00:41:06,559
Like two stars

672
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,560
Colliding and shattering in the night sky

673
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,760
Even if it's just for a moment

674
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:11,359
It's more than enough to surpass forever

675
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,638
Hate and love both burn brightly

676
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:15,319
Loving until the sky falls dark

677
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,280
Loving until we reach the end of the road

678
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,079
Before the altar

679
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,198
We burn all the incense

680
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:22,279
Not asking for the next life

681
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,799
Only desiring this moment

682
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,999
Drowning together with you in

683
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,239
This blazing fire of fate
