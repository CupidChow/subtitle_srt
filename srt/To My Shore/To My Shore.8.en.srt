1
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:17,479
A wind that only seems gentle

2
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:22,440
Your gaze shimmers with a dark undertow

3
00:00:23,479 --> 00:00:28,119
Who is laughing at my madness

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,560
yet indulges my startled heart

5
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:38,959
I see through your mask

6
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:44,159
and let you probe my limits

7
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,758
It is I who indulge

8
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,400
Love blazes like fire

9
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,839
spreading

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,879
Hard to say who crossed the line first

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,758
and who is waiting for whom to yield

12
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,598
Sharing rouge-scented smoke

13
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,638
and the flame that collides at our lips

14
00:01:07,639 --> 00:01:10,000
fiercer than any tender lingering

15
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,838
a duel that stakes our pride

16
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:18,080
whether a calamity decreed by fate

17
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:23,319
or sweetness bestowed by heaven

18
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,638
I still choose craving, wrath, and folly's

19
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:30,278
mad notion

20
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:33,400
made real

21
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:40,719
To hold your gaze is far too perilous

22
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,838
I walk devoutly toward my ruin

23
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:54,839
You are my abyss

24
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,918
You are my

25
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:08,479
sunshine

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
"To My Shore"

27
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,199
Authentication failed

28
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,880
Try his birthday.

29
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,960
Young man.
Who are you looking for?

30
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:30,759
The person who lives here.

31
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,520
You Shulang.

32
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:32,638
Xiao You, huh.

33
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,278
He got in pretty late last night,

34
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,038
then went out again
first thing this morning.

35
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,240
You should give him a call.

36
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:42,960
Okay.
Thank you, sir.

37
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:01,960
What's wrong, Xiao?

38
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,320
Feeling low?

39
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,360
Come on...

40
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:06,080
drink with me and let it out.

41
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,000
Bottoms up.

42
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,254
(Director's Office)

43
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:10,279
Shulang,

44
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,639
Shulang,

45
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,199
Shulang!

46
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,320
President Fan.

47
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,399
Looking for Director You?

48
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,800
He's on annual leave.

49
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,720
It's been a while since he's come in.

50
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,160
Okay, okay...

51
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:41,240
stop. One more drink and you'll die here.

52
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
Enough already.

53
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,240
Stop drinking.

54
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:56,639
Oh—it's you again, young man.

55
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:59,199
Been waiting all night for Xiao You?

56
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,199
We had a bit of a fight.

57
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,879
I was hot-headed,

58
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,919
said some harsh things,

59
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,000
I want to apologize in person.

60
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:09,559
I saw him leave with a
suitcase a couple days ago,

61
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,600
I don't think he'll be back that soon.

62
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,759
Why don't I leave you my number?

63
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,559
If he comes back, please call me.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,799
That works.

65
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,799
I know you like the hunt.

66
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,559
Start a new game, then.

67
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,040
Better than drinking your misery away.

68
00:04:28,239 --> 00:04:29,880
Are you even listening?

69
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,320
“Misery?”

70
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,839
When did you go blind?

71
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,320
Right.

72
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,720
I'm blind.

73
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,480
I can dump him,

74
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:44,799
but him leaving me...

75
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,200
no way.

76
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,839
Then stop fixating on just one person.

77
00:04:59,359 --> 00:05:00,600
So what's the plan?

78
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:03,880
If he won't play nice,

79
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,640
I'll coax him back—then dump him hard.

80
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,320
By the way,

81
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,640
we nailed the identity of that hostess.

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,480
She just ran away from the mountains.

83
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:20,720
Her dad had sold her to a
60-something year old rich bumpkin.

84
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,279
What do you plan to do about her?

85
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,972
Give that bumpkin her phone number.

86
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:30,239
That's it?

87
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,239
Not sending her address too?

88
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:34,160
Just scare her.

89
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:36,320
If it really blows up

90
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,600
and You Shulang finds out,

91
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,319
I'll never win him back.

92
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,079
That You guy must've owed you in a past
life and came to repay you in this one.

93
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,358
Fine, fine...

94
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:47,799
have it your way.

95
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:50,559
But if he won't even look at you,

96
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,240
how are you going to coax him?

97
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,399
Owe me?

98
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,000
Why does it feel like he came to save me?

99
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,935
(conversation with You's old man neighbor,
ending with the message that You came back today)

100
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,000
I've got my ways.

101
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Stay out of it.

102
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
Director You,

103
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,240
I've got no way to clear my name.

104
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,279
If that was what I really had done,

105
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,136
why would I have walked you home afterward,

106
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,320
guarding you the whole way?

107
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,519
That's what makes me most uncomfortable.

108
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,839
First someone set me up,

109
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,320
then it was recorded and
replayed over and over.

110
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:39,359
Fan Xiao,

111
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:42,319
I strongly suspect you walked me home

112
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,320
just to savor how pathetic I was.

113
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,320
Once wasn't enough,

114
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,119
you kept rewatching it.

115
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:50,559
The clip came from the dashcam on its own.

116
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:53,119
I rewatched it because I was drawn to you.

117
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,398
You can't condemn me
based on baseless suspicion

118
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,880
and write me off.

119
00:06:57,119 --> 00:06:59,559
Isn't that unfair to me?

120
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,640
Go home.

121
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:09,359
When I figure it out,

122
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,480
I'll come find you.

123
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,079
And if you never figure it out?

124
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,760
I'm asking you...

125
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:15,000
what if you never do?

126
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,920
Fan Xiao, give me some time

127
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,079
to let my emotions settle.

128
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,679
I'll come talk to you.

129
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,119
Drink less and go home.

130
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,919
Fan Xiao, are you out of your mind?

131
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:41,359
Your hand has an old injury.

132
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,160
Let me see your hand.

133
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,961
You don't want me,
so why do you want my hand?

134
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:47,880
Calm down, Fan Xiao.

135
00:07:49,753 --> 00:07:50,753
I can't keep my cool.

136
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,680
Director You thinks he can decide when to
stop our relationship,

137
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,760
so does that mean I can

138
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,119
decide to have you whenever I want?

139
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,838
Your hand is hurt, Fan Xiao.

140
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:00,839
Medicine first,

141
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:02,519
everything else later.

142
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,320
Don't worry...

143
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,240
even with this hand I can make you happy.

144
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,320
Both of us can be in charge once,

145
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,119
call it fair.

146
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,760
Fan Xiao…

147
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,880
Can I trust you?

148
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,760
Are you willing to?

149
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,239
If you're lying to me,

150
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,960
then lie to me forever.

151
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,599
Don't slip up.

152
00:08:46,119 --> 00:08:47,599
Don't let me find out the truth.

153
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:52,320
I may not be much,

154
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,320
but I have my dignity.

155
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,479
If you must lie to me,

156
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,719
then keep lying,

157
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,520
don't let me figure it out.

158
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,919
That's the greatest mercy I can give you.

159
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,280
Can you do that?

160
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,280
I didn't lie to you.

161
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,559
Don't dump me.

162
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,919
I'm not dumping you.

163
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,119
Come back.

164
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,080
You Shulang,

165
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,880
you're so cruel.

166
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:35,400
You tell me to leave
and I leave.

167
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,320
You tell me to come back
and I come back.

168
00:09:38,719 --> 00:09:40,880
Since when do you get to decide everything?

169
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,119
So are you coming back?

170
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,320
I'm back.

171
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,879
I haven't seen you in three days,

172
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,119
I missed you.

173
00:09:57,359 --> 00:09:58,359
You Shulang,

174
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,840
So much of what I've told you is a lie,

175
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,960
but when I said “I love you” it was true.

176
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
I love you.

177
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,080
I love you very much.

178
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,300
(Episode 8)

179
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,159
Drop me here.

180
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:22,639
If colleagues see President
Fan dropping me off,

181
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:23,799
it won't look good.

182
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,400
Okay.

183
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,080
I won't hurt Director You's reputation.

184
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,679
I'll loop around then head to your office.

185
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,400
I've got meetings all day.

186
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,559
It's not great to hang around my office.

187
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,720
I'll keep you company after work.

188
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:39,919
Be good.

189
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,159
Do your thing.

190
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:42,880
I'll be in my own office.

191
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,960
Didn't you say last time

192
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,239
that Director Liu gave me an office?

193
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,199
There's probably cobwebs there by now.

194
00:10:49,719 --> 00:10:51,840
Either way I'm sticking close.

195
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:54,039
Gotta make up for those three days.

196
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,159
Okay.

197
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:01,799
Hold up.

198
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:03,919
What?

199
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,640
Gotta collect some sugar first.

200
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,960
We're on a public street, President Fan.

201
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,960
Today's meeting materials

202
00:11:26,961 --> 00:11:28,760
have been placed in front of each of you,

203
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:31,840
and the digital copies are in your
inboxes.

204
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Director Liu,

205
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:36,976
the closing report and the price list for
that project have already been submitted.

206
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,359
Xiao Ding will handle the tail-end.

207
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,880
Our next meeting time is...

208
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,039
Ah, President Fan.
Sorry

209
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,200
to interrupt the meeting.

210
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,320
While reconciling quotes with Finance,

211
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:54,159
there's one item I didn't understand.

212
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,679
Could I borrow Director
You for two minutes?

213
00:11:57,119 --> 00:11:58,119
At my office.

214
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,880
President Fan, we're still in a meeting...

215
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,520
It's fine, it's fine.

216
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,599
Xiao You,
go ahead.

217
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:05,960
Let Xiao Ding handle the rest.

218
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,960
Yes, Director.

219
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,320
I'll head over.

220
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,640
Xiao Ding,

221
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,015
I've arranged to meet Section Head Wu
from the Drug Administration,

222
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,279
let's go together after the meeting.

223
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:15,919
Got it, Director.
Mm.

224
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
Fan Xiao...

225
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,640
Not even two minutes yet.

226
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
Fan Xiao...

227
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,280
What?

228
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:45,559
I said what I said about
making up for three days.

229
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,376
Who made you stay all morning in the
meeting room without coming out once?

230
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,400
I'm charging interest.

231
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:54,799
You're going out this afternoon too.

232
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,960
Mm.

233
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:57,999
Then I'll advance the
afternoon's portion too.

234
00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:00,599
Tonight...

235
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:02,519
tonight okay?

236
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,640
Advance as much as you want.

237
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,880
Deal.

238
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,080
Tomorrow's the weekend;
I'm taking you somewhere.

239
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:11,840
Where?

240
00:13:11,841 --> 00:13:12,919
Why so secretive?

241
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,239
I've had it ready for a while.

242
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,760
But you ignored me the last few days.

243
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,760
Alright.

244
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:21,880
I'll finish all my work today.

245
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,400
Okay.

246
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,479
You do your work.

247
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,599
I'll keep myself busy.

248
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,400
Last time at the cemetery you mentioned it.

249
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,559
When you're busy you
might not make it back.

250
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,238
When you miss her,

251
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:19,119
you might not know
where to go to pay respects.

252
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,159
So I've been looking for a suitable place.

253
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,840
It's quiet here.

254
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:25,840
You can come anytime.

255
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,039
And if you're swamped, don't worry...

256
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,880
there's year-round caretaking and incense.

257
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:37,599
Fan Xiao.

258
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:40,039
Thank you.

259
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:42,520
It's what I should do.

260
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:46,159
If Auntie hadn't taken you in back then,

261
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:49,400
how could I have such a
living bodhisattva today?

262
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:54,640
Mind your words,
there's a bodhisattva here.

263
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,960
Go on—get back to work.

264
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,159
I'll sit here a while alone.

265
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,840
OK.

266
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,039
Mom.

267
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,559
Did I find the person you told me about?

268
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,880
The one who makes me feel that this world
isn't so bad?

269
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:30,599
Boss.

270
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,718
The bait you set out...

271
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:33,599
Second Young Master has bitten.

272
00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:35,200
Mm.

273
00:15:35,239 --> 00:15:36,479
He's circled long enough.

274
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,080
It's time he took the hook.

275
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,559
Keep me in the loop.

276
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:41,840
Fan Yu is cautious.

277
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:43,559
Stay careful.

278
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:46,679
What about the old man and the eldest?

279
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:47,719
Keep eyes on them.

280
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,520
When it's time to close the net,

281
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,880
the more chips we hold, the better.

282
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,599
But right now...

283
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:04,080
I'm almost reluctant to go
scorched earth with them.

284
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:08,960
Lu.

285
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,840
Have you decided?

286
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,320
Sleep with the lady boss
and you'll get the endorsement.

287
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:15,079
A lot of resources will come in.

288
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,640
Mr. Sha,

289
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,799
you know that...

290
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,320
I'm gay.

291
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:22,760
I can't sleep with a woman.

292
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:25,799
Can't sleep with a woman…

293
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,639
Then why'd you volunteer to come

294
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,520
to tonight's arrangement?

295
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,960
I…

296
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:35,039
I can accept...

297
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:37,238
touching and stuff.

298
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:38,359
“Touching”?

299
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,719
They're putting over a
million into an endorsement...

300
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:53,080
for a couple of touches?

301
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,320
You made of gold?

302
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,599
I'm sorry, Mr. Sha.

303
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,199
I'll accept the company's

304
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,039
punishment—whatever form.

305
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:02,359
I'm sorry.

306
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:12,959
I really can't.

307
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,800
Really can't.

308
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,680
I'm sorry.

309
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:28,199
You still think that sugar-daddy
Fan can act as your shield?

310
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,760
Lu Zhen...

311
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,040
you're a goddamn stray dog now.

312
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:36,079
I've never forced good people to do bad
things,

313
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,599
but this client today,

314
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,319
is someone you agreed to yourself.

315
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,119
Whether you want to or not, you'll do it
anyway.

316
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,640
Got it?

317
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,880
Fan Xiao...

318
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,560
Fan Xiao...

319
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,719
all of this is your fault.

320
00:17:53,719 --> 00:17:55,800
Sha Huaian—fine, I'll do you today.

321
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Come on.

322
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,719
Pup's grown teeth, huh?

323
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,359
Fine.

324
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,160
Tonight you're doing me
whether you like it or not.

325
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,560
Come.

326
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:13,239
How's this?

327
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,760
Oh...

328
00:18:15,479 --> 00:18:17,920
these gym-built muscles
weren't for nothing, right?

329
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,599
You queens...

330
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,199
don't you like this type?

331
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,079
Come here...

332
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,599
come—come...

333
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:28,880
come on!

334
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,239
Mr. Sha...

335
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,359
Mr. Sha, I was wrong.

336
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,760
Right or wrong—finish first.

337
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,319
Oh...

338
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,400
need any “extra service” from me?
Hmm?

339
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:39,959
Come on, Lu...

340
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,880
I'll “serve” you.

341
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:42,760
Come on.
I'm willing to fix this.

342
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,399
I'll pay the penalty, Mr. Sha.

343
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,479
I can goddamn handle the penalty.

344
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:50,199
Mr. Sha...

345
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,598
give me a chance, please.

346
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:52,838
I was wrong, I was wrong.

347
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,238
Weren't you going to do me?

348
00:18:54,239 --> 00:18:54,880
Mr. Sha, I was wrong.
Do it.

349
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,680
I truly know I was wrong.

350
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,719
Mr. Sha...

351
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,078
Mr. Sha, I was wrong.

352
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:01,079
Mr. Sha...

353
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,599
You really know you were wrong?

354
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:06,719
I do.

355
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Fine.

356
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,159
Tomorrow you'll go
apologize to that female client.

357
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,000
Whenever she decides to forgives you

358
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,400
and agrees to renew with us,

359
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:17,919
only then this will be over.

360
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,160
It'll be in the past.

361
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,079
Clear?

362
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,640
Clear.

363
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:24,359
Clear.

364
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,520
Then get the hell out.

365
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,920
Thank you, Mr. Sha.

366
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,839
Thank you.

367
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,520
You still think that sugar-daddy
Fan can act as your shield?

368
00:19:42,827 --> 00:19:43,827
Lu Zhen...

369
00:19:44,412 --> 00:19:47,253
you're a goddamn stray dog now.

370
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:49,959
Lu Zhen...

371
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,200
to me you're no different
from a withered flower...

372
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:55,239
or a dying cicada.

373
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,239
Lu Zhen...

374
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,280
take care of yourself.

375
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,520
Hey, kid...

376
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:07,280
end of the line.

377
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:10,880
I must've missed my stop.

378
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:13,520
Should've gotten off one stop back.

379
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:15,560
Can I ride back with you?

380
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,718
This is the last stop.

381
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:17,719
Can't go back.

382
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:24,880
Can't go back?

383
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,280
Right—can't go back.

384
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,520
Nothing can.

385
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:34,280
Fan Xiao really is a pervert.

386
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:36,399
And I...

387
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,199
I'm no saint either.

388
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,640
Was it vanity...

389
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,959
or the thrill of something new?

390
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,359
In the end, my greed...

391
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:49,119
cost me the good I had with Uncle You.

392
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,680
He's found a new love.

393
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:55,280
And me...

394
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,839
I'm just a flower, a cicada...

395
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:02,400
a ridiculous clown.

396
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:07,199
I really didn't deserve someone as good as
him.

397
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,479
Now that I think about it...

398
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:12,520
when he sat alone smoking on the balcony,

399
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,680
he must've had so much pain.

400
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:18,239
I never tried to understand.

401
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:21,959
I just took his kindness for granted.

402
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,280
And in the end...

403
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:31,800
This is… You Shulang's place.

404
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,319
How did I end up here?

405
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:40,160
Open up.

406
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:43,359
You Shulang...

407
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:44,959
it's me.

408
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,640
Open up, You Shulang.

409
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,319
Open the door.

410
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,680
Open up!

411
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,560
Uncle You...
I…

412
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,479
Fan Xiao—what are you doing here?

413
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:10,680
Fan Xiao...

414
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,159
I think someone's knocking.

415
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,160
Leave it.

416
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,000
Focus.
Fan Xiao...

417
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,680
Maybe a neighbor needs help.

418
00:22:16,719 --> 00:22:17,719
I'll check.

419
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:21,239
Don't move—I'll answer.

420
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,239
Open up.

421
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,119
Uncle You...
I...

422
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:44,640
What are you doing here?

423
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,318
If you've got a problem, come at me.

424
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:54,719
What do you want with You Shulang?

425
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,559
I already returned the gifts you gave me.

426
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,199
And I wrote an IOU for what I owe.

427
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,198
What do you want?

428
00:23:02,199 --> 00:23:03,719
We're already broken up.

429
00:23:04,719 --> 00:23:05,719
Lu Zhen...

430
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,199
How does he know Fan Xiao?

431
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,520
It broke.

432
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,520
Bad luck.

433
00:23:18,972 --> 00:23:20,052
Buddha, give your blessing.

434
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,599
Zhen-zhen,

435
00:23:24,239 --> 00:23:25,479
what brings you here?

436
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,719
Uncle You...

437
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,760
what's going on?

438
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,280
What are you two doing?

439
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:34,079
Why is Fan Xiao in your home?

440
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,160
Yeah— Shulang...

441
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,239
my live model...

442
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,400
why would he knock
on your door at midnight?

443
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,920
You two know each other?

444
00:23:45,479 --> 00:23:46,040
We...
we do.

445
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:50,800
I once hired him as my model, I think…

446
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:53,479
just once.

447
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:55,079
I believe so.

448
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:57,880
That's my impression.

449
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:00,199
I've invited too many models...

450
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,199
it's hard to remember.

451
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,920
Fan Xiao—your back...

452
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,680
You Shulang...

453
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,880
What were you doing just now...

454
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:14,280
sleeping together?

455
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:17,920
Don't tell me...

456
00:24:17,921 --> 00:24:20,521
the one who didn't come out of
your bedroom last time was him too.

457
00:24:22,719 --> 00:24:23,719
Yes.

458
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:25,319
Yes.

459
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,680
You Shulang...

460
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,359
do you know who he is?

461
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:33,280
He's Fan Xiao...

462
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,279
the one who hired me as a model...

463
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,400
called me “Zhen-zhen,”

464
00:24:36,719 --> 00:24:37,759
kept showering me with gifts,

465
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,760
with tenderness...

466
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,560
he's the one who made me dump you
and “cheat” with him!

467
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,400
There was no cheating.

468
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Cheating requires mutual feelings.

469
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:56,680
Between us,

470
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,839
there was none.

471
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,280
Right...

472
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,280
none.

473
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,920
You only pretended—made me think
you loved me.

474
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:11,760
When I burned every bridge for you,

475
00:25:12,199 --> 00:25:14,040
you told me it was all fake.

476
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,920
You played me—fine.

477
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:18,520
I deserved it.

478
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,079
But what are you doing here?

479
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,199
You pervert.

480
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,520
What do you want?

481
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:28,680
I get it now.

482
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,520
Your ex is my current boyfriend.

483
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,400
Right?

484
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,199
Because I once turned you down...

485
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:42,199
and now I'm with the boyfriend you
abandoned,

486
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,560
so you

487
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,280
snapped?

488
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,800
It's not like that...

489
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:51,079
It's not like that...

490
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,958
It's not like that, Uncle You.

491
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:55,319
Don't listen to him.

492
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:56,920
It's my fault.
I was vile.

493
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:59,719
I shouldn't have left you for him.

494
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,239
But he's a pervert...

495
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,159
a master manipulator.

496
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,519
I don't know why he played me...

497
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,520
and now came for you.

498
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:07,520
There must be a connection.

499
00:26:08,239 --> 00:26:09,560
There must be.

500
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:15,959
There must be.

501
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:17,119
Lu Zhen...

502
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,800
calm down.

503
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,680
Come.

504
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,920
Say it slowly.

505
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,880
Don't get worked up.

506
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,079
Zhen-zhen, sit—slow your breathing.

507
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,319
Once you calm down,

508
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,838
we can solve the problem.

509
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:46,280
Don't call me Zhen-zhen.

510
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,199
Lu Zhen—sit.

511
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,400
Eat some chocolate.

512
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,160
Your lips are pale...

513
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,239
it's probably low blood sugar.

514
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,280
Control your emotions.

515
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,839
I don't want you fainting here,

516
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,000
because I no longer have any duty

517
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,160
to care for you.

518
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,040
Fan Xiao...

519
00:27:11,479 --> 00:27:12,680
Lu Zhen's anemic...

520
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,479
he can't take verbal stress.

521
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,118
If your taunts today

522
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,359
make him pass out here,

523
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,879
the responsibility to look after him

524
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,319
falls on you.

525
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,560
After all,

526
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,680
he was the model for your painting.

527
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,760
I'm going to change.

528
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:40,319
You're wrapped up
tight—what are you changing?

529
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:01,920
Lust blinds judgment.

530
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,160
I've lied to myself and others.

531
00:29:07,719 --> 00:29:08,719
Put your clothes on.

532
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,160
I've got a few questions for you two.

533
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:27,760
You can choose not to answer...

534
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:29,880
but if you won't,

535
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,560
please leave my home.

536
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,839
Ask, Uncle You.
“Uncle,” my ass.

537
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:37,079
You're not three.

538
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:38,718
Enough with the “uncle.”

539
00:29:38,719 --> 00:29:39,719
Change what you call me.

540
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:41,119
It's not appropriate.

541
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:42,959
Lu Zhen...

542
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,000
Through what channel did

543
00:29:44,001 --> 00:29:45,520
Fan Xiao find you as a model?

544
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:47,359
Sister Xiaoya called me.

545
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:48,719
I didn't want to go.

546
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:50,079
I had other gigs.

547
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:53,078
She told me to drop them...

548
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:54,318
this one paid a lot...

549
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:55,800
And he asked for you by name?

550
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,560
Yes.

551
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:57,721
He specifically asked for me.

552
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,680
Fan Xiao, did you give Lu Zhen gifts?

553
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,760
I did.

554
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,239
Just to thank him.

555
00:30:04,959 --> 00:30:06,040
Small things...

556
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:07,959
nothing expensive.

557
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:10,920
The crown was from you too?

558
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,400
It was.

559
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:16,040
When I went to their company for the ad
shoot,

560
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,839
I happened to see him get bullied.

561
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,599
We're friends...

562
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,680
I couldn't just stand by and watch.

563
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:24,359
You know how it is...

564
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,079
favors for favors.

565
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,839
I had the host send him the crown.

566
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:32,640
That day Lu Zhen came
to pick up the painting...

567
00:30:33,239 --> 00:30:34,839
you heard his voice from the room...

568
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,319
you didn't recognize it as your friend?

569
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:40,239
I didn't.

570
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:43,959
Lu Zhen...

571
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:47,000
the day you picked up the painting,

572
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:48,959
you got a call.

573
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:51,359
From whom?

574
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:53,079
A call?

575
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:54,239
Yes.

576
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:56,800
When you learned I had a new boyfriend,

577
00:30:57,719 --> 00:30:59,839
I could tell that your feelings were a bit
down,

578
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,680
but after that call,

579
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,040
your mood lifted.

580
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:06,479
So I guessed it was your new lover.

581
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,479
Right.
I remember.

582
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,719
It was Fan Xiao.

583
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,640
I thought he was asking me out,
so I rushed off.

584
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:12,880
This I really don't recall.

585
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,160
Lu Zhen, did I get through then?

586
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:16,880
No...

587
00:31:17,239 --> 00:31:18,560
it ended right away.

588
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:20,078
Then I must've pocket-dialed.

589
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,118
An accident.

590
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:22,400
You're lying, Fan Xiao.

591
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,880
What are you even talking about, “small
gifts,”

592
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,359
“just helping me out”...

593
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,159
I can tell the difference between
kindness and seduction.

594
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,718
Seems you're still at the daydreaming age.

595
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:31,719
Enough.

596
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,839
When was the last time the two of you saw
each other?

597
00:31:37,719 --> 00:31:39,199
Long ago.

598
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,760
Three months at least.

599
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,959
I even turned down work to see him.

600
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,959
He kept saying he was out of town.

601
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,839
Out of town three months ago.

602
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,640
What's Lu Zhen's name in your contacts?

603
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:56,959
“Lu,” in pinyin?

604
00:31:57,719 --> 00:31:59,079
After the airport...

605
00:31:59,479 --> 00:32:00,479
your phone got a call

606
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,040
from “Lu.”

607
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,040
You had me hold it while you answered.

608
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,839
Right in front of me...

609
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,520
picking up my ex-boyfriend's call.

610
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:14,880
Was that exciting for you?

611
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,920
I can show you my phone.

612
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,079
Lu Zhen—call Fan Xiao.

613
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,160
Okay.

614
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:35,199
Shulang...

615
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,959
you still don't trust me.

616
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,880
Not with Xue Baotian...

617
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,199
nor now.

618
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,880
Is it me who's unworthy,

619
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:43,719
or are you addicted to paranoia?

620
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,920
Suffering delusions?

621
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,397
(Hua Model 1)

622
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:53,119
That's...

623
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,959
Do you know what I saved you as?

624
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:32,319
Look closely...

625
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:36,640
“Light.”

626
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,238
Coaxing him back—then dumping him hard...

627
00:33:48,239 --> 00:33:49,280
Fan Xiao...

628
00:33:49,719 --> 00:33:51,599
how will you dump You Shulang hard?

629
00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:54,199
Tell him everything you did...

630
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,800
then say

631
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:57,640
you never liked him.

632
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,880
Of course not.

633
00:34:00,719 --> 00:34:03,319
A man as strong as You Shulang...

634
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,719
if he knows you never loved him,

635
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,320
he'll never spare you a thought.

636
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,360
Only if he repents...

637
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,120
making him feel like he wronged you...

638
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,639
seeing the one he loves suffering
a great pain from his suspicion...

639
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,719
only then will he'll feel it.

640
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:22,399
Only then

641
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,238
will he never forget...

642
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,479
living in guilt.

643
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:30,199
That— is how you dump him hard.

644
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,320
You Shulang...

645
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,959
you know I don't love the light...

646
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,959
but I love you.

647
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,918
I made you, in my life,

648
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:44,879
the light that drives out darkness.

649
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,399
I made you my redeemer...

650
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,919
I worshipped you as a god.

651
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:53,760
But in the end,

652
00:34:55,479 --> 00:34:57,360
you never trusted me.

653
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,159
Perhaps

654
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:06,719
you never loved me either.

655
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:08,719
When I...

656
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:12,239
when I was ready to
make you my one and only,

657
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,600
you kept searching for “proof” that I'd
lied...

658
00:35:16,399 --> 00:35:18,120
so-called evidence...

659
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,919
and kept yourself ready to walk away.

660
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:31,679
I love you,

661
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,199
but I'm tired.

662
00:35:35,479 --> 00:35:38,000
I've had enough of your
cross-examinations,

663
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,520
of being judged like a criminal.

664
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,120
I can kneel at your feet...

665
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:48,280
but not as a sinner.

666
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,360
Let's...

667
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,560
break up.

668
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,159
You won, Fan Xiao.

669
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,320
You beat that fool,

670
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,600
that “bodhisattva,”

671
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:30,399
that “good man” blind to suffering...

672
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:34,320
that liar who peddles hope.

673
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:37,639
Call me back to you, Shulang—quick.

674
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,239
Please call me back to you.

675
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,199
I really want to turn around
and see his expression.

676
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,638
I bet I look awful.

677
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:47,639
Shulang...

678
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,479
I'm sinking.

679
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,159
Save me—please.

680
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:56,320
I beg you.

681
00:36:57,719 --> 00:36:59,320
Cheer up, Fan Xiao.

682
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,560
You should be happy.

683
00:37:04,919 --> 00:37:06,320
I don't want to go.

684
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,520
I don't want to go.

685
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,320
I don't want to leave here.

686
00:37:15,919 --> 00:37:17,399
I don't want to go.

687
00:37:19,879 --> 00:37:22,119
I don't want to leave here.

688
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,120
President Fan...

689
00:37:23,121 --> 00:37:24,959
what a performance.

690
00:37:26,919 --> 00:37:28,017
A bit over the top.

691
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,320
Shulang...

692
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,080
what do you mean?

693
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,479
I mean...

694
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,159
President Fan is a good actor,

695
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:49,360
but not good enough

696
00:37:50,479 --> 00:37:52,600
to move the audience or the jury.

697
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Shulang...

698
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,080
spell it out.

699
00:37:58,479 --> 00:38:00,639
You're not the passive-aggressive type.

700
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,679
I'm really not the type.

701
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,239
So I'll be blunt.

702
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,399
Open your phone—the first message.

703
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:36,759
- You Shulang.
- What about You Shulang?

704
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,919
Say it.

705
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,280
Why are you being so cryptic?

706
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,000
Don't tell me—you pulled it off?

707
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:43,239
Dumped him?

708
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,840
How'd you do it?

709
00:38:44,879 --> 00:38:47,120
Did you get that “dump him hard” effect?

710
00:38:47,479 --> 00:38:48,799
So how's that You guy taking it?

711
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,800
Losing his mind?

712
00:38:51,399 --> 00:38:53,719
I'd love to see what that looks like.

713
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,320
You know...

714
00:38:54,321 --> 00:38:56,999
couldn't you dump him in front of me?

715
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,519
What reason did you use?

716
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,198
By the way, I think...

717
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:02,398
that Xue Baotian should get knocked
around a bit.

718
00:39:02,399 --> 00:39:03,478
I'm afraid he'll spill.

719
00:39:03,479 --> 00:39:04,320
Hey, say something!

720
00:39:04,321 --> 00:39:05,398
Why appear and then vanish?

721
00:39:05,399 --> 00:39:07,638
You're getting more and more
twisted, Young Master Fan.

722
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:09,158
You'll take someone who you
disgust all the way to the bedroom,

723
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:10,238
have your fun, then dump them.

724
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:11,319
Twisted to the core.

725
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,159
Twisted to the moon.

726
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,239
Twisted to the bone.

727
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,119
Learned something new today.

728
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,120
It was fun, right?

729
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:17,159
Come out and play.

730
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:18,399
I'll throw you a party.

731
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,360
Hello? At least explain.

732
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,879
Mr. Shi is more honest than you.

733
00:39:32,919 --> 00:39:33,919
Sorry...

734
00:39:34,959 --> 00:39:36,360
I peeked at your phone.

735
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,719
You gave me the passcode.

736
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,280
Back at the airport...

737
00:39:43,919 --> 00:39:45,319
dragging a suitcase to made it
“inconvenient”

738
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,040
to answer Lu Zhen's call.

739
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:50,360
In hindsight,

740
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,719
it wasn't inconvenient...

741
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:57,399
you wanted me to answer

742
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,839
and to hold it to your ear...

743
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,520
it was more exciting that way, right?

744
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,280
Right in front of me...

745
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:06,280
you asked my ex to dinner,

746
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:09,120
played the both of us,

747
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,478
satisfying that unique perversion.

748
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:14,479
No...

749
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,280
I can explain.

750
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:18,719
Explain.

751
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,520
I'm listening.

752
00:40:20,773 --> 00:40:21,894
Shi Lihua...

753
00:40:22,432 --> 00:40:24,033
is just talking nonsense.

754
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:25,639
He...

755
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,040
So you had Xue Baotian set me up,

756
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,000
deliberately lured Lu Zhen...

757
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:32,479
made us break up...

758
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:37,840
never having a shred of sincerity...

759
00:40:38,919 --> 00:40:40,119
and then dumped me hard

760
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,478
to end your game?

761
00:40:41,479 --> 00:40:43,360
All “nonsense,” huh?

762
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,479
Stay silent and I'll take it as yes.

763
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,199
Fan Xiao...

764
00:40:55,959 --> 00:40:58,639
what did I ever do to wrong you

765
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:02,320
so as to have earned this hatred?

766
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,679
I believe...

767
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,320
I never did anything to hurt you.

768
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,239
I put you first in everything,

769
00:41:16,959 --> 00:41:18,600
thought of you in all things.

770
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,080
So why?!

771
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:25,600
Why do you hate me this much?

772
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,120
I don't hate you.

773
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:31,520
I don't.

774
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:35,679
Oh—right.

775
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:41,159
The word Mr. Shi used was...

776
00:41:42,479 --> 00:41:43,520
disgust.

777
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,040
Disgust.

778
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,360
Fan Xiao...

779
00:41:52,399 --> 00:41:54,080
look how stupid I am...

780
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:58,320
I thought you loved me all this time.

781
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:04,600
I take it back:

782
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:08,879
President Fan is indeed a terrific actor...

783
00:42:09,879 --> 00:42:11,760
so damned good.

784
00:42:12,879 --> 00:42:14,360
You can act true love

785
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,320
for someone you despise.

786
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:19,360
I didn't lie.

787
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,520
My love for you is real.

788
00:42:24,399 --> 00:42:25,600
I didn't lie to you.

789
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:28,320
I didn't—believe me.

790
00:42:37,959 --> 00:42:39,040
“Love me.”

791
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,679
That's

792
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,639
the funniest joke I've ever heard.

793
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,120
Fan Xiao...

794
00:42:58,199 --> 00:43:03,120
Still haven't had enough of playing
with me?

795
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:09,280
You want to trick me back into your bed
and dump me again?

796
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:12,000
To do it again once you've had your fun?

797
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,520
I'll treat this past year

798
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:25,600
as a horrible nightmare.

799
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:32,079
Do me a favor—never appear

800
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,560
in my life again.

801
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,080
Never.

802
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:40,639
Shulang...

803
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,280
I didn't...

804
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,520
Go!

805
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,999
In the crowd

806
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,560
I was spotted in an instant

807
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:34,079
The desolation in your eyes

808
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,238
Hiding the same fire inside

809
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:39,918
No need for words

810
00:44:39,919 --> 00:44:43,239
No need to ask what's right or wrong

811
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,759
The moment we drew close

812
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,479
The outcome was already destined

813
00:44:56,639 --> 00:44:59,159
Is the moth drawn to the light

814
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,520
Or the whale sinking into the deep

815
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,638
With nothing but solitary courage

816
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:07,199
I wager it all on tomorrow

817
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:11,198
The walls of the world

818
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:14,479
What does it matter if I break them down

819
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:17,918
My chest burns with heat

820
00:45:17,919 --> 00:45:20,120
Screaming only for you

821
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,918
I'll love you until it boils over

822
00:45:23,919 --> 00:45:26,199
Loving without a care for the world

823
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,958
Like two stars

824
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:29,959
Colliding and shattering in the night sky

825
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:31,159
Even if it's just for a moment

826
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,759
It's more than enough to surpass forever

827
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,039
Hate and love both burn brightly

828
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,718
Loving until the sky falls dark

829
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:38,679
Loving until we reach the end of the road

830
00:45:39,439 --> 00:45:40,478
Before the altar

831
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:42,599
We burn all the incense

832
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,678
Not asking for the next life

833
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:45,198
Only desiring this moment

834
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:46,398
Drowning together with you in

835
00:45:46,399 --> 00:45:48,639
This blazing fire of fate
