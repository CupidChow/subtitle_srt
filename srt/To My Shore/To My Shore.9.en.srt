1
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:17,479
A wind that only seems gentle.

2
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:22,440
Your gaze shimmers with a dark undertow.

3
00:00:23,479 --> 00:00:28,119
Who is laughing at my madness

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,560
yet indulges my startled heart.

5
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:38,959
I see through your mask

6
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:44,159
and let you probe my limits.

7
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,758
It is I who indulge.

8
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,400
Love blazes like fire

9
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,839
spreading.

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,879
Hard to say who crossed the line first

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,758
and who is waiting for whom to yield.

12
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,598
Sharing rouge-scented smoke

13
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,638
and the flame that collides at our lips

14
00:01:07,639 --> 00:01:10,000
fiercer than any tender lingering

15
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,838
a duel that stakes our pride

16
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:18,080
whether a calamity decreed by fate

17
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:23,319
or sweetness bestowed by heaven

18
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,638
I still choose craving, wrath, and folly's

19
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:30,278
mad notion

20
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:33,400
made real.

21
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:40,719
To hold your gaze is far too perilous

22
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,838
I walk devoutly toward my ruin.

23
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:54,839
You are my abyss.

24
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,918
You are my

25
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:08,479
sunshine.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
"To My Shore"

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,119
Rarely does a gift affect
me right to my core.

28
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:27,719
I've got a meeting in half an hour,

29
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,720
so I can give you ten minutes before that.

30
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,160
I brought Lu Zhen to
apologize to you, Ms. Shi.

31
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:34,919
Apologize for what?

32
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:38,160
Men and women—love is about chemistry.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,279
If Little Lu isn't into me,

34
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,279
I can't force it.

35
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,720
Honestly,

36
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:46,879
at my age,

37
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,838
if I try hard enough I could
probably give birth to him.

38
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:49,839
Lu Zhen,

39
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,759
What are you waiting
for? Apologize to Ms. Shi.

40
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:53,799
Ms. Shi, I'm sorry.

41
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
I was wrong.

42
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,399
I have let you down egregiously.

43
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,639
I didn't know better.

44
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,999
I didn't understand the situation,

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,520
I...
Lu Zhen,

46
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,440
If you're apologizing, show some sincerity.

47
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:04,880
Is Ms. Shi's time just for
you to waste by rambling?

48
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,919
Ms. Shi, I was wrong.

49
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,856
I accepted the date without
understanding the situation.

50
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,240
Please forgive me.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,558
Why does everyone make
me out to be the villain?

52
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:23,758
If I were you that day,

53
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,959
I wouldn't have let Lu Zhen

54
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,600
walk out of that club in one piece.

55
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,895
And I wouldn't have
waited around all day today,

56
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,880
carving time out of a
packed schedule to see him.

57
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:34,039
So “villain” doesn't suit you at all.

58
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:39,559
Lu Zhen,

59
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,919
Who told you to get up?

60
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,720
What...

61
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,639
did they assign Little Lu a new agent?

62
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,360
Ms. Shi,

63
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,278
I'm Lu Zhen's ex...

64
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:54,279
You Shulang.

65
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,639
Ex what?

66
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:57,399
Boyfriend?

67
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,359
So the agency recommended a gay guy to me?

68
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,360
Please don't be upset

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,375
it has nothing to do with the company;

70
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:06,639
this was all Lu Zhen's fault.

71
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,399
He wanted the endorsement

72
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,039
and wanted to build connections,

73
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,800
but he didn't communicate
clearly with the agency.

74
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,080
He accepted your request while in a daze,

75
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,800
but he knew he shouldn't pretend
to be straight and deceive anyone.

76
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,880
He chickened out that night.

77
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,239
The company was furious...

78
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:23,119
and wanted to teach him a lesson.

79
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:27,160
That wound on your
forehead—someone hit you?

80
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,920
I had it coming.

81
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,359
At least you've got a conscience.

82
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:37,599
Better than the ones who pop pills and still
pretend to be straight to get the job done.

83
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,839
So, Little Lu was your…

84
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:42,799
ex-boyfriend?

85
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:43,959
Yes.

86
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,959
And you still step up
when your ex is in trouble?

87
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,760
This is the last time I'm doing this.

88
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,799
I'm paying him back for what we had,

89
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:55,239
and after today,

90
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:58,279
I'm done.

91
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,480
Why did you break up?

92
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,640
He's such a good boyfriend.

93
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:43,119
Guess you weren't satisfied.

94
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,079
Some men

95
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,559
can't share hardship;

96
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,519
some can't share riches.

97
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,760
If I'd met a decent man,

98
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,080
I wouldn't be booking pretty little boys
every night to pass the time.

99
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,720
Lu Zhen is young.

100
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,200
He idealizes everything...

101
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,479
love, work.

102
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,720
He stumbled this time,

103
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,800
and I hope that he'll
definitely learn from it.

104
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:08,119
So.

105
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:10,600
Please, do us this kindness

106
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,399
and forgive him.

107
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,720
Not many men will lower
themselves for an ex.

108
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:22,720
I'll accept this favor from you,
Mr. You.

109
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:27,399
I won't replace the spokesperson.

110
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:29,359
Lu Zhen...

111
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,319
I liked you

112
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,679
because you reminded me
a bit of my ex-husband when he was young.

113
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,200
Just don't become as black-hearted
as he turned out to be.

114
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,640
I'm sorry—really sorry.

115
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:58,000
What a pity, Mr. You.

116
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,239
If you liked women,

117
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,200
no matter the cost,

118
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,200
I'd make you mine.

119
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,480
You're kind

120
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,720
and beautiful,

121
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,159
You'll meet the right person.

122
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,239
The right person…

123
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:24,760
have you met yours?

124
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,920
Before that night,

125
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:30,160
I thought I had.

126
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,500
(Episode 9)

127
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:36,839
Sawadee ka.

128
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:40,880
This way, please.

129
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,839
There you are, Director You.

130
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,399
Second Young Master,

131
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,680
Sorry to keep you waiting,

132
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,279
Not at all...

133
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,160
you're ten minutes early.

134
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:57,600
Refined taste...

135
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,238
finding a traditional
troupe like this in Bangkok.

136
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:01,559
Just putting on airs.

137
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,519
I'm learning from our third brother...

138
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,279
sampling the sights, cuisine,
and beauties of Hua culture.

139
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:14,399
Let's be direct.

140
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,520
What did you want to see me about?

141
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:19,519
I heard

142
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,200
you and Fan Xiao broke up.

143
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:22,679
Is it true?

144
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:24,719
It seems like you have something to say.

145
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,880
If we're going to talk in circles,

146
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:29,399
we might as well enjoy the show.

147
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,200
Fine...

148
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:32,400
Then I'll lay it all out on the line.

149
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,280
After what he did to you,

150
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,000
you really don't want revenge?

151
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,760
What's funny?

152
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,799
So Second Young Master
has sounded the war drums...

153
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,640
and wants a blade to wield.

154
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,359
We each get what we need.

155
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,479
Don't say I'm using you as a blade.

156
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,320
And in your view,

157
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,000
how should I take revenge?

158
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:00,319
There are a million ways.

159
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,319
I've found you the
simplest, quickest path...

160
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,359
to vent your anger

161
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,880
and make some money.

162
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,039
To vent my anger? How?

163
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,960
I'd love to know.

164
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,719
Don't you want to hear
how you profit first?

165
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:20,520
I heard you've been selling
your apartment to repay Fan Xiao.

166
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,118
No need.

167
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:23,119
Help me with one thing...

168
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,960
Help me with one thing...

169
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,000
and everything on this cheque is yours.

170
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:29,160
All the money in this
cheque is yours.

171
00:09:29,184 --> 00:09:30,839
It's more than enough to cover
your brother's debt

172
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,840
and then some.

173
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,080
You get your anger out and walk
away with cash—best of both worlds.

174
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:40,799
That much?

175
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,840
What do you need me to do?

176
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,080
Nothing hard.

177
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:50,038
Just slip this drive

178
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:53,000
into Fan Xiao's work laptop—quietly.

179
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:55,359
And that's all.

180
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:56,719
And then?

181
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,599
Then we wait.

182
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,560
He's doing something illegal?

183
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,679
Director You,

184
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:08,280
If he ends up in handcuffs,

185
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,840
won't that make you feel better?

186
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,799
I watched him build the tower high;

187
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,039
I watched him feed his guests;

188
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,577
I watched the tower collapse.

189
00:10:40,602 --> 00:10:43,562
[TN: Quote from the classic play "The
Peach Blossom Fan" by Kong Shangren]

190
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:46,799
Second Young Master,

191
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:50,400
there's nothing left between us.

192
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:53,239
Settle your family feud yourselves.

193
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,799
Thank you for the tea...

194
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
but

195
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,320
it's gone cold.

196
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:08,559
Director You,

197
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,359
Director You, wait. Sit.

198
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:15,559
I never took you
for a man who stands idle when insulted.

199
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,799
I've got a recording of Fan Xiao...

200
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,520
don't you want to hear

201
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,559
how he talked about you with others?

202
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,159
You wiretapped him?

203
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,678
Our third brother is
too careful and sharp...

204
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:31,880
I can't wiretap him.

205
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:33,959
I bought the audio from the Shi family...

206
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,399
It seems like they have someone on call.

207
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,560
I thought it was interesting,

208
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,039
so I bought the audio they
recorded while spying on him.

209
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,079
I didn't expect what I heard.

210
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,239
Even I thought he went too far.

211
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,080
Director You,

212
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:48,559
Wanna hear?

213
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:51,039
No need.

214
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,080
Not interested.

215
00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:00,280
When life gets boring,
I used him to kill time.

216
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,200
When I've had my fill, I get rid of him.

217
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:05,919
Since he's being ungrateful,

218
00:12:06,598 --> 00:12:07,598
then I'll coax him back,

219
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,719
then dump him hard.

220
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,239
Director You,

221
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,479
You can accept that?

222
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,119
I wouldn't be able to at all.

223
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:15,520
As far as I know,

224
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:17,559
Fan Xiao still has a thing for you.

225
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:19,400
Why don't you pretend
to make up with him...

226
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,000
earn his trust...

227
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,520
and then

228
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,280
slip this drive

229
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,719
into his laptop?

230
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:28,558
Then it'll be mission accomplished.

231
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:29,880
You'll make money

232
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,039
and vent your anger.

233
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,679
Why not?

234
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,679
Second Young Master,

235
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:37,520
If you like the recording,

236
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,880
keep it.

237
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,640
You're brothers...

238
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,799
special hobbies aren't surprising.

239
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,159
I'm going after that pervert.

240
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,719
Have fun.

241
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:15,759
For now, it looks pretty good.

242
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,919
You wait, You Shulang

243
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
I love you.

244
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:20,918
I mean it, You Shulang.

245
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:24,039
When life gets boring,
I used him to kill time.

246
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,960
When I've had my fill, I get rid of him.

247
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,200
Since he's being ungrateful,

248
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,200
then I'll coax him back,

249
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:33,000
then dump him hard.

250
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,760
What's the matter?

251
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,080
Bai Ting,

252
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:19,119
I need a favor...

253
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,880
get someone drunk for me.

254
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,759
How come I've never seen you...

255
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,639
Are you new here?

256
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,959
New?

257
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,520
I'm just not enough for you to see me.

258
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:32,879
I'm hurt.

259
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,280
Isn't Bai Ting the sweet-and-pure type?

260
00:14:35,359 --> 00:14:36,719
Look at her outfit.

261
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,559
Those lashes on her
lids could rake my face.

262
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:42,256
She wants to latch onto Third Young Master.

263
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,760
Everyone knows

264
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:47,400
he likes 'em curvy and bold.

265
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,679
How can my sweetie stop feeling wronged?

266
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,520
Want me to buy you a bag?

267
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,520
How could I make you
spend money, Young Master.

268
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:57,799
How about

269
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:00,280
three penalty shots instead?

270
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,079
Fine, fine.

271
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,840
Tonight

272
00:15:03,841 --> 00:15:05,760
I'll drink with you till you're happy.

273
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:09,880
But before we drink, let me have a kiss...

274
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,960
What the—who are you?

275
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:16,679
It's you.

276
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,400
You're...

277
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:19,400
It's me.

278
00:15:19,401 --> 00:15:20,640
Don't remember?

279
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:24,960
Didn't you try to kiss me like that once?

280
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:26,640
So…

281
00:15:26,641 --> 00:15:30,520
Third Young Master swings both ways?

282
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:32,400
The hell I am!

283
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:34,079
Don't try that extortion crap.

284
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,320
I didn't so much as put a finger on you.

285
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,840
Young Master,

286
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,840
How could you be so heartless?

287
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:43,679
I came today

288
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:46,840
to relive old times with you.

289
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:50,159
Get lost.

290
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,840
I don't do men.

291
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,399
The hypocrite who ruined you
was Fan Xiao.

292
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,519
You want nostalgia?

293
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,679
Go find him.

294
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,280
What,

295
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,039
you get addicted to being molested?

296
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,520
You're sick.

297
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,599
I just pitied you.

298
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:09,400
Didn't you used to think
he was a “good guy”?

299
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,839
Young Master, you're scaring me.

300
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,279
Come on—let's keep drinking.

301
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,039
Party on. Don't mind him.

302
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,558
Freak.

303
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:21,000
Come on—don't mind him.

304
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:21,599
Let's drink.

305
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:22,719
Mm.

306
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Bai Ting...

307
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,640
let's go.

308
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:29,718
The hell is your problem?

309
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:30,520
Young Master,

310
00:16:30,521 --> 00:16:32,080
It's fine—really.

311
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,799
You go. It's fine.

312
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,880
Come on, keep drinking.

313
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:54,039
Come on—cheers.

314
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,159
Come on...

315
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,560
I envy you—you found your soulmate.

316
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,599
“Soulmate”?

317
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,000
Bit much, isn't it?

318
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,520
What do you want...

319
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,800
to sleep with me?

320
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,560
You just want to fool around...

321
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,920
you're just itching for something new.

322
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,119
You Shulang,

323
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,280
I love you.

324
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,119
I'm serious.

325
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,640
My future—everywhere I look, I see you.

326
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,760
I don't think

327
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:40,479
I ever did anything to hurt you.

328
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,079
I put you first in everything.

329
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,560
I thought of you in all things.

330
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,159
So why...

331
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,119
why do you hate me so much?

332
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:18,719
Fan Xiao:

333
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,598
If you're going to lie
to me—then lie forever.

334
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:23,599
I'm not lying.

335
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:27,000
Don't reject me.

336
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,520
Hello?

337
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:52,599
Lu Zhen:

338
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,400
Let's meet tomorrow afternoon.

339
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,400
Bring the painting Fan Xiao gave you.

340
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,280
You didn't come out
before when I called you.

341
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:16,559
Ever since you dumped that You guy,

342
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,959
I can finally ask you to come out.

343
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,040
You should've dumped that You guy earlier.

344
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:24,520
Let's go.

345
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,880
Get in my car and let my
assistant drive us back.

346
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,839
No, thanks.

347
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
I'll call a chauffeur.

348
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,479
You're as stubborn as a mule.

349
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:36,718
Drive safely.

350
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:39,280
Okay, okay, let's go.

351
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,400
Let's go.

352
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:52,599
Fan Xiao.

353
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,040
Shulang.

354
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:11,839
Shulang.

355
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:14,520
In didn't expect you'd come to see me.

356
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:24,280
I went to see Bai Pengyu.

357
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,040
How'd you find him?

358
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,280
He haunts these bars too.

359
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,520
Do you remember what you said that day?

360
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,959
The day after I was assaulted,

361
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,520
you sat in the car and told me,

362
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,680
This one must be paid back.

363
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,680
Today I used the gloves you bought me.

364
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,400
Guess that makes your word good.

365
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:05,239
I also prepared a pair of
lambskin tactical gloves.

366
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,479
I know you're happy with my hands.

367
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,680
How about tonight?

368
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,400
Fan Xiao.

369
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,640
Can I trust you?

370
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:35,400
Even though I'm no one special,

371
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,599
I have my dignity.

372
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,959
You're going to lie to me?

373
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:45,479
Then lie forever.

374
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,959
Don't let me find out.

375
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:52,640
This is the greatest mercy I can give you.

376
00:21:56,479 --> 00:21:57,479
Fan Xiao.

377
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:59,199
You're my high-stakes gamble.

378
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:01,800
Can I win?

379
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:06,640
Looks like there are
no winners in this game.

380
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,800
Only losers,

381
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,400
and those who lose worse.

382
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,079
I can't run anymore.

383
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,280
Mom...

384
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:21,959
I can't run anymore.

385
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:23,359
Mom...

386
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:24,959
Mom...

387
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:25,760
Fan Xiao.

388
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,079
Fan Xiao.

389
00:22:27,199 --> 00:22:28,199
It's just a dream.

390
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,319
It's not real.

391
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:30,479
I'm here.

392
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,880
I'm here.

393
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,520
Fan Xiao:

394
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,800
I'm here.

395
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,959
It's really over between
me and You Shulang.

396
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,520
Shulang.

397
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,559
What will it take for you
to let it all out?

398
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,560
Fan Xiao.

399
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,560
You're nothing special.

400
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:58,359
Back then I beat Bai
Pengyu for ten minutes.

401
00:22:58,479 --> 00:23:01,400
And I'd do the same to you.

402
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:20,400
Something's changed. You always pulled your punches.

403
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,800
Now every hit lands.

404
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,199
That means you're not doing the same to me.

405
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,800
You want special treatment?

406
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,239
Then I'll oblige.

407
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:44,479
Fan Xiao.

408
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:47,079
That painting you gave Lu Zhen...

409
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,640
it seems like you left me a line of text on it.

410
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,319
A bodhisattva never falls into sin;

411
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:56,839
If he won't fall,

412
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,040
drag him down.

413
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:02,839
Here,

414
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:05,640
translate it...

415
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,760
in Thai.

416
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,959
You're my bodhisattva

417
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:16,318
and my god.

418
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,319
Fan Xiao.

419
00:24:17,766 --> 00:24:19,485
Now I really can't imagine

420
00:24:20,199 --> 00:24:22,318
what all the Thai you
whispered in my ears everyday meant.

421
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:23,800
What did they mean?

422
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:26,079
Fan Xiao.

423
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,079
You're in hell and still want to drag me
down there with you, huh?

424
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,760
Is that so?

425
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:40,119
Where'd this loser come from...

426
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:42,760
daring to lay hands on my brother.

427
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:48,359
Get out!

428
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:53,478
I'm really minding other people's business.

429
00:24:53,479 --> 00:24:54,479
Fan Xiao.

430
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:58,239
If I ever interfere in your life again

431
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,479
I'll eat my hat.

432
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,199
Thanks for that just now.

433
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:35,880
Now I'll take a minute off.

434
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:07,839
Fan Xiao.

435
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,160
One last time, I'll ask you...

436
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,160
why did you treat me this way?

437
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,920
It's all my fault.

438
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:30,000
Here's the money my brother owes you.

439
00:26:31,199 --> 00:26:33,280
The PIN is written on the card.

440
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,560
Fan Xiao.

441
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:41,280
Do you believe there's a god in this world?

442
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:49,799
I've always thought the
pendant on your chest

443
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,239
looked ominous.

444
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,880
Now that I'm really looking at it,

445
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:56,119
it turns out that it looks like you.

446
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,280
But it was originally
meant to guard the house.

447
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,680
And you...

448
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,520
should belong in hell.

449
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,520
I know I'll go to hell.

450
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:33,040
But I don't want to go now.

451
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,160
Because there's no you in hell.

452
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:41,160
You Shulang:

453
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,160
I'll be in hell,

454
00:27:46,199 --> 00:27:47,719
but I won't find you there.

455
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,560
My god.

456
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,880
I don't want to go down.

457
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:00,359
Is it too late now?

458
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,959
Xiao.

459
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,599
Come to mom.

460
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,640
Mom.

461
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,680
Mom.

462
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,160
Don't be afraid, baby.

463
00:28:51,239 --> 00:28:52,680
I'm here with you.

464
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,520
Mom.

465
00:28:58,199 --> 00:28:59,199
Mom.

466
00:28:59,280 --> 00:28:59,760
Fan Xiao.

467
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,199
Dear, don't be scared.

468
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:02,479
Come to mom.

469
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,719
Mom, where are you?

470
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,400
I only have one match left.

471
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,880
I...

472
00:29:13,047 --> 00:29:17,687
If I light it, will I see you?

473
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,680
Mom.

474
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,560
You told me to live,

475
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:29,160
But you didn't tell me
who I should live for.

476
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,920
Fan Xiao's Mother?

477
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:43,880
Let's go.
We can't wait anymore.

478
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:46,719
We can't wait—hurry up and drive.

479
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,520
Mom.

480
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,520
I miss you so much.

481
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:55,880
I want to come find you.

482
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:58,319
What happened?

483
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,560
Has our Xiao been wronged?

484
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,760
Mom.

485
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,160
Mom.

486
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,760
Mom.

487
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,199
Dad is so scary.

488
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,479
Brother and the others
don't like me either.

489
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:14,119
Yes, the people who
deserve to die are still alive.

490
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,560
How can I die?

491
00:30:17,479 --> 00:30:19,239
I have nothing.

492
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,239
Then no one gets to be happy.

493
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,280
You won't have nothing.

494
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,680
You still have me.

495
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,920
You Shulang:

496
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,839
I'm here—it's okay.

497
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:43,520
You Shulang.

498
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:47,760
You Shulang.

499
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,880
Fan Xiao.

500
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:53,760
From now on,

501
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:56,000
Don't show up in my life again.

502
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,400
And don't let me see you again.

503
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,040
You Shulang.

504
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:01,760
Come back.

505
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:03,119
You Shulang.

506
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,160
Come back here.

507
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,840
You really don't care about me anymore?

508
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,359
You said you loved me.

509
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:15,560
You told me not to care about any of it.

510
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:18,400
You said you'd protect me.

511
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,318
Why don't your words count?

512
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:21,231
You say you love me, then love me.

513
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:23,400
If you say you don't love me, then don't.

514
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:26,359
Are you not a bodhisattva?

515
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,079
Where is your compassion?

516
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:30,680
Didn't you come to save me?

517
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,280
Why are you abandoning me?

518
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,639
You Shulang.

519
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,199
Who gave you permission to leave me?

520
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,199
Did they all leave?

521
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:56,760
You all left?

522
00:31:57,719 --> 00:31:59,479
No one wants me?

523
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,199
I can finally die as I wished.

524
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,119
Huang Qimin.

525
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,160
Hello?

526
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:32,479
Mr. Huang.

527
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,479
The equipment on the left will arrive soon.

528
00:32:43,855 --> 00:32:44,855
Come on, come on.

529
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,719
Send it over.
Hurry up.

530
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:48,119
What are you doing?

531
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,119
Can you do it?

532
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,599
You Shulang.

533
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:55,055
What's Director You doing now?

534
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:56,119
Don't worry about the game.

535
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,280
Looks like staying in the
dorm won't work long-term.

536
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:03,839
Better move out soon.

537
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,160
Mr. Huang...?

538
00:33:14,479 --> 00:33:15,479
Hello, Mr. Huang.

539
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,520
You're in Thailand now?

540
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,358
You little rascal.

541
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:23,920
You love teasing me.

542
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,880
Back in school, you were the
one leading the “Boss Huang” chant.

543
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,160
Now that you've graduated,

544
00:33:29,239 --> 00:33:31,280
no one will call me
“Professor Huang” anymore.

545
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,760
Here,

546
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:35,760
Got the best Tieguanyin from
the factory manager's office.

547
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,920
To make it up to you.

548
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,599
Try it.

549
00:33:39,199 --> 00:33:40,119
Joking aside,

550
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,119
you're still the thoughtful one.

551
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,760
You remember I like tea, huh?

552
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:48,199
You said you needed me
for something on the phone.

553
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:53,000
While I'm in Thailand,
this R&D team wants to invite you to join.

554
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,078
To invite me to join the R&D team?

555
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:56,079
Yeah.

556
00:33:56,719 --> 00:33:59,479
Did you read the materials I sent you?

557
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,519
You mean the honeysuckle drink, right?

558
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,599
Yes, that project.

559
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,319
Once we can optimize the process,

560
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,320
it'll be quick to produce and launch.

561
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,280
No other pharmaceutical companies involved?

562
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,360
There's some support.

563
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:16,639
But the focus is on
developing the Changling brand.

564
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:19,399
Once we get this project up and running,

565
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:23,919
we'll be able to roll out other projects one by one.

566
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,959
For all of these popular products in Thailand,

567
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,799
we'll can use the Changling brand

568
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,479
and bring them to market.

569
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,879
The investors say,

570
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:35,679
as long as marketing is done right,

571
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,879
we can easily make the brand a success.

572
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,000
The investors?

573
00:34:40,001 --> 00:34:41,639
There's already funding?

574
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,639
Yeah.

575
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,800
Where else would we get the money?

576
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,799
And besides, we only know R&D.

577
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,360
We're not in sales.

578
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:50,479
Hmm.
Shulang.

579
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,399
You're my best student.

580
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,560
You were overqualified for our school from your exam scores back then.

581
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,560
You had such great graduate scores.

582
00:35:02,479 --> 00:35:06,280
But you rushed to work to
support your younger brother.

583
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,000
You couldn't continue your studies.

584
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:13,159
And you ended up in a
job that wasn't in your field.

585
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,776
And in my heart of hearts,

586
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,000
I've never let it go.

587
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:21,040
So, now this must be a result of our unfinished
teacher-student bond.

588
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:23,638
I'm in Thailand.

589
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:26,199
I can't do it here without someone I trust.

590
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:28,040
Come and help your teacher.

591
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,080
Teacher.

592
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,359
The thing is, my job...

593
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,839
"Though none may lend a hand to lift my lofty dreams,"

594
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,800
"I shall tread through snow and reach the mountain's peak."

595
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,760
I know that you've relied on yourself

596
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,800
to make it to to where you are at Bohai.

597
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,199
And it wasn't easy.

598
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:48,719
But really ask yourself...

599
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:51,360
do you like this job?

600
00:35:57,959 --> 00:35:59,280
Can't say I like it.

601
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,800
Toasting and chatting.

602
00:36:00,801 --> 00:36:01,919
Welcoming and sending off.

603
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:03,519
I've long grown tired of it.

604
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,359
But right now,

605
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,399
you're worried about the pay?

606
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,399
Don't be.

607
00:36:09,521 --> 00:36:11,885
Didn't I tell you we have investors?

608
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:14,959
Come be my deputy team lead

609
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,560
and manage all the external affairs.

610
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,040
I'll pay you… this much.

611
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,280
My, you've certainly changed a lot.

612
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,399
Boss Huang has really become a boss!

613
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,120
Right.

614
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:31,759
I heard you sold your apartment,

615
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,080
and need a place.

616
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:36,000
The investor's covering more than money...

617
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,000
offices and housing are included.

618
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:45,658
If I stay at Bohai,
I'll inevitably see Fan Xiao again.

619
00:36:46,366 --> 00:36:47,366
He's unpredictable,

620
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,918
and I've already

621
00:36:48,919 --> 00:36:50,639
been far too irrational in this relationship.

622
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,478
Maybe leaving now

623
00:36:52,479 --> 00:36:53,679
is the smartest move.

624
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Well?

625
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,719
You in, Shulang?

626
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Sir...

627
00:37:00,399 --> 00:37:01,320
I'll follow however you plan it.
Good.

628
00:37:02,121 --> 00:37:04,399
Then it's a deal.

629
00:37:04,479 --> 00:37:06,718
The project's already started.

630
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:08,800
I need you on-site ASAP.

631
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,840
So...

632
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:13,599
hurry up and resign tomorrow and come over.

633
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,600
Tomorrow?

634
00:37:16,175 --> 00:37:19,399
I'll need time
to hand over my work.

635
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:21,519
And...

636
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,000
who's the investor behind this team?

637
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,000
It's…

638
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,199
Xinruida.

639
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:32,079
Xinruida.

640
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,000
Funding stuff isn't your lane.

641
00:37:35,025 --> 00:37:36,626
You definitely wouldn't know them.

642
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,120
Mm.

643
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,840
All right, sir.

644
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,479
I'll get on it quickly.

645
00:38:12,879 --> 00:38:13,879
Sir.

646
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:15,679
Ah, Shulang...

647
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:16,879
have a seat.

648
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:19,879
Sit.

649
00:38:23,919 --> 00:38:24,919
Shulang,

650
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:28,000
thanks to you leading the cleanup,

651
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,120
this room finally looks
presentable, hahaha.

652
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,718
Professor Huang,

653
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:35,280
what's the deal with the investor?

654
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:37,080
I still know nothing.

655
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:41,879
You just arrived; your
to-do list is a mile long.

656
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,959
Investors are just money men.

657
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,159
No need to study them.

658
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,919
Anyway, they'll be here in a minute...

659
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:52,039
we'll talk as we meet them.

660
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,560
Mm.

661
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:54,919
Mr. Huang...

662
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,238
your guests are here.

663
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:57,239
Please.

664
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,759
In the crowd

665
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,320
I was spotted in an instant.

666
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:36,839
The desolation in your eyes.

667
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,999
Hiding the same fire inside.

668
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,678
No need for words.

669
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:46,000
No need to ask what's right or wrong.

670
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,519
The moment we drew close.

671
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,239
The outcome was already destined.

672
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:01,919
Is the moth drawn to the light.

673
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,280
Or the whale sinking into the deep.

674
00:40:05,879 --> 00:40:07,398
With nothing but solitary courage

675
00:40:07,399 --> 00:40:09,959
I wager it all on tomorrow.

676
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:13,958
The walls of the world.

677
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:17,239
What does it matter if I break them down.

678
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:20,678
My chest burns with heat.

679
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:22,879
Screaming only for you

680
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,678
I'll love you until it boils over.

681
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:28,959
Loving without a care for the world.

682
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,718
Like two stars.

683
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,719
Colliding and shattering in the night sky.

684
00:40:32,919 --> 00:40:33,919
Even if it's just for a moment.

685
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,519
It's more than enough to surpass forever.

686
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,799
Hate and love both burn brightly.

687
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,478
Loving until the sky falls dark.

688
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,439
Loving until we reach the end of the road.

689
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:43,238
Before the altar.

690
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:45,359
We burn all the incense.

691
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,438
Not asking for the next life.

692
00:40:46,439 --> 00:40:47,958
Only desiring this moment.

693
00:40:47,959 --> 00:40:49,158
Drowning together with you in.

694
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:51,399
This blazing fire of fate
