1
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:17,479
A wind that only seems gentle

2
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:22,440
Your gaze shimmers with a dark undertow

3
00:00:23,479 --> 00:00:28,119
Who is laughing at my madness

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,560
yet indulges my startled heart

5
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:38,959
I see through your mask

6
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:44,159
and let you probe my limits

7
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,758
It is I who indulge

8
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,400
Love blazes like fire

9
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,839
spreading

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,879
Hard to say who crossed the line first

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,758
and who is waiting for whom to yield

12
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,598
Sharing rouge-scented smoke

13
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,638
and the flame that collides at our lips

14
00:01:07,639 --> 00:01:10,000
fiercer than any tender lingering

15
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,838
a duel that stakes our pride

16
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:18,080
whether a calamity decreed by fate

17
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:23,319
or sweetness bestowed by heaven

18
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,638
I still choose craving, wrath, and folly's

19
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:30,278
mad notion

20
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:33,400
made real

21
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:40,719
To hold your gaze is far too perilous

22
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,838
I walk devoutly toward my ruin

23
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:54,839
You are my abyss

24
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,918
You are my

25
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:08,479
sunshine

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
"To My Shore"

27
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,159
Shulang.

28
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,679
Don't go.

29
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,838
Please.

30
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:25,279
Don't go

31
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:27,758
I'm the kind of man
who can't stand seeing people “being nice.”

32
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,638
I only believe people are born evil.

33
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:31,520
Kindness never survives a test.

34
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:34,320
Once self-interest is involved,

35
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,000
no one can truly be kind.

36
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,399
At first, I thought you were a fake saint,

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,679
So I played dirty,

38
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,880
I tried to force you to
reveal your true nature.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,159
But

40
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,479
I realized you really are a good person.

41
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,320
You're too selfless for your own good.

42
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,520
You want to fix everyone's problems.

43
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,320
The more you did that,

44
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,320
The more I felt ashamed of myself.

45
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,360
I don't believe that shit.

46
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,919
I wanted to drag you through the mud.

47
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,039
But I found out.

48
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:08,460
I've already fallen for you.

49
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,240
And

50
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:16,520
I just want you to be kind only to me.

51
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,600
But I won't admit that I love you.

52
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:29,679
I thought that if I just got you into bed,

53
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,359
It would burn through
this tension inside me.

54
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,639
I could walk away easily.

55
00:03:38,242 --> 00:03:39,666
But when you...

56
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:43,440
started uncovering my lies slowly,

57
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:46,000
I panicked.

58
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:49,240
I don't care who ended the relationship.

59
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,279
The warmth I had just felt,

60
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,399
the joy I had just experienced,

61
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,880
the thought that all
of this would disappear...

62
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,519
And vanish,

63
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,039
I didn't expect it to hurt this much.

64
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,079
I started...

65
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,679
threatening you again and
again to keep you close.

66
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,920
Again and again.

67
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,799
I was wrong.

68
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:32,600
But what else could I do?

69
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:35,519
What else could I do to make you stay?

70
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,279
Shulang.

71
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,920
I'm willing to pay any price.

72
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:47,559
Please give me one more chance.

73
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,359
Let me atone.

74
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,920
Shulang.

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,039
Let's start over, okay?

76
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,320
Okay?

77
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,439
Fan Xiao

78
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,479
I used to rack my brain...

79
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,640
why would you treat me like this?

80
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,599
Turns out it was just because

81
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,920
I'm a “good man.”

82
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,439
All of that.

83
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,798
My work.

84
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:23,200
My family.

85
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,919
You wrecked my life.

86
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,519
You destroyed all the little
comfort and happiness I had.

87
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,879
Fan Xiao.

88
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,599
All of this.

89
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Was just because I was kind?

90
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,518
Fan Xiao.

91
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:46,160
When I poured my heart out for you,

92
00:05:46,576 --> 00:05:48,575
what were you doing to me?

93
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,799
Insulting me.

94
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,480
Lying.

95
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:53,399
Contempt.

96
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:56,559
Threats, again and again.

97
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:02,600
Where do you get the
nerve to ask for a fresh start?

98
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,440
Don't you think...

99
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,880
that not killing you is...

100
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,440
already the biggest mercy you'll get?

101
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,839
I deserve to die.

102
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,799
I know I belong in hell.

103
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,839
Shulang.

104
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,719
Save me one last time...

105
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,200
please, one last time.

106
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,278
Fan Xiao.

107
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,839
You're right about one thing:

108
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,798
I overestimated myself.

109
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:46,040
I thought I could save you.

110
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,959
But in the end,

111
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:53,320
You dragged me down with
you into the abyss.

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,119
No way back.

113
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,640
No one can save you...

114
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,239
except yourself.

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,480
You mean…

116
00:07:12,119 --> 00:07:13,159
Fan Xiao.

117
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,679
If you truly want to atone,

118
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,720
let me go...

119
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,679
and let yourself go.

120
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,965
I can't.

121
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,200
Exactly as I expected.

122
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:45,279
Fan Xiao, do you know?

123
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:49,760
You've proved every bit of
the “human evil” that you preach.

124
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,839
Fan Xiao.

125
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:58,799
I can already see our ending.

126
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,799
If you don't push me to death,

127
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,000
I'll make sure you die first.

128
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,320
Fan Yu.

129
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,719
Give me the drive.

130
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,000
(Episode 12)

131
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:29,478
Handle it yourselves.

132
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:32,640
And send me the other party's file.

133
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,280
I want to see it now.

134
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,678
I simmered pork-bone soup.

135
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,359
It's good for healing.

136
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,640
You've lost too much weight.

137
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,159
Drink it while it's hot.

138
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,919
I'll take you to the hospital.

139
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,919
I won't go.

140
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,718
- Cold water will do.
- No, it won't work.

141
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:27,639
If we don't treat the
wound, it'll get infected.

142
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,919
I'm not going to the hospital.

143
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,678
Shulang, please listen to me.

144
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:35,639
It will really get infected
if we don't treat it.

145
00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:39,279
I'll go buy burn ointment.

146
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,000
Don't move before I come back.

147
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,760
Shulang

148
00:11:06,761 --> 00:11:08,001
I'll apply the medicine for you

149
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:09,359
I'll do it myself.

150
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:21,479
Shulang.

151
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,479
Are you going out?

152
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,678
Shulang, can you tell
me where are you going?

153
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:30,359
Are you meeting someone?

154
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,119
You're good at tailing people, right?

155
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,799
You can come with me and see.

156
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:37,559
Go ahead.

157
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,479
I won't follow you anymore.

158
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,199
And I won't interfere in your affairs.

159
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,520
As long as you allow
me to stay by your side.

160
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,960
Your greatest harm to me is...

161
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,799
that you still won't leave.

162
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:07,519
How did you lose so much weight?

163
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,119
That bastard Fan treated you like this?

164
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,120
- I'm going to call the police.
- Don't be rash.

165
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,039
The video captured by the
dashcam doesn't count as spying.

166
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,919
And he didn't distribute it.

167
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,559
The video was hacked and taken out by you.

168
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:22,015
If you really report it to the police,

169
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:24,056
it isn't clear who would
take responsibility.

170
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,798
Then his imprisoning you
doesn't count as a crime?

171
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:28,439
He didn't imprison me.

172
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,719
It's just that I...

173
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:33,119
Whatever.

174
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,960
What's your plan now?

175
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,918
If you need help, just let me know.

176
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:39,159
Say whatever you need.

177
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,440
That video.

178
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:43,760
Was it hacked from Fan Xiao's computer?

179
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,679
I majored in computer
science and applications.

180
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:51,639
If my dad hadn't forced me
to take over the business,

181
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,719
I wouldn't have given up my dream.

182
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,038
Now all I can do is deal with scumbags.

183
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,880
Can you hack into any computer?

184
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,359
Not every system can be breached.

185
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,400
Depends on the security level.

186
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:12,440
Can you check if this
program can be modified?

187
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,280
Let me see.

188
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,320
This?
Sure, easy.

189
00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:33,840
Are you planning to
use it against Fan Xiao?

190
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,799
How should I thank you?

191
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,400
Thank me?

192
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,400
I...

193
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:52,440
You watched the video too?

194
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:55,200
No.

195
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,159
I...

196
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,718
I just saw the beginning.

197
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:00,598
When I realized something was wrong,
I closed it immediately.

198
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:02,200
I'm not as twisted as Fan Xiao.

199
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,919
You know that.

200
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,358
I'm spiritually a platonist.

201
00:14:05,359 --> 00:14:08,679
No physical contact for me.

202
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,279
Then tell me how I should thank you.

203
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,478
No need to thank me.

204
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:17,479
But.

205
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:21,520
If you leave Fan Xiao,

206
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:24,640
can I go after you?

207
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,520
It's not a quid pro quo.

208
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,200
Just a request.

209
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:34,080
Could you give me a chance?

210
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,799
Sorry.

211
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,960
I'm not looking to date right now.

212
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:44,239
Then I'll wait till you are.

213
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,559
I'm young.

214
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,520
I can wait.

215
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,880
I'll send this to you when I'm done.

216
00:14:55,107 --> 00:14:56,520
I'll leave now.

217
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,159
Director You.

218
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,199
When will Fan Xiao die by your hand?

219
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,039
I'm dying of impatience!

220
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,200
Second Young Master.

221
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:40,320
What grudge do you have with Fan Xiao?

222
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,640
Why so desperate to bring him down?

223
00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:45,719
No need to spell it out, Director You.

224
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:48,760
It's just a struggle for power and profit.

225
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,880
Three brothers, three mothers.

226
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:53,159
The eldest's mom was the wife.

227
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,200
The third's mom was the old man's favorite.

228
00:15:56,719 --> 00:15:59,200
But my mom was kept outside.

229
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,799
Of the three sons, I'm the least promising.

230
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,839
Even that old fellow Xu Zhong

231
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,639
wouldn't even look at me
when choosing his son-in-law.

232
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,118
Either the unmarried third,

233
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:09,840
or the divorced eldest.

234
00:16:10,479 --> 00:16:12,159
So if I don't fight for it,

235
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:15,719
Do you think that in this family,
I would even have a place to stand?

236
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,238
Director You.

237
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:23,639
Third brother has been working
from home most of the time as of late.

238
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,640
He also took his work laptop home.

239
00:16:26,775 --> 00:16:28,574
Just use the drive I gave you.

240
00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:30,239
Insert it into the computer.

241
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,359
Enter a simple command.

242
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,119
All the data on his computer
will automatically transfer to me.

243
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:38,640
Then everything will be done.

244
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,880
But Director You

245
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,080
I've waited so long.

246
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:47,280
How come I haven't received any data yet?

247
00:16:48,719 --> 00:16:49,840
Second Young Master.

248
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,520
You might as well change the path.

249
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,319
Send the data to me.

250
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,119
Then I'll file the report.

251
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,640
Not only will it vent my anger,

252
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:01,119
but it will also clear
you from the situation.

253
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:04,520
And you'll avoid other people
criticizing you for inter-family fighting.

254
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,239
Wouldn't that be even better?

255
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,079
Good.

256
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,560
This third one really
hurt Director You badly.

257
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:14,920
Don't worry.

258
00:17:14,921 --> 00:17:16,438
As long as I get the evidence

259
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:18,039
I'll definitely make a copy for you.

260
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,999
Then you can do whatever you want with him.

261
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,319
However you like.

262
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,920
Second Young Master.

263
00:17:24,371 --> 00:17:28,119
I guess you're so eager to get the
evidence from Fan Xiao's computer,

264
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:30,319
not to bring down Fan Xiao,

265
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:33,760
at least, not only to
bring down Fan Xiao...

266
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Could it be that there's some
secret of yours hidden in this data?

267
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,880
I have no power in the company.

268
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,760
What secrets could I possibly have?

269
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,119
Just a little joke.

270
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,040
Don't take it to heart,
Second Young Master.

271
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,198
I tried.

272
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,239
Fan Xiao's computer is password protected.

273
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,520
I couldn't get in.

274
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,160
So.

275
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,039
I had the intention,
but lacked the ability.

276
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,079
How come?

277
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,160
You've changed your mind?

278
00:18:09,033 --> 00:18:10,432
Limited ability.

279
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,840
Sorry to disappoint you,
Second Young Master.

280
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,040
Director You.

281
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,079
Don't rush off.

282
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,439
It's only been a few months.

283
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,079
You've triggered three acute
stress episodes in Fan Xiao.

284
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:33,439
He's about to knock his head bloody.

285
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,560
And you call that “limited ability”?

286
00:18:37,239 --> 00:18:39,039
He's only 18 years old.

287
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,799
When he saw the sea again,

288
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,160
he had such a severe stress reaction.

289
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,999
So, Director You.

290
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,078
Don't be modest.

291
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,280
Try again.

292
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,639
Whatever conditions you want,
I'll try my best to meet them.

293
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,079
Don't be polite with me.

294
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:54,520
Alright.

295
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:56,759
Then I won't force you, Director You.

296
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,959
Since the first path didn't work out,

297
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:00,760
there's still the second path.

298
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,759
You want revenge, right?

299
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,400
Then why don't you come with me?

300
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,520
We'll go together as a pair.

301
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,118
When Fan Xiao sees us,

302
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:10,400
he'll definitely explode with rage.

303
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,239
How does this plan sound?

304
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,959
We'll finish it right away.

305
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,119
Okay.

306
00:19:19,496 --> 00:19:22,294
As long as the Second Young
Master is willing to lie down,

307
00:19:22,326 --> 00:19:24,126
let me take the top position.

308
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,920
Director You

309
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:29,358
I didn't mean it that way.

310
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:31,039
I meant we...

311
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,319
could just pretend, not to actually do it.

312
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,920
I was with Fan Xiao before
only because he was good in bed.

313
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,280
I didn't expect to end up with a madman.

314
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,920
So my advice to Second Young Master is—
Don't start the game lightly.

315
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,639
Or you'll end up with nothing.

316
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,560
Everyone loses.

317
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,719
That You dares to trick me.

318
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,319
He's really hard to deal with.

319
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:18,126
But this time wasn't a total loss.

320
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,319
Back then, I was with Fan Xiao
just because he was good in bed.

321
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:25,800
I didn't expect to end up with a madman.

322
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,520
So my advice to Second Young Master is—
Don't start the game lightly.

323
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,118
Or you'll end up with nothing.

324
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:36,719
Everyone loses.

325
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,040
Fan Xiao, oh Fan Xiao.

326
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,760
You hopeless romantic.

327
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,199
If you hear this and then
bash into a wall again,

328
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,119
doesn't that mean it's the end for you?

329
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:26,959
Shulang.

330
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,399
Can you help me with something?

331
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
Can you look at these files on my computer?

332
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:33,040
They are two similar drugs.

333
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:35,280
I'm not sure which one
has better market potential.

334
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:37,640
You're an expert in this area too.

335
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,400
Why ask me?

336
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:43,119
All I know is sales.

337
00:21:43,592 --> 00:21:45,312
The rest is just superficial.

338
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:48,118
These two drugs are
based on the same formula,

339
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:49,958
But one uses authentic ingredients,

340
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:51,560
the other uses northern herbs.

341
00:21:52,231 --> 00:21:53,831
The price difference is significant.

342
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,119
I'm not sure how to judge it.

343
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:59,280
Can't we leave Mr. Fan
if we don't take a look?

344
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,400
Give it to me.

345
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,920
The information's all here.

346
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:27,880
I'll go get you some water.

347
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,920
Do you still have yesterday's
pomegranate juice?

348
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,119
There's still pomegranate.

349
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:35,359
I'll juice it for you.

350
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,119
Take your time to look.

351
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,959
Just follow the code I
gave you and input it.

352
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,599
The data will automatically
save to your email.

353
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:22,438
Yesterday's pomegranate
juice was a bit sour, you said.

354
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:23,560
You barely drank it.

355
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:25,599
This time, I added some honey.

356
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,959
See how it tastes.

357
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:33,399
Though the authentic herbs are more
expensive because of their higher quality,

358
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,560
their price has remained
high over the years.

359
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,958
But the price they
quoted you is still inflated.

360
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:39,680
To find out how much higher,

361
00:23:39,815 --> 00:23:43,560
we need to check the historical
price trends of the herbs.

362
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,599
And the planting output for this year.

363
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,359
We can analyze that comprehensively.

364
00:23:58,239 --> 00:24:00,479
If President Fan has no other business,

365
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:02,520
I'm going to sleep.

366
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,239
Shulang.

367
00:24:11,479 --> 00:24:13,800
Can we tonight?

368
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,199
Didn't President Fan always
do whatever he wanted?

369
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,079
When did he ever care
about others' intentions?

370
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,479
I don't want to force you.

371
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,880
"Don't want to force?"

372
00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:31,359
Fan Xiao.

373
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,680
You've messed up my whole life.

374
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,478
But now you want to imprison me.

375
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:39,640
That might take more effort.

376
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,079
Do you know why I didn't leave forcefully?

377
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,800
Because, since I couldn't
escape your control,

378
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,880
you've become nothing
more than a tool for me.

379
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:52,079
An adequately functional piece of bedding.

380
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,920
As long as I still serve
some purpose to you,

381
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,280
I'll be content with that.

382
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,479
Shulang, you've been drugged.

383
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:36,839
Shulang

384
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,079
I will find that sick
bastard who did this to you.

385
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,760
You must get payback for this.

386
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:45,672
So your partner is actually a man?

387
00:25:45,697 --> 00:25:46,697
Shulang.

388
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,519
You are sent by heaven to save me.

389
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,439
I wish to prostrate myself
beneath your lotus throne for all eternity.

390
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:54,399
Am I not trustworthy?

391
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,159
Or have you developed a
habit of making things up?

392
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,560
Have you gone paranoid?

393
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,920
I should've killed you.

394
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,280
Don't get your hands dirty because of me.

395
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,719
Don't stain your hands with blood.

396
00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:15,479
It's not worth it.

397
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:22,079
It'll happen soon, just like you wanted.

398
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,839
It won't be long.

399
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:28,680
What do you mean?

400
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:52,599
Mom.

401
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:56,359
I haven't come to see you for a long time.

402
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,839
Last night I dreamed of you again.

403
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,800
And Chen.

404
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:08,478
He followed us.

405
00:27:08,479 --> 00:27:10,479
He was shouting “Brother, Brother.”

406
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,520
He was fighting to get the
wooden windmill you made for us.

407
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,799
Today's the grand opening.

408
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,478
Uncles and aunties are
coming to visit the welfare home.

409
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:20,598
How should the children behave?

410
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:22,559
Be good.

411
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,280
Great.

412
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,199
Parents, please come in.

413
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,279
How cute!

414
00:27:33,304 --> 00:27:34,944
How cute!

415
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,880
Let's go.

416
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,879
This child looks handsome and elegant.

417
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,119
Let's take him.

418
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,999
I'm about to give birth.

419
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
When will you send him away?

420
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,559
Speak softly.

421
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,280
You just fell asleep.

422
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:00,880
We just adopted him less than a year ago.

423
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,799
How should I talk to the welfare home?

424
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,919
Then just drop him at
the welfare home's door.

425
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,920
He's already this big.

426
00:28:05,921 --> 00:28:08,160
He can walk in by himself.

427
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:23,040
From now on, you can live with us.

428
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,318
Come here.

429
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:26,760
From now on, this is your
little brother Chen.

430
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,112
Chen.

431
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,599
He will be your older brother from now on.

432
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,199
Come.

433
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,719
Put on your little brother's clothes first.

434
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:49,160
Look at your hands, they're freezing.

435
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,640
Mom.

436
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,520
Sorry.

437
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,520
If you hadn't adopted me...

438
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,560
Silly child.

439
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,199
This was just an accident.

440
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:06,759
Accident.

441
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,199
No one is at fault.

442
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:11,359
Mom.

443
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:16,839
The best decision I made
was bringing you home.

444
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,000
Mom had selfish reasons too.

445
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:23,199
Because I was worried about Chen.

446
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,880
He was lonely by himself.

447
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:32,640
So I went and found a
good older brother for him.

448
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,838
From now on,

449
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:40,982
you'll be the one in charge
of taking care of Chen.

450
00:29:41,007 --> 00:29:42,007
Mom.

451
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,479
Don't worry.

452
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,519
Lang.

453
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,079
From now on, if you like someone,

454
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,640
remember to bring them to me.

455
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:57,439
Let me see them.

456
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,880
Male or female.

457
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:03,318
Doesn't matter.

458
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:04,479
Mom.

459
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:09,493
Mom.

460
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,679
Sorry.

461
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,599
I didn't take good care of Chen.

462
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:17,839
Maybe you really shouldn't
have adopted me back then.

463
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,399
Then you and Chen would be
living happily now.

464
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,880
But Mom.

465
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,319
There's one thing you were wrong about.

466
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:32,760
Living your best life, until the end...

467
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:37,920
doesn't mean you'll find happiness.

468
00:30:56,959 --> 00:30:58,479
Mom.

469
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:04,040
I'm a bit tired.

470
00:31:04,472 --> 00:31:10,959
I always feel that the you in
my dreams is the real world.

471
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,160
You in the portrait.

472
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,959
Chen on the railing.

473
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,640
And the vicious Fan Xiao.

474
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,718
They're all fake.

475
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:26,760
Whenever it gets to this point,

476
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:30,479
I wake up.

477
00:31:32,719 --> 00:31:35,280
I wake up from the beautiful dream.

478
00:31:37,526 --> 00:31:38,646
Mom.

479
00:31:43,352 --> 00:31:45,272
I miss you.

480
00:31:51,959 --> 00:31:54,880
Can I come find you earlier?

481
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,079
I want to eat the dumplings you made.

482
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,239
The fennel filling.

483
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:29,679
When did you stop playing with matches?

484
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,760
Switched to skewers.

485
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,560
Come in.

486
00:32:37,199 --> 00:32:38,239
Fan Xiao.

487
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,999
What's been going on with the cleaning
at my place these days?

488
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,400
What's the situation?

489
00:32:42,479 --> 00:32:44,639
The hotel meals have barely been touched.

490
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,318
The guest room door's
been closed the whole time.

491
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:47,679
I knocked as per your request.

492
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,759
They said it was for housekeeping.

493
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,039
What did the person inside say?

494
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,439
Said no need.

495
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:53,439
All right.

496
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,760
You can go.

497
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,800
Yes.

498
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,040
Wait a moment.

499
00:32:57,359 --> 00:32:59,118
When the hotel delivers the meals,

500
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:00,520
ask them to send some pastries too.

501
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,919
They should be the kind
that tastes fine even cold.

502
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,920
Also,

503
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:06,119
don't make them too sweet.

504
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,760
Got it.

505
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:09,680
Why don't you like sweets?

506
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:11,479
How do you know I don't like sweets?

507
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:13,118
The first time I bought you milk tea,

508
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:14,639
you said you didn't like sweet drinks.

509
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:17,079
The first time you smoked Rouge,

510
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,760
You said it was too cloying.

511
00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:22,319
When I was in the orphanage,
the conditions were bad.

512
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,160
We didn't get to eat sweets.

513
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:26,958
Later, when the leaders came to inspect,

514
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:29,598
the orphanage bought tons of candy.

515
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:31,319
They gave it to every class.

516
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,319
We were all really looking forward to it.

517
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:35,239
We waited the whole day, excited.

518
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,838
But after the leaders left,

519
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:39,880
they took the candy back.

520
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,680
I got stubborn and thought,

521
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,519
“It's just sugar.”

522
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,999
“It's just candy.”

523
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,520
"How good can it be?"

524
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,839
I told myself I didn't like sweets.

525
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,119
After a while, I tricked myself.

526
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,920
And eventually, I
really didn't like sweets.

527
00:34:02,719 --> 00:34:04,598
You never stayed at the office before.

528
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:06,079
You were always watching
over me like a bodhisattva.

529
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,639
How is it that now,

530
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,399
you've started staying in the office?

531
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:14,159
Maybe only when I'm not
around him can I keep him safe.

532
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:19,520
Boss.

533
00:34:19,521 --> 00:34:20,719
Your guest has arrived.

534
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,239
All right.

535
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,199
Good luck.

536
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,560
I'll leave now.

537
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:39,919
Mrs. Boss.
You're looking for me?

538
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,439
Young You.

539
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,776
You finally turned on your mobile phone.

540
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,159
It's about your Mr. Huang.

541
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,800
You can't just go in like that.
Move aside.

542
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,280
I'm not done yet.

543
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,198
Mr. You.

544
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,559
You can't go in by yourself.

545
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,280
I need to report to the boss first.

546
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,080
You'd better move out of the way.

547
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:57,478
Shulang.

548
00:34:57,479 --> 00:34:58,360
Huo.

549
00:34:58,361 --> 00:35:00,479
No one can stop Mr. You
from doing the things he wants.

550
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,719
Stop following him.

551
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:03,199
Yes.

552
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:10,919
Go prepare some snacks.

553
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,239
Nothing too sweet.

554
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,520
Yes.

555
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,439
Why?

556
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:23,199
What do you mean, why?

557
00:35:23,399 --> 00:35:25,399
I've already left Changling Pharmaceutical.

558
00:35:25,513 --> 00:35:27,793
Why did you still sue my teacher?

559
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:29,159
You came to find me?

560
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:31,840
Are you here to demand an explanation?

561
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:37,280
No reason.

562
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,999
I'm just in a bad mood.

563
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,399
Bad mood?

564
00:35:40,582 --> 00:35:41,479
Yeah.

565
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,679
Bad mood.

566
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,319
Your Mr. Huang keeps
opposing me on certain issues.

567
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,600
Then let's forget everything.

568
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,536
Who told him to run
into the barrel of the gun?

569
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,080
Do you know?

570
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:52,559
Because of this incident,

571
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,615
Professor Huang was
disoriented and fell down the stairs.

572
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:55,878
He fractured his ankle.

573
00:35:55,879 --> 00:35:56,919
What?

574
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,120
You're going to blame me for this too?

575
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,840
Shulang.

576
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,520
If you're here to plead
for Professor Huang,

577
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,080
I'll withdraw the lawsuit right away.

578
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,320
You know that.

579
00:36:13,321 --> 00:36:14,559
Anything you want me to do,

580
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,879
I'll get it done immediately.

581
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:21,000
Other than coercion,

582
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,520
what else do you have?

583
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,040
Yes.

584
00:36:27,879 --> 00:36:29,399
I've pleaded.

585
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:31,614
But you've already made up your mind.

586
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:32,759
To be honest,

587
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,039
I didn't sue Huang Qimin
to force you to compromise.

588
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,359
It's just that I felt awful inside.

589
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:36,959
If I don't do something,

590
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,320
I'll suffocate.

591
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,840
Shulang.

592
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,438
Let's stop torturing each other, okay?

593
00:36:58,439 --> 00:36:59,879
All my mistakes, I admit.

594
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,719
You can punish me however you want.

595
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,479
As long as you come back to me.

596
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:30,040
Fan Xiao.

597
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,560
Coercion and threats aren't your specialty.

598
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,000
I've got something in my hands right now.

599
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:37,879
If I release it,

600
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:41,199
it should cause quite a stir.

601
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:43,719
You Shulang.

602
00:37:44,439 --> 00:37:46,080
Whatever you have,

603
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,478
Huang Qimin signed the contract with me,

604
00:37:48,479 --> 00:37:50,159
It's real and valid.

605
00:37:50,439 --> 00:37:53,120
Even though I'm not the GM of this company,

606
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:56,360
Huang Qimin and his
team are all legally liable.

607
00:37:56,879 --> 00:37:57,879
What's more,

608
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:00,559
he probably can't afford the
penalty for breach of contract.

609
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,800
If he dares to scam
me with unfinished work,

610
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:08,120
I'll sue him for commercial fraud.

611
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:09,560
That way,

612
00:38:11,439 --> 00:38:13,639
it won't just be about
paying money anymore.

613
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:17,239
If Professor Huang goes to jail,

614
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,359
the project will stop.

615
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,800
The compensation won't be enough.

616
00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:21,959
Your initial investment won't be recouped.

617
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:24,719
What's the benefit for you in doing this?

618
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:28,239
You Shulang.

619
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,760
You said it yourself,

620
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,479
I'm a madman.

621
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,679
What reason does a madman need?

622
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,159
I just want a quick fix.

623
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:38,438
If I'm not happy, no one else gets to be.

624
00:38:38,439 --> 00:38:40,320
Anyone I can drag down, I will.

625
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,719
As far as I know,

626
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,800
the lawsuit has reached mediation.

627
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,719
The mediator suggested
both sides take a step back.

628
00:38:54,439 --> 00:38:57,904
If Changling Pharmaceutical can complete
process optimization within three months,

629
00:38:59,744 --> 00:39:01,264
they'll hope you withdraw the lawsuit.

630
00:39:03,919 --> 00:39:05,040
Yes.

631
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,878
But if I don't agree to sign,

632
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:10,519
the case won't last two days in mediation.

633
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,399
And three months isn't enough
to complete the optimization.

634
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,918
What's more,

635
00:39:15,919 --> 00:39:20,199
three months isn't enough
to finish the optimization.

636
00:39:20,439 --> 00:39:22,280
Even though I'm an outsider,

637
00:39:22,399 --> 00:39:27,479
but I roughly how much time
each step of the process takes.

638
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:38,256
If Changling Pharmaceutical can finish
the optimization within three months,

639
00:39:41,399 --> 00:39:44,080
will you let it go, Mr. Fan?

640
00:39:46,479 --> 00:39:48,239
Why?

641
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,520
Because you once promised,

642
00:39:53,726 --> 00:39:56,446
you'd unconditionally grant me one request.

643
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,000
Director You, why are your lips so pale?

644
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:07,559
What do you think?

645
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,158
All brute force.

646
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:10,719
No technique at all.

647
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,280
No wonder you broke into a cold sweat.

648
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:15,360
Sorry.

649
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,719
Sorry.

650
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,999
I didn't think it through.

651
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,639
I shouldn't have done that.

652
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,438
Okay, okay.

653
00:40:22,439 --> 00:40:23,679
It's fine.

654
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:26,199
Director You.

655
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,080
You're really good to me.

656
00:40:28,439 --> 00:40:30,238
From now on, I'll go through
hell and high water for you.

657
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:31,719
I'll die a thousand deaths if I must.

658
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,560
What are you laughing at?

659
00:40:35,919 --> 00:40:37,040
You don't believe me?

660
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,800
I'm serious.

661
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:40,879
I believe you.

662
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:43,760
Director You.

663
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:45,639
I'm really serious.

664
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,678
As long as you're willing to ask,

665
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:49,360
I'll take the moon for you,

666
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,960
I'll dive into the five oceans
to catch a turtle if you wish.

667
00:40:53,439 --> 00:40:55,760
I've really taken it to heart.

668
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,679
Then from now on, unconditionally
grant me one request.

669
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,719
Come here.

670
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,760
Come into big brother's arms.

671
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:11,959
Three months—no more, no less.

672
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,120
I'll wait for your good news.

673
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,199
Director You.

674
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,198
Professor Huang.

675
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:29,760
We got three months.

676
00:41:29,959 --> 00:41:31,719
Though it's tight,

677
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,080
But if you and your
team work day and night,

678
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,760
there's still a glimmer of hope.

679
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,040
Shulang

680
00:41:38,439 --> 00:41:41,040
I've hurt my foot.

681
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,638
We have a few key members in the team.

682
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:46,320
I heard we've been sued.

683
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,600
People were already uneasy.

684
00:41:48,919 --> 00:41:50,679
Now they've all left.

685
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,600
No soldiers, no generals.

686
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,360
Even if you get us three months,

687
00:41:57,479 --> 00:42:00,439
I don't have any hope left.

688
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,959
Young You.

689
00:42:02,399 --> 00:42:03,919
Come help me.

690
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:07,399
Help me hold the fort.

691
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:08,800
Professor Huang

692
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:10,600
I'll go back and help you.

693
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:11,839
I'll hang up now.

694
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,878
Then I'll call you again later.

695
00:42:12,879 --> 00:42:13,919
Okay.

696
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:21,159
Fan Xiao.

697
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,399
I'm really not used to your bunker.

698
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,199
You really love paying
the electricity bill, huh?

699
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,599
How's it going?

700
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,918
What I said on your phone...
is it okay?

701
00:42:33,919 --> 00:42:35,198
Mr. Huang.

702
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:37,439
You still need to work on your acting.

703
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:39,000
Don't blow your cover.

704
00:42:40,919 --> 00:42:44,478
Oh, you young people...

705
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:47,360
I really don't know
what you're all fighting about every day.

706
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,959
You scared me half to death
just now in the next room.

707
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,600
I've never done anything wrong in my life.

708
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,560
Now I'm old,

709
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,760
and I'm tricking my own student.

710
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:02,280
Thank you, Mr. Huang.

711
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:06,438
We reap what we sow.

712
00:43:06,439 --> 00:43:07,679
I'll head out.

713
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,360
Your leg was tripped by your dog.

714
00:43:10,399 --> 00:43:12,360
It has nothing to do with me.

715
00:43:12,439 --> 00:43:14,159
Why are you adding extra drama?

716
00:43:15,959 --> 00:43:17,878
Essentially,

717
00:43:17,879 --> 00:43:19,959
there's no difference.

718
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,238
In the crowd

719
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:45,800
I was spotted in an instant

720
00:43:46,919 --> 00:43:49,319
The desolation in your eyes

721
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:52,478
Hiding the same fire inside

722
00:43:52,479 --> 00:43:55,158
No need for words

723
00:43:55,159 --> 00:43:58,479
No need to ask what's right or wrong

724
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:00,999
The moment we drew close

725
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,719
The outcome was already destined

726
00:44:11,879 --> 00:44:14,399
Is the moth drawn to the light

727
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:17,760
Or the whale sinking into the deep

728
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,878
With nothing but solitary courage

729
00:44:19,879 --> 00:44:22,439
I wager it all on tomorrow

730
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:26,438
The walls of the world

731
00:44:26,439 --> 00:44:29,719
What does it matter if I break them down

732
00:44:30,879 --> 00:44:33,158
My chest burns with heat

733
00:44:33,159 --> 00:44:35,360
Screaming only for you

734
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,158
I'll love you until it boils over

735
00:44:39,159 --> 00:44:41,439
Loving without a care for the world

736
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,198
Like two stars

737
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:45,199
Colliding and shattering in the night sky

738
00:44:45,399 --> 00:44:46,399
Even if it's just for a moment

739
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,999
It's more than enough to surpass forever

740
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,279
Hate and love both burn brightly

741
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,958
Loving until the sky falls dark

742
00:44:51,959 --> 00:44:53,919
Loving until we reach the end of the road

743
00:44:54,679 --> 00:44:55,718
Before the altar

744
00:44:55,719 --> 00:44:57,839
We burn all the incense

745
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,918
Not asking for the next life

746
00:44:58,919 --> 00:45:00,438
Only desiring this moment

747
00:45:00,439 --> 00:45:01,638
Drowning together with you in

748
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:03,879
This blazing fire of fate
