1
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:17,479
A wind that only seems gentle

2
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:22,440
Your gaze shimmers with a dark undertow

3
00:00:23,479 --> 00:00:28,119
Who is laughing at my madness

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,560
yet indulges my startled heart

5
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:38,959
I see through your mask

6
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:44,159
and let you probe my limits

7
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,758
It is I who indulge

8
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,400
Love blazes like fire

9
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,839
spreading

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,879
Hard to say who crossed the line first

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,758
and who is waiting for whom to yield

12
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,598
Sharing rouge-scented smoke

13
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,638
and the flame that collides at our lips

14
00:01:07,639 --> 00:01:10,000
fiercer than any tender lingering

15
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,838
a duel that stakes our pride

16
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:18,080
whether a calamity decreed by fate

17
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:23,319
or sweetness bestowed by heaven

18
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,638
I still choose craving, wrath, and folly's

19
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:30,278
mad notion

20
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:33,400
made real

21
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:40,719
To hold your gaze is far too perilous

22
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,838
I walk devoutly toward my ruin

23
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:54,839
You are my abyss

24
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,918
You are my

25
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:08,479
sunshine

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
"To My Shore"

27
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:17,559
Waiter.

28
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:19,320
What do you recommend?

29
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,520
Today's chef's special is

30
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,119
yellow curry beef brisket.

31
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:34,279
You two…

32
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,160
know each other?

33
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,520
We do.

34
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,479
He's my ex.

35
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:49,559
My man's got great taste in men.

36
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,800
Really good.

37
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,880
Ex-boyfriend...

38
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,679
Send us five of your best dishes,

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
you pick.

40
00:02:57,925 --> 00:02:59,565
If nobody has dietary restrictions,

41
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,240
I'll get started.

42
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,160
Don't ask.

43
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,440
There's nothing to say.

44
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,199
I'm almost thirty.

45
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,880
How could I not have an ex?

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,080
I've got one question...

47
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,559
how is he in bed?

48
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:18,520
They say the hotter the guy,

49
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,639
the lamer the skills.

50
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,759
Jiang Huihui...

51
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:22,960
what did you learn all those years abroad?

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,559
None of your business.

53
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,800
If not me, then who?

54
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,520
You two bicker first...

55
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:27,999
I'm stepping out for a smoke.

56
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,360
Want one?

57
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:56,880
You used to like these.

58
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,839
Smooth?

59
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,239
Not really my thing.

60
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:22,920
Too sweet and cloying.

61
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,440
Kinda like...

62
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:25,839
rouge.

63
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,279
Rouge?

64
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:39,959
Waiting for me?

65
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:41,480
What do you mean?

66
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,160
You've been in here six minutes.

67
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:45,399
If it's going to the
bathroom or having a smoke,

68
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,920
that's more than enough time.

69
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,079
If you're still here,

70
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:51,119
you're waiting for me.

71
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,519
Aren't you in sales at Kangda Pharma?

72
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,320
What's this...

73
00:04:57,679 --> 00:04:59,359
a costume change?

74
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,200
Still doing sales,

75
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:06,519
and I help out here sometimes.

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I speak Thai...

77
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,480
they pay me better.

78
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,320
You could carry plates all night

79
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:15,399
and still not afford this pack of Rouge.

80
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:18,160
President Fan, slumming it...

81
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,160
what's the angle?

82
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,959
I quit when I was inside too,

83
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,079
but after I got out,

84
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:29,040
I couldn't control it.

85
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,200
When I'm upset, I want a smoke;

86
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,679
when I miss you, I want one, too.

87
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,079
I tried other brands,

88
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,440
but I couldn't get used to them.

89
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,920
This brand's pricey,

90
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
so I smoke it less...

91
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,720
only when I miss you like crazy

92
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,200
do I light one.

93
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,160
Some things aren't fit to say right now...

94
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:51,119
please keep them to
yourself, President Fan.

95
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,799
As far as I know,

96
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:56,119
you never went “inside,” did you?

97
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,440
Six months.

98
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,560
I was a cooperating witness.

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,680
A cooperating witness with minor offenses.

100
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:04,320
Charges weren't disclosed publicly.

101
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,440
A cooperating witness.

102
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:12,239
During the “tsunami,”

103
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,320
they could've taken me and my mom.

104
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,480
But they shut the car door

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,200
they wouldn't wait a second.

106
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,320
I wanted revenge for years.

107
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,600
I planned it for a long time.

108
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:27,839
To collect evidence,

109
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,559
I did plenty of dirty things with them.

110
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,159
Later I worked with Thai prosecutors

111
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,640
and gave them firsthand info.

112
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,559
So once it went to court,

113
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:38,799
they converted me to a cooperating witness

114
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,440
and gave a lighter sentence.

115
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:49,119
The money in the

116
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,040
medical fund you set up for Tiantian,

117
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:54,359
the dividends from Pinfeng
under your own name...

118
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:57,559
none of that needs you juggling jobs.

119
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
So,

120
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,473
what trick are you playing now?

121
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,720
I won't touch Tiantian's medical money

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,679
not even if I'm broke.

123
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:12,799
True...

124
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,720
I could do nothing

125
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,559
and still live comfortably.

126
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:17,880
But days like that...

127
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,600
what's the point?

128
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:22,440
I want to cut loose from family capital

129
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,760
and earn clean money to spend,

130
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,799
to find something worth working for.

131
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,040
Otherwise,

132
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:32,640
I really won't last.

133
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,600
I relied on no one...

134
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,959
I earned this job myself.

135
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,200
Look,

136
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:46,919
this is me at the company's

137
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,679
Outstanding Employee awards.

138
00:07:48,704 --> 00:07:50,456
[A picture stating he's Outstanding
Employee of the season]

139
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,480
In six months

140
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,839
I rose from field rep
to regional distributor.

141
00:07:57,239 --> 00:07:58,839
Silly, right?

142
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,000
Starting from scratch
was harder than I thought.

143
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:04,239
Shulang...

144
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
you don't know.

145
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,480
A tiny title,

146
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,679
a bonus worth a few cartons of smokes...

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,799
things I used to despise...

148
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,959
had me shaking with excitement.

149
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,559
After I got off stage, they all
called home with the news;

150
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:22,679
I've never had real good news,

151
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,600
and when I finally did,

152
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:29,160
I didn't know who to tell.

153
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I stared at your number

154
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,960
for over ten minutes

155
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,880
and still didn't dial.

156
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,520
I promised you

157
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:44,960
not to disturb your life...

158
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,799
so I have to keep it.

159
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,880
Then please keep doing exactly that.

160
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,080
This place was so good.

161
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,239
I'm so full I can't walk.
How are you getting home?

162
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,358
My husband's picking me up.

163
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:14,439
My car's outside.

164
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,200
I'll drive you back.
Oh...

165
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:17,679
don't forget to get your parking validated.

166
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,640
Hey, man...

167
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,359
I'm talking to you.

168
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,239
Look here.

169
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,359
Where are you looking?

170
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:33,558
The hair's right here.

171
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,640
What's left to confirm?

172
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:35,599
What...

173
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,679
you think I'd frame a waiter?

174
00:09:38,719 --> 00:09:39,719
Of course not.

175
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:40,320
Sorry...

176
00:09:40,719 --> 00:09:42,280
we'll remake it right away.

177
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,559
That's more like it

178
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:45,840
That's the right attitude.

179
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:47,159
Here...

180
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,679
your tip.

181
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,479
Not picking it up?

182
00:09:57,719 --> 00:09:59,960
Too high-and-mighty to be a waiter?

183
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:04,760
You...

184
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,840
let's go.

185
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
Coming.

186
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,400
(Episode 14)

187
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,719
Shulang...

188
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:17,440
what are you doing here?

189
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,080
Are you watching me?

190
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,159
I'm not.

191
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,320
No...

192
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,000
I saw the dark circles under
your eyes at the restaurant...

193
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,079
you looked like that when you weren't well.

194
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,880
I got worried,

195
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:37,559
so I

196
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,599
waited here.

197
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:41,799
Until when?

198
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:43,440
Usually

199
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,880
until your lights go out.

200
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,679
Usually?

201
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,359
It's late—where are you going?

202
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,159
I'm fine.

203
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:55,479
Go.

204
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:57,320
You're sure you're not unwell?

205
00:11:58,239 --> 00:11:59,239
Don't mind me.

206
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,599
What's going on?

207
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:06,039
Is it your stomach?

208
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,559
It hurts.

209
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,679
I'll take you to the hospital.

210
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:14,440
Fan Xiao...
put me down.

211
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,280
I'm not going to the hospital.
I'll just buy some meds.

212
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:18,440
I'll be fine after.

213
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,039
Fan Xiao...

214
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:22,840
Tiantian's at home; I'm worried.

215
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:36,159
Every time I take pills,

216
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:37,359
it gets better.

217
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,440
Every time?

218
00:12:38,719 --> 00:12:39,799
Does this happen a lot?

219
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,119
I thought you were doing fine.

220
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,559
I'll just go buy meds.

221
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,640
I'll get you home now,

222
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,320
then I'll go to the pharmacy.

223
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,719
That fast?

224
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,239
Thanks.

225
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,280
I'll make you some congee,

226
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,640
and leave when it's done.

227
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,840
No need.

228
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:38,079
What do you really want?

229
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,760
I just want to cook congee for you...

230
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,000
and I'll go after you eat it.

231
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,080
It's ready to drink.

232
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,960
I'll put it in the kitchen.

233
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,479
Your kitchen...

234
00:14:36,719 --> 00:14:37,479
Enter through the bedroom,

235
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,600
there's a small door inside.

236
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,559
You Shulang...

237
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,159
you actually brought the wolf in again.

238
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,799
Shulang...

239
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:25,679
it's your birthday today.

240
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,840
Happy birthday.

241
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,359
But your stomach's bad,

242
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:32,960
no cake.

243
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,919
So blow out the candle,

244
00:15:42,006 --> 00:15:43,565
and make a wish.

245
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,719
Not making one?

246
00:16:05,479 --> 00:16:07,119
I don't know my real birthday.

247
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:09,640
And I never celebrate.

248
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:12,719
I know.

249
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:15,559
Didn't we pick today before...

250
00:16:17,838 --> 00:16:19,159
Does that pact still count?

251
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
Is the congee done?

252
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,159
If it is, get out.

253
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,239
Then I'll wish for you:

254
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,239
Wishing Director You and Tiantian

255
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:39,000
to be healthy always,

256
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:40,719
and happy.

257
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,439
The congee's on warm.

258
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,920
I'm leaving.

259
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,119
Get some rest.

260
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,640
If you need me,

261
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,800
one call and I'm there.

262
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:54,199
Sis Xiaotian...

263
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:55,759
Send me the files tonight

264
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,760
by email.

265
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,080
I've got a video meeting
with President Huang tomorrow.

266
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,640
Don't worry,

267
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,720
Brother You and I keep
updating the measurements.

268
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,317
It's 7:30 now...

269
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,016
we'll have it out by ten at the latest.

270
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,239
Okay.

271
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,520
I won't keep you up late.

272
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,680
Thanks, sis.

273
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,319
Director You...

274
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:18,280
did you hear Fan Xiao crashed and burned?

275
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:20,838
He's so overbearing,

276
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,199
stepped on everyone,

277
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:23,760
made a ton of enemies.

278
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,520
Now he's done in...

279
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,839
can't cut it in Thailand.

280
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,479
Tucked tail and ran.

281
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:31,920
I heard from Bai Sanmiao

282
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:33,839
that Fan Xiao went to China.

283
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,199
He's going to follow him.

284
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,599
Bai Pengyu...

285
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,719
what's his beef with him?

286
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,680
It's obviously revenge,

287
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,119
he's dying to get even.

288
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:45,119
No idea what grudge they have.

289
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:46,959
Director You...

290
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:48,520
wanna go watch the show?

291
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,759
Didn't Fan Xiao lie to you then

292
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,079
and force you?

293
00:18:58,239 --> 00:18:59,239
Brother You...

294
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:00,959
Brother You...

295
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:01,236
Yeah?

296
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:03,560
Are you still not fully recovered?

297
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,599
You've been off the past few days.

298
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,119
Today's technical calculations...

299
00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:09,880
you messed them up three times.

300
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,680
Sorry...

301
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,560
I really haven't felt well.

302
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,280
I'll head out first today.

303
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,560
Brother Zhou...

304
00:19:18,719 --> 00:19:19,719
Xiaotian...

305
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,920
thanks for covering.

306
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:21,920
Brother You,

307
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,000
you should go to the
hospital—don't tough it out.

308
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,040
Yeah, You,

309
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,640
go get checked properly.

310
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,439
We've got this here.
Mm.

311
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:29,479
It's okay.

312
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,920
A solid sleep will fix it.

313
00:19:31,479 --> 00:19:32,479
Okay.

314
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,520
It's almost eight.

315
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,079
Are the buses late today?

316
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:45,199
Why isn't one here yet?

317
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:47,198
After seven, this stop

318
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:48,958
only runs every fifteen minutes.

319
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:50,800
We probably just missed one.

320
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:51,599
Let's wait.

321
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,079
It's coming—almost here.

322
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:54,920
Director You, Director You...
I found out...

323
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
8:30 tonight...

324
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:58,359
at Lido Club...

325
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,079
Bai Sansmiao invited Fan Xiao.

326
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,280
Hey, kid...

327
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:16,560
Gettin' on?

328
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:18,119
Oh.

329
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,239
Look...

330
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:35,079
That motorcycle is so cool.

331
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:36,079
Cool my foot...
it's so showy.

332
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:38,119
And loud.

333
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,958
This is Hongyesi.

334
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:53,559
Passengers who need to get off,
please get off at the back door

335
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,136
Please be careful when opending the door

336
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,976
Please take your way
when getting off the vehicle

337
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,239
Anyone getting off?

338
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,920
No one? I'm going.

339
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,160
Driver!
Driver...

340
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,719
Sorry, I'm getting off!

341
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,160
Should've said so earlier.

342
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,640
Xue Bao...

343
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:31,119
Driver,

344
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,160
can you go faster?

345
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,560
Sure.

346
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,599
It's already eight forty-seven

347
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,359
Hello.

348
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,520
Hi.

349
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,520
Which room is Young Master Bai's suite?

350
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,560
May I have your surname, sir?

351
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,560
Fan.
Okay.

352
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,280
One moment.

353
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:58,719
Mm.
All right...

354
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,880
this way, Mr. Fan.

355
00:22:04,486 --> 00:22:05,680
This way, Mr. Fan.

356
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,360
It's the last private room inside.

357
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,160
Third Young Master is waiting for you.

358
00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:20,479
Come on, come on...

359
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,078
let's give a warm welcome to our...

360
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,119
Fan...

361
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,800
As expected—he's not here.

362
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:27,839
Why is it you?

363
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,680
Where's Fan Xiao?

364
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
Third Young Master...

365
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:31,239
I'm here with a friend,

366
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:32,160
I heard

367
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:33,599
you were next door,

368
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,800
so I came to say hi.

369
00:22:35,199 --> 00:22:36,199
Long time no see...

370
00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:38,640
still as dashing as ever.

371
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:45,599
Third Young Master,

372
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,119
my friend's calling me...

373
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,959
I won't intrude.

374
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:50,599
Enjoy yourselves.

375
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:53,640
Brother You...

376
00:22:54,479 --> 00:22:56,839
leaving without even a drink?

377
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,359
I came back to Hua country

378
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,719
to throw a big party to invite Fan Xiao...

379
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,479
and he disrespects me like this?

380
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:10,520
You invited Fan Xiao today?

381
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:11,719
Third Young Master,

382
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,920
you also know

383
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:14,920
he and I have beef.

384
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,919
If he's coming,

385
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,040
I'll leave first.

386
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:28,800
What do you mean by that?

387
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:32,359
Nothing special.

388
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:35,079
Brother You...

389
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:37,800
I know best

390
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:39,560
about your grudge with Fan Xiao.

391
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,719
Look...

392
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,199
he still isn't here.

393
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:44,119
Why don't you call and hurry him up?

394
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:46,359
When he arrives,

395
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,800
I'll play peacemaker

396
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,239
and “make peace.”

397
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,560
Third Young Master...

398
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,920
Sorry,

399
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:54,040
my gastritis is acting up...
I can't drink.

400
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:56,479
And

401
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,599
I can't order Fan Xiao around.

402
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,880
We haven't spoken in a long time.

403
00:24:03,239 --> 00:24:04,239
Is that so?

404
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:07,000
If he wants to hide like a turtle,

405
00:24:07,199 --> 00:24:08,959
I can invite Brother You instead...

406
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,040
same difference.

407
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,680
Brother You...

408
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,160
why hold the door?

409
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:14,959
Come on...
sit with me.

410
00:24:15,959 --> 00:24:16,959
Let's have a good talk.

411
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:18,079
Third Young Master...

412
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,479
I'll treat you another day.

413
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:22,680
I really have someone waiting.

414
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,280
You think this is the kind of place

415
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:30,119
where you come as you like

416
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,280
and leave as you please?

417
00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:33,319
No time like the present...

418
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:34,560
tonight it is.

419
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,760
You set up this whole scene

420
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,439
and invited Fan Xiao...

421
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,959
what do you really want?

422
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,640
Third Young Master...

423
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,079
let's stop circling.

424
00:24:58,359 --> 00:24:59,359
We both know

425
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,880
what you mean.

426
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,319
He's fallen on hard times...

427
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,959
you want to stomp him.

428
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,319
After what he did to me,

429
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,760
shouldn't I step on him?

430
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,680
Mm.

431
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:18,199
The ways to “handle” someone...

432
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,040
they're all the same.

433
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:22,160
I've been to Lido many times,

434
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,479
never in this room.

435
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,719
This one's not for ordinary guests...

436
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:29,013
you need a sponsor to book it.

437
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:31,359
In a place this private,

438
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,079
if it's just drugs and booze,

439
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,839
that's too crude.

440
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,280
So, Third Young Master,

441
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:39,880
you want to use the pricey stuff

442
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,839
or mix it up?

443
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:49,599
I get it now.

444
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:52,359
You didn't come to greet me...

445
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,959
you got wind of it

446
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,479
and came to save your sweetheart.

447
00:25:55,959 --> 00:25:58,280
So you used Fan Xiao's name to get in...

448
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,239
to pay his debt?

449
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,000
Not pay it, no.

450
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:07,079
But what you did to me before...

451
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:11,239
doesn't it deserve a beating?

452
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,079
Or

453
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,640
If you insist on revenge,

454
00:26:20,199 --> 00:26:22,959
I'll take it for Fan Xiao.

455
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:30,359
He treated you like dirt,

456
00:26:30,592 --> 00:26:32,592
and you'll still take the hit for him?

457
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,958
You get off on being used?

458
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:36,159
Addicted to being pinned down?

459
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,319
I don't touch men...

460
00:26:39,439 --> 00:26:40,199
or else

461
00:26:40,439 --> 00:26:42,319
I also need to find someone
as despicable as you

462
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:56,040
Your loss, Third Young Master.

463
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,520
But tonight I'm under your roof...

464
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,359
do whatever you want.

465
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,319
If you don't kill me today,

466
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,640
I'll hang on to you
for the rest of your life,

467
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,280
until I collect tenfold...

468
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,760
a hundredfold.

469
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,920
Of course,

470
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,839
you're not only watched by me...

471
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:36,599
there's Fan Xiao too.

472
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:39,719
Then you'll know

473
00:27:40,719 --> 00:27:42,959
what we really are to each other.

474
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,640
And of course,

475
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,599
that includes everyone here tonight.

476
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:50,839
You...

477
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,199
you're threatening me?

478
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,078
Think I don't dare touch you?

479
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,079
Do you?

480
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,680
You dare—no doubt.

481
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:02,479
You just don't like getting
your hands dirty.

482
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,040
I really have an appointment
with someone today

483
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:08,119
my friend is urging me...

484
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:09,760
I really have to go.

485
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,520
Brother You...

486
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:17,160
you tell me...

487
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:19,359
you came to say hi,

488
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:21,920
and I let you walk so easily...

489
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:23,619
that makes me look rude.

490
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,880
Doesn't it?

491
00:28:29,719 --> 00:28:30,719
Last time

492
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,599
you had Fan Xiao beat me in ten minutes.

493
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,079
Today,

494
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,199
let me stretch my legs,

495
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:39,399
and give you ten minutes back.

496
00:28:39,479 --> 00:28:40,479
How about it?

497
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:53,239
You alone...

498
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,280
or all of you?

499
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:58,160
All would make it bullying,

500
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,680
right?

501
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,839
Just me

502
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:04,160
and him.

503
00:29:15,439 --> 00:29:16,439
Fine.

504
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:27,800
Wait, wait!

505
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,920
Wait!

506
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:30,599
You Shulang...

507
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,640
you said

508
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,040
I could hit you for ten minutes!

509
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:34,279
You're breaking your word!

510
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:35,800
Last time I hit you,

511
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,319
I never said you couldn't fight back.

512
00:29:49,199 --> 00:29:50,199
Shulang...

513
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:51,439
Shulang, what's wrong?

514
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,800
Why are your hands so cold?

515
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,920
Why didn't you answer the phone?

516
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:00,079
You called me?

517
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:01,719
Didn't you say “one call and I'm there”?

518
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,239
Why was your phone off?

519
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,640
I…

520
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,078
Bai Sanmiao kept calling me...

521
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:07,079
it was annoying,

522
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:08,839
so I shut it off for a bit.

523
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,520
Why did you call me?

524
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:18,439
Nothing.

525
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,040
Pocket dial.

526
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,239
You wouldn't call for no reason...

527
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:23,920
it couldn't be accidental.

528
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:25,479
So what really happened?

529
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,560
What's wrong?

530
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:32,880
Shulang...

531
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:34,079
are you unwell?

532
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,760
I just got back from the lab,

533
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,640
I'm very tired...

534
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,119
I want to rest early.

535
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,079
Can I, Fan Xiao?

536
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,560
No...

537
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:45,040
Bai Pengyu

538
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:46,880
kept asking to meet to “talk” today.

539
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:49,000
It started pouring when I went.

540
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,199
I figured you had no umbrella,

541
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,280
so I brought one to the institute.

542
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,760
They said you weren't well

543
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:56,280
and had gone home early.

544
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,839
But your home stayed dark.

545
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:00,959
You Shulang...

546
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,359
what really happened?

547
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,520
Fan Xiao...

548
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:07,000
you track me every second...

549
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,160
that's “not disturbing my life”?

550
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,640
If I'm not at the institute,

551
00:31:12,641 --> 00:31:14,000
I must be home?

552
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:16,520
I can't have a life of my own?

553
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:19,280
Can't I do other things...

554
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,000
like go on a date or whatever?

555
00:31:22,199 --> 00:31:23,199
A date...

556
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,440
where he let you walk home in a storm?

557
00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:27,719
What a class act.

558
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:29,119
Director You, you like that?

559
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:31,319
Fan Xiao...

560
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,639
any man's got more class than you.

561
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,160
I don't want to rehash the past.

562
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,560
Before my patience runs out

563
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,000
just disappear.

564
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:43,479
I'll still find out.

565
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,959
If it was a date,

566
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,199
that kind of man isn't for you.

567
00:31:57,308 --> 00:31:58,270
[Ruixiang Pharma Xue Baotian]
Director You...

568
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,599
I heard Bai Sanmiao laid hands on you.

569
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:01,886
Are you okay?

570
00:32:02,199 --> 00:32:03,920
I didn't mean to miss your call...

571
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,959
Zhang Chi's punk crew
grabbed me just now...

572
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:06,800
Say that again...

573
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,119
he hit who?

574
00:32:16,698 --> 00:32:17,959
Are the injuries serious?

575
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,760
Fan Xiao...

576
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,439
Bai Pengyu asked for you today

577
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:24,239
to mess you up.

578
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,239
I wanted to see

579
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,198
how a devil like you

580
00:32:28,199 --> 00:32:30,280
gets played.

581
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:33,719
It'd be a great show.

582
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:36,760
Thinking of it cheers me up.

583
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:41,479
I know

584
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:44,199
you came to watch the joke.

585
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,599
Go take a hot bath.

586
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,520
Don't catch a cold.

587
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:55,839
I'll head out.

588
00:32:58,479 --> 00:32:59,479
Get some rest.

589
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,640
Fan Xiao...

590
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:08,760
He got nothing out of me.

591
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,760
Don't go after him.

592
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,239
How could I not?

593
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:20,560
I figured they wanted a show,

594
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,800
but I never thought

595
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:24,160
that clown

596
00:33:24,161 --> 00:33:25,800
would dare touch you.

597
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:27,839
If he touches you,

598
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,920
he pays the price.

599
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:33,959
Fan Xiao...

600
00:33:34,199 --> 00:33:35,839
I'm no bodhisattva.

601
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,959
I've wanted revenge more than once...

602
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:42,359
I want to grind you under my heel...

603
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:44,359
I want to see you suffer.

604
00:33:46,479 --> 00:33:47,479
But unfortunately,

605
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,640
it can't be Bai Pengyu.

606
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,640
He isn't worthy.

607
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:55,640
He's cut from the same cloth as you.

608
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,760
Fan Xiao...

609
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,359
When he called me “cheap,”

610
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,839
I half believed it.

611
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:09,280
I've been low enough...

612
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,120
a joke to others.

613
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,159
So I beg you...

614
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,919
let it go.

615
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,719
Don't stir up more trouble.

616
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,479
No one is worthy...

617
00:34:36,479 --> 00:34:38,360
only you can take revenge on me.

618
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,040
If hurting me helps you breathe,

619
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,479
I'll take it gladly.

620
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,159
You're nobody's joke...

621
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,879
you're not…

622
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,520
I'll do anything you say,

623
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,120
except this.

624
00:35:00,919 --> 00:35:02,439
No one touches you.

625
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,800
If he does,

626
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,919
he pays.

627
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,199
I won't go overboard,

628
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:13,439
or break the law.

629
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,800
Don't worry.

630
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:26,679
What would I worry about?

631
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:33,800
I want to check your injuries,

632
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,239
put some medicine on,

633
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,439
and then I'll go...

634
00:35:36,879 --> 00:35:38,239
I won't linger.

635
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,280
Where's Tiantian?

636
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,760
At the neighbor's.

637
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:54,959
Here...

638
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,040
have some ginger tea,

639
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,159
chase off the chill.

640
00:36:05,959 --> 00:36:07,439
I ran hot water in the tub...

641
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,040
go soak.

642
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,678
How far are you going to follow me?

643
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:24,159
I want to check your injuries...

644
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,439
it's warm in the bathroom.

645
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,600
See?

646
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,719
You can go out now.

647
00:37:21,919 --> 00:37:23,879
Why so many bruises?

648
00:37:25,439 --> 00:37:26,600
Does it hurt?

649
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:28,719
It's okay.

650
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,560
It's all my fault,

651
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:33,000
I let you get hurt this much.

652
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:39,600
I really am a bastard...

653
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:44,600
I caused you all these injuries.

654
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,879
I'm sorry.

655
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:49,479
If it weren't for me,

656
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,840
you wouldn't be hurt so much.

657
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,600
I'm sorry.

658
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,639
I'm sorry.

659
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:12,679
If I leave you,

660
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:16,679
would you stop getting hurt?

661
00:38:17,919 --> 00:38:20,120
I should leave.

662
00:38:21,479 --> 00:38:23,919
I should stay far away from you.

663
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:32,199
I'm sorry.

664
00:38:57,679 --> 00:38:58,679
Shulang...

665
00:38:59,439 --> 00:39:01,560
I want to stay tonight...

666
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,760
just once more.

667
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:08,280
Okay?

668
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,560
I'm sorry.

669
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:24,120
I'm sorry.

670
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:34,040
I should stay far away from you.

671
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,719
I should leave.

672
00:39:58,879 --> 00:39:59,879
Okay.

673
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,040
Sleep.

674
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,159
I'm leaving.

675
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:04,280
I won't show up again.

676
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,080
Take care of yourself—and Tiantian.

677
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:28,479
Don't rush to hit Bai Pengyu.

678
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,800
If you do,

679
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,679
make sure he never gets back up.

680
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,239
I know.

681
00:41:35,959 --> 00:41:37,639
I won't act rashly.

682
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,439
And...

683
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,679
about just now...

684
00:41:47,879 --> 00:41:49,320
it was an accident.

685
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,080
I won't read into it.

686
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,520
You're the gentleness in my eyes,

687
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,560
the immortal in my heart,

688
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,879
you are the reason I love this world...

689
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,439
the whole reason.

690
00:43:14,919 --> 00:43:16,159
Youyou...

691
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:18,840
it's so late, why are you calling?

692
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,520
Ms. Shi...

693
00:43:21,879 --> 00:43:24,080
didn't you say you'd set
me up with a boyfriend?

694
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:26,238
I'd like to meet him.

695
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:27,239
Oh?

696
00:43:27,613 --> 00:43:29,252
Finally willing to let go of the past?

697
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,199
I'm just afraid I'll

698
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,760
go back and live it again.

699
00:43:52,399 --> 00:43:53,878
In the crowd

700
00:43:53,879 --> 00:43:57,439
I was spotted in an instant

701
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,958
The desolation in your eyes

702
00:44:00,959 --> 00:44:04,119
Hiding the same fire inside

703
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,799
No need for words

704
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,120
No need to ask what's right or wrong

705
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,638
The moment we drew close

706
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:15,360
The outcome was already destined

707
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,040
Is the moth drawn to the light

708
00:44:26,879 --> 00:44:29,399
Or the whale sinking into the deep

709
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,519
With nothing but solitary courage

710
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,080
I wager it all on tomorrow

711
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,079
The walls of the world

712
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,360
What does it matter if I break them down

713
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,799
My chest burns with heat

714
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,000
Screaming only for you

715
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:50,799
I'll love you until it boils over

716
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,080
Loving without a care for the world

717
00:44:53,719 --> 00:44:54,839
Like two stars

718
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,840
Colliding and shattering in the night sky

719
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,040
Even if it's just for a moment

720
00:44:58,041 --> 00:44:59,638
It's more than enough to surpass forever

721
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:00,918
Hate and love both burn brightly

722
00:45:00,919 --> 00:45:03,599
Loving until the sky falls dark

723
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,560
Loving until we reach the end of the road

724
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,359
Before the altar

725
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,478
We burn all the incense

726
00:45:09,479 --> 00:45:10,559
Not asking for the next life

727
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,079
Only desiring this moment

728
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,279
Drowning together with you in

729
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,520
This blazing fire of fate
