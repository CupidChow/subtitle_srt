1
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:17,479
A wind that only seems gentle

2
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:22,440
Your gaze shimmers with a dark undertow

3
00:00:23,479 --> 00:00:28,119
Who is laughing at my madness

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,560
yet indulges my startled heart

5
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:38,959
I see through your mask

6
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:44,159
and let you probe my limits

7
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,758
It is I who indulge

8
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,400
Love blazes like fire

9
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,839
spreading

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,879
Hard to say who crossed the line first

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,758
and who is waiting for whom to yield

12
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,598
Sharing rouge-scented smoke

13
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,638
and the flame that collides at our lips

14
00:01:07,639 --> 00:01:10,000
fiercer than any tender lingering

15
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,838
a duel that stakes our pride

16
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:18,080
whether a calamity decreed by fate

17
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:23,319
or sweetness bestowed by heaven

18
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,638
I still choose craving, wrath, and folly's

19
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:30,278
mad notion

20
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:33,400
made real

21
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:40,719
To hold your gaze is far too perilous

22
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,838
I walk devoutly toward my ruin

23
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:54,839
You are my abyss

24
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,918
You are my

25
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:08,479
sunshine

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
"To My Shore"

27
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,759
Mr. Shi.

28
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,960
Lets have a drink.

29
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
The big star is
over there just sitting.

30
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,278
Why keep asking me to drink?

31
00:02:36,279 --> 00:02:36,960
Go cheers him.

32
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:38,160
We already did.

33
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:41,679
He gave us a smile and sent us back.

34
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,759
What's wrong, Xiao?

35
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,278
These girls are handpicked from all over
Thailand.

36
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:55,320
Top-shelf eye candy.

37
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,639
Men or women.

38
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,838
Boys, girls, and everything in between.

39
00:02:58,839 --> 00:03:01,520
All specially chosen to
celebrate your birthday.

40
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,960
Don't like them?

41
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,479
I do.

42
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:06,800
You went all out, Mr. Shi.

43
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:08,399
You do?

44
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,320
Then why hasn't your gaze left
your Director You, not even once?

45
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:15,799
If I didn't know the backstory,

46
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,360
I'd think you'd fallen for him.

47
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,479
Anyway...

48
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,398
he's also my gift to you.

49
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:24,399
Well?

50
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Do you like it?

51
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
Not bad.

52
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,639
I know you've switched teams,

53
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,918
so I gave you more choices.

54
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:33,600
The sea's big,
plenty of fish...

55
00:03:34,321 --> 00:03:35,478
time to try something new.

56
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,479
Right?

57
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,639
Hey, you...

58
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,039
another fresh round.

59
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:43,919
Mr. Shi.
They've arrived.

60
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:53,160
Happy birthday, President Fan!

61
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,479
Excuse me.

62
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,519
President Fan's in quite the mood tonight.

63
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,960
They're just clowning around.

64
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,720
Here—have a drink.

65
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,039
Anyone catch your eye?

66
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,800
Looks like the quality's pretty good.

67
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,880
All pretty good.

68
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,760
You're the birthday boy,

69
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,880
you pick first.

70
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,920
After you pick, I'll help
you test-drive the rest.

71
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:23,959
How do you “test drive”?

72
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,279
Director You...

73
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,600
President Fan really doesn't know how?

74
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,600
Then I'd better teach you properly tonight.

75
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,279
You...

76
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,519
Come here.

77
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,679
What kind of drink would
you like to have, sir?

78
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,799
I'll help you choose.

79
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:51,200
Pick what you like.

80
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,279
Here.

81
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,480
Let me give you a sip.

82
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
Professor You...

83
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,040
That's it?

84
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:16,600
No secret techniques from the vault?

85
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:22,559
Handsome...

86
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,839
you're up.

87
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,160
Then I'm adding ice, okay?

88
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,119
Might feel a little cold.

89
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,280
Since Teacher You is willing to teach,

90
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:59,239
let's switch to a better classroom.

91
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,239
Sure.

92
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,040
If you want to learn,

93
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,000
be good.

94
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:22,880
How is Teacher You going to teach me?

95
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,640
Hm.

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What...

97
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,040
Is President Fan jealous?

98
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:31,320
I'm willing to do anything,

99
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,279
but I don't do jealousy.

100
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,399
Right.

101
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,480
Our President Fan never gets jealous.

102
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:44,600
Happy birthday, babe.

103
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,760
Then teach me how to be happy.

104
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,920
All that stuff I just showed
you, did you catch any of it?

105
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,519
Come here.

106
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:15,519
What would you like to drink, sir?

107
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:17,559
Shulang.

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Mm?

109
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,640
Any requests, sir?

110
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:26,519
Whatever you like.

111
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,279
Teacher You's mixing is a little off.

112
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,040
It's too bland.

113
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,679
Someone needs to be punished.

114
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:14,480
How do you want to punish me?

115
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:26,799
Fan Xiao...

116
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,480
Your fiancée is here.

117
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,200
Don't stop, Teacher You.

118
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,479
Your fiancée's here!

119
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:38,520
Fan Xiao...

120
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,880
I don't have a fiancée.

121
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,159
Do you want me to keep away from her?

122
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,640
No.
Let's go.

123
00:08:48,401 --> 00:08:49,601
We'll go take a look together.

124
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:52,919
Wait.

125
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,798
This is the birthday gift
I've prepared for you.

126
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:06,799
It's not expensive.

127
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,080
Don't think too much of it.

128
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,559
I hope every moment of yours will be happy.

129
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
With you around,

130
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,080
Every moment is happy.

131
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,359
I love it.

132
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:32,559
I'll wear it all the time.

133
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,200
Maybe don't wear it all the time,

134
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,559
or your luxury watches will complain.

135
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,159
Let's go.

136
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:39,760
Go meet your “fiancée.”

137
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,919
I don't have a fiancée.

138
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,880
Whatever they say, don't believe it.

139
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,400
Okay.

140
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,000
(Episode 7)

141
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,479
Big brother, second brother...
Xiao's here.

142
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:05,159
See?

143
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,000
Bathroom breaks aren't that long.

144
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,239
Little third,

145
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,238
you've been gone seven or eight months,

146
00:10:17,239 --> 00:10:18,479
and never came to see us.

147
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,479
Since you wouldn't come back,

148
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,158
we bought tickets and flew over

149
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,559
to celebrate your birthday.

150
00:10:24,479 --> 00:10:26,239
Big bro, second bro...

151
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,640
why didn't you tell me you were coming?

152
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,376
I would've picked you up at the airport.

153
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,199
We wanted to surprise you,

154
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,679
So,

155
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,678
we had Uncle Xu pick us up.

156
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:36,999
You boys are grown men,

157
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,479
and still you play these games.

158
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,279
But seeing you close and affectionate,

159
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,400
I'll speak for the chairman
and say it makes me happy.

160
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:44,799
Xiao Xiao,

161
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,039
it's your birthday today.

162
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,919
Tingting insisted on coming to celebrate
as soon as she was discharged.

163
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,719
She took ages choosing your gift.

164
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,679
Xiao Xiao,

165
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,038
thank you for taking me to
Bangkok for medical treatment.

166
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,880
This is the present I chose for you.

167
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:09,359
You're too kind.

168
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:12,239
A Huo.

169
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:13,479
Here.

170
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:24,359
Xiao Xiao,

171
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,200
aren't you going to open Tingting's gift?

172
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:31,478
She said you often
visited her in the hospital...

173
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:32,559
you're so thoughtful.

174
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,559
She put a lot of heart
into choosing that gift.

175
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,559
Shulang...

176
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:41,960
Sit here.

177
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,200
Uncle Xu,

178
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:55,359
Tingting is like my own little sister.

179
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,280
Taking care of her is my duty.

180
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:58,719
As for the gifts...

181
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:00,239
There's too many.

182
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:02,479
Let me take my time and
go through them at home.

183
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,280
Look at thi...

184
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,840
Father sent us

185
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:14,479
to check on your investments.

186
00:12:15,119 --> 00:12:17,039
You haven't returned to
Singapore for so long...

187
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:18,400
Is it that…

188
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:21,000
you've lost so much
you can't afford airfare?

189
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:23,238
Big bro's just scaring you.

190
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:24,039
Father

191
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,358
only asked us to check in on you...

192
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:26,798
if there's business trouble,

193
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:27,799
let us help.

194
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,080
You know I'm useless at work,

195
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,280
but I can help you chase girls!

196
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,000
This should be to your taste, Shulang.

197
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:42,280
And this is...

198
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,079
Second bro, this is my...

199
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,280
Director You.

200
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,840
Right, right.

201
00:12:47,841 --> 00:12:49,159
I haven't introduced you...

202
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:50,839
This is my eldest brother, Fan Bo;

203
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,200
this is my second brother, Fan Yu.

204
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,640
You know Vice President Xu,

205
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:57,760
and by his side, his daughter Xu Ting.

206
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,080
Big bro, second bro...

207
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:01,799
this is

208
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,919
You Shulang, Office
Director of Bohai Pharma.

209
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,158
The drug we developed with Bohai

210
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,239
is about to hit the market.

211
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:08,280
Pleasure.

212
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,599
Pleasure, pleasure.

213
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,319
Since he's little third's friend,

214
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,200
we'll...
Fan Xiao...

215
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,159
Xu Ting is your fiancée.

216
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,199
The way you treated her just now...

217
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,039
where does that put
Father's years of friendship

218
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,080
with Uncle Xu?

219
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:24,936
Big bro, it seems like I'm not quite
understanding what you're saying.

220
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,000
Since when did Tingting become my fiancée?

221
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,080
She's a proper young lady...

222
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,799
If you say that,

223
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,719
you'll make her cry.

224
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:35,919
Little third...

225
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,679
you forgot?

226
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,840
Before you left home,

227
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,839
Father said if Tingting recovered,

228
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,960
you two would get engaged.

229
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,039
If you hadn't agreed,

230
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,439
would he have let you come back?

231
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:47,719
Director You...

232
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,400
how about we go play cards?

233
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,559
Let's go.
Don't go.

234
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,280
I only remember Father saying

235
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,798
if Miss Xu and I got along,

236
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,080
we could consider an engagement.

237
00:13:59,119 --> 00:14:00,280
Tingting is excellent;

238
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:02,679
my feelings for her are like family.

239
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:05,039
Speaking of which,

240
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,559
my casual chats with Father...

241
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,400
I've nearly forgotten them.

242
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:11,479
Big bro and second bro remember

243
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,039
even clearer than I do.

244
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:14,718
Matters of love...

245
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:15,918
I remember very well...

246
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:17,959
unlike big bro who only
remembers serious business.

247
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:19,599
Fan Xiao...

248
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,760
you know perfectly well what Father meant.

249
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,360
You know it in
your heart of hearts.

250
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,119
You think playing dumb

251
00:14:27,239 --> 00:14:28,880
letting you drag this out forever?

252
00:14:31,359 --> 00:14:32,599
If you don't want it to drag,

253
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,599
big bro can do it himself.

254
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:37,159
Didn't sister-in-law already run off?

255
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:38,239
It's best if you don't...
Fan Xiao...

256
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,119
You're going too far.

257
00:14:41,239 --> 00:14:42,239
Big bro, big bro...

258
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:43,200
Fan Xiao...

259
00:14:43,201 --> 00:14:44,280
Watch your mouth.

260
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,718
You know sister-in-law
is big bro's sore spot.

261
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:46,960
You...

262
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:49,280
why bring up what hurts?

263
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You...

264
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:54,479
Tingting...
He— they...

265
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,679
That's not what they meant.

266
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,880
Tingting...

267
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,799
Tingting!

268
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,038
My daughter...

269
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:02,039
is not a toy for your Fan family to bully.

270
00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:03,239
Uncle Xu...

271
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:03,840
Uncle Xu...
Don't go!

272
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,200
Uncle Xu...

273
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,320
This...

274
00:15:12,719 --> 00:15:13,719
Little third...

275
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,999
Xu Zhong loves stirring
the pot in front of Father.

276
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,200
Who knows what charge he'll pin on you.

277
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,039
You might as well

278
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,759
get engaged to Tingting first,

279
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,760
to appease Father.

280
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,759
With time,

281
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,038
you can go with the flow

282
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,599
and rethink it later.

283
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,679
Big bro,

284
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:32,079
little third is the youngest...

285
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,320
he'll say the wrong thing.

286
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,918
I'm more than sure he didn't
mean to bring up your divorce

287
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:38,200
just to rile you.

288
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:40,400
Today is his birthday.

289
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:42,478
Let it slide this once.

290
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:44,479
Let's have a proper drink.

291
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,239
If we're drinking,

292
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:48,999
let's take off the kid gloves.

293
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:52,719
Your big brother can really drink.

294
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,119
Was he a wine barrel in a past life?

295
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,599
Director You's definitely tipsy.

296
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:02,559
Cracking dad jokes already.

297
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:06,080
The room's spinning.

298
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:08,359
Let me lean for a second.

299
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:10,840
Director You...
Hm?

300
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,359
What are we, exactly,

301
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,736
that you'd throw yourself
in front of the bottle for me?

302
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,039
When he said that to you,

303
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,280
your face went white.

304
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,000
With your tolerance, at that point

305
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:27,479
you were already over the limit.

306
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:29,599
If I hadn't taken over,

307
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:32,200
you'd have drunk yourself under the table.

308
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,640
And your brothers wouldn't have to work
so hard to take you down.

309
00:16:36,719 --> 00:16:37,719
Here...

310
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,400
Drink.

311
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:42,599
That's right, little third.

312
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:45,159
Drink a few more with big bro.

313
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:45,799
Here.

314
00:16:46,359 --> 00:16:47,359
Drink.

315
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:48,719
Big bro, here.

316
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:53,200
I'll drink this one for President Fan.

317
00:16:53,719 --> 00:16:56,359
What gives you the
right to drink in his place?

318
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:58,918
President Fan has an important
meeting with us tomorrow...

319
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,279
tonight he shouldn't get hammered.

320
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,215
To ensure the project reaches
mass production and profitability quickly,

321
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:05,479
let me handle the rest of the drinks.

322
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,880
And let me take the chance

323
00:17:06,881 --> 00:17:09,239
to welcome you both back.

324
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,359
Hm.

325
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,559
Fair point.

326
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,319
All right.

327
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,679
Drink your fill.

328
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,680
Come on, come on.

329
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,800
I'm honored to host
the two President Fans...

330
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,959
bottoms up.

331
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,119
Your big brother hates you so openly,

332
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,959
but your second brother's malice

333
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,719
is far worse.

334
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,680
Sharp eyes, Director You.

335
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:40,000
You saw through that.

336
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:52,040
My big brother hates me to my face.

337
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:53,119
Fan Yu hates me

338
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,560
from every dark corner.

339
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:59,640
Like hands in the shadows,

340
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:04,560
waiting for the moment to drag me down.

341
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,560
Honestly, I envy big bro's kind...

342
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:11,399
straightforward in temper,

343
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,760
love and hate

344
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,599
all out on the table.

345
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:19,359
Unlike us...

346
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:27,479
Us…

347
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,920
Me and Fan Yu...

348
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,199
we're the same.

349
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,239
Our true thoughts are buried deep.

350
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,760
Fake as hell.

351
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,760
Are we fake too?

352
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:43,920
With you, it's all real.

353
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:46,959
It couldn't be more real.

354
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,560
Damn you, Zhang Chi!
Hey...

355
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,718
Touch me again

356
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:52,559
and I'll kill your whole family!

357
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,118
You sick freak, Zhang Chi!

358
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:55,159
If I don't castrate you,

359
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,079
I'm not Xue Baotian!

360
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,599
Xue Baotian...
Don't touch me!

361
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:00,920
Back off, I'm warning you!

362
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,719
After we beat him up last time,

363
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,520
someone scooped him up.

364
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,119
They've been tangled for a while.

365
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,400
Big bro...

366
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,598
Could it be that guy?

367
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:14,599
Don't move!

368
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:19,520
Zhang Chi, put me down!

369
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:22,040
Fan Xiao...
Fan Xiao!

370
00:19:22,921 --> 00:19:27,079
Director You—
He's going to harvest my kidney!

371
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,039
Put me down!

372
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,880
Should we help?

373
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:32,679
I'm drunk.

374
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,599
I'm not getting involved
in a lovers quarrel.

375
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,479
I'm drunk too.

376
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,560
Director...

377
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:51,640
Do you think we offended Mr. Xue
of Ruixiang Pharmacies somehow?

378
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,959
They're stirring trouble again.

379
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,479
Pulling all our nearly
expired stock and returning it.

380
00:19:57,199 --> 00:19:59,799
Normally it's three months before
that they get pulled from the shelves,

381
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,198
but they're pulling stock with 6 months
left,

382
00:20:02,199 --> 00:20:03,640
plus the ones we're promoting.

383
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,198
Sales says

384
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:07,118
that the pull order

385
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:08,800
was personally given by Young Mr. Xue.

386
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,440
They told us to ask you the reason.

387
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:11,639
And

388
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,079
Director Liu is also
waiting for instructions.

389
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,239
I'll handle it.

390
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:20,719
Send me the list of products pulled and the
related product documentation now.

391
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,119
Hello?

392
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,238
I'm exhausted.

393
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:30,838
Fan Yu's acting CFO now...

394
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:32,160
he never does real work.

395
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,920
As soon as we're off,
he calls meetings to review the books.

396
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:38,319
I'm running out of patience to play nice.

397
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,560
Working late again today?

398
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,279
Just wrapped.

399
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,199
Maybe they saw how bad I looked

400
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:46,719
and finished early.

401
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,776
You don't need to come
to my place tonight...

402
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,560
No.

403
00:20:50,561 --> 00:20:51,599
Don't say it.

404
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:52,719
I won't agree.

405
00:20:53,479 --> 00:20:55,599
These days, only when I see you

406
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,920
when I'm holding you

407
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,640
do I feel alive.

408
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:00,679
I mean...

409
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,599
I'm at your place now.

410
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,319
What?

411
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,680
You're at my place?

412
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,039
You work late every day

413
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,718
and still drive across
half the city to mine...

414
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:09,479
that's such a pain.

415
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,919
So I came to yours instead.

416
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,560
It's closer to your office...

417
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,479
it'll save you time morning and night.

418
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,680
So that means I get to see you right away?

419
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,280
Drive safe.

420
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,160
I still have some work to handle.

421
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:21,880
Okay.

422
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
See you soon.

423
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,598
I need to handle Xue Baotian

424
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,319
before Fan Xiao gets back,

425
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:53,719
so he doesn't get distracted.

426
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:58,199
Those two brothers of his
already give him enough grief.

427
00:22:05,943 --> 00:22:07,263
(You Shulang)

428
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,000
He's probably driving.

429
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,800
I'll leave a message.

430
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,040
So many missed calls and
messages from Shulang.

431
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:42,478
Fan Xiao, I'm just calling you

432
00:22:42,479 --> 00:22:43,640
to say

433
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:46,680
I checking my email
on your computer for a moment.

434
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,119
The computer?!

435
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,120
You didn't even set a password.

436
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,880
Shulang...

437
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,280
It's so dark in here.

438
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,199
Why not open the curtains?

439
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,680
You'd better not touch me.

440
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,239
What's wrong—why so mad?

441
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,319
Did I mess up?

442
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:45,359
Fan Xiao...

443
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,239
Don't play dumb.

444
00:23:48,239 --> 00:23:49,839
I'm only giving you one chance.

445
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:51,880
He must've found out.

446
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:53,719
He always means what he says.

447
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:56,800
You know I always mean what I say.

448
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,239
Lying now will only make it worse.

449
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,400
You know the cost of lying.

450
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,920
Better to tell the truth.

451
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,920
It shouldn't be that serious.

452
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,359
You saw that dash-cam clip?

453
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,000
I found it while sorting files.

454
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,815
I didn't have the heart to delete it.

455
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:21,640
When I miss you

456
00:24:21,641 --> 00:24:22,680
and you're not around,

457
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,560
I take a look.

458
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,358
If you don't like it,

459
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:28,760
I'll delete it.

460
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,560
Forgive me.

461
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:32,119
Director You...

462
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:34,719
Fan Xiao...

463
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,920
Then tell me:

464
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,719
When did you “find” that video?

465
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,479
Recently.

466
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,760
Yeah, recently.

467
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:44,479
After we got together?

468
00:24:45,239 --> 00:24:46,239
Probably.

469
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,520
Fan Xiao...

470
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:52,119
I checked the playback log.

471
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,958
After it was uploaded to your terminal,

472
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:56,479
it was often played.

473
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,999
The earliest replay

474
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,199
was two hours after it was recorded.

475
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Explain to my why you open
it every night from that day on?

476
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,600
Don't you dare say you
already liked me then.

477
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:13,520
Save that crap.

478
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:16,359
Even if you don't let
me speak, I have to.

479
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,719
I stumbled on that clip by accident.

480
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:22,719
At first I just glanced,

481
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:24,800
but I couldn't stop.

482
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,119
It was like a magnet,

483
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,479
pulling me in every minute of the day.

484
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:34,239
Each time it sparked endless desire.

485
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:36,520
I despised myself for it.

486
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,000
You were my best friend.

487
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:40,040
How could I secretly

488
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:41,800
lust after my friend constantly?

489
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
For a while,

490
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,280
I didn't dare see you.

491
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,199
When I did, I couldn't meet your gaze...

492
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,479
it felt like a desecration.

493
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,879
But every time I resolved

494
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,560
to delete it,

495
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,719
I hesitated so much.

496
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,839
I even recovered it from the
deleted files so many times.

497
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:05,040
I can't explain

498
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:06,599
why I did that...

499
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,159
why only watching that video of you

500
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,560
could spark that feeling.

501
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,479
Looking back,

502
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,199
I'd already fallen for you.

503
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:18,839
Fan Xiao...

504
00:26:19,199 --> 00:26:21,119
We'd known each other one month.

505
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,136
Where would that feeling of love come from?

506
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,160
And besides...

507
00:26:24,479 --> 00:26:26,199
Weren't you straight then?

508
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:28,759
No way one video made you switch teams.

509
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,400
Who wrote the rules?

510
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,559
Who says within a month

511
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,680
you can't fall for someone?

512
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,760
If I'd really been that straight back then,

513
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,920
how would I be in your bed now?

514
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:40,839
Director You...

515
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,040
Your video ruined a straight man.

516
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,880
Shouldn't you take responsibility?

517
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:50,719
Nonsense.

518
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:52,959
Fan Xiao...

519
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:55,719
I never saw you dodge my gaze,

520
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:58,359
or feel your helplessness or guilt.

521
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,479
Don't make yourself look
good by saying things like that.

522
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:04,119
You're a fucking a pervert.

523
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,880
If Director You says I am, I am.

524
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:13,199
I know I was wrong.

525
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,159
I just watched

526
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,560
my boyfriend's adult video early, that's
all...

527
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,599
all I did was see it early.

528
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:22,479
Hardly a capital offense.

529
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:24,119
Director You...

530
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,359
If only I knew he'd be like this earlier,

531
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,479
shameless,

532
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:27,920
wriggling and whining.

533
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:37,000
You only watched mine?

534
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,640
You never recorded anyone else?

535
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,680
Only yours.

536
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,400
Can I believe you?

537
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,959
I'm not lying—about this.

538
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:45,359
“About this,” huh?

539
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,839
I haven't forgiven you yet.

540
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,760
Then what do you want, Director You?

541
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,479
The video was exciting, right?

542
00:27:58,599 --> 00:27:59,880
Then record one for me too.

543
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,160
Start.

544
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:15,839
Everything off?

545
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:17,880
All of it.

546
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,400
It turns out Director
You has a kink like this.

547
00:28:44,719 --> 00:28:45,719
Stop.

548
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:53,680
Where are you looking, Director You?

549
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,160
Seems like

550
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:59,560
you're more interested in my hand.

551
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,000
Do you want it

552
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,199
touching me,

553
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,319
or touching you?

554
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,560
Fan Xiao...

555
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,280
If you behave,

556
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,400
you'll be the only one in my dreams.

557
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,040
Right...

558
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:25,760
I'm right by your car.

559
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:29,479
Here.

560
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,800
Director You...

561
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:35,239
Not glued to Fan Xiao today...

562
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:36,359
what do you want with me?

563
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,679
I came to apologize to you, Mr. Xue,

564
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,680
to offer my apology.

565
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,280
Hey...

566
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,560
Don't.

567
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,760
I can't afford that.

568
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:47,119
Say, Mr. You...

569
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,359
You moved mountains to
rescue a hostess, and yet...

570
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:53,479
when it's me, you close your eyes
and let me die? Don't I deserve saving?

571
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,040
Isn't my fortune worth it?

572
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,880
A hostess?

573
00:29:59,479 --> 00:30:00,479
What hostess?

574
00:30:07,479 --> 00:30:09,160
Fan Xiao slept with you, didn't he?

575
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:14,000
I guess I guessed right?

576
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,319
No wonder he's changed...

577
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,496
clinging to you like a
bodhisattva on an altar.

578
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,520
Kept and worshipped.

579
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:26,199
Someone like you can get topped?

580
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,999
Guess it's not that I'm bad with women...

581
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,239
Since that bastard Zhang Chi

582
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:35,400
did me,

583
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:37,640
I can't even flirt right.

584
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:39,119
Director You...

585
00:30:39,479 --> 00:30:41,071
do you have the same problem?

586
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,719
What did you need today?

587
00:30:49,199 --> 00:30:51,560
The Bohai pharma thing, right?

588
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,839
Yes—I wanted to ask about those returns.

589
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,200
I've got some questions about how they've
been handled.

590
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,559
It's nothing...

591
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,000
just going through the motions.

592
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:00,880
From now on,

593
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:02,279
stock them if needed,

594
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,280
promote them if needed.

595
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:05,520
If anything comes up, find me directly.

596
00:31:09,719 --> 00:31:10,520
Okay.

597
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,319
Thank you for cutting us some slack.

598
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,760
It's nothing.

599
00:31:15,199 --> 00:31:18,199
From today we're brothers in misery...

600
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:19,239
on the same side.

601
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,400
And listen...

602
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:22,160
about Fan Xiao...

603
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,040
let me think how to say this…

604
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,759
Money, cars,

605
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,760
housing—ask for what you want.

606
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:30,640
He's loaded anyway.

607
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Hello?

608
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:36,919
Why rush me?

609
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,920
I just stepped out.

610
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,239
Okay, okay.
Got it, got it.

611
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:41,079
I'm coming back now.

612
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,599
Mr. Xue...

613
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,079
Hm?

614
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:46,479
That hostess you mentioned...

615
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:48,359
I rescued a hostess?

616
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:49,599
Um…

617
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:51,399
What hostess?

618
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,199
You misheard.

619
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,400
I'm off.

620
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:55,719
That bastard Zhang Chi…

621
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,959
Anyway...
keep your eyes open.

622
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:02,479
I'm going.

623
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:04,319
Bye.

624
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,839
A hostess…

625
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:14,239
Sir...

626
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,478
we've got all types of girls.

627
00:32:16,479 --> 00:32:18,479
What's your preference?

628
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,640
One moment.

629
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:26,079
Hello?

630
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:28,040
I have to work late today.

631
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:30,000
I'll be back late.

632
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,280
He looks upright and clean;
I thought he was decent.

633
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,640
Hah...

634
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:35,839
it turns out,

635
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,479
men are all the same,

636
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,199
lying through their teeth to sneak around.

637
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:42,280
Eat first—don't wait up.

638
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:44,079
Mm.

639
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,919
What type do you like?

640
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,479
I'll bring them in for you to choose.

641
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,839
Fresh-faced,

642
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,719
like recent college grads.

643
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:54,520
Bring that type.

644
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,119
Sure—one moment.

645
00:32:59,959 --> 00:33:00,999
Ladies, come with me.

646
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,040
Come in.

647
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:13,239
Greet the gentleman.

648
00:33:13,719 --> 00:33:15,880
Good evening, sir.

649
00:33:16,239 --> 00:33:17,119
Mr. You...

650
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,560
Pick whoever you like.

651
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:21,040
This one stays.
Okay.

652
00:33:21,479 --> 00:33:23,119
The rest can go.

653
00:33:23,199 --> 00:33:24,999
Enjoy your night.

654
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,800
Go on, go on.

655
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,280
Tang Xiaowan...

656
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,040
That was the name you used that night,
right?

657
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,560
I remember you.

658
00:33:39,719 --> 00:33:41,719
You're one of the few good people I've met.

659
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,400
I thought you were stupid then...

660
00:33:44,479 --> 00:33:47,040
Is it worth it for someone who you don't
know at all?

661
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:53,119
Do what you can.

662
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,880
If I can help, I will.

663
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,839
If I really can't,

664
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,119
I won't force it.

665
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,800
You came to ask something, didn't you?

666
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,160
Yes.

667
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,479
Who was making a fool of me that
night?

668
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,760
You only realized now were were made a
fool?

669
00:34:15,959 --> 00:34:17,360
You're such a dope.

670
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,080
You know

671
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,080
in our line of work, we keep our mouths
shut,

672
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,120
or we don't eat.

673
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,320
I know.

674
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:26,959
I understand.

675
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,080
I don't know how much

676
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,639
it would take for you to tell me what you
know...

677
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,679
You still look down on us, huh?

678
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,679
Buy me a lollipop and I'll tell you.

679
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:49,520
What made you be the only
good one I've met since I started?

680
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:08,239
Hello?
Shulang...

681
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,280
why aren't you back yet?

682
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:13,479
I kept calling but there was no answer.

683
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,080
I'm fine.

684
00:35:15,479 --> 00:35:16,999
I talked to Xue Baotian today

685
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,760
about stocking items near their expiry
date.

686
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:20,479
He let it slide.

687
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,159
I handled the follow-up quickly.

688
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:25,080
Where are you? I'll pick you up.

689
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,600
No need.

690
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,320
I'm heading back.

691
00:35:30,919 --> 00:35:31,919
Fan Xiao...

692
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,080
Xue helped a lot this time.

693
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:35,520
I should show some thanks.

694
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,520
I'm thinking of inviting him out.

695
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:42,039
Your reputation carries weight...

696
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,959
call a couple of his friends
to join.

697
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,840
Sure.

698
00:35:45,841 --> 00:35:47,320
Whatever you say.

699
00:35:48,399 --> 00:35:49,959
I'm used to sleeping while holding you.

700
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,560
Without you, I can't settle.

701
00:35:53,399 --> 00:35:54,399
Okay.

702
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,839
How did I lose again?

703
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,520
I never win with you guys.

704
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:12,959
Then it's on me.

705
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,959
I brought Mr. Xue out to cheer you up.

706
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:17,959
Happy, happy—very happy.

707
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:20,239
Quite happy.

708
00:36:20,399 --> 00:36:22,519
As long as I'm not with that bastard Zhang
Chi,

709
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,719
I'm extra happy.

710
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,198
Girls, booze, brothers...

711
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:28,918
that's what life's really about.

712
00:36:28,919 --> 00:36:30,000
Mr. Xue...

713
00:36:30,879 --> 00:36:33,520
thanks for your continued
support of Bohai Pharma.

714
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,159
Cheers.

715
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,560
You're too polite.

716
00:36:36,479 --> 00:36:38,600
President Fan, join us!

717
00:36:39,919 --> 00:36:40,159
Come on.
Sure, I'll keep you company.

718
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,119
Bottoms up!

719
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:42,520
Let's drink together.
Drink up!

720
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,520
Let's keep going!

721
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,678
I don't believe I can't win tonight.

722
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:54,919
Keep going!

723
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,760
Just drinking when you lose is boring.

724
00:37:02,919 --> 00:37:06,360
How about we raise the stakes?

725
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:08,479
Make it exciting.

726
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,560
Director You...

727
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,320
you're growing on me.

728
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,359
Play— the wilder the better.

729
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,360
How do we play?

730
00:37:18,919 --> 00:37:19,679
President Fan...
Are you joining?

731
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,120
If you want, I'll join you.

732
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,520
Your call.

733
00:37:34,399 --> 00:37:38,080
One of these glasses has something extra.

734
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,479
The loser picks one at random.

735
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,080
What you drink...

736
00:37:44,919 --> 00:37:46,199
is up to fate.

737
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,040
Xiao...

738
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,360
Director You is joking.

739
00:38:07,399 --> 00:38:08,478
Don't you know him...

740
00:38:08,479 --> 00:38:09,879
he's the most law-abiding.

741
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,600
After drinking,

742
00:38:11,601 --> 00:38:13,919
he won't even drive in his own courtyard.

743
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,840
He wouldn't play that.

744
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,560
He's teasing you.

745
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:25,760
Now's not the time to take Xue down.

746
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,520
You think I'm taking him down?

747
00:38:29,479 --> 00:38:30,479
What else?

748
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,800
He's a jerk,

749
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:34,840
but it really isn't the right time.

750
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:39,080
Is he the only jerk?

751
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:41,479
None of them are good people.

752
00:38:41,879 --> 00:38:43,320
They made a clown of you.

753
00:38:43,959 --> 00:38:44,959
All of them?

754
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,760
I remember

755
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:53,040
the man with the Buddha pendant.

756
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,919
He didn't say much,

757
00:38:55,479 --> 00:38:57,760
but I think he knew.

758
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,080
You sure?

759
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,560
Not a hundred percent.

760
00:39:04,479 --> 00:39:07,320
But you should know, that
women's intuition is sharp.

761
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:09,919
He didn't act on the surface,

762
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,679
but he's definitely no good.

763
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,080
Good man,

764
00:39:21,879 --> 00:39:23,080
you can't touch them.

765
00:39:23,919 --> 00:39:25,760
They're rich bastards.

766
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,959
Don't think about revenge.

767
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,199
Stay away.

768
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:38,239
Mr. Xue...

769
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:43,520
That “female subordinate”
last time was fake, right?

770
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,239
Hired to mess with me.

771
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,840
But the spiked drink was real.

772
00:40:02,479 --> 00:40:04,800
When you watched me down that glass,

773
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,958
was it fun?

774
00:40:08,959 --> 00:40:10,360
Exciting?

775
00:40:10,919 --> 00:40:12,159
หุบปากได้แล้ว. (Shut your mouths.)

776
00:40:17,879 --> 00:40:18,879
Sorry...

777
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:21,879
I slipped into Thai in
the heat of the moment.

778
00:40:23,399 --> 00:40:24,560
Mr. Xue...

779
00:40:25,479 --> 00:40:27,479
Director You still minds what happened.

780
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,199
Why don't you explain what
was going on that night...

781
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,280
Clear the air,

782
00:40:34,919 --> 00:40:36,256
and there'll be no misunderstanding.

783
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,280
Um… I...

784
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:41,040
What are you sitting for?

785
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:42,319
Grab a bottle.

786
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,320
Yeah.

787
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,120
Director You...

788
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:50,159
I'm the one who messed with you.

789
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:53,040
I don't like you.

790
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:56,040
I think you're using Fan Xiao.

791
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,520
And you put on airs...

792
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,479
you make him worship you.

793
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:10,279
That night Second Young Master Xue
and I were teasing you...

794
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,280
just a joke.

795
00:41:11,479 --> 00:41:12,760
He meant no harm...

796
00:41:13,479 --> 00:41:14,520
but I did.

797
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,120
Even now I still can't stand you.

798
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,839
Do you know how much Fan
Xiao spent on your brother?

799
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,559
Isn't that what you're after?

800
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,000
Shi Lihua, you've gone too far.

801
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,560
We're leaving.

802
00:41:32,399 --> 00:41:33,840
Now's not the time to keep talking.

803
00:41:57,479 --> 00:41:58,479
Fan Xiao...

804
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,879
Did you take part in messing with me?

805
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:04,479
Why would I mess with you?

806
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,280
I protected you all night.

807
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,520
Did you forget?

808
00:42:10,399 --> 00:42:11,800
Then why are you nervous?

809
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:13,679
Nervous?

810
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:17,800
I'm just worried you'll fall out with Xue

811
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,719
and he'll stir up trouble.

812
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,840
Fan Xiao...

813
00:42:22,479 --> 00:42:23,479
Do you know...

814
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:27,000
this spot

815
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,719
behind your ear...

816
00:42:29,479 --> 00:42:31,399
when you're terrified,

817
00:42:31,959 --> 00:42:33,638
it twitches uncontrollably.

818
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:34,959
When you hear waves,

819
00:42:35,959 --> 00:42:37,080
when you see the sea,

820
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:38,560
in nightmares...
it does that.

821
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,879
It twitched three times tonight.

822
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,320
Don't say you're afraid
of Xue making trouble.

823
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,800
That level of trouble

824
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,360
isn't enough to rattle you, is it?

825
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:53,639
President Fan...

826
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,879
That's how Director You deems to judge me?

827
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:03,479
Yes.

828
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,560
I don't have proof,

829
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,679
but I feel awful.

830
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,600
Fan Xiao...

831
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:20,120
Let's not see each other for a while.

832
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,599
In the crowd

833
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:39,159
I was spotted in an instant

834
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,678
The desolation in your eyes

835
00:43:42,679 --> 00:43:45,839
Hiding the same fire inside

836
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,519
No need for words

837
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,840
No need to ask whats right or wrong

838
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,359
The moment we drew close

839
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,080
The outcome was already destined

840
00:44:05,239 --> 00:44:07,760
Is the moth drawn to the light

841
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,120
Or the whale sinking into the deep

842
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:13,238
With nothing but solitary courage

843
00:44:13,239 --> 00:44:15,800
I wager it all on tomorrow

844
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,799
The walls of the world

845
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,080
What does it matter if I break them down

846
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:26,519
My chest burns with heat

847
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,719
Screaming only for you

848
00:44:29,879 --> 00:44:32,519
I'll love you until it boils over

849
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,800
Loving without a care for the world

850
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:36,559
Like two stars

851
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,560
Colliding and shattering in the night sky

852
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,760
Even if it's just for a moment

853
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:41,359
It's more than enough to surpass forever

854
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,638
Hate and love both burn brightly

855
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:45,319
Loving until the sky falls dark

856
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,280
Loving until we reach the end of the road

857
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,079
Before the altar

858
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,198
We burn all the incense

859
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:52,279
Not asking for the next life

860
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,799
Only desiring this moment

861
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,999
Drowning together with you in

862
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,239
This blazing fire of fate
