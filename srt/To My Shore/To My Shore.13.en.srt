1
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:17,479
A wind that only seems gentle

2
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:22,440
Your gaze shimmers with a dark undertow

3
00:00:23,479 --> 00:00:28,119
Who is laughing at my madness

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,560
yet indulges my startled heart

5
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:38,959
I see through your mask

6
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:44,159
and let you probe my limits

7
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,758
It is I who indulge

8
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,400
Love blazes like fire

9
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,839
spreading

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,879
Hard to say who crossed the line first

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,758
and who is waiting for whom to yield

12
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,598
Sharing rouge-scented smoke

13
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,638
and the flame that collides at our lips

14
00:01:07,639 --> 00:01:10,000
fiercer than any tender lingering

15
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,838
a duel that stakes our pride

16
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:18,080
whether a calamity decreed by fate

17
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:23,319
or sweetness bestowed by heaven

18
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,638
I still choose craving, wrath, and folly's

19
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:30,278
mad notion

20
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:33,400
made real

21
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:40,719
To hold your gaze is far too perilous

22
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,838
I walk devoutly toward my ruin

23
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:54,839
You are my abyss

24
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,918
You are my

25
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:08,479
sunshine

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,999
"To My Shore"
(Episode 13)

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,039
Our product is now
confirmed in four formats.

28
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:20,039
However,

29
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:21,720
This optimization really

30
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,038
needs to be quickly refined

31
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,639
by leveraging our product advantages.

32
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:25,679
Especially

33
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:26,919
the children's version,

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,399
which is our main product this quarter.

35
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,559
The latest sorted materials.

36
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,920
Thank you, everyone, for your hard work.

37
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:43,999
Thank you for all your hard work.

38
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:50,039
Everyone, please stop what you're doing.

39
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,800
Our project

40
00:02:52,119 --> 00:02:53,119
succeeded.

41
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,639
A success!

42
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,039
Great!

43
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,120
Thank you all for your efforts.

44
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,560
Thank you all for your efforts.

45
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
Great!

46
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,880
Let me take a look.
Look, look.

47
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:03,639
I told you it was possible.

48
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,639
Awesome!

49
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,039
Really good.

50
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,119
We finally did it.

51
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:10,519
When we first started the experiment,

52
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,320
never imagined it would be so quick.
Professor Huang.

53
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,000
The internal tests have passed.

54
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,639
We can proceed to submission.

55
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,880
Okay.

56
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:18,119
Shulang

57
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:20,080
I knew you could do it.

58
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,039
President Fan.

59
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,800
The internal tests are done.

60
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,119
We can prepare the final payment.

61
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,080
You Shulang.

62
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,639
How's he doing?

63
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,119
He's doing very well now.

64
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,960
Just like you envisioned,

65
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,879
once he's immersed in R&D,

66
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,440
he has a new foundation to support him.

67
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,160
Looking at him now,

68
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:51,160
he's back to his old self, shining.

69
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,960
And where is he now...?

70
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,320
He said

71
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:56,399
he'll go home once the wrap-up is done.

72
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,279
Home.

73
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,360
Finally, it's over.

74
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,320
Xiao Tian.

75
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,519
You scared me!

76
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,360
I'm happy!

77
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,839
Are you not happy, Brother Zhou?

78
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:10,880
I am.

79
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,216
I've practically been living
at the plant for the past while.

80
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,960
If I don't go back soon,

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,479
my daughter won't recognize me.

82
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,399
I promised her.
Once the project's done,

83
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:19,535
I'd take her to the amusement park
for a whole day of fun.

84
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,279
I'm leaving now.
Goodbye, Brother Zhou.

85
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,799
Xiao You.
Xiao Li

86
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm leaving now.
Goodbye, Brother Zhou.

87
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,880
See you.

88
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,678
I've also promised my girlfriend

89
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:28,959
to spend her birthday with her.

90
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,079
I was afraid of a delay.

91
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:31,600
Luckily, we finished early.

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,640
I'm going to eat like a pig.

93
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,519
I lost my appetite with how busy I've been.

94
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:36,679
Exactly.

95
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,200
You, Brother You.

96
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,600
What are you planning to do?

97
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,920
Me?

98
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,279
I...

99
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,239
Brother You,
what are you thinking?

100
00:04:47,239 --> 00:04:48,239
Nothing.

101
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,160
Sleep.

102
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:51,159
I'm going to sleep for
three days and nights.

103
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,118
What I think is, we really
owe it to You this time.

104
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:55,798
You had to manage all the departments,

105
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:57,118
plus take on some hands-on tasks.

106
00:04:57,119 --> 00:04:58,000
Nonstop.

107
00:04:58,001 --> 00:05:01,399
If it wasn't for You, we wouldn't have
finished this so efficiently. Not a chance.

108
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:03,639
As expected of my idol,

109
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,959
he's handsome and capable.

110
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,200
Stop fangirling.

111
00:05:06,201 --> 00:05:07,359
Stop bothering me.

112
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:08,200
It's time to clock out.
Let's go.

113
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,519
Brother You.
You're not leaving?

114
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,399
I'll stay a bit.

115
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,480
You guys head out first.

116
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:14,839
Okay.
Goodbye, Brother You.

117
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,239
We'll head out first.

118
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,518
We've been so busy these days

119
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:19,159
that we've lost touch with the world.

120
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,000
Dead tired.

121
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,399
Let's go.

122
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:37,799
Where're you going?

123
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,679
You take your time.

124
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,480
The Garden District.

125
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:47,799
Okay.

126
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,079
Bai Ting, are you free?

127
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:52,119
I'm passing by your place.

128
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,040
Only if it's not a bother,

129
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,279
let's grab a bite.

130
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:18,959
Bai Ting.

131
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:21,040
Thanks for helping me this time.

132
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,320
If you need it,

133
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,959
I can introduce you to a new job.

134
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,399
No need.

135
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,078
I'm used to this line of work now.

136
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,880
It doesn't gross me out like before.

137
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,239
I want to make real money.

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Buy a place.

139
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,600
Buy a car.

140
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:42,640
And never depend on anyone again.

141
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,600
Money means strength.

142
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,320
It means control over your fate.

143
00:06:59,102 --> 00:07:00,934
[Looking at the no-response from Bai Ting]

144
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,399
Who?

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,559
Are you Bai Ting's friend?

146
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,720
I am.

147
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:23,200
Isn't she home?

148
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:24,919
I don't know where she is.

149
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,239
I was going to ask you.

150
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,960
What happened to Bai Ting?

151
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,679
I don't know.

152
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,799
A couple of days ago at the club,

153
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,600
she got a call.

154
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,639
She looked rattled.

155
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,399
She hurried home.

156
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,079
Then we lost contact.

157
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,799
She disappeared into thin air.

158
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:45,040
All her stuff is still here.

159
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,359
Have you asked her other friends?

160
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,079
Bai Ting doesn't have many friends.

161
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,239
Then.

162
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,519
Do you know who called her?

163
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:57,640
Has anything unusual happened recently?

164
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,119
The call...

165
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:01,920
Not sure who it was.

166
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,040
Anything unusual?

167
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:06,040
I don't know if this counts.

168
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,479
There was a guy before.

169
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,160
He booked a huge room.

170
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:11,239
He specifically requested only her.

171
00:08:11,581 --> 00:08:14,279
But didn't stay long before he left.

172
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,798
Ordered expensive booze.

173
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:17,119
Didn't touch a drop.

174
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,679
What kind of guy?

175
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,399
He was tall and handsome.

176
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,119
He had good manners.

177
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,959
Any distinct features?

178
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,200
Nothing special.

179
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,160
Oh, wait...

180
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,000
He lit his smokes with matches.

181
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,159
Doesn't everyone use lighters now?

182
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,760
You Shulang.

183
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,239
You've really come back.

184
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,598
The old you has truly returned.

185
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:28,599
I missed you so much.

186
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:29,200
These past months,
I can't even imagine

187
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:31,359
how I managed to survive.

188
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,736
I went to the places
we used to visit together.

189
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,320
I watched the movies we used to watch.

190
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:38,200
I even learned a few new Thai dishes.

191
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,559
You'll definitely like them.

192
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,919
You haven't had dinner yet, right?

193
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,200
I'll cook for you.

194
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,359
But those dishes take a bit of time.

195
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,080
Let me think.

196
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,840
I'll make you some
seafood pineapple fried rice.

197
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,359
You go rest in your room first.

198
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,760
I'll be right there.

199
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,119
Fan Xiao.

200
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:00,239
I came here today to ask you a few things.

201
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:03,479
The project is about to finish.

202
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,238
Are you planning something again?

203
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:06,960
New ways to threaten me?

204
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,640
What do you mean?

205
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,520
Did you meet with Bai Ting?

206
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,118
Now, Changling Pharma

207
00:10:22,119 --> 00:10:23,840
no longer has any leverage on you.

208
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,800
My brother has received
the punishment he deserves.

209
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,479
So now you're thinking about her?

210
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,479
You Shulang.

211
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:34,119
What?

212
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,400
Where is Bai Ting?

213
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,039
So,

214
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,920
You came here today to
question me about this?

215
00:10:41,193 --> 00:10:42,953
Is this what you came to ask me about?

216
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,479
Between us,

217
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,559
what else is there to talk about?

218
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,799
Where did you hide Bai Ting?

219
00:10:58,359 --> 00:11:00,760
All I feel now when I see you is disgust.

220
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,799
No other feelings.

221
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,679
I don't know.

222
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,400
How you survived these past three months,

223
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:08,960
But these past three months for me,

224
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:12,119
have been the easiest of my life.

225
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:16,280
Life without you has been blissful.

226
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,039
It's been wonderful.

227
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,479
Fan Xiao

228
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:23,599
I don't want to argue with you today.

229
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:24,799
Just tell me

230
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,513
where is Bai Ting?

231
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:27,400
She's dead.

232
00:11:27,401 --> 00:11:28,640
Bai Ting is dead.

233
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,119
She didn't have to die.

234
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:31,320
She forced me.

235
00:11:31,321 --> 00:11:32,520
You forced me.

236
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,559
What did you do?

237
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,760
What did I do?

238
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,039
You Shulang.

239
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:42,559
You have too many weaknesses.

240
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:43,919
Bai Ting.

241
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,159
Huang Qimin.

242
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,719
And your troublesome brother,

243
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:49,840
they are all your weak spots.

244
00:11:50,267 --> 00:11:51,987
Don't think that without them...

245
00:11:52,393 --> 00:11:54,273
I have no way to deal with you.

246
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:57,320
I want to keep you by my side.

247
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,599
Your foster mother's spirit in heaven

248
00:12:01,073 --> 00:12:03,073
will bless me.

249
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,000
Fan Xiao.

250
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,679
She's already resting in peace.

251
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,200
What more do you want to do?

252
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,719
Are you even human?

253
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:14,320
In your eyes,

254
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,559
wasn't I already a devil to you?

255
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,400
Fan Xiao.

256
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:26,719
You are indeed a devil.

257
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,559
But don't devils have soft spots?

258
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:36,239
This

259
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,799
is proof of your crimes.

260
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:40,640
You guys evaded taxes,

261
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,119
bribed officials,

262
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:44,880
which of these wouldn't
land you in prison for years?

263
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,599
This

264
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:50,376
was your big brother's way of using illegal
methods to pressure your sister-in-law.

265
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,320
Using illegal methods

266
00:12:51,321 --> 00:12:53,641
is proof of suppressing his
father's company through crime.

267
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:55,359
And this

268
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,919
was your father's criminal evidence.

269
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,280
He was making and
selling counterfeit products.

270
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,799
These are drugs.

271
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,320
They are critical to living.

272
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:05,559
And he still dared to fake them.

273
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:08,559
So,

274
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,520
what do you want to do?

275
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:16,919
As long as I hit send,

276
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:18,559
You

277
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,280
and your entire family's criminal evidence

278
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:24,520
will be sent to the media

279
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,559
and to the judicial authorities.

280
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,520
Would you really do this to me?

281
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,559
You Shulang.

282
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,000
Would I?

283
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,000
Will I?

284
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:52,159
I once wanted to give
you the best of everything.

285
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,320
As long as I could do it,

286
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,200
I thought

287
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:05,080
you were heaven's gift to a lonely man.

288
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:07,799
A gift to compensate for my loneliness.

289
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,520
I cherished it deeply.

290
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,320
But the joke's on me.

291
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:27,960
That candy I ate

292
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,679
was poisoned.

293
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,520
Fan Xiao.

294
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You weren't a gift from heaven.

295
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,679
You were punishment.

296
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:45,840
Not just for me,

297
00:14:46,472 --> 00:14:48,873
But for everyone around me.

298
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:50,039
President Fan.

299
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,599
Tell me really,
what do you want to do?

300
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,080
These

301
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,718
originally were things I discovered,

302
00:14:58,719 --> 00:15:00,520
Their criminal evidence

303
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,520
I was planning to use
them to threaten them later.

304
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,080
But now,

305
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:13,559
I ended up shooting
myself in the foot first.

306
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:15,880
But Director You,

307
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,919
Your heart is too soft.

308
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,840
Could you really send me to prison?

309
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,760
Fan Xiao.

310
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,039
You say

311
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,039
your gift is me,

312
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:48,080
Your punishment is also me.

313
00:15:48,395 --> 00:15:50,080
I won't let you leave me.

314
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:51,719
Fan Xiao.

315
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,599
Fan Xiao.

316
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,479
Don't push me.

317
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:01,753
I've een pushing you for so long.

318
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,960
When haven't I won?

319
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,239
Accept your fate.

320
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:17,080
Because I hope when I'm scared,
you'll be there.

321
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,880
If you're there,

322
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,359
I'll feel more at ease.

323
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,719
I can crawl at your feet

324
00:16:27,873 --> 00:16:30,672
but not as a sinner.

325
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,000
We

326
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,599
Should break up.

327
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,239
If you leave Changling

328
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,960
leave me,

329
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:50,400
Then your half a lifetime of
Professor Huang's hard work

330
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:52,760
will go up in flames.

331
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:57,559
Looks like Director You

332
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,520
doesn't care about anyone anymore.

333
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,760
Do you need me to

334
00:17:03,359 --> 00:17:05,920
ask your brother for you?

335
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,599
You said

336
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,238
everyone has to pay for

337
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:11,079
the wrong things they've done.

338
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,040
President Huang

339
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,280
Zhang Chen

340
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,800
They all did wrong.

341
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,280
But Bai Ting didn't do anything wrong.

342
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,359
She was just trying to help you.

343
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,959
I'm not the Bodhisattva
you keep calling me.

344
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,719
I can't save you.

345
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,040
Not even

346
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,160
I can't even save myself.

347
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,680
You can't bring yourself to do it.

348
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,000
Let me help you.

349
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,400
Bodhisattva

350
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,680
I will atone.

351
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,839
You're free.

352
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:33,879
Next, we continue with international news.

353
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,118
Considered to have shaken
the Thai pharmaceutical industry,

354
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:38,039
The counterfeit and illegal drug
case of the Nanwa family has,

355
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,679
after months of investigation,

356
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,319
collecting evidence and making arrests,

357
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:44,160
finally, the case reached a
verdict at the National Court.

358
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,280
Not only did the case uproot

359
00:18:46,305 --> 00:18:48,445
Thailand's pharmaceutical
monopoly, the Fan Group,

360
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,615
but also implicated politicians
from neighboring countries,

361
00:18:50,639 --> 00:18:52,679
with amounts and crimes
rarely seen in Thai history.

362
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,399
The scope of the crimes, including

363
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,559
the amount involved,

364
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,040
has rarely been seen in Thailand's history.

365
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,679
According to local media,

366
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,920
The case was reported by an insider,

367
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,479
who provided detailed, direct evidence.

368
00:19:04,504 --> 00:19:06,264
And straightforward data.

369
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,319
Driver.

370
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,760
Change the music, please.

371
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:28,479
Hello?

372
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,119
You, where are you?

373
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,359
Almost there.

374
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,079
Just past the next light.

375
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:34,760
You guys go ahead.

376
00:19:38,775 --> 00:19:39,680
Why is You Shulang still not here?
Exactly.

377
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:41,896
It's already ten o'clock, still not here.

378
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,680
Sorry,
I'm late.

379
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:44,199
Here.

380
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:45,439
Everyone's here.

381
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:46,656
We've just been waiting for you.

382
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,536
Been waiting half a day for you.
Why did you arrive so late?

383
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,359
Exactly.

384
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,159
Didn't you say you were in
seclusion preparing for exams?

385
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,376
You'll be fine after the exams are over.

386
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,639
You've always had great results.

387
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,319
You'll be fine.
Thanks.

388
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,920
Studying full-time?

389
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:57,199
While on the job.

390
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:58,599
Once you pass this

391
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,240
You'll have your
pick of the litter then.

392
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:03,920
Can't wait.

393
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,719
Come on.

394
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,400
Did you see that news from Thailand?

395
00:20:08,479 --> 00:20:09,479
What news?

396
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,199
About Thailand,

397
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,319
I know, I know.

398
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:12,359
Of course you know.

399
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,040
You, Shulang,

400
00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:15,000
You were in Thailand?

401
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,520
What's going on with you two?

402
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,078
We haven't even finished
talking about the litter.

403
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:21,040
Why are you changing the subject?

404
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,160
I knew it.

405
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,118
You're pretending to study hard

406
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:25,800
Your motives aren't pure.

407
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,199
His motives aren't pure.

408
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:54,459
(Medical Diagnosis "Three
Fundamentals" Training Doctor's Handbook)

409
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,479
I can fly a plastic bag high.

410
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:21,079
Even higher than a kite.

411
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:23,920
Director You, want to see it?

412
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:26,599
If you want, I'll fly one for you.

413
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,640
Mr. You

414
00:21:58,839 --> 00:21:59,839
Long time no see.

415
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,880
I didn't expect you to really come.

416
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:03,319
Please sit.

417
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:04,599
Sit down.

418
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:08,239
Sit down.

419
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,880
This is...

420
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,560
I've got cancer.

421
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,400
I've don't have long to live.

422
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,160
The doctor said

423
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:19,040
Everyone in my family

424
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,599
We all carry this bug inside us.

425
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:24,239
My son's is in his brain.

426
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:26,040
Mine's in my liver.

427
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:28,680
I heard the boy has recovered.

428
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,400
Back then,

429
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:33,640
thanks to you

430
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:34,839
and President Fan,

431
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,680
you saved our Tiantian.

432
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:37,680
Yes,

433
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,119
His name's Tiantian.

434
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:41,959
Back then,

435
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:44,079
I brought him back home

436
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,959
He had two surgeries

437
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,400
And several rounds of chemo.

438
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:49,719
Doctor said

439
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,599
He's fine now.

440
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:53,239
Don't worry too much.

441
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,760
You'll be just fine, like Tiantian.

442
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,160
I'm done for.

443
00:23:05,199 --> 00:23:07,479
They've issued the
critical condition notice.

444
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,800
To be honest,

445
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,239
I'm not afraid of dying.

446
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:14,280
I've never made a name
for myself in this life.

447
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:16,359
But

448
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,000
If I die,

449
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,800
what will happen to Tiantian?

450
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,400
He's still so young.

451
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,160
If I'm gone,

452
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,040
what will happen to him?

453
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:33,599
In this world

454
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:36,560
I'm his only family.

455
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:38,800
He's still so young.

456
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:41,079
I can't be at peace this way.

457
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,160
Mr. You

458
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,640
I know you're a good person.

459
00:23:51,094 --> 00:23:52,574
Tiantian's life,

460
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,959
was given by you.

461
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:56,560
You're like his second parents.

462
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:58,599
I know.

463
00:23:58,839 --> 00:23:59,839
If I die,

464
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,160
Tiantian will surely be
sent to the orphanage.

465
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,479
When that time comes,
could I trouble you...

466
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,520
please,

467
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,880
go visit him at the orphanage

468
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,400
I know

469
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,040
This will surely cause you a lot of trouble

470
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,520
But

471
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,079
I have no other way.

472
00:24:18,479 --> 00:24:21,400
You and President
Fan are all I can think of.

473
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,479
I can't reach him by phone.

474
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:25,880
Only you picked up.

475
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,800
Mr. You

476
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,880
Tiantian is very well-behaved.

477
00:24:30,565 --> 00:24:32,045
He's still so small.

478
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:33,920
He hardly ever cries.

479
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:35,719
All you need to do is

480
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,280
visit him often at the orphanage,

481
00:24:37,574 --> 00:24:39,174
see if he's doing well,

482
00:24:39,199 --> 00:24:40,519
if he's healthy or not,

483
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,718
if he's happy,

484
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:43,079
just make sure he's happy, okay?

485
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:44,239
Is that okay? I'm begging you.
Ms. Wu

486
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,800
Please don't get too emotional.

487
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:47,959
Please,

488
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:49,680
Let's sit down and talk slowly.

489
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,119
Conditions at the orphanage

490
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,040
are much better than before.

491
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,200
You don't need to worry too much.

492
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:06,471
They won't go hungry,

493
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,640
they won't be cold either.

494
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,640
But

495
00:25:11,199 --> 00:25:12,280
what I hope for

496
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,800
in this world

497
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:17,079
there will be someone to care for him,

498
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,719
and someone he can care about.

499
00:25:21,806 --> 00:25:22,806
Mr. You

500
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,799
Tiantian is still small.

501
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,239
He doesn't remember things.

502
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,880
He'll forget me soon.

503
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:34,239
And then, in this world,

504
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:37,999
if he doesn't have anyone to care for him,

505
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,920
how sad would that be?

506
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:41,640
If

507
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:44,160
He has you by his side,

508
00:25:44,844 --> 00:25:46,886
I could leave in peace.

509
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,400
Mothers are always selfish.

510
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,200
We always think of our children first.

511
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:05,959
Their well-being comes first.

512
00:26:07,239 --> 00:26:08,239
Mr. You

513
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:11,000
If you feel it's too much to ask,

514
00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:13,000
Then I...

515
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,000
Mom

516
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,920
Mom

517
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:18,920
Mom
Tiantian

518
00:26:20,199 --> 00:26:21,479
Why did you guys come?

519
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:24,280
He insisted on looking for Mom.

520
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,520
Tiantian's mom

521
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,880
It's almost New Year.

522
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,718
My husband and child
are urging me to go back.

523
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:30,759
You should find the new nanny.

524
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,000
Quickly find one.

525
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,800
Tiantian

526
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:43,079
Hello.

527
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:44,199
Call Uncle.

528
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:49,599
Hello, Uncle.

529
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,000
Good boy.
Tiantian

530
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,160
Stop messing around.

531
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,598
Get off Uncle.

532
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:56,719
I just like Uncle.

533
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,040
I've done everything you asked.

534
00:27:05,239 --> 00:27:07,079
Do you think he'll adopt Tiantian?

535
00:27:08,199 --> 00:27:10,159
What's the connection
between that child and him?

536
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,760
He's not a kitten or a puppy.

537
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,320
You can't just adopt him on a whim.

538
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,359
What if you're wrong?

539
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,880
What if You Shulang doesn't adopt Tiantian?

540
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:20,599
Then I'll adopt him.

541
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:23,479
What?

542
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:25,280
You'll adopt him?

543
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:28,880
Why do I feel
like I don't even know you anymore?

544
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:31,640
That's the child we saved together.

545
00:27:32,199 --> 00:27:33,839
He will grow up happy.

546
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,719
Someone will tell him

547
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:38,040
That this world is not so bad.

548
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,760
He will become the bond You Shulang wanted.

549
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,160
In this world

550
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,359
The bond that belongs to him.

551
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,400
What you said

552
00:27:55,479 --> 00:27:57,400
What you said is true.

553
00:27:57,479 --> 00:27:58,479
Yes.

554
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,479
I brought all of my

555
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,976
documentation and financial info.

556
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,160
And property information.

557
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:06,319
You can take a look.

558
00:28:07,239 --> 00:28:08,280
Also,

559
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,560
If you have any other questions,

560
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,040
you can ask me.

561
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,719
I

562
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,920
I

563
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,079
I'll live in the next life as your servant.

564
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:19,640
Lie down quickly.
I

565
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:21,239
Thank you so much.

566
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,280
Lie down quickly.

567
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,959
Thank you.

568
00:28:26,146 --> 00:28:27,626
Actually, adopting Tiantian

569
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,680
I have my selfish reasons.

570
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:31,920
I'm also an orphan.

571
00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:34,640
Life alone is too lonely.

572
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,880
I hope Tiantian can be my companion.

573
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:42,279
And there's one more
thing that's very important.

574
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,119
Ms. Wu

575
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,959
You need to think about it carefully.

576
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,640
This is why it took me a
few days to come see you.

577
00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:01,839
I'm gay.

578
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:04,879
If you think my sexual orientation

579
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,959
could cause any
negative impact to Tiantian,

580
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,479
you can reject me.

581
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:11,359
It doesn't matter.

582
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,640
None of that matters.

583
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,520
It's New Year.

584
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,560
New Year.

585
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,119
Even if I'm alone,

586
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,160
I still need to have some dumplings.

587
00:29:58,599 --> 00:29:59,599
No vinegar?

588
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:02,040
Boss, some vinegar please.

589
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:02,880
Alright.
Coming right up.

590
00:30:07,719 --> 00:30:08,800
Bai Ting

591
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:11,000
You Shulang

592
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:14,319
Here, You Shulang.

593
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,839
Eat while it's hot.

594
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:24,719
Here.

595
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,920
Chopsticks.

596
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,800
Thank you.

597
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:30,119
So... you...

598
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,719
what's going on here?

599
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:35,680
I called you before,

600
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,880
But no one picked up.
Did you eat?

601
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:39,199
Let's go once you've eaten.

602
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,880
Boss, the bill's paid.

603
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,160
Come again next time.

604
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:50,160
I guess, I'm just... reformed.

605
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,719
Sorry.

606
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,560
I didn't even tell you.

607
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,400
I just wanted to cut all
ties with everything before.

608
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,160
Keep things clean.

609
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,199
Did I make you worry?

610
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,319
I should have told you earlier.

611
00:31:09,719 --> 00:31:11,000
I understand you.

612
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:12,640
If it were me,

613
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,640
I would have done the same.

614
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,920
Tastes pretty good.

615
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:29,079
Did you make this?

616
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,520
Yeah.

617
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,319
Bai Ting

618
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:48,000
Don't worry.

619
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:50,599
I won't bother you again.

620
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:01,040
This player... please
restart your life.

621
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:06,800
Thank you, You Shulang.

622
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,680
If there's a chance,

623
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:12,680
please thank President Fan for me.

624
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:16,319
Thank who?

625
00:32:16,719 --> 00:32:17,959
Fan Xiao

626
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:20,000
President Fan is called Fan Xiao, right?

627
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:23,136
Did you hurt your hand, should I...

628
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,160
No worries.

629
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,959
Over half a year ago,

630
00:32:33,199 --> 00:32:34,560
I was at the nightclub.

631
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,400
I didn't want to do the dirty work.

632
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,760
A floor boss there
wanted to get back at me.

633
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,959
They brought my dad and brother in.

634
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,119
They tried to drug me,
to force me to go back.

635
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,079
What happened then?

636
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,800
How did this get tied to Fan Xiao?

637
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,040
I had no way out.

638
00:32:56,199 --> 00:32:58,239
The only person I could turn to was you.

639
00:32:58,839 --> 00:32:59,999
But when I called you,

640
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,239
I couldn't reach you at all.

641
00:33:01,719 --> 00:33:02,719
Finally,

642
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,479
I contacted President Fan.

643
00:33:05,239 --> 00:33:09,839
He had left me his contact info
when he wanted me to threaten you.

644
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:12,160
He said

645
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:15,400
you were busy with
an important project.

646
00:33:16,479 --> 00:33:17,680
You were very busy.

647
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,079
We didn't want to trouble you with this.

648
00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:21,799
He said he would take care of it for me.

649
00:33:22,479 --> 00:33:26,040
President Fan arranged for
me to stay at a place outside.

650
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:27,359
And let me hide for a while.

651
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:31,199
But out there,

652
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,479
while hiding away,

653
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,520
these quiet days

654
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,239
were actually pretty nice.

655
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,959
So I took my remaining savings

656
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,920
and bought this dumpling shop.

657
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:46,599
Fan Xiao helped her...

658
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,640
And how did he handle it in the end?

659
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:53,479
My brother loves to gamble.

660
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:57,679
President Fan somehow
found out and set him up.

661
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,119
He made him owe a lot of money.

662
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,800
And take out high-interest loans.

663
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:01,880
In the end,

664
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:03,199
He stepped in to mediate.

665
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:05,599
The condition was

666
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,239
They would never bother me again.

667
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,040
I owe him thanks.

668
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,639
But he said he was doing
a favor for the Bodhisattva.

669
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,760
If anyone should be thanked, the
Bodhisattva should receive thanks, not him.

670
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,239
Tiantian

671
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,879
Uncle's here to take you home.

672
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,639
Mom

673
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,879
Where's mom?

674
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,080
Mom

675
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,280
Mom went to pick stars for Tiantian.

676
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,280
The place to pick stars is a bit far.

677
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,040
It might take some time.

678
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,840
From now on,

679
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,800
Uncle will stay with you, okay?

680
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,639
Okay.

681
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,679
Tiantian

682
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:04,719
Show Uncle

683
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,160
Did you learn how to fold dumplings?

684
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:08,760
See if I folded them well.

685
00:35:08,959 --> 00:35:10,040
So good.

686
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,479
You're amazing.

687
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,000
Look at your messy face!

688
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,399
Finally, they lived happily ever after.

689
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,280
Alright, Tiantian.
Story's over.

690
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,320
Time to sleep.

691
00:35:22,399 --> 00:35:24,239
One more story.

692
00:35:25,479 --> 00:35:26,678
Time to sleep.

693
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:28,399
Just the last one.

694
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,040
Okay.

695
00:35:32,919 --> 00:35:34,959
Guess how much I love you.

696
00:35:45,919 --> 00:35:47,199
What's wrong, Tiantian?

697
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:51,840
Uncle, what's written on this painting?

698
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:54,879
This painting says...

699
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,679
"Fly side by side."

700
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:00,000
What does “fly side by side” mean?

701
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,399
It means being together
with the one you love.

702
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,639
Being with the person you like.

703
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,520
Then are you and me “flying side by side”?

704
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:12,280
Not that kind of “like.”

705
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,399
This seems to be

706
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,760
You and Jennie from kindergarten.

707
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:20,320
Then, Uncle,

708
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,320
Do you have someone
to “fly side by side” with?

709
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:32,399
Tiantian

710
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:33,919
Let's go play over there.

711
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:46,399
Hello

712
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,520
What medicine do you need?

713
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,135
Do you have stomach medicine?

714
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:50,080
I'll check it myself.

715
00:36:50,081 --> 00:36:51,879
It's on the back shelf, at the corner.

716
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Thanks.

717
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,120
Brother Fan.

718
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:07,520
What brings you here today?

719
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,840
I'm here to

720
00:37:14,919 --> 00:37:16,199
collect some research materials.

721
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,080
Want to eat?

722
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:20,479
Thanks, Fan Xiao.
Wait for me to get it for you.

723
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,360
Okay.

724
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,679
Fan Xiao
The materials.

725
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:34,120
Thank you
Fan Xiao

726
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,080
Are you thirsty?

727
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,640
Why don't you sit down for a bit?

728
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,879
No need to sit.

729
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,320
I'm in a hurry.

730
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,879
I'll take this.

731
00:38:21,959 --> 00:38:22,600
Sir

732
00:38:22,601 --> 00:38:23,638
You have a subway card here.

733
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:24,840
Not a credit card.

734
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,679
Sorry about that.

735
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,760
No problem.

736
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,360
Here you go.
Thank you.

737
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:34,159
Yes

738
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:37,199
I forgot to take it.

739
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:05,919
Hello

740
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,360
My name is Fan Xiao.

741
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,639
I'm Thai-Hua.

742
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:11,719
You Shulang

743
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:16,159
Brother Fan

744
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,400
What did you forget to take?

745
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,360
Brother Fan

746
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,120
Excuse me.

747
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,560
Is something the matter?

748
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,120
You came to buy medicine.

749
00:39:44,879 --> 00:39:47,600
I work in sales at Kangda Pharma.

750
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,639
You can try their medicine.

751
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,399
Kangda's medicine

752
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,840
Expensive

753
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,040
Weak efficacy

754
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,679
Before, I wouldn't choose it.

755
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:07,679
And I won't choose it in the future.

756
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,879
Not anymore.

757
00:40:38,399 --> 00:40:39,000
Tiantian
Slow down.

758
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:41,239
Uncle, look at the red road.

759
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:43,799
Where did this living Lei Feng come from?

760
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,639
He laid a road with red bricks!

761
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,576
A young guy worked
through the night in the rain.

762
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,280
He worked through the rain half the night.

763
00:40:49,399 --> 00:40:50,478
My old man,

764
00:40:50,479 --> 00:40:51,239
When he offered him a cigarette,

765
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,719
He asked if he was moving in.

766
00:40:52,879 --> 00:40:54,000
He said no.

767
00:40:54,399 --> 00:40:56,719
He likes someone living here.

768
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,398
The rainwater was flooding.

769
00:40:58,399 --> 00:41:00,679
He was worried it would be hard for her
to get in and out.

770
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,519
These red bricks are like a carpet.

771
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,800
Of course.

772
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:07,639
Probably for the girl on the sixth floor.

773
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,120
She really is a beauty.

774
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,839
The rain has been a lot lately.

775
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,760
This will make it much
easier to get in and out.

776
00:41:12,879 --> 00:41:13,399
Tiantian

777
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,600
Tiantian

778
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:15,719
Tiantian

779
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,760
Stop playing.

780
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,919
You'll be late for kindergarten.

781
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,919
Uncle's going to eat with classmates later.

782
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:22,239
Be good, okay?

783
00:41:23,405 --> 00:41:25,326
Uncle, do you have classmates too?

784
00:41:25,479 --> 00:41:26,040
Yeah.

785
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:27,399
You have classmates, Tiantian.

786
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,760
Uncle has classmates too.

787
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,480
I've eaten Western food for seven
or eight years abroad.

788
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,680
You're still taking me out for Western food
after I come back from being abroad?

789
00:41:37,879 --> 00:41:38,879
Zhang Shicheng

790
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,840
Don't we still have some
bad blood between us?

791
00:41:42,479 --> 00:41:44,280
I dated three girls in college.

792
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,480
And it's all because of you.

793
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:47,320
This grudge will last a lifetime.

794
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,800
That's because your
love wasn't “gold-strong.”

795
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,959
Every time I dated, you ruined it.

796
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,016
You seemed to have
“gold-strong” love for me.

797
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:55,719
How come

798
00:41:55,919 --> 00:41:57,479
You disappeared for seven years abroad.

799
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,080
You Shulang

800
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,520
Zhang Shicheng is bullying your woman.

801
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:04,159
Huihui.

802
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,280
This restaurant

803
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,679
Was opened by a French chef.

804
00:42:06,879 --> 00:42:08,199
I don't know if it's good.

805
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,800
But it's famous for being expensive.

806
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:10,879
Today

807
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,840
Let me help you bring him to bankruptcy.

808
00:42:13,399 --> 00:42:14,000
Huihui

809
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,455
If you don't want to eat Western food,

810
00:42:15,479 --> 00:42:16,199
There's a decent place.

811
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:17,639
A new Southeast Asian restaurant.

812
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:19,040
This is good.

813
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:20,279
The décor has an exotic feel.

814
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:20,840
I like it.

815
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,040
Let's go, let's go.

816
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,040
You Shulang

817
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:52,639
Hmm

818
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,679
Why are you spacing out?
Look at the menu.

819
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,399
What do you want to eat?
Hmm

820
00:42:57,639 --> 00:42:58,719
Waiter

821
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,840
Do you have any recommendations?

822
00:43:04,879 --> 00:43:06,959
The chef's special for today is

823
00:43:07,479 --> 00:43:08,600
Yellow curry beef brisket.

824
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,360
Hey, Huihui,

825
00:43:25,919 --> 00:43:27,800
At least your ex is here.

826
00:43:28,399 --> 00:43:30,959
You don't have to be so obvious
when staring at handsome guys.

827
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,159
You two

828
00:43:33,879 --> 00:43:35,040
know each other?

829
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:37,239
We do.

830
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,280
He's my ex.

831
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:00,158
In the crowd

832
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:03,719
I was spotted in an instant

833
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,238
The desolation in your eyes

834
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:10,398
Hiding the same fire inside

835
00:44:10,399 --> 00:44:13,079
No need for words

836
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:16,399
No need to ask what's right or wrong

837
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:18,918
The moment we drew close

838
00:44:18,919 --> 00:44:21,639
The outcome was already destined

839
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,320
Is the moth drawn to the light

840
00:44:33,159 --> 00:44:35,679
Or the whale sinking into the deep

841
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,799
With nothing but solitary courage

842
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,360
I wager it all on tomorrow

843
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,359
The walls of the world

844
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:47,639
What does it matter if I break them down

845
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,079
My chest burns with heat

846
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,280
Screaming only for you

847
00:44:54,439 --> 00:44:57,079
I'll love you until it boils over

848
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,360
Loving without a care for the world

849
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,119
Like two stars

850
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,120
Colliding and shattering in the night sky

851
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,320
Even if it's just for a moment

852
00:45:04,321 --> 00:45:05,918
It's more than enough to surpass forever

853
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,198
Hate and love both burn brightly

854
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:09,878
Loving until the sky falls dark

855
00:45:09,879 --> 00:45:11,840
Loving until we reach the end of the road

856
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,638
Before the altar

857
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:15,759
We burn all the incense

858
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:16,839
Not asking for the next life

859
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,359
Only desiring this moment

860
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,559
Drowning together with you in

861
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,800
This blazing fire of fate
