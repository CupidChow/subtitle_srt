1
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
"To My Shore"

2
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,479
Mom…

3
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:33,639
Xiao-xiao, run!

4
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,199
Again, again!

5
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:40,839
No backing out!

6
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,479
Mr. Fan.

7
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:57,559
Mr. Fan.

8
00:02:57,839 --> 00:03:00,838
I' ve seen President Fang
and President Li to their car.

9
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:01,600
Okay.

10
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,071
Thanks for helping me
entertain them at the club,

11
00:03:04,095 --> 00:03:06,839
otherwise I wouldn't have
been able to handle it alone.

12
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,720
Mr. Fan,

13
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:11,600
you rarely ask me for help...

14
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,320
I'm happy to help.

15
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,118
It's just…

16
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:17,839
when you first asked me to “host,”

17
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:21,559
I thought...

18
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,520
you scared me for a second.

19
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,039
You thought I meant that kind of “hosting,”
huh?

20
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,319
Relax.

21
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,240
I'll get you home safe before midnight.

22
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,639
Oh...

23
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,000
I got you a gift.

24
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,360
Mr. Fan,

25
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,119
you've already helped me so much.

26
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,919
You don't have to...

27
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:47,999
Isn't this the crown from
the last show's finale?

28
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,399
Boss went to your show.

29
00:03:49,726 --> 00:03:53,246
When he heard the finale crown you were supposed
to wear got reassigned to another model,

30
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,279
he bought it on the spot.

31
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:56,520
I…

32
00:03:56,521 --> 00:03:57,921
I don't think I should accept this.

33
00:03:58,559 --> 00:03:59,679
Now

34
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,960
this crown

35
00:04:01,985 --> 00:04:03,985
belongs to you.

36
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:06,559
Your Highness,

37
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,398
may I

38
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:10,679
have the honor of a song?

39
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:14,880
Since

40
00:04:14,881 --> 00:04:17,119
Mr. Fan doesn't mind how I sound,

41
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,519
I'll give it a shot.

42
00:04:43,799 --> 00:04:46,119
And who's this now?

43
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,839
You're acting weird lately...

44
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,359
why are you only bringing guys around?

45
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,200
Just NPCs.

46
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,679
A game that might blow up any minute…

47
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,920
thrilling, right?

48
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,839
I'll leave you alone.

49
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:02,959
I'm off...

50
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,200
call me if you need me.

51
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,480
President Fan.

52
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,518
Shulang...

53
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,519
what are you up to?

54
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,239
Watching the game at home.

55
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,839
With your girlfriend?

56
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:19,959
Nice.

57
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,519
I'm alone.

58
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,559
A long night...

59
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,119
our Director You has no company?

60
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,080
He has a business dinner tonight.

61
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:32,279
What a waste of a good night.

62
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,200
Why did you call?

63
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,279
No reason.

64
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,519
Someone's singing at this bar—sounds great.

65
00:05:40,679 --> 00:05:42,119
Thought I'd invite you.

66
00:05:43,119 --> 00:05:44,119
After all,

67
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,359
you're my only friend in this city.

68
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:48,959
Listen.

69
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,000
Hear that?

70
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
Nice, right?

71
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
It's okay...

72
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,239
can't really hear it.

73
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,480
Come hang for a bit?

74
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,920
Kongke Bar.

75
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:13,359
No schmoozing...

76
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,040
just friends.

77
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,959
Aren't I your only “friend” here?

78
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
President Fan makes
friends wherever you go.

79
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,599
Don't flatter me like that.

80
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,279
If it's nothing urgent,

81
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,960
let's talk at tomorrow's press conference.

82
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,519
I'm hanging up.

83
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:25,920
Director You's getting
less and less polite with me.

84
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,399
Where did that first-meeting courtesy go?

85
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,399
Courtesy is for outsiders.

86
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,160
You

87
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:34,880
don't really count anymore.

88
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,800
(Episode 3)

89
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,838
Congratulations to both investment teams

90
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,320
on a successful signing.

91
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,760
All right.

92
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,200
Honored guests, please be seated.

93
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,399
President Fan—please stay.

94
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:05,600
And would you be so kind as to give a few
words to the present company?

95
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,760
My language skills aren't great,

96
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,119
so I'll keep it short.

97
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,959
If I misspeak,

98
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,079
please forgive me.

99
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,279
Thanks again

100
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,920
for coming to our project launch.

101
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,239
Here's to

102
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,320
a smooth partnership
between Pinfeng Capital and Bohai Pharma,

103
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:24,919
and may our friendship be lasting,

104
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,278
like

105
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,519
mine with Director You.

106
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,239
President Fan,

107
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:42,279
this is the office
Director Liu set up for you

108
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,953
so as to be more convenient
to follow up on the project.

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,920
Let me know if you need anything else.

110
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,239
What I need most

111
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,720
is this moisturizer.

112
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,160
Want some?

113
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
I'm good.

114
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,839
It's a lot more humid here

115
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,160
than where I came from.

116
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,040
True.

117
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,118
Too wet in the rainy season,

118
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:12,200
too dry in the hot season.

119
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,640
The skin gets dried out.

120
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,200
Why are you staring at me?

121
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:19,760
You didn't rub it in evenly.

122
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,480
Here.

123
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,000
Is that better?

124
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:26,000
Here…

125
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:27,119
and there.

126
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:28,880
Now?

127
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,640
Is it even now?

128
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,920
Here.

129
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,119
How about

130
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,200
we trouble Director You...

131
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:51,479
Shulang,

132
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,640
help me out.

133
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,840
Done.

134
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,359
Thanks.

135
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:19,320
This is a nice office setup...

136
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,320
it has everything.

137
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,039
Xiao Ding...

138
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:26,919
get a humidifier for
President Fan's office.

139
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,640
Make it quick.

140
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:33,199
Director You really knows
how to take care of people.

141
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:35,119
Oh, shut it.

142
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,280
Want a cigarette?

143
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,120
Stop hiding behind the
excuse of poor language skills.

144
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,960
You're just...

145
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,520
what?

146
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,840
Doing it on purpose to tease.

147
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:12,839
You're just

148
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
nasty.

149
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,120
Nasty.

150
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,760
Nasty.

151
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,559
Sharp eyes, Director You.

152
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Sometimes I think I am nasty too.

153
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,320
Like tomorrow...

154
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,279
I want to “borrow”

155
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,760
your day off,

156
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,400
come wander the city with me.

157
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,559
Tomorrow?

158
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,520
I can't make it tomorrow.

159
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,918
Signing the contract and ghosting me?

160
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,118
It's not that.

161
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:48,520
Rain check, okay?

162
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,919
I've already got plans.

163
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,159
I know I owe you.

164
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,040
But I really am meeting someone tomorrow.

165
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,719
Your girlfriend?

166
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,160
I'm going out with my partner.

167
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:05,039
Then I won't intrude.

168
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,000
All I can do is wish Director You

169
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:08,760
a happy day off.

170
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,080
Maybe I'm too sensitive.

171
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,520
Maybe he's just casual with boundaries.

172
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,040
Not too concerned anymore.

173
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:18,319
By the way— where did
you get that moisturizer?

174
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,679
The smell's… harsh.

175
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,118
How about later

176
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:23,479
I'll go with you to buy a new one,

177
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,760
we'll get a better one.

178
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,159
Knew it...

179
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,080
Director You does care.

180
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,239
Didn't expect

181
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,520
you to know so much about skincare.

182
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,799
I used this before.

183
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Works well.

184
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,919
I saw you earlier

185
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,320
reading the ingredients.

186
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:59,239
Reading the ingredients is a habit from
work.

187
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:00,799
Just checking

188
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:03,200
whether it suits our Young Master Fan.

189
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,320
Zhen-zhen,

190
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,799
free tomorrow?

191
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,559
Want to show me around?

192
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,799
Tomorrow?

193
00:12:15,479 --> 00:12:16,639
What...

194
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,640
you busy?

195
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,679
It's fine—I'm free.

196
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,000
Then what time?

197
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,319
Where do you want to go?

198
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,760
9 a.m. sharp...

199
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,679
Urban Wetland Park.

200
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:32,516
[You already know it's Zhen-zhen calling!]

201
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,000
Hey...
Shulang,

202
00:12:37,001 --> 00:12:38,319
I just got a booking.

203
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,558
Tomorrow

204
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,799
the agency scheduled me for work.

205
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Okay.

206
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:44,119
Got it.

207
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:47,320
I'll refund the tickets and flights then.

208
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:48,679
We'll go next time.

209
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,840
Mm.

210
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,520
Stood up?

211
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,320
He's busy tomorrow.

212
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,960
Then…

213
00:12:57,479 --> 00:12:59,000
shall we…

214
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:02,799
Sure.

215
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,039
Where do you want to go?

216
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,159
I'll go with you.

217
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:06,719
Urban Wetland Park.

218
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,640
See you at nine-thirty.

219
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,960
Morning, Mr. Fan.

220
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,039
I'm not late, am I?

221
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:25,039
Not late.

222
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,200
Right on time.

223
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,280
I'm early.

224
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:30,320
What did you bring?

225
00:13:30,479 --> 00:13:31,799
I made these.

226
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,039
A friend said the park's huge...

227
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:36,080
it'll be good to refuel when we rest.

228
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,760
Very thoughtful.

229
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,320
Then...

230
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:41,559
Shall we?

231
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:45,520
Zhen-zhen,

232
00:13:45,632 --> 00:13:46,639
what do you think about

233
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,000
someone who seems perfect in public

234
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:52,039
and gets their dirty secret exposed...

235
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:53,559
what happens?

236
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:58,679
Uh…

237
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,400
they'd probably blow up from embarrassment?

238
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,640
Not him.

239
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,719
He

240
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,960
Keeps up appearances.

241
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,280
Even if he's grinding his teeth,

242
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,960
he'd swallow it with a smile.

243
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:14,000
Then, I wonder who you're talking about.

244
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,719
What's the punishment?

245
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,239
You can't park here.

246
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:34,719
Please you go back.

247
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,320
Go back.

248
00:14:38,766 --> 00:14:39,485
Back off.
Okay,

249
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,200
thank you.

250
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:45,159
“Go back,” huh?

251
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,119
Back to where?

252
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,239
Back to when we first met?

253
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,119
President Fan,

254
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,919
welcome to our company.

255
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,679
Pleased to meet you.

256
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:05,718
Just remembered an urgent matter...

257
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:07,039
I need to run back to the office.

258
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,280
Today's trip is off.

259
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,080
What?

260
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,599
But I...

261
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:16,359
Thanks.

262
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,679
I'll enjoy these.

263
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,760
What?

264
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,159
Mr. Fan...
I'll make it up to you.

265
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:28,919
Sorry...

266
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,919
traffic at the lot made me late.

267
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:32,239
Not at all...

268
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,320
you're right on time.

269
00:15:33,359 --> 00:15:34,359
I was early.

270
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,880
You took a cab?

271
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:38,239
Just now

272
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:40,039
I saw you talking to one.

273
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,559
Someone asked directions...

274
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:43,280
I put him in a taxi.

275
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:48,119
You? Giving directions
with your sense of direction?

276
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,840
Exactly why I put him in the cab.

277
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,960
Foreigner.

278
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:53,159
Driver didn't speak English.

279
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,200
Couldn't make it clear.

280
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,239
What's that in your hand?

281
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,799
Food.

282
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:01,359
The place is huge...

283
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:02,280
when we're free,

284
00:16:02,281 --> 00:16:03,479
we're good to refuel.

285
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,640
Let's go.

286
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,400
You made it?

287
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,919
You'll know when you taste it.

288
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,239
If it's good, I made it.

289
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:12,479
Nasty.

290
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,960
Wait for me...

291
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:16,559
don't run...

292
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,919
wait!
What's so funny?

293
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:20,679
Can you understand what they're saying?

294
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,200
No.

295
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,159
But eyes are a universal language.

296
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,320
Their eyes are full of happiness.

297
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,039
It's nice.

298
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,280
Again, again!

299
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:31,239
So if they're happy,

300
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:32,919
you're happy?

301
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:36,039
Director You's got a big heart.

302
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,400
Tsk—don't twist my words.

303
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,960
I'm not a saint.

304
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:43,038
I just get infected by

305
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,719
the simple joy around me.

306
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,039
Don't you?

307
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,880
“People around you,” huh?

308
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:53,479
I should be the one

309
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,520
around you.

310
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,119
Do I look

311
00:16:58,479 --> 00:17:00,159
like I'm simply joyful right now?

312
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,920
Joyful or not, I don't know.

313
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:07,599
I only know you're not “simple.”

314
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,359
What, did I hit a nerve?

315
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,199
Sure...

316
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:15,800
our Director You

317
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:18,479
is the best.

318
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,920
Fine.

319
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,079
It's hot.

320
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,119
Keep some distance.

321
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:39,839
Penny for your thoughts?

322
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,919
That pond looks like where I

323
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,480
used to catch fish and shrimp as a kid.

324
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:46,599
Catch fish and shrimp?

325
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,359
You were that naughty as a kid?

326
00:17:52,183 --> 00:17:53,239
Not for fun...

327
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,199
for surviving.

328
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,560
And you don't always get a catch...

329
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:04,920
it depends on luck.

330
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,959
You really did that when you were a kid?

331
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:12,000
From seven

332
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,599
till fourteen.

333
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,920
How'd you catch them...

334
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,640
use those tools on the bank?

335
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:23,359
That won't work.

336
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,520
What can you catch with that?

337
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,239
The biggest, fattest fish

338
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:27,479
stay in deep water...

339
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,160
you've gotta dive.

340
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:31,040
But I never went to the deepest part.

341
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,119
Even though the fish were fattest there,

342
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,160
there was a whirlpool.

343
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,439
Greedy kids got drowned by it.

344
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,479
You weren't greedy?

345
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:44,000
I was.

346
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:47,160
But I wanted to live more.

347
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:57,880
Is living

348
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,560
really that important?

349
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,000
Living's exhausting.

350
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,520
It is.

351
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,640
But there are things
worth sticking around for.

352
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,920
Like

353
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,359
falling in love.

354
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,280
And, say…

355
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,680
good food.

356
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,079
Here, try this.

357
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,119
I'll do it myself.

358
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,119
Don't be so formal.

359
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:32,160
You helped me rub face cream on,

360
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,800
I'm just returning the favor.

361
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,319
Fan Xiao,

362
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,119
knock off the clingy crap.

363
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,319
Don't do it again.

364
00:19:58,119 --> 00:19:59,119
Does it taste good?

365
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,319
Is the taste familiar?

366
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:02,959
Familiar?

367
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,560
What chain is this from?

368
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,559
It's okay.

369
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,880
I don't think I've had it before.

370
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:11,280
Then...

371
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,640
how's it compare to
your girlfriend's cooking?

372
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,239
Fan Xiao,

373
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:19,000
get yourself a girlfriend.

374
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,560
Better than pining after
someone else's partner.

375
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,199
My partner rarely cooks...

376
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,880
I'm the one who cooks for them, mostly.

377
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,000
You cook for them?

378
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:34,719
Forget this.

379
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,119
Come on...

380
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,760
I'll take you to something actually good.

381
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:41,280
How was that?

382
00:20:41,479 --> 00:20:42,400
Pretty accurate, right?

383
00:20:42,401 --> 00:20:43,680
Aim's fine.

384
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,520
Weak on power.

385
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,880
Weak on power, huh…

386
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,160
Fan Xiao,

387
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,920
why'd you bring me here?

388
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,239
If you keep being mysterious,

389
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:52,560
I'm leaving.

390
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,560
Almost time...

391
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,520
you'll see.

392
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,079
Young Master Xue.

393
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,919
Slow down.

394
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,719
Hey, gimme a kiss.

395
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,078
Xue Baotian.

396
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:08,040
Careful, careful.

397
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,999
Director You's got class,

398
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,719
but swapping drinks for a lady...

399
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,359
one for one...

400
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:14,718
won't do.

401
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:16,000
Fine...

402
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,319
Director You,

403
00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:18,799
I'm making friends with you tonight.

404
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
Director You,

405
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:21,359
tonight

406
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:23,079
I'll get you some payback.

407
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:24,599
Young Master Xue...

408
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:27,560
be careful.

409
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:30,119
Young Master Xue...

410
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,719
What the hell...

411
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,679
Stop fighting!

412
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,640
Who touched your granddaddy?

413
00:21:34,641 --> 00:21:36,479
Please stop!

414
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,039
Young Master Xue, are you okay?

415
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,359
Looking to die?!

416
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,199
I'm off—President Fan...

417
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,560
He hits where it hurts.

418
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,359
Not a saint at all...

419
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
more like

420
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:56,479
a charming little devil.

421
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:13,520
That neck…

422
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:18,040
I want a bite.

423
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,319
I really want a bite.

424
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,000
Damn it—still not enough.

425
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:25,479
I need the real thing.

426
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,959
This better be fucking important.

427
00:22:41,719 --> 00:22:43,400
Chill—it's nothing.

428
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,160
Lu Zhen?

429
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,040
Zhen-zhen?

430
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,280
Alright.

431
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,199
Wait for me.

432
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,800
Zhen-zhen...

433
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:21,520
your turn.

434
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:26,280
Director You can't be
the only one on my roster.

435
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,920
Zhen-zhen...

436
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,920
Mr. Fan.

437
00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:40,760
Been waiting long?

438
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,359
Not long.

439
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:47,599
You're had a little
too much to drink.

440
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:56,560
Tonight's drinks are…

441
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,920
strong.

442
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:02,640
Haven't eaten, have you?

443
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:05,359
Don't skip meals...

444
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
you're too skinny.

445
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:12,119
Too skinny.

446
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:13,280
And too soft.

447
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Not like Director You...

448
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:17,479
I'll stay a bit

449
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,199
then take you home.

450
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:27,280
I'm gonna hit the restroom.

451
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,719
I'll wait here.

452
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:41,279
Your boyfriend's hilarious...

453
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,999
who proposes there?

454
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,280
So awkward.

455
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:47,640
He looked so sincere, though.

456
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,800
Forget it.

457
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:50,119
Then congrats...

458
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,000
happy wedding.

459
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:01,040
Marriage…

460
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,838
I want to be with you forever.

461
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,039
Let's get married.

462
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,238
Kiddo,

463
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:10,838
“forever” is a long time.

464
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:11,479
You sure?
I'm sure.

465
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,519
You're the one I want to be with forever.

466
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,959
Let's get married. Please?

467
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:18,639
Okay. If Zhen-zhen wants it,

468
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,880
I'm in.

469
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,639
Check flights...

470
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,640
we'll go abroad and get married.
Really?

471
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,719
All done.

472
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,959
That's a wrap for today's brand shoot.

473
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:29,880
Thanks.

474
00:25:29,881 --> 00:25:31,040
How're you getting home?

475
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,680
My boyfriend's picking me up, as usual.

476
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,520
Aww, jealous...

477
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,200
your boyfriend picks you up every day,

478
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,880
and he's handsome

479
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:40,160
and sweet.

480
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:41,639
Where'd you find that treasure?

481
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,839
Find your own.

482
00:25:43,199 --> 00:25:44,680
I chased mine down!

483
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,478
At first I wasn't sure,

484
00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:49,718
but then I thought...

485
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:50,760
whatever,

486
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,319
I'll go for it.

487
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,040
That's the spirit.

488
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,559
I…

489
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,239
Zhen-zhen...

490
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,279
I shouldn't be thinking of You Shulang now.

491
00:25:59,280 --> 00:25:59,839
Zhen-zhen...

492
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,160
I…

493
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,960
What are you spacing out for?

494
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,319
Finish this drink,

495
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:08,599
and we'll go home.

496
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,520
Let's go.

497
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,880
It's so hot.

498
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:33,640
Mr. Fan...

499
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,319
Zhen-zhen.

500
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:37,599
What's wrong?

501
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:39,839
Nauseous?

502
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,160
Want to throw up?

503
00:26:42,719 --> 00:26:43,719
Hot.

504
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:52,280
I'm burning up.

505
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:54,680
Feel me.

506
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,838
Have some ice water...

507
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:00,839
cool down.

508
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,119
Mr. Fan,

509
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,839
I'm weak…

510
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:17,239
can't open it.

511
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:18,160
Can you help me?
Tch—no.

512
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:22,199
I should be calmer.

513
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,839
More restrained.

514
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:26,199
Mr. Fan,

515
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:32,319
Silly boy...

516
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,719
need me to help?

517
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,479
Why isn't this working?

518
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:44,760
Get in the back.

519
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:49,560
Mr. Fan…

520
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,000
Don't look at me like that.

521
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,999
Less soft...

522
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,359
more aloof.

523
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,119
Sit up straighter.

524
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:08,160
Don't slouch.

525
00:28:08,185 --> 00:28:09,185
Sit up straight.

526
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:11,119
Mr. Fan,

527
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:12,640
I feel awful.

528
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:15,839
Help me—please?

529
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:17,800
I feel awful.

530
00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:23,959
It's still not working.

531
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,760
I'll take you home.

532
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,040
Sleep it off.

533
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:30,279
Mr. Fan,

534
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,160
Actually I was...

535
00:28:31,161 --> 00:28:32,399
Get some rest.

536
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,880
We'll be there soon.

537
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:55,118
Mr. Fan,

538
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,159
today

539
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,160
thanks for the ride.

540
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,479
Want to come in?

541
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,199
I just bought a new couch...

542
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,039
super comfy.

543
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,160
It's late...

544
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:07,400
another time.

545
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,760
Text me when you're get in,

546
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
so I won't worry.

547
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,319
Come on...

548
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:15,680
Mr. Fan...

549
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,119
Mr. Fan...

550
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,400
Zhen-zhen...

551
00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:35,479
Lu Zhen!

552
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:37,560
What's wrong?

553
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:39,719
Uncle You?

554
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,198
It's you?

555
00:29:41,199 --> 00:29:42,119
Why are you here?

556
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,679
I called a few times
and couldn't reach you.

557
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,160
I got worried
and came by.

558
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,000
Why are you so...

559
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,319
Kiss me, Uncle You.

560
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,719
You're…

561
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,319
Lu Zhen...

562
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,760
let's go upstairs, okay?

563
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:56,880
No...

564
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,079
right now.

565
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:07,079
I want that kiss.

566
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,760
I want You Shulang's kiss.

567
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,800
Lu Zhen...
come on,

568
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:15,719
upstairs.

569
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,479
I want to hook up with that sick pervert.

570
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:28,920
What?

571
00:30:28,921 --> 00:30:30,319
Hook up with who?

572
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,800
Sick pervert?

573
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,160
Who?

574
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:34,560
You Shulang.

575
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,000
The guy you wanted...

576
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,159
You Shulang.

577
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,280
You really brought him straight to my bed?

578
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:43,839
Lao Xiao,

579
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:45,319
are you for real?

580
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:48,160
Switching sexual orientation now?

581
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:50,479
For real?

582
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,718
Just playing.

583
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:53,239
For now, it looks…

584
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,439
fun.

585
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,160
How'd you knock him out?

586
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,199
He's usually

587
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:02,479
careful.

588
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,478
Their company hosted clients tonight...

589
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:05,359
he got drunk.
He sent everyone off

590
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,640
and was alone in the lot...

591
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:10,119
my guy dosed him there.

592
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:14,640
But, I gotta say, I gotta hand
it to your “saint,” he's tough.

593
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,919
Before he went down,

594
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,400
he hip-threw my buddy,

595
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:20,359
foot on his neck, phone
out and calling the cops.

596
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:21,999
If the dose hadn't been strong enough,

597
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,920
who knows

598
00:31:22,921 --> 00:31:24,479
how that would've ended.

599
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,239
My bodhisattva...

600
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:28,000
of course he's tough.

601
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:34,719
But,

602
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,920
bringing him into my home?

603
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,479
It's really

604
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,319
dumb.

605
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,799
Relax.

606
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,160
I handled the cameras.

607
00:31:45,479 --> 00:31:46,598
When you're done,

608
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:48,759
I'll pack him up and dump
him back in the parking lot.

609
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,079
Chop-chop.

610
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,839
Lao Xiao,

611
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,239
do you even know how…

612
00:32:02,199 --> 00:32:04,040
with a man?

613
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,358
I'll take him back myself.

614
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:08,640
Don't worry about it.

615
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:12,118
I know you're crazy,

616
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:14,079
but this crazy?

617
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,039
Long night...

618
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,118
enjoy.

619
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:20,119
Oh, and

620
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:23,040
happy early birthday.

621
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:24,560
Consider this

622
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:27,239
my gift to you.

623
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,560
Still that wild-rose scent.

624
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,640
Even the Buddha fed himself to a tiger.

625
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,880
Bodhisattva…

626
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,319
let me have a bite,

627
00:33:16,479 --> 00:33:17,640
okay?

628
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,680
No answer?

629
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,800
I'll take that as a yes.

630
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:34,319
(Thai) Thank you, Buddha.

631
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,800
I've always wanted to tell you.

632
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:47,000
Your clothes are so ugly.

633
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,319
What about

634
00:33:50,199 --> 00:33:51,479
taking them off?

635
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,000
You Shulang...

636
00:34:21,479 --> 00:34:23,280
save me.

637
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,399
“Hmph” what?

638
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,840
Feels good?

639
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,280
You like being kissed by a man?

640
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:52,959
Your type

641
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,000
kisses in public, right?

642
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,959
Don't care if people see?

643
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:07,199
Fine—I'll indulge you.

644
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,000
Bodhisattva…

645
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,399
I'll spare you today.

646
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:44,479
But one day,

647
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,399
I'll make you crawl into
my bed on your own...

648
00:35:50,919 --> 00:35:52,840
begging me to have you.

649
00:36:22,479 --> 00:36:23,839
President Zhang...

650
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,718
Bold, Director You!

651
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:26,360
Come on...
another!

652
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:28,159
Drink!

653
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,840
Hey,

654
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,520
Shulang?

655
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:33,919
Shulang?

656
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,000
You Shulang?

657
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,199
Are you listening?

658
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:38,399
Fan Xiao?

659
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,158
What's wrong...

660
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:41,639
why so quiet?

661
00:36:42,479 --> 00:36:44,000
And your voice—why's it hoarse?

662
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,800
I drank too much last night...

663
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,959
blacked out a bit.

664
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:56,360
Why're you calling so early?

665
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:58,439
You really did drink.

666
00:36:58,919 --> 00:37:00,239
My car's in for service...

667
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,398
remember?

668
00:37:01,399 --> 00:37:03,840
You're driving me to the Bohai meeting.

669
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:05,280
Right...

670
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,760
give me twenty minutes...

671
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,040
Give you what?

672
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,959
Hello?

673
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:14,719
You Shulang?

674
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,320
I brought that turtleneck you wanted.

675
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:44,959
You drank so much

676
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,439
you puked on your shirt?

677
00:37:48,919 --> 00:37:50,280
Got a cigarette?

678
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,520
I'm out.

679
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,158
Your throat's wrecked...

680
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,239
skip the smoke.

681
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:56,159
Here,

682
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:57,199
have some...

683
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,879
Cigarette. I need a cigarette.

684
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,879
What's wrong with you?

685
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,320
Your girlfriend

686
00:38:08,321 --> 00:38:09,560
parties that hard?

687
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,999
Damn it… I think I was…

688
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,120
molested.

689
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:21,159
What?

690
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,639
By who?

691
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,520
This wasn't your girlfriend?

692
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,280
Is this like the drug from last time?

693
00:38:33,959 --> 00:38:35,159
I don't think so.

694
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,719
Last time, it only heightened desire.

695
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:41,239
But last night

696
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,520
I lost consciousness completely.

697
00:38:45,399 --> 00:38:47,080
Your lip's split...

698
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:48,919
Don't touch me...

699
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,959
Lemme see.

700
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,080
Does it hurt?

701
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,239
A bit.

702
00:38:58,719 --> 00:38:59,879
It's...

703
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:02,239
Bite marks?

704
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,320
Looks like it.

705
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:09,600
Anywhere else under your clothes?

706
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,520
Yeah.

707
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,199
Some pervert.

708
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:16,280
A real sicko.

709
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,800
So...

710
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:26,000
Just groping...

711
00:39:26,399 --> 00:39:27,600
nothing else.

712
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,439
Think back...

713
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:32,239
has anyone acted that
way toward you before?

714
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:38,599
You're the only clingy
person around me normally.

715
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,280
The rest are decent people.

716
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:42,159
I'm trying to be serious...

717
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:43,919
and you're joking?

718
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,040
My head is a mess.

719
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,399
I've got nothing.

720
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,360
I did go too hard.

721
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:55,840
Next time, lighter.

722
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,679
Shulang,

723
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,800
I'll find that bastard for you.

724
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,918
He will

725
00:40:04,919 --> 00:40:05,919
pay.

726
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,800
Yes...

727
00:40:07,801 --> 00:40:09,239
for the parking lot,

728
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,280
I need all the monitoring
videos during this period.

729
00:40:15,919 --> 00:40:17,559
You mean my drive recorder

730
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,520
took a video of

731
00:40:18,521 --> 00:40:19,959
an offender harming you?

732
00:40:20,479 --> 00:40:21,479
Yes,

733
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,119
the monitor video showed that

734
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,280
your dash cam was directly opposite my car

735
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,879
and it was turned on at that time.

736
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:33,399
So could you please help provide me with
evidence?

737
00:40:44,399 --> 00:40:45,159
Hello, sir.

738
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,718
Welcome to Fujin Club.

739
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:48,959
Do you have a reserved private room?

740
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,839
I'm waiting for somebody.

741
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,479
Sure.

742
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,959
Please call me if you need anything.

743
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,120
Shulang.

744
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,080
Fan Xiao.

745
00:41:31,879 --> 00:41:33,919
Sorry to ask you to
come out on short notice.

746
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,918
I remember you're
hosting a banquet tonight.

747
00:41:35,919 --> 00:41:37,399
I can host clients any time.

748
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,159
I won't skip out on Director You.

749
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,840
No need for politeness between us.

750
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,360
If you called so suddenly,
something must be up...?

751
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,840
There is, actually.

752
00:41:52,399 --> 00:41:54,479
The one who molested me…

753
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,959
I found him.
