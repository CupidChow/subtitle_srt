1
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:17,479
A wind that only seems gentle

2
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:22,440
Your gaze shimmers with a dark undertow

3
00:00:23,479 --> 00:00:28,119
Who is laughing at my madness

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,560
yet indulges my startled heart

5
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:38,959
I see through your mask

6
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:44,159
and let you probe my limits

7
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,758
It is I who indulge

8
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,400
Love blazes like fire

9
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,839
spreading

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,879
Hard to say who crossed the line first

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,758
and who is waiting for whom to yield

12
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,598
Sharing rouge-scented smoke

13
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,638
and the flame that collides at our lips

14
00:01:07,639 --> 00:01:10,000
fiercer than any tender lingering

15
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,838
a duel that stakes our pride

16
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:18,080
whether a calamity decreed by fate

17
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:23,319
or sweetness bestowed by heaven

18
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,638
I still choose craving, wrath, and folly's

19
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:30,278
mad notion

20
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:33,400
made real

21
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:40,719
To hold your gaze is far too perilous

22
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,838
I walk devoutly toward my ruin

23
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:54,839
You are my abyss

24
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,918
You are my

25
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:08,479
sunshine

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
"To My Shore"
(Episode 15)

27
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,320
You,

28
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,800
I found you a guy...

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,399
Lu Bowen.

30
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,918
Half Hua, half Portuguese.

31
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,000
Tall, handsome.

32
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:25,600
If you use him right,
he's a walking almanac...

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,320
flip to any page you like.

34
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,440
See if you like him.

35
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:29,679
Shulang,
Mm?

36
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,559
Need anything else?

37
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:33,080
I'm good.

38
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,320
Thanks.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,720
Waiter,

40
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,199
some nonfat milk, please.

41
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,679
Sure—one moment.

42
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,320
Shulang,

43
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,839
if it's not too personal…

44
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,119
are you...

45
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,039
Top.

46
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,160
Oh… is that a problem?

47
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:51,839
Why—doesn't fit?

48
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,639
I go by vibe.

49
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,720
If it's you,

50
00:02:57,839 --> 00:02:58,839
anything fits.

51
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:16,839
Bowen.

52
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,880
Shulang.

53
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,776
How come you're not wearing a scarf again?

54
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,520
It's cold...

55
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,800
take mine.

56
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,720
There's a theme-park restaurant nearby.

57
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:27,918
After we pick up Tiantian,

58
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:28,800
want to eat there?
I booked a table.

59
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,399
Sounds good.
Thanks.

60
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,000
What are you thanking me for?

61
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:34,919
Shulang,

62
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,559
you're always too polite with me.

63
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:37,839
C'mon...
the car's over there.

64
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
Mm.

65
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,255
It's jammed in front of the school...

66
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:00,199
let's walk.

67
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:01,279
Okay.

68
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,199
Careful...

69
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
are you alright?

70
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,320
I'm fine.

71
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,959
Took a spill.

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Help me with this.

73
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,398
Want a hand?

74
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,519
I'll pull you up.

75
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:50,200
No need.

76
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,200
You…

77
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,440
know him?

78
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,160
Is that him?

79
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,919
The bell's about to ring.

80
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
Let's go.

81
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,399
It's all fake.

82
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:57,079
All illusions.

83
00:05:58,839 --> 00:05:59,959
Don't be scared...

84
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,118
it'll pass.

85
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:04,679
It'll pass soon.

86
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,160
Don't lose it.

87
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,600
Don't bang your head.

88
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:12,480
Don't lose it, Fan Xiao.

89
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,520
You Shulang doesn't like crazy people.

90
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,000
It's okay.

91
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,959
He's doing great now.

92
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,000
He's happy.

93
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,000
See?

94
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,480
As long as I leave him alone...

95
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,040
as long as I stay away forever.

96
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,559
Yeah.

97
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,399
Leave.

98
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,079
Hey, taking this little red carpet up?

99
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,839
Lao Ding,
look,

100
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,440
it's been here forever...

101
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,600
the bricks are crumbling.

102
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,640
I'm pulling it up

103
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:09,200
so folks can walk easier.

104
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,439
True enough.

105
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,440
Time to work.

106
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,880
Go on then.

107
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
Shulang,

108
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,399
you'll lead the new project.

109
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,399
If I'm okay I won't come in.

110
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,880
I don't like the smell of hospitals.

111
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,359
But Third Young Master's sick,

112
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,799
so how could I not come visit?

113
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:51,959
Fan Xiao!

114
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,200
Fan Xiao,

115
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,399
you screwed me in the dark

116
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,960
and now you're here playing nice?

117
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,600
Watch your mouth.

118
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,959
Aren't you wronging me?

119
00:08:06,872 --> 00:08:08,511
You treat me like a friend.

120
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,760
Even when I hit bottom

121
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,440
you kept inviting me out.

122
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,320
I'm grateful.

123
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,679
Why would I hurt you?

124
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:20,920
I went after that You guy

125
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:22,480
and you fought back for him.

126
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,640
You two

127
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,799
are really a devoted couple, huh?

128
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,399
Fine, fine...

129
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,760
I'll eat it.

130
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,799
You beat me,

131
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,880
got your anger out...

132
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,760
what more do you want?

133
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,280
Nothing.

134
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,000
Just a reminder:

135
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,400
when you're sick, eat more fruit.

136
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,599
It's sweet.

137
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,039
Have some.

138
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,239
Get your damn hands off me!

139
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,640
Fan Xiao!
You...

140
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
Don't waste it.

141
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,678
I'm broke.

142
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,400
Fruit costs money.

143
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,200
What's going on? Bed 13...

144
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:04,039
no shouting.

145
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:07,559
He's cranky 'cause he's sick.

146
00:09:08,446 --> 00:09:09,766
I told him to eat fruit

147
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:10,919
and he gives me attitude.

148
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,799
Keep it down.

149
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,119
This is a ward.

150
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:16,599
Fan Xiao,

151
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,400
what the hell do you want!

152
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,080
Bai Pengyu,

153
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,080
when you toast me,

154
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,400
I might not toast you back.

155
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,679
But if you come for me,

156
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,239
I will pay it back double.

157
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
As for the mess between

158
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,559
me,

159
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,319
you, and You Shulang...

160
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,559
it ends here.

161
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,760
If you still won't let it go

162
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,599
and try anything else,

163
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:49,000
I'll take it all.

164
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,080
Fine, fine...

165
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,679
I get it.

166
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,039
If I ever see

167
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:58,919
you lovebirds again,

168
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:00,520
I'll walk the other way.

169
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,239
Good. Deal.

170
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,959
The Fan clan's collapsed.

171
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,478
Fan Xiao's barefoot now...

172
00:10:20,479 --> 00:10:21,919
nothing left to lose.

173
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,919
If there's nothing then why go after him?

174
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,439
I told you...

175
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,159
he holds grudges forever.

176
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,719
Relax...

177
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,799
he needs money now.

178
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:35,519
After he vents on you,

179
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,799
he won't keep his eyes on you.

180
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,000
Alright,

181
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,679
I'll visit you in a couple days...

182
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,840
bye.

183
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,679
That Bai Pengyu

184
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,400
counts as your friend,

185
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:49,200
and you sold him out without blinking.

186
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,559
A drinking buddy.

187
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:57,320
If I don't sell him,

188
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,080
should I sell you?

189
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,280
Oh...

190
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,440
house party tomorrow.
Come hang.

191
00:11:03,321 --> 00:11:04,679
It's been a while.

192
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,520
Can't. I've got two shipments arriving...

193
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:08,039
gotta unload.

194
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,479
Lao Xiao,

195
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:13,760
why torture yourself?

196
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,320
Even if home isn't what it was,

197
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:17,119
no one would dare mess with you.

198
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,400
Why stay here?

199
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,918
He doesn't want you anymore...

200
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,599
he's got a boyfriend.

201
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,200
How do you know he's got a boyfriend?

202
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:32,479
One of my buddies...

203
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:35,079
had a birthday party

204
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,199
at that club.

205
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,519
His boyfriend was there.

206
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,080
You Shulang came to pick him up.

207
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:41,080
Guess what I said...

208
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,558
I told him, “Your man just

209
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,320
groped a boy toy in the club.”

210
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,039
Your boyfriend didn't grope anyone.

211
00:11:56,552 --> 00:11:58,712
You came here just for that?

212
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:00,520
I didn't believe it anyway.

213
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:03,880
You think I want to be in this?

214
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,199
I bragged like an idiot

215
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,479
in front of him,

216
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,480
after he heard it he made
me come apologize...

217
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,039
I mean...

218
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:12,039
come explain

219
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,520
it wasn't his idea.

220
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,719
I don't think

221
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,478
he'd pull something

222
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:17,760
that cheap.

223
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,960
Hey

224
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,158
You two, man...

225
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,280
so forgiving of each other

226
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,479
Guess I'm the extra.

227
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,919
You Shulang,

228
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:28,159
Sometimes I really admire you.

229
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,200
How did Fan Xiao fall for you?

230
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:33,599
Should I be honored?

231
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,999
Don't get snarky.

232
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,440
He doesn't owe you anything...

233
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,799
oh right, right...

234
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,959
he wronged you first,

235
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,479
he owes you.

236
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,400
If you're here to whitewash him,

237
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:49,280
I don't have time

238
00:12:49,281 --> 00:12:51,239
to waste on something
as pointless as this.

239
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:54,520
What counts as “worthwhile,” huh?

240
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,520
Saving your time for what...

241
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,760
to cuddle with your new boyfriend?

242
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:10,719
Why are you...

243
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,080
why are you closing the blinds?

244
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:30,159
When do we settle our tab?

245
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:32,080
Our…

246
00:13:33,119 --> 00:13:34,200
tab? What tab?

247
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,640
You know exactly what.

248
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,520
Shouldn't you be going through
thick and thin with Bai Pengyu?

249
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,200
I…
He…

250
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,080
are you gonna hit me?

251
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,400
I wanted to drop it,

252
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,400
and to stop wasting energy on you two.

253
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:58,119
But you keep popping up.

254
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,039
Either I do it—or you do it yourself.

255
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,119
Do… what?

256
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,400
Use this ashtray.

257
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,599
There's nothing else handy.

258
00:14:18,152 --> 00:14:19,873
At least draw some blood.

259
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,320
…Okay.

260
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:46,159
Don't dodge.

261
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,440
If once isn't enough, do it again.

262
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,000
Young Master Shi, delicate as you are...

263
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,280
blood shows nicely.

264
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:57,039
I don't owe you!

265
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,200
Feel wronged?

266
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:14,239
How about this: you hit me once,

267
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:16,960
and I'll send you to someone else's bed.

268
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,599
Not wronged.

269
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,719
I deserve it, alright?

270
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,038
Last time I got smacked

271
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:33,919
was when my grandpa kicked me as a kid.

272
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,520
What were you going to say?

273
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,200
I've got five minutes till lunch.

274
00:15:57,234 --> 00:15:58,354
[exasperated swearing]

275
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,520
Would it kill you not to
act all high and mighty?

276
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:04,679
What...

277
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,320
Five minutes not enough
for your bromance speech?

278
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,559
Want me to play you
a Jay Chou ballad?

279
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,640
Neither of you

280
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:16,960
wants to listen or talk,

281
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,000
so I'm the only fool.

282
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,280
You Shulang,

283
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,559
I get it that you hate Fan Xiao,

284
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:27,159
but he's carried a lot for you.

285
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,719
He could've walked away clean

286
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,440
from his family's case,

287
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:32,118
but he threw himself in to cool you down...

288
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:34,039
took the heat

289
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:37,559
to protect you—the whistleblower.

290
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,479
He publicly admitted he reported them.

291
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,479
After jail, he got hunted for three months.

292
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,119
Three months!

293
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,679
Hunted.

294
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,880
What did he tell you...

295
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,200
that he spent six months inside?

296
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:56,679
He only did three.

297
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:57,799
When he got out

298
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:59,960
he left Thailand to draw them off,

299
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,455
but they still found his place...

300
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,200
doused it in gasoline

301
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,280
and torched it.

302
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,599
The police stepped in

303
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,479
and put him in a safehouse.

304
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,880
Three months later

305
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,000
the big boss died in an internal feud.

306
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,439
Only then was Fan free.

307
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,640
After that he didn't dare come find you...

308
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,040
part of it was that he promised you,

309
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,520
part of it was the fear that they'd
go after you.

310
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:41,839
Also...

311
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:43,640
It was Fan

312
00:17:43,641 --> 00:17:46,040
who asked Tiantian's mom to call you.

313
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:48,280
He knew you were lonely

314
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:50,319
and you'd like that kid.

315
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:52,118
I never thought

316
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:53,599
you'd actually adopt him.

317
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:56,239
He said if you didn't, he would...

318
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,479
because you saved that kid together.

319
00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:09,640
Anything else?

320
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,560
You're over time.

321
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,599
Oh my god—the bodhisattva.

322
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,160
This is the “bodhisattva” that
Fan Xiao keeps talking about.

323
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,719
I'm so pissed off!!!!!!!

324
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,519
Hey! Tell it in detail...

325
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,239
exactly how did
our Director You beat you up?

326
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,119
Fan Xiao, enough.

327
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,640
Was he handsome?

328
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:05,839
Yes!

329
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,119
Super handsome!

330
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:08,439
So what?

331
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,640
You Shulang's got a boyfriend...

332
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,199
he's not yours anymore.

333
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,280
Fan Xiao,

334
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,640
wake the hell up.

335
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:17,239
Oh right...

336
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,199
party tonight.

337
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,239
Come out.

338
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,400
Can't.

339
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,319
Turning in early.

340
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:26,016
Tomorrow I'm doing something
nice at the welfare home.

341
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,040
Where?

342
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:31,479
Careful, Tiantian.

343
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:45,000
Uncle...

344
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:46,839
There's a bouquet of sunflowers here too,

345
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:48,800
just like ours.

346
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,199
Shulang,

347
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:52,520
why do you think our mom liked sunflowers?

348
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,560
Because...
Wait...

349
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:55,479
let me guess.

350
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,598
Because they're bright

351
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:58,680
and always face the sun!

352
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:01,479
Because they make seeds.

353
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:03,439
My mom loved sunflower seeds.

354
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:04,640
No way...

355
00:20:04,719 --> 00:20:05,838
I don't buy it.

356
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:06,839
Don't mess with me.

357
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:20,119
Mom,

358
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,400
I'm here to see you.

359
00:20:23,199 --> 00:20:24,640
Look who I brought...

360
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:26,239
Tiantian,

361
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,280
my little nephew.

362
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,439
Hey, Shulang.

363
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,280
Happy New Year, Professor.

364
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:49,839
Wishing you the best.

365
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:52,199
And to you.

366
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,680
Shulang,

367
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,079
I've been meaning to talk

368
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:58,400
but I didn't know how to start.

369
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:00,880
Since you called,

370
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:03,920
I guess there's no time like the present.

371
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:05,040
Sounds serious.

372
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,880
If it's overtime,

373
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:09,839
I'm charging double.

374
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,640
I'll pay triple...

375
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:13,959
as long as you don't resent me.

376
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,800
Can't...

377
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,000
all the respect for my
teacher and the like.

378
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,520
What is it?

379
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:22,040
After the holiday

380
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,400
I'm stepping down as GM of Changling.

381
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,040
I want you to take over.

382
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:28,439
Professor,

383
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,959
If you've decided to retire,

384
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,760
I support you.

385
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,160
But

386
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,800
I'm not the right pick...

387
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,640
I don't have the credentials.

388
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:41,079
I'm still a part-time grad student.

389
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,880
You can find someone better.

390
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:45,479
Maybe not the credentials...

391
00:21:46,199 --> 00:21:47,959
but you have the ability.

392
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,680
And you care about Changling.

393
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,319
A helmsman doesn't have
to be the top specialist.

394
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:02,040
Clear direction,

395
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,680
sound strategy,

396
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:08,000
and the ability to marshal
people and resources.

397
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,760
Also,

398
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,280
you're Changling's
second-largest shareholder.

399
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,479
If you don't sit in that chair,

400
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:16,760
who should?

401
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:18,119
Wait—what did you just say?

402
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,800
Remember

403
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:22,439
that deal with Fan Xiao...

404
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,199
about optimizing the honeysuckle
drink's process in twenty days,

405
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,400
or

406
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:29,839
He'd sue me

407
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:31,800
and Changling?

408
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:33,439
That was

409
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,880
a con we pulled on you—together.

410
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,759
Fan thought

411
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,680
you were in a bad way back then.

412
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:45,479
He wanted to spark your will to live.

413
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:49,119
I'm not making excuses...

414
00:22:49,439 --> 00:22:51,400
there was care for you…

415
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:55,079
and it also let us push
for more investment.

416
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:57,680
I didn't expect he'd invest that much

417
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,920
and convert it all to equity in your name.

418
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,679
Every dividend

419
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,719
is on the books...

420
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:09,079
you can withdraw anytime.

421
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,800
Fan said

422
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:13,000
to tell you in three years.

423
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,680
He said,

424
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,319
by then

425
00:23:17,719 --> 00:23:19,119
maybe you'd have

426
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:22,000
forgotten him

427
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:25,079
and accept this as compensation.

428
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,400
Professor,

429
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,040
do you think compensation like that

430
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,760
helps?

431
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,999
Long time no see...

432
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,479
cheers, cheers!

433
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,560
Cheers!

434
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:40,959
Cheers!

435
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:41,520
You,

436
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,695
how'd you get here tonight?

437
00:23:42,719 --> 00:23:43,719
Me?

438
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,575
Rode over in a car worth a few million...

439
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:47,640
with a dedicated driver.

440
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,239
No way...

441
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,400
seriously?

442
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,479
Bus 521.

443
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:56,599
Next time I'll pick you up.

444
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,719
Man, these years...

445
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,760
I've had my fill of heartbreak with women.

446
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,599
Maybe I'll switch

447
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:04,359
to brotherhood.

448
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,959
Not every blade of grass works, buddy.

449
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,400
Kidding.

450
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,520
Cards—let's go.

451
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,760
You guys go.

452
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,400
I'll join later.
Cool...
let's move.

453
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:15,239
En

454
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,640
Xiao Nie...
Come on...

455
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:18,439
let's go.

456
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,719
Huihui,

457
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,920
Hmm?

458
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:31,880
Where'd your big waves go?
Why no curls?

459
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,920
Straight hair now?

460
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:35,640
The sultry mature look's out.

461
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,239
Does it look good?

462
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,520
Hmmm.

463
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Looks good.

464
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:44,760
Knew you'd give the straight-guy answer.

465
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,920
You don't act like a gay man at all...

466
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,719
and your ex didn't either.

467
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:57,560
Know my New Year's wish?

468
00:24:59,719 --> 00:25:00,760
Find a scumbag

469
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:02,560
and wreck him for once.

470
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,599
Zhang Shicheng's a good guy.

471
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:09,640
He's waited for you for years.

472
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,000
He is too good,
that's why I can't do it.

473
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:15,160
Someone like me

474
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,920
will hurt everyone.

475
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,959
I'm better matched with a scumbag.

476
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,839
Then be straight with Zhang Shicheng.

477
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,199
Cut it off clean.

478
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:26,000
Don't let him keep hoping.

479
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:29,400
I've tried to break it off so many times,

480
00:25:29,866 --> 00:25:31,345
but I can't.

481
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:34,800
People like us...

482
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,479
the more we lack something,

483
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,319
the more we hate it.

484
00:25:39,673 --> 00:25:41,393
Sometimes you can't tell

485
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,479
if you hate it or crave it.

486
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:46,119
Zhang Shicheng...

487
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,079
I can't let go.

488
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,959
I'm scared to hurt him…

489
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,239
and to shatter my own dream.

490
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,079
So you just keep him hanging?

491
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,119
I'm not keeping him hanging...

492
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,520
it's him who still loves me.

493
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,040
If he didn't,

494
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,839
nothing I do would matter.

495
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,280
So…

496
00:26:19,199 --> 00:26:20,680
still in love?

497
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,239
Bye.
Bye.

498
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:23,839
Bye then.
Take care.

499
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:25,680
Bye.

500
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:26,719
En

501
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:28,319
Then I'm off, You.

502
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:28,760
Okay.
See you next time.

503
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,079
Bye.

504
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,175
Sure you don't need me to see you off?

505
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:35,119
What—my patch of grass not good enough?

506
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,479
Scram.

507
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,640
I called a ride.

508
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,680
Alright—bye.

509
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:39,959
Bye.

510
00:27:21,199 --> 00:27:23,040
Hi there—what can I get you?

511
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Baijiu.

512
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:26,280
Strongest you've got.

513
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:27,839
Got it.

514
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,160
Sir,

515
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:40,000
anything else?

516
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,160
What?

517
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,479
Not gonna invite me in?

518
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,119
All these meds...

519
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,040
you flipping them?

520
00:28:27,719 --> 00:28:28,719
Yeah.

521
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,479
Doing patent TCM too?

522
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:34,839
Yeah.

523
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,320
I see what people are talking about,

524
00:28:36,479 --> 00:28:37,719
and try a little of everything.

525
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,719
You sleep here at night?

526
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:45,800
Usually no.

527
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,839
The guard went home for the holiday,

528
00:28:48,239 --> 00:28:49,439
and recently

529
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,160
I've got shipments,

530
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,040
so I'm staying a couple days.

531
00:28:54,439 --> 00:28:56,160
You unload all this yourself?

532
00:28:56,479 --> 00:28:57,079
Yeah.

533
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,479
Doing it myself

534
00:28:59,479 --> 00:29:00,520
keeps me calm.

535
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:03,079
Sit.

536
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,520
Mind if I sit on the bed?

537
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:28,000
Why aren't you asking
me why I came here today?

538
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:32,119
Don't dare to ask.

539
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,760
Take a guess.

540
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,560
To rake me over the
coals, I'm guessing.

541
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:39,880
Huang Qimin told me...

542
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:41,520
he confessed

543
00:29:41,719 --> 00:29:43,079
that we lied to you.

544
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,239
You think that was atonement?

545
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,439
That day at the shrine,

546
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,199
hearing what you said
to your mom's tablet...

547
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,200
I was terrified you'd kill yourself.

548
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,319
So much.

549
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,839
You might not believe me,

550
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:05,199
I never saw it as atonement.

551
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:08,040
I just wanted you doing what you love...

552
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:10,760
to have you shine again.

553
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:13,199
Later I realized

554
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,478
you don't need wealth or status

555
00:30:16,479 --> 00:30:18,119
to live a shining life

556
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:21,599
as long as

557
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,719
I disappear from your life.

558
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,040
I can't take those shares.

559
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:37,239
I knew you'd say that.

560
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
I'm fine on my own...

561
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,880
the money I make covers me.

562
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,318
Those shares...

563
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:46,319
if you won't take them,

564
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:48,839
hold them for Tiantian.

565
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:51,719
I'll never have kids.

566
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,680
We saved him together.

567
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,119
So

568
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,040
Whether he acknowledges me or not,

569
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,000
he's my kid in my heart.

570
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,400
Fine...

571
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:10,079
I'll hold them for Tiantian.

572
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:17,959
It's cold...

573
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,680
come sit.

574
00:31:41,273 --> 00:31:43,112
Why didn't you go after Bowen?

575
00:31:44,199 --> 00:31:45,199
I checked him out.

576
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:48,400
He's a decent guy...

577
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,520
better than me.

578
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,319
And if he weren't?

579
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,280
Even if you blamed me,

580
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:58,599
I'd still “fix” him.

581
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,920
If Bowen's so good,

582
00:32:02,439 --> 00:32:04,199
won't you give us your blessing?

583
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,280
You Shulang,

584
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,160
it's too much.

585
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,599
Ask for a blessing is too much?

586
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,400
Didn't you watch us kiss the other night?

587
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:16,119
You Shulang,

588
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,119
What are you here for?

589
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,319
If you came to make me suffer,

590
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,160
you don't have to.

591
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:24,880
I'm already suffering.

592
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:27,479
I know I am guilty,

593
00:32:28,439 --> 00:32:29,959
so I deserve it.

594
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:32,560
But I'm begging you...

595
00:32:33,199 --> 00:32:34,920
leave me a way to live.

596
00:32:35,439 --> 00:32:36,478
Don't

597
00:32:36,479 --> 00:32:37,598
come all this way

598
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:39,280
just to remind me of that night!

599
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:42,160
So

600
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,000
You really were there?

601
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,400
I was.

602
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:49,119
I told you—I'd spend
every New Year with you,

603
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,640
even if

604
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,280
I wasn't by your side.

605
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,880
So you saw it?

606
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:01,400
The fireworks lit the two of you
up so clearly, as if it was day!

607
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,920
Shulang,

608
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:13,560
I've worked so damn hard to get here,

609
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:15,319
to set you free

610
00:33:16,479 --> 00:33:17,479
and see you happy.

611
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:19,439
I've held back for so long...

612
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,760
I won't blow it now.

613
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,319
But if you dare light that fuse again,

614
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,760
I swear I'll take you right here!

615
00:33:33,239 --> 00:33:34,239
Fan Xiao...

616
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,560
are you gonna behave from now on?

617
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,040
What?

618
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,319
I asked you

619
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,920
one last time: will you behave?

620
00:33:43,199 --> 00:33:44,880
I asked you once before

621
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:46,800
and you lied.

622
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,560
I'm asking one more time:

623
00:33:50,479 --> 00:33:52,160
one last time.

624
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,159
If we're together,

625
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,239
will you behave?

626
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,719
Can't say it...

627
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:06,119
or can't do it?

628
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,199
I will.

629
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:17,840
I'll listen. I'll behave.

630
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,399
No lies,

631
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,040
no schemes...

632
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:23,399
never again.

633
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,800
Shulang...

634
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,959
I swear.

635
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,399
Weren't you about to “take me”?

636
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,439
You and that

637
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:49,199
Lu Bowen...

638
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,719
he has his baggage.

639
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,040
So do I.

640
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,520
You've been drinking?

641
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:01,879
Mm.

642
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,440
I don't want you doing
something drunk that you'll regret.

643
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,439
I am drunk.

644
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:19,120
So—do you want me

645
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,159
or not?

646
00:35:23,879 --> 00:35:25,040
…No.

647
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:26,760
No?

648
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:32,639
I don't want a one-night stand.

649
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,520
You Shulang,

650
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,799
I can't switch my feelings

651
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,280
on and off.

652
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,959
You know how hard it was for me to let go.

653
00:35:44,479 --> 00:35:46,478
I keep telling myself not to go crazy...

654
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:47,760
because it hurts you.

655
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,719
Now

656
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:51,719
I was this close to accepting

657
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,398
watching over you from afar.

658
00:35:53,399 --> 00:35:54,760
Guarding you in your life

659
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,039
If you come to me now,
drunk and nostalgic...

660
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:04,159
You Shulang,

661
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:05,040
you're drunk now,
thinking of old feelings,

662
00:36:05,879 --> 00:36:06,639
thinking of me.
When you sober up tomorrow,

663
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,399
you'll regret this.

664
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:11,399
Then what...

665
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:12,800
hate me more,
run further,

666
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,599
or come drunk again?

667
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,120
I don't want any of that.

668
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,760
You really don't want me?

669
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:55,560
In a year

670
00:36:55,879 --> 00:36:58,040
you've built muscle, President Fan.

671
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,919
And you've gotten more composed.

672
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,479
Or is

673
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:24,040
my charm fading?

674
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:36,479
You sure you don't want me?

675
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,840
You Shulang,

676
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,320
You're insane.

677
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:45,479
You talk too much.

678
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:49,399
This was your favorite spot to bite.

679
00:37:54,479 --> 00:37:56,080
Fan Xiao, you're a wolf, huh?

680
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,239
What?

681
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:20,320
Nothing...

682
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,760
the bed collapsed.

683
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,719
Keep going.

684
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:34,239
Brother Fan,

685
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,000
didn't we set a time?

686
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,080
If you're free,

687
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:38,159
let's move it now.

688
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:39,280
Someone's asleep inside.

689
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,800
It'll be noisy to haul.

690
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,560
No

691
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,600
Not today.

692
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:44,320
Oh,

693
00:39:44,479 --> 00:39:45,959
so someone's sleeping?

694
00:39:46,439 --> 00:39:47,120
Who's

695
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,175
important enough for
Brother Fan to guard like that?

696
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:50,199
My other half.

697
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,120
My partner.

698
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,600
Heading out?

699
00:40:06,399 --> 00:40:07,600
Mm.

700
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,080
I'm hungry...

701
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:20,479
let's go for breakfast.

702
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:28,239
Come with me...

703
00:40:29,439 --> 00:40:30,439
my love.

704
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:49,119
In the crowd

705
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,679
I was spotted in an instant

706
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,198
The desolation in your eyes

707
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:59,359
Hiding the same fire inside

708
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,039
No need for words

709
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,360
No need to ask what's right or wrong

710
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,878
The moment we drew close

711
00:41:07,879 --> 00:41:10,600
The outcome was already destined

712
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,280
Is the moth drawn to the light

713
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,639
Or the whale sinking into the deep

714
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:26,759
With nothing but solitary courage

715
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,320
I wager it all on tomorrow

716
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,319
The walls of the world

717
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,600
What does it matter if I break them down

718
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,039
My chest burns with heat

719
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,239
Screaming only for you

720
00:41:43,399 --> 00:41:46,039
I'll love you until it boils over

721
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,320
Loving without a care for the world

722
00:41:48,959 --> 00:41:50,079
Like two stars

723
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,080
Colliding and shattering in the night sky

724
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,280
Even if it's just for a moment

725
00:41:53,281 --> 00:41:54,878
It's more than enough to surpass forever

726
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,158
Hate and love both burn brightly

727
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:58,839
Loving until the sky falls dark

728
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,800
Loving until we reach the end of the road

729
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,599
Before the altar

730
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,718
We burn all the incense

731
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:05,799
Not asking for the next life

732
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,319
Only desiring this moment

733
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,519
Drowning together with you in

734
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,760
This blazing fire of fate
