1
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,999
"To My Shore."

2
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,600
The guy who molested me.

3
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,800
I found him.

4
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,478
He's here, in this club.

5
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,600
How did you find him?

6
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:26,239
Let's go hear what he has to say first.

7
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:48,160
I'll go scout ahead.

8
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,839
Who the hell are you?

9
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,080
Young Master Bai.

10
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:02,559
I need a word with you.

11
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,679
Turn the lights back on.

12
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,240
Clear the room.

13
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,520
Who the hell is this?

14
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:09,399
Weird.

15
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,479
Who the hell are you?

16
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,240
Young Master Bai.

17
00:03:11,241 --> 00:03:13,160
Didn't expect it to be you in here.

18
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,520
You know him?

19
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,559
I do.

20
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,479
Met him at one of Shi Lihua's parties.

21
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,999
What do you two want?

22
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,760
You barge in and start
smashing things, huh?

23
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:25,959
What do we want with you?

24
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,320
You know exactly why.

25
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,799
Since I could find you today

26
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,880
I came prepared.

27
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,360
If you don't mind an audience,

28
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,279
then I don't either.

29
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,440
Fine.

30
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:38,679
Let's talk.

31
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,999
Everybody get the hell out,

32
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,360
I've got real business to discuss.

33
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:44,398
Go warm up another room

34
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:45,440
I'll be there later.

35
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:46,999
We'll be waiting, Young Master Bai.

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,800
We'll be waiting, bro.
We'll head over first.

37
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:53,838
All right

38
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:54,839
talk.

39
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:56,719
Young Master Bai.

40
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,400
Even though we don't know each other well,

41
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,960
we do have Shi Lihua in common.

42
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:02,319
So.

43
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,800
If you've got anything to say.

44
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,800
Think it over carefully.

45
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,478
And don't play coy.

46
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,720
President Fan, right?

47
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,600
What relationship do you have with
this gentleman who wants to talk to me?

48
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,919
He's my friend.

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,079
Oh—friends.

50
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,078
Young Master Bai.

51
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,238
Today

52
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:23,239
I'm here for an explanation.

53
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,279
With this chemistry...

54
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,958
If I hadn't personally got him to the bed

55
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,679
I might believe they're just “friends”.

56
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:31,359
Real good at pretending.

57
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,519
What are you on about guy?

58
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:35,798
What “explanation”?

59
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:36,999
I don't follow.

60
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,640
That tracks.

61
00:04:37,641 --> 00:04:40,000
You've done so many filthy things.

62
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,720
You can't keep track of them all.

63
00:04:43,799 --> 00:04:45,079
Let me jog your memory...

64
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,160
last Thursday night.

65
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:50,279
The Qiyue Hotel parking lot.

66
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:58,760
Then tell me...

67
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,238
that night.

68
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:03,079
What exactly did I do to you?

69
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:04,439
What the hell are you looking at?

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,920
I wouldn't be here without proof.

71
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:08,359
Young Master Bai.

72
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,679
If you've got no explanation

73
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:13,119
I'll assume it was you.

74
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,839
Then today, I'm afriad
I'm here to settle the score.

75
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:20,278
How do you plan on doing that?

76
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,320
Simple.

77
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:24,880
An eye for an eye.

78
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,880
Whatever you did to me

79
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:29,119
I'll return in kind.

80
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,719
Young Master Bai.

81
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,078
Where do we start undressing you?

82
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,238
Screw you!

83
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:34,760
I'm straight.
Young Master Bai.

84
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:37,320
Watch your mouth.

85
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:39,640
Your phone's been ringing.

86
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,880
Take the call first.

87
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,879
Calm down.

88
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,079
Then we'll talk.

89
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,119
Fan Xiao.

90
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,720
How the hell are we supposed to talk?

91
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:48,959
No rush.

92
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,760
Take the call first.

93
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,439
Sit.

94
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,959
We'll talk slowly.

95
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,040
Hello.

96
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,959
Okay.

97
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,519
Fine—I admit it

98
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,600
I did it.

99
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,720
Why?

100
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:14,959
Why the hell do you think?

101
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:15,839
I took a little something.

102
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,959
Got revved up.

103
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,559
No one was around.

104
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,398
You looked decent.

105
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,279
Good enough.

106
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,759
You carry ether on you?

107
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,640
And what if I do?

108
00:06:23,641 --> 00:06:25,160
My hobby—problem?

109
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:26,559
Just say it.
How much?

110
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,160
I don't want your money.

111
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,079
Then what do you want?

112
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:39,479
What you just said won't fly.

113
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,399
Relax

114
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,136
I can't bring myself to
put my mouth on you.

115
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,518
Give me ten minutes to beat you.

116
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,880
We call it even.

117
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,150
Fuck!

118
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,119
You dare lay a hand on me?

119
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,559
I'll kill you today!

120
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,159
Dare hit me, huh?

121
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,760
I'll bust your head for free today.

122
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,238
You dare swing that at him?

123
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:03,518
Say the word if you want to die.

124
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,040
Fan Xiao.
Don't...

125
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,519
Don't worry.

126
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:06,959
I won't take his life

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,279
I'll handle the dirty work.

128
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:12,278
Ten minutes.

129
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,399
Time me.

130
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,200
Fan Xiao.

131
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:18,359
You're really doing this...

132
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,040
If we're doing the play, do the whole act.

133
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,546
Thanks for your cooperation,
Young Master Bai.

134
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,150
Bastard.

135
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,919
I'm done playing,

136
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,279
I'll spill everything.

137
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,559
Not even for Anna?

138
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,880
Shi Lihua said you could
have her sleep with me.

139
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,079
Is that for real?

140
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,040
She's a beauty queen after all

141
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,720
I'll have her come out
to drink with you first.

142
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,679
Whether you can take her home
or not depends on your skills.

143
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,880
Then hurry—hit me quick.

144
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,040
I'll stick to exposed skin then.

145
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,678
The effect is better.

146
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,040
And you'll suffer less.

147
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
Apologies in advance.

148
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:14,200
No more.

149
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,640
Any more and I'll see the King of Hell.

150
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,040
Fine.

151
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,399
One last hit.

152
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:22,278
Remember in a minute.

153
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,798
Scream louder.

154
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:24,799
Fan Xiao.

155
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,880
What are you doing?

156
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,640
Our Bai family isn't made up of easy
targets.

157
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,200
Just scream.

158
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,799
What are you doing?

159
00:08:51,359 --> 00:08:52,839
Tell me...

160
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,158
Will the person outside feel sorry?

161
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,159
I…

162
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,840
I don't know.

163
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:00,519
Young Master Bai.

164
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,359
You must take the fall for this.

165
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,840
Remember what I said.

166
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:06,119
Offend anyone but not Fan Xiao.

167
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,880
He'll smile and play you to death.

168
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,640
I should ask him for something good.

169
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:19,359
Thanks for your hard
work, Young Master Bai.

170
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,640
Let's go.

171
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,400
Wait—your hand.

172
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,079
It's nothing

173
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,119
I just banged it when I
worked that punk over.

174
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,200
Just hit the wall by accident.

175
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:57,359
No.

176
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,440
To the hospital.

177
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,200
(Episode 4)

178
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,119
Welcome, Director You to my humble abode.

179
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,199
Your right hand just got put in a splint.

180
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
Don't move it.

181
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:24,038
Whatever you have trouble doing, just tell
me.

182
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,039
I'll help you.

183
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,239
It's really nothing

184
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:30,799
I'll do it.

185
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,719
You're a grown man—don't be stubborn.

186
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,599
Slow down.

187
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,559
Your metacarpal's fractured.

188
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,919
And you say “no big deal”.

189
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,280
The doctor also said if this doesn't
heal right, you'll have longterm problems.

190
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:49,200
Fan Xiao.

191
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:50,759
You've been in Thailand a while.

192
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,640
Why does your place still look like a
showroom?

193
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,359
I'm mostly at the office

194
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:57,551
I live here for the quietness.

195
00:10:58,479 --> 00:10:59,960
You can check the terrace.

196
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,640
The view's great.

197
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,358
At night.

198
00:11:11,359 --> 00:11:13,000
You can only see the mountain outlines.

199
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:15,880
In the daytime, especially after rain.

200
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
It's beautiful.

201
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,960
If there's anything that you can't do easily
one-handed before you sleep, just let me know.

202
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,719
This collar's a little tight.

203
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,959
Do you mind giving me a hand, Director You?

204
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,798
It's not like both hands are useless.

205
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:45,880
Use your left.

206
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
Useless.

207
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,999
Don't move your right hand.

208
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Come here.

209
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:03,679
Come.

210
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,760
Slow down.

211
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,440
Director You really does care about me.

212
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:09,119
Zip it.

213
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,200
Chin down.

214
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,039
What are you doing?

215
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,480
The curtain remote,
I've been looking for it forever.

216
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:56,320
It was wedged in the sofa behind you.

217
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,478
Director You.

218
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:02,960
There are two buttons left.

219
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,280
There.

220
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,440
I'll change into a robe.

221
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,239
Fan Xiao

222
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,598
I think the person who molested me

223
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:33,999
wasn't Bai Pengyu.

224
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
How so?

225
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,598
Last time I deliberately said

226
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:38,999
“an eye for an eye”

227
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
to test him.

228
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:43,760
But he clearly hates men.

229
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,358
He took something

230
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:46,280
and drank.

231
00:13:46,281 --> 00:13:48,798
When you're that out of it,

232
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,080
you don't care.

233
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,798
You shouldn't drink on meds.

234
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:54,839
I know.

235
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,840
This is for you...

236
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,718
have a little to relax

237
00:13:57,719 --> 00:13:59,358
and sleep.

238
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:00,719
If you're not at ease,

239
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:01,799
we'll keep digging.

240
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,840
The lady boss who poured you drinks...

241
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,000
I checked.

242
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,080
It wasn't her.
We'll see.

243
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,880
Either way,

244
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,656
thanks, Fan Xiao.

245
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,520
Honestly…

246
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,080
from childhood to now,

247
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,280
few people have ever
protected me like this.

248
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:22,919
What?

249
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,640
Do you know

250
00:14:25,641 --> 00:14:26,918
what the women at our company

251
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:28,080
say about you?

252
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,239
What do they say?

253
00:14:30,479 --> 00:14:31,639
They say

254
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,479
you're the brooding, scheming male lead...

255
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,558
anyone you latch onto,

256
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:38,239
things always end poorly for them.

257
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,479
If they knew

258
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,320
you're this childish and clingy,

259
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,280
what would they think?

260
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,359
You Shulang.

261
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,640
I don't care what they think.

262
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,440
I only want to know

263
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,159
what you think.

264
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,358
It's late.

265
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:17,559
You won't get a cab here.

266
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:19,359
Just don't go back.

267
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,719
I can't drive with this hand.

268
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,280
Tomorrow I'll trouble
you to take me to work.

269
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,679
The guest room has its own bath.

270
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:27,999
The bedding's new.

271
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
No one's used it.

272
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:30,639
Treat it like a hotel

273
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,640
for the night.

274
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:38,079
Keep the hand dry after you go home.

275
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,559
I'll prescribe antibiotics.

276
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,759
You may run a fever tonight,

277
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,760
keep an eye on it.

278
00:15:58,119 --> 00:15:59,119
Fan Xiao.

279
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,559
Fan Xiao.

280
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,520
Fan Xiao.

281
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,679
Are you feeling unwell?

282
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,200
Shulang.

283
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:15,919
I am actually feeling unwell.

284
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,719
You said you'd help me.

285
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,640
Fan Xiao.

286
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:37,039
I'm just asking a favor.

287
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:39,199
No need to throw a punch if you disagree.

288
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:40,239
Fan Xiao.

289
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,079
I'm gay.

290
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,000
I can't play these straight-boy games with
you.

291
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:01,479
We're here.

292
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,000
Out you go.

293
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:06,879
My top button...

294
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,680
it's been undone since we left.

295
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,958
Director You,

296
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,800
you're really just going to ignore me?

297
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,679
The Director You I know

298
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,719
even helps strangers.

299
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:21,040
How come with me,

300
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,520
I don't get that treatment?

301
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,519
You still want my help?

302
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,800
Don't mind it, Director You.

303
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,400
Orientation is everyone's freedom.

304
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
Unless

305
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:37,359
you're insecure?

306
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:39,039
No.

307
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,040
I'm just afraid you'll...

308
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,439
You underestimate me.

309
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:44,599
It's just being gay.

310
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:47,520
Did you forget where we are?

311
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,040
(Thai) Hello.

312
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:51,439
Gay marriage is legal.

313
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,599
So… the button?

314
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:00,359
Useless.

315
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:02,359
Come here.

316
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,920
Done.

317
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,719
So your “girlfriend”

318
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,680
is actually a man.

319
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,680
I didn't mean to hide it.

320
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,359
I'll introduce you sometime.

321
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,760
Go on—get out.

322
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:30,800
I'm going to be late.

323
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:42,478
I can't hold back.

324
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:43,599
I want you.

325
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:46,199
Huh? What does that mean?

326
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,959
Wishing you a great day.

327
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:00,400
A Huo...

328
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,719
the antique ring from the auction...

329
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,119
send it to Lu Zhen.

330
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,400
It's time to give him a nudge.

331
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,920
So there really is no other reason for you
breaking up with me?

332
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,000
I'm not good enough for you.

333
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:26,760
You sure?

334
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,920
Mr. Lu,

335
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:32,040
President Fan asked
me to bring these to you.

336
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,319
That's not right.

337
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,679
I can't take gifts I didn't earn.

338
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:38,119
How can I keep letting President Fan
send me gifts?

339
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,880
Mr. Lu,

340
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:40,280
I'm just following orders.

341
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,999
If you don't like them,

342
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,200
take it up with President Fan.

343
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,959
President Fan...

344
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,319
has he been busy lately?

345
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,360
Why is he always sending gifts through you?

346
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:52,118
Our boss

347
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:53,800
is very possessive.

348
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:56,920
Take care of yourself.

349
00:19:57,719 --> 00:19:58,719
I'm off.

350
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,800
Uncle You...

351
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,760
Lu Zhen

352
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,800
there's no room for me
in your heart anymore.

353
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,520
The environments you work in are
complicated.

354
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,520
Protect yourself from now on.

355
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:23,599
Uncle You...

356
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,078
You Shulang

357
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:29,520
did you ever love me?

358
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:32,520
You're very good to me...

359
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,919
thoughtful,

360
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,119
attentive.

361
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,040
But is that love?

362
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:43,280
You're a flawless boyfriend,

363
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:45,959
but I can't feel your existence.

364
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:47,438
Your joy and anger and sorrow...

365
00:20:47,439 --> 00:20:48,920
I can't share in them.

366
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:50,718
When you're silent,

367
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:51,920
when you smoke,

368
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:53,359
when you smile,

369
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:56,040
I always feel like you're alone.

370
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:58,838
Even with your arm around me,

371
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:00,358
right by my side,

372
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,319
I still can't feel you here.

373
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:04,680
I still feel you're alone.

374
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:07,199
No matter how I try, I can't get in.

375
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:10,680
Do you know?

376
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,279
That kind of defeat

377
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,959
is truly crushing.

378
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,400
Director You,

379
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:24,078
this booze is strong...

380
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:25,359
don't chug it.

381
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,958
Why are you drinking?

382
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:28,039
Your hand isn't healed yet.

383
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:29,040
You can't drink.
No...

384
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,760
fruit tea.

385
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:32,598
What's wrong...

386
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:33,599
bad mood?

387
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,838
Know how I can tell

388
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,079
you're unhappy?

389
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,040
Because we're the same kind.

390
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:47,719
What kind?

391
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,160
People who wear masks.

392
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,160
So you don't have to hide from me.

393
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:07,760
Have a smoke...
it'll help.

394
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,119
I don't want one now.

395
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:11,119
Fine.
Give it here.

396
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:16,079
What?

397
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:18,599
You've shared a half-smoked
cigarette with me before,

398
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,280
you weren't this jumpy then.

399
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,880
It's nothing.

400
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,680
I broke up.

401
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,880
What?

402
00:22:32,881 --> 00:22:34,040
You're kidding?

403
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,119
Weren't you fine a few days ago...

404
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,239
said you'd introduce us?

405
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,040
Forget it.
Have a drink with me.

406
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:43,599
I can't understand it...

407
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:45,560
a guy like you,

408
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,199
how could anyone let you go?

409
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,760
Enough chatter.

410
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,520
Your hand isn't healed.
Drink fruit tea.

411
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:52,719
Fine.
I'll drink.

412
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,238
I'll risk my life to
accompany the gentleman.

413
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:56,400
Booze works.

414
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:58,359
Fruit tea.

415
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:01,439
Come on.

416
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:02,800
Cheers.

417
00:23:05,199 --> 00:23:06,199
And...

418
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:08,439
if I get drunk,

419
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,560
take me home.

420
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,640
Easy.

421
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,160
Easy.

422
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,439
So heavy.

423
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,280
Director You,

424
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,239
you're body is too precious...

425
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:52,520
let me wash my hands first.

426
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,880
I didn't expect
Director You to be so tender.

427
00:24:05,199 --> 00:24:06,680
Just unlucky...

428
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,319
always meeting the wrong people.

429
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,400
Uncle You,

430
00:24:31,439 --> 00:24:33,520
your sweet-and-sour pork is amazing.

431
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,640
Love you.
Mwah.

432
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
What do I do…

433
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:49,560
I really want a bite,

434
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,279
but I can't leave marks

435
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,479
on you today.

436
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,760
My bodhisattva...

437
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,599
did you come to the human world to test me?

438
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,280
How about

439
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:04,479
just a kiss?

440
00:25:13,663 --> 00:25:15,050
What, what did you say?

441
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,540
You Shulang is kissing me...

442
00:25:21,713 --> 00:25:23,627
He's actively kissing me.

443
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:24,991
I've got him.

444
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:26,400
Zhen-zhen.

445
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:27,599
Zhen-zhen.

446
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,920
Fan Xiao.

447
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,280
Why is he here?

448
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,920
Early in the morning,

449
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,199
men are easy to tease.

450
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:26,920
Director You,
Cut it out.

451
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:28,359
Let go.

452
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,800
I'm not kidding.

453
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,599
Feel this.

454
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,680
Fan Xiao,

455
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:38,280
that's not how you joke.

456
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,359
You're crossing a line.

457
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Director You...

458
00:26:44,199 --> 00:26:45,479
then let me ask:

459
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,599
if I cross the line,

460
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,199
what happens?

461
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,359
I told you I'm gay.

462
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:56,119
If you keep pushing,

463
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,880
I'll have to take you.

464
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,400
What?

465
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:03,119
What did Director You say

466
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,000
he'd do to me?

467
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:12,680
What d'you want to eat?

468
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,560
How long has it been for you, Director You?

469
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,920
Last night you were drunk,

470
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,239
chasing me for kisses...

471
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,079
I couldn't dodge you.

472
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,760
Oh, right...

473
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:26,599
your ex is called Zhen-zhen, right?

474
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,239
You kissed me and called for him.

475
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:33,839
Look—you broke the skin on my lip.

476
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,560
Wanna see?

477
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,759
It's just a kiss...

478
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,958
what's the big deal?

479
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:43,959
But

480
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,160
scaring me with that condom

481
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,958
that was on you.

482
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:48,959
What if...

483
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,000
I wasn't scared?

484
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,920
Get lost.

485
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:59,478
I took care of you all night.

486
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:01,198
If nothing else, that's effort.

487
00:28:01,199 --> 00:28:02,598
No breakfast?

488
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:03,959
And now you kick me out?

489
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,560
Cold-blooded, Director You.

490
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,839
I'm showering— get dressed yourself.

491
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,760
Zhen-zhen,

492
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:25,640
how long till your boyfriend
willingly climbs into my bed?

493
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,359
Lu Zhen is still calling?

494
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,160
You keep dodging him...

495
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:36,079
aren't you afraid he'll lose hope

496
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,759
and run back to your Director You?

497
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,040
Knowing You Shulang,

498
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,199
he'll never take him back.

499
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,680
Your move—hurry.

500
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:44,680
Get wrecked.

501
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:46,598
You toyed with You Shulang,

502
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:47,695
and Lu Zhen caught a stray.

503
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:48,958
I don't know who to pity.

504
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:50,238
But then again,

505
00:28:50,239 --> 00:28:52,119
who can predict love?

506
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,598
An ex pouts,

507
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:55,239
strips a little and turns on the charm...

508
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,679
few men can resist.

509
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,680
Get wrecked.

510
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,478
Look at my hand...

511
00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:01,719
can it beat yours?

512
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:04,040
So vindicative...

513
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:05,959
All the cards on the table are the same.

514
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,560
You've never been in love...

515
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:10,119
you don't get how
easily old flames reignite.

516
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:10,760
Speaking of...
on that note,

517
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,319
what's up with you and Anna?

518
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,520
She really put some respect on your name.

519
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,080
She actually went to see Bai Pengyu.

520
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:18,880
Once,

521
00:29:18,881 --> 00:29:20,640
a rich guy slit his wrist in front of her,

522
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,760
begging her to come back.

523
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,958
Blood everywhere.

524
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:24,599
She didn't even blink.

525
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,359
In the end the businessman called
the ambulance himself.

526
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,318
You two are menaces...

527
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:30,519
hurry up and get together,

528
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,160
do the world a favor.

529
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,838
Buddha says

530
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,520
nine kinds of people go to hell.

531
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:38,319
She and I...

532
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,719
neither of us are getting away.

533
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,239
Come on, drink.

534
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,639
Come on, cheers—come on.

535
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,280
A Huo...

536
00:29:48,281 --> 00:29:51,119
for the team going to the industry expo,
on the travel list,

537
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:53,000
add one more slot.

538
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,400
Give it to You Shulang.

539
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,960
We've been in Thailand for a long time,

540
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:08,759
always slammed with work...

541
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,118
it's great to finally have a chance

542
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:11,238
to see the beach.

543
00:30:11,239 --> 00:30:11,880
Yeah.

544
00:30:11,881 --> 00:30:13,358
The scenery's great.

545
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:14,199
White sand, palm shadows...
so beautiful.

546
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,799
That's why conferences now

547
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,358
often pick coastal cities...

548
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:19,199
you can unwind after work.

549
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,640
Here...

550
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:27,479
go ahead and eat, everyone.
I've got no appetite.

551
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,160
Fan Xiao?

552
00:30:52,479 --> 00:30:53,479
What's wrong?

553
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,680
Maybe President Fan is exhausted.

554
00:30:55,719 --> 00:30:57,560
Want to
walk on the beach together?

555
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,118
We can still catch the sunset.

556
00:30:59,119 --> 00:30:59,920
I'll pass.

557
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,040
I'm a little tired.

558
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:02,119
You go ahead.

559
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:04,118
Shulang...

560
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:05,119
have fun,

561
00:31:05,959 --> 00:31:06,959
cure that broken heart.

562
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:11,119
Director You...
shall we?

563
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:13,839
Okay.

564
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,760
Big brother,

565
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,760
buy a flower please?

566
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,199
What a sweet mouth.

567
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,799
Your Hua language skills are great.

568
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,520
Make all your sales early and get some
rest.

569
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:31,119
Thank you.

570
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,400
Our Director You is really thoughtful.

571
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,358
Fan Xiao said you broke
up with your lover today.

572
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:40,000
In our department

573
00:31:40,001 --> 00:31:41,719
lots of girls fancy you.

574
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,759
I guess they've got a shot now.

575
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,880
Don't tease me.

576
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:47,079
It's not teasing,
I can vouch for it.

577
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,198
Every time your name
comes up, they get so excited

578
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:51,280
the boss has to cough to shut them up.

579
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,598
Can't blame them.

580
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:54,319
You're handsome and attentive.

581
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:56,598
It's a good thing you're here
with President Fan injured...

582
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:57,640
otherwise,

583
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,718
none of us know him that well,

584
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:00,958
and we wouldn't know how to look after him.

585
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:02,079
It's just work.

586
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,920
Tell you what...

587
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,239
you two stroll awhile.

588
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:07,400
He barely ate today.

589
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,799
I'll bring him some food

590
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,800
and go find him.

591
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:11,800
Sure, sure.

592
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:13,079
See you later.

593
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,479
Don't turn on the light.

594
00:32:21,199 --> 00:32:22,199
Please

595
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,880
don't turn it on.

596
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,160
Fan Xiao?

597
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:35,719
What's wrong, Fan Xiao?

598
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,959
Let me hold you

599
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,239
just for a minute.
It's okay.

600
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,680
I'm here.

601
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:45,358
I haven't been to the sea in a long time.

602
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:46,599
I'll get you some water.

603
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,006
Pour me a real drink.

604
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,520
Okay.

605
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:09,719
You know

606
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:13,319
the tsunami that killed over three
hundred thousand people?

607
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,520
You mean

608
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:16,479
decades ago,

609
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,359
the one in Indonesia?

610
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,319
My family was vacationing on an island.

611
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,800
Minutes before it hit,

612
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,160
I was eating sticky rice,

613
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:29,400
wrapped in lotus leaf.

614
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,000
For years after,

615
00:33:32,479 --> 00:33:34,199
every nightmare

616
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:37,199
carried that smell.

617
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,920
I just smelled it again.

618
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:42,640
I was back there...

619
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,640
swaddled in my mother's arms,

620
00:33:46,239 --> 00:33:47,719
shaking with fear.

621
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,800
Sorry...

622
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,839
did I scare you?

623
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:55,479
It's okay.

624
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,920
Let me...

625
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:02,719
Shulang...

626
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,680
if it were you,

627
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,280
would you reach out

628
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:08,959
to protect someone?

629
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:11,919
I'm not sure.

630
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:15,560
In life-or-death situations,

631
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,800
no one knows how they'll act.

632
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,679
What if it's your spouse and child?

633
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,760
I wouldn't leave them.

634
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,320
Director You...

635
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:33,479
I knew you were a good man.

636
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,719
At least

637
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:41,239
you and your mother

638
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,399
made it out.

639
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,239
She died.

640
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,959
Mom,

641
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,079
the water is rising.

642
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,600
Mom's got you.

643
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,320
Mom...
don't be afraid.

644
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,239
Are we going to die?

645
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,239
No, Xiao-xiao.
I'm here.

646
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:09,199
It will pass.

647
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:10,239
It'll be okay.

648
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,800
Mom, I'm scared.

649
00:35:14,959 --> 00:35:16,360
I've got matches.

650
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,239
Hold these.

651
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,360
And this too.

652
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,600
If you get too scared,

653
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:25,520
we'll light another.

654
00:35:25,521 --> 00:35:27,919
In the end she used all her strength

655
00:35:29,479 --> 00:35:31,839
to pile everything in the room

656
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,199
into a corner

657
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,719
and had me stand on it.

658
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,238
I watched her

659
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:40,360
sink inch by inch.

660
00:35:40,879 --> 00:35:43,000
The last thing she said to me...

661
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:44,360
Xiao-xiao,

662
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,679
you have to live.

663
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,559
Is living so hard?

664
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,399
Living is truly painful.

665
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,719
My mother died...

666
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,040
right in front of me.

667
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,679
It was so dark.

668
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,679
I had only a box of matches.

669
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:05,159
Later,

670
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:08,760
my matches ran out.

671
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,600
I couldn't see her.

672
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,560
Fan Xiao…

673
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:17,959
Mom…

674
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,600
why did you

675
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,280
keep telling me to live?

676
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:25,959
My matches are gone.

677
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,760
I want to be with you.

678
00:36:30,879 --> 00:36:32,840
This world is too dark.

679
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,800
I hate them.

680
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,840
I hate everyone.

681
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,479
They should've all drowned with you.

682
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:43,159
Fan Xiao...

683
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:44,719
Fan Xiao...

684
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,120
calm down.

685
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,600
Calm down.

686
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,679
That tsunami has long past.

687
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,199
It's over now.

688
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,080
Shulang?

689
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:56,159
It's me.

690
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,560
I'm here.

691
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,000
Do you know

692
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,080
who I hate most right now?

693
00:37:03,081 --> 00:37:04,159
You.

694
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,760
Fan Xiao...

695
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:06,959
breathe—calm down.

696
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:08,000
Calm down.

697
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:10,000
Who do you think you are

698
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,479
to decide others' lives and deaths?

699
00:37:13,479 --> 00:37:14,800
Who do you think you are...

700
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,919
a bodhisattva who saves all?

701
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,080
Fan Xiao...

702
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,280
calm down.

703
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,840
Then save me.

704
00:37:41,439 --> 00:37:42,439
Fan Xiao...

705
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,959
Sorry.

706
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,439
I just...

707
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,520
It's okay.

708
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,120
I get it...

709
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,320
trauma response.

710
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:01,119
Last time I got drunk

711
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,800
and crossed a line.

712
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,040
This time you were triggered.

713
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
We're even.

714
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,719
Let's not bring it up again.

715
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,800
You kissed me.

716
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:15,159
I kissed you.

717
00:38:15,479 --> 00:38:16,520
It's done with.

718
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,599
The udon I packed

719
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,600
is probably soggy.

720
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,280
I'll buy another.

721
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,040
Shulang...

722
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:28,520
do you know why

723
00:38:28,521 --> 00:38:30,600
I put your name

724
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,320
onto the travel list?

725
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:33,679
No.

726
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:35,120
Because I hope

727
00:38:35,121 --> 00:38:36,959
that when I'm afraid, you'll be there.

728
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:38,719
When you're there,

729
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,760
I'm calmer.

730
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:57,639
What?

731
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,639
You actually went to the coast?

732
00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:01,320
Aren't you afraid of a relapse?

733
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Already had one.

734
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,159
Then why do you sound normal?

735
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,840
Director You is here.

736
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,120
Meaning?

737
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,959
I can't run forever.

738
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,239
If I'm going to try

739
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,600
to take a step forward,

740
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,199
might as well

741
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,719
milk a little pity in front of him.

742
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,600
That works?

743
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:22,959
You...

744
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,320
So annoying.

745
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:28,719
Distinguished business
representatives, please take a short break.

746
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,600
Our forum will officially begin in ten
minutes.

747
00:39:34,879 --> 00:39:35,719
Excuse me...

748
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,159
could you please help us adjust our seats?

749
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,320
I need a seat that's not by the window.

750
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:42,000
All right.

751
00:39:42,001 --> 00:39:43,040
Let me coordinate it.

752
00:39:43,399 --> 00:39:44,399
Thank you.

753
00:39:49,479 --> 00:39:50,638
Excuse me...

754
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,479
the sea breeze is so noisy.

755
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,320
Would you mind closing the window?

756
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,239
First of all,

757
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:01,360
I'm very happy

758
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,280
to attend this WS-hosted summit.

759
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:06,958
Here,

760
00:40:06,959 --> 00:40:09,399
I see many old friends.

761
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,719
Thank you all for coming.

762
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:21,120
This forum is, domestically, and even in
international medical exchange, or in technology,

763
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:23,359
by all acounts is top-tier...

764
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,399
This expert is very forward-thinking,

765
00:40:25,879 --> 00:40:26,919
with a global vision.

766
00:40:27,854 --> 00:40:28,495
Listen up.

767
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,960
We have received strong support
from investors at home and abroad...

768
00:40:35,919 --> 00:40:39,679
Well, thanks to the experts
for their wonderful speeches.

769
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,320
That's all for today's theme forum.

770
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:45,560
Everyone can go to the
restaurant to enjoy dinner.

771
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:46,719
Thank you, everybody.
See you tomorrow.

772
00:40:47,919 --> 00:40:48,600
Let's go.

773
00:40:48,601 --> 00:40:49,679
I've already ordered.

774
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:51,319
Let's eat back at the hotel.

775
00:40:52,399 --> 00:40:53,399
Shulang...

776
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:56,679
What is it?

777
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,320
Walk the beach with me.

778
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:02,800
You sure?
It'll be dark soon.

779
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,040
You may not see the water,

780
00:41:05,959 --> 00:41:07,600
but the waves will still...

781
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,080
I want

782
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,040
to try.

783
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,320
Fan Xiao...

784
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:30,719
Fan Xiao...

785
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:31,879
come back.

786
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,159
Fan Xiao...
stop.

787
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,120
What...

788
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:38,080
afraid I'll kill myself?

789
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:39,479
Walk back, Fan Xiao.

790
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:40,736
If you want exposure therapy

791
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,080
you can't rush it.

792
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:52,199
So...

793
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:56,239
after the accident you
never came back to the sea?

794
00:41:57,959 --> 00:41:58,959
Afterward

795
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:01,199
I did therapy on-and-off for years.

796
00:42:02,919 --> 00:42:04,879
As an adult I thought I could face it,

797
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,280
so I went to Phuket.

798
00:42:07,919 --> 00:42:09,199
I didn't even see the ocean...

799
00:42:09,919 --> 00:42:11,559
just hearing it

800
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,600
sent me over the edge.

801
00:42:12,959 --> 00:42:14,079
Later

802
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,560
I tried desensitization again,

803
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:17,879
but it didn't help.

804
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:19,199
Slowly...

805
00:42:20,959 --> 00:42:23,479
I got tired, I couldn't lose control again.

806
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,080
I didn't want to face the
nightmare over and over.

807
00:42:26,959 --> 00:42:28,600
In the end

808
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,520
I could only give up

809
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,120
and run.

810
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,040
Like a coward.

811
00:42:34,959 --> 00:42:36,040
Will you laugh at me?

812
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:37,239
Fan Xiao...

813
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:38,679
it's not like that.

814
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,679
Everyone has something they can't face.

815
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,760
You too?

816
00:42:44,879 --> 00:42:45,879
I'm afraid to swim.

817
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,119
I actually used to be good at it.

818
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,360
I was very good at swimming.

819
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,319
Back then,

820
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,320
we were poor.

821
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,878
We boys went to the river

822
00:42:56,879 --> 00:42:58,079
to set fish traps.

823
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,760
Another kid and I swam well,

824
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:02,320
we dared to set traps deep.

825
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:04,679
We caught more fish than the others.

826
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,760
But slowly

827
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,080
he saw me as a rival,

828
00:43:10,966 --> 00:43:12,246
he started to resent me,

829
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:14,399
and bullied my younger brother.

830
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:17,199
Once he set the trap too deep.

831
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,958
When he dove to get it,

832
00:43:19,959 --> 00:43:21,120
his legs got tangled.

833
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,760
You saved him?

834
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,719
Yes.
I saved him,

835
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,639
but he almost dragged me down with him.

836
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:33,000
He panicked,

837
00:43:33,399 --> 00:43:35,000
clutched my arms and legs.

838
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,478
Then a gulp of water knocked him out,

839
00:43:37,479 --> 00:43:38,719
and I dragged him ashore.

840
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:41,560
Want a cigarette?

841
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:42,719
No.

842
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,280
No smoking on the beach.

843
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:47,360
But after he came to,

844
00:43:47,879 --> 00:43:49,280
he accused me

845
00:43:49,879 --> 00:43:51,560
of diving in to steal his fish.

846
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,039
A year later,

847
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,239
he did it again.

848
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,959
But that time I hesitated.

849
00:44:00,959 --> 00:44:03,399
I stood on shore watching
him thrash and call for help.

850
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,520
His head bobbed up and down.

851
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,520
The feeling from a year before...

852
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,360
limbs trapped, sinking...

853
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,199
choked me again.

854
00:44:16,399 --> 00:44:17,878
So when you ask

855
00:44:17,879 --> 00:44:20,560
if I'd help in a disaster,

856
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,519
I'd say I don't know.

857
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,560
Did he die?

858
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,000
No.

859
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,159
I rescued him again...

860
00:44:29,719 --> 00:44:31,279
I just hesitated a bit.

861
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,679
But he'd been under too long asphyxiating,

862
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:35,479
and ended up with brain damage.

863
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,399
Later his parents

864
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,040
knelt to thank me.

865
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,520
After that I stopped swimming.

866
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,639
You think his condition is your fault?

867
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:47,119
Two minutes less,

868
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,120
and he'd be fine?

869
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:50,519
There are two other possibilities.

870
00:44:50,919 --> 00:44:53,679
He didn't end up with brain damaged but
dragged you under.

871
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,919
Or you saved him

872
00:44:56,719 --> 00:44:58,159
and he turned on you again.

873
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:00,199
Fan Xiao...

874
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,760
could you comfort me like a normal person?

875
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,439
You Shulang...

876
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,600
you really are a good man.

877
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,198
You said before

878
00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:14,199
we have no right to decide how others live
or die.

879
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:17,719
But

880
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,040
as long as we're alive,

881
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,920
there will always be someone to tell you

882
00:45:23,239 --> 00:45:24,639
that the world isn't all bad...

883
00:45:25,399 --> 00:45:26,399
it can be beautiful.

884
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,919
So you're that someone

885
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,639
who tells me the world isn't all bad.

886
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,159
I just want to tell you

887
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,000
each of us

888
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,199
has old wounds we can't face.

889
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,320
Avoiding them isn't shameful,

890
00:45:41,399 --> 00:45:42,760
and it's not cowardly.

891
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,280
We just need to let go.

892
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,320
Let go.

893
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,519
Don't obsess over whether you can face it.

894
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,840
If you can't face the sea, don't.

895
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,959
If you can't swim, don't.

896
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:04,159
Fan Xiao...

897
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,679
let's go back to the room.

898
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:06,799
Lock the windows and doors,

899
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,679
and we won't hear the damn waves.
