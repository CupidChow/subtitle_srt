1
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
"To My Shore"

2
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:20,600
Your nerve's getting bigger by the day.

3
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,119
You actually rammed
someone in broad daylight?

4
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,520
It's a law-and-order society now.

5
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,079
Stash those shady old tricks

6
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,520
and keep them out of sight.

7
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,000
(in Thai) Understood.

8
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,600
Speak Chinese when you talk to me.

9
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:38,399
Got it, Mr. Xu.

10
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,240
Uncle Xu,

11
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,639
if I do something wrong again,

12
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,320
just chew me out to my face.

13
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,440
Xiao,

14
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,919
your father left you in my care,

15
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,080
so I'm responsible for you.

16
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,119
We're a huge family business...

17
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,880
we can't bide our time.

18
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,758
We finally chose

19
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,520
to push for new development

20
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:18,838
and to put you in charge of this major move
into Hua country Pharma.

21
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:20,800
You can't drop the ball.

22
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:25,080
We're business people —
Making money comes first.

23
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:26,320
You're right...

24
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,039
peace brings profit.

25
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,479
But Uncle Xu,

26
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,720
You can teach lessons
like that to me directly.

27
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,678
No need to go around me

28
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:36,679
to lecture my guys.

29
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,080
They won't really get it,

30
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,479
will they?

31
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,759
Xiao,

32
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:45,199
as long as you understand
where I'm coming from.

33
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:46,880
It's late;

34
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,520
I'll get going.

35
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,479
Uncle Xu,

36
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,800
I'll walk you out.

37
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,080
No need.

38
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:56,240
Turn in early.

39
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,679
Boss,

40
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,520
I'll find who tipped Mr. Xu off.

41
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,713
Also, that Tesla driver was quick...

42
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,199
dodging at the last second.

43
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,920
Looks like he just got an arm injury.

44
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:16,079
Do you want us to… finish it?

45
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,839
If luck's on his side, that's his karma.

46
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,720
Leave it.

47
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,040
So,

48
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,040
what about his daughter, Xu Ting?

49
00:04:23,792 --> 00:04:25,593
She's flying home to recuperate.

50
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,600
I don't want her recovering too fast.

51
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:30,345
Boss,

52
00:04:30,593 --> 00:04:32,959
Miss Xu is the fiancée
the big boss picked for you.

53
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:34,899
If he presses you about it...

54
00:04:34,924 --> 00:04:36,964
As long as our Hua country
expansion goes smoothly,

55
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:44,799
she doesn't have to be my fiancée.

56
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,300
(Episode 1)

57
00:04:53,653 --> 00:04:54,653
Miss Xu,

58
00:04:54,678 --> 00:04:56,036
time for your meds.

59
00:04:58,066 --> 00:05:00,480
Ting-ting, just focus on getting better.

60
00:05:00,505 --> 00:05:02,866
If you need anything in
Bangkok, just let me know.

61
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:04,612
Thanks, Xiao.

62
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:07,718
Nurse, say that again.

63
00:05:07,743 --> 00:05:08,863
I'm old...

64
00:05:08,888 --> 00:05:11,480
you talk so fast,
I won't remember.

65
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,840
The hospital issued a
critical-condition notice.

66
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,159
Doctor, what do I do?

67
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,319
Can I still be treated?

68
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,399
We need to study the case more.

69
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,200
Please, I'm counting on you.

70
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:23,480
We'll do our best.

71
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,600
Don't be scared, sweetie.

72
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,398
It'll be okay soon.

73
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,159
No more pain, no more pain.

74
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,678
I've told you several times...

75
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:33,399
where are your kids?

76
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,199
Why won't they come stay with you?

77
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,160
They're busy with work.

78
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,440
Dad,

79
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,519
what do we do… Dad...

80
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:45,347
All beings suffer;

81
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,220
all forms are empty.

82
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:49,898
(in Thai) May the Buddha protect us.

83
00:05:53,813 --> 00:05:54,932
All set.

84
00:05:55,219 --> 00:05:56,059
The department you need

85
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,460
is right across from the elevators.

86
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,018
Thank you, young man.

87
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:04,259
So handsome and so kind.

88
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,338
Easy there, Granny.

89
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:06,420
Take it slow.

90
00:06:15,318 --> 00:06:18,038
Great, now I'll definitely
miss the meeting.

91
00:06:24,626 --> 00:06:26,026
And it's a luxury car…

92
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:29,618
hope the owner's reasonable.

93
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:52,149
Hello.

94
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,390
I'm so sorry...

95
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,868
I was glued to the GPS

96
00:06:57,869 --> 00:06:59,869
and looked up too late. I rear-ended you.

97
00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:07,749
Are you hurt?

98
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,550
I'm fine.

99
00:07:09,956 --> 00:07:11,316
Do you need to go to the hospital?

100
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:13,389
I knocked on your window
and you didn't respond...

101
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,869
I was worried something was wrong.

102
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:16,149
I'm fine.

103
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,589
It just happened so fast

104
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,149
I froze for a second.

105
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,510
I'm so sorry.

106
00:07:21,309 --> 00:07:22,350
Totally my fault.

107
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:24,589
I'll cover all damages.

108
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,390
The car doesn't matter

109
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:27,469
people matter more.

110
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:30,070
I already called the
police and my insurer.

111
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,589
It might take a bit of your time.

112
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,790
No problem...

113
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:35,149
I'm not in a rush.

114
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:36,869
Okay!

115
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:38,589
Thanks.

116
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:43,869
Sorry.

117
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,749
It's still a bit chilly out.

118
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,790
You're underdressed.

119
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,950
My jacket's in my suitcase.

120
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,869
I rushed to the flight and forgot it.

121
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:59,670
Mind putting on my coat for now?

122
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:01,469
So...

123
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,110
Thanks, then.

124
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,909
And drop the “sir”...

125
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,110
sounds stiff.

126
00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:12,189
I'm Fan Xiao,

127
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:13,269
I'm a Hua person born in Thailand.

128
00:08:14,989 --> 00:08:15,989
You Shulang.

129
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:28,350
Wild-rose scent?

130
00:08:29,269 --> 00:08:30,749
He looks so buttoned-up,

131
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,230
but he wears a wild-rose perfume.

132
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,069
A Huo,

133
00:08:48,469 --> 00:08:49,589
come pick me up.

134
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,829
Someone hit my car...

135
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:54,550
white Tesla,

136
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:56,990
9230.

137
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,110
Bangkok.

138
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,310
I've been delayed

139
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,110
38 minutes, 42 seconds.

140
00:09:05,469 --> 00:09:06,670
And don't cause any deaths.

141
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:08,870
Small world,
Mr. You...

142
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,990
we meet again.
Mr. Fan?

143
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:15,550
What are the odds?

144
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:19,990
Why is your arm injured...

145
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:22,349
don't tell me that came
from the rear-end collision.

146
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:23,588
No idea what's up lately.

147
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:25,588
I'd just parked and was getting out...

148
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:26,509
and someone clipped me.

149
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:27,589
Luckily it's minor.

150
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:28,990
Make way, please!

151
00:09:28,991 --> 00:09:30,190
Make way!

152
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:31,389
Thanks.
Make way!

153
00:09:32,648 --> 00:09:34,269
A fracture isn't
something to be trifled with.

154
00:09:34,469 --> 00:09:36,749
Luckily this Hua people hospital's

155
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,029
has a great reputation in Thailand.

156
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,910
Here for a follow-up?

157
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:42,149
Just to get a new prescription.

158
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:44,429
What brings you here?

159
00:09:44,856 --> 00:09:45,629
Visiting a patient.

160
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,550
The ward bridge connects to outpatients.

161
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,750
My sense of direction sucks...

162
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,550
I somehow wandered over here.

163
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,029
If it's not too much trouble,

164
00:09:55,192 --> 00:09:58,350
can you point me to the
direction of the parking lot?

165
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,430
Sure…

166
00:09:59,469 --> 00:10:01,350
I'll tell you the route in a bit...

167
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,350
What's up?

168
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:07,949
Let's go.

169
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,629
Why my child?

170
00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:18,709
Why do all of you...

171
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:20,469
So dangerous!

172
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:23,029
Grow up fine, one after another...

173
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,388
why can't he?

174
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:26,069
Why?!

175
00:10:26,094 --> 00:10:27,454
The railing's so high...

176
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:29,029
how'd she get over it?

177
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,110
Ma'am...

178
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:33,110
Don't come any closer!

179
00:10:33,111 --> 00:10:36,229
We've confirmed the diagnosis,

180
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,069
but it's not hopeless.

181
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,029
Calm down.

182
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,468
If we treat in time.

183
00:10:41,469 --> 00:10:42,628
Treat in time?

184
00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:45,750
Treat with what money?

185
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,509
I don't even have enough

186
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,789
for one surgery!

187
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,310
Step back first! It's dangerous!

188
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:53,910
You're holding a child!

189
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,029
Calm down.

190
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,709
I'll handle the call.
Don't do it.

191
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:01,469
Don't jump.
Please don't jump!

192
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:07,389
Listen up...

193
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,589
fire rescue just said

194
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,590
if the adult falls,
don't try to catch her...

195
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,870
you'll get hurt.

196
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:13,389
But we can try to catch the child.

197
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,069
We can use coats and
bed sheets as cushioning.

198
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,709
Before they arrive,

199
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,069
be ready to catch the baby!

200
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:21,629
Quick, jackets off!

201
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,750
Pile them here!

202
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,829
Come on...

203
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,910
if there are bed sheets, use them too!

204
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:35,910
Ma'am,

205
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:37,189
I'm serious...

206
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,509
my kid had a congenital heart disease too.

207
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,430
They said he wouldn't live past one year.

208
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:42,310
Then

209
00:11:42,311 --> 00:11:44,509
a Sino-Thai joint team did a free clinic...

210
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,869
he's healthy now.

211
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,309
There are options!

212
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,670
Plenty of able hands here.

213
00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:50,069
Your arm's injured...

214
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,310
no need to join in.

215
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:52,829
I'm fine.

216
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:54,389
What?

217
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:58,389
You don't feel as distant with me today.

218
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,389
If we save the kid,

219
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:02,190
dinner's on me tonight...

220
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:04,310
call it a celebration,

221
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,469
and an apology for the accident.

222
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,870
And if we…

223
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:10,509
And if we don't?

224
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,230
Kidding.

225
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,110
Looks like I'm getting
a free meal either way.

226
00:12:22,469 --> 00:12:23,469
Oh no!

227
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,190
Looks like rescue won't make it in time.

228
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:29,670
They said don't catch the adult,

229
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,069
only the child...

230
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:34,389
what if they both fall?

231
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,589
If that happens,

232
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,670
to avoid more injuries

233
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,509
we can only…

234
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:43,269
Don't come closer!

235
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:44,190
Don't come closer!
Be careful!

236
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,230
Yes! We saved him!

237
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,629
Thank God!

238
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:47,389
You Shulang!

239
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,469
You cried.

240
00:14:03,556 --> 00:14:04,635
Don't you think

241
00:14:05,348 --> 00:14:06,429
death

242
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:10,069
can also be a kind of
release… even redemption?

243
00:14:12,369 --> 00:14:13,530
(in Thai) Thank you.

244
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,510
What?

245
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:18,949
Redemption? What did you say?

246
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,430
Nothing...

247
00:14:20,431 --> 00:14:22,391
just thinking about what
happened this afternoon.

248
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,430
Come on...

249
00:14:26,431 --> 00:14:27,509
cheers to your hero move.

250
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:28,829
And to you.

251
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,350
Didn't expect you to be
a matches-and-cigs guy.

252
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:51,910
How's that brand...

253
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,550
any good?

254
00:14:56,709 --> 00:14:58,709
Try it and see.

255
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,750
Well?

256
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:52,589
Not my thing.

257
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,468
Too sweet...

258
00:15:54,469 --> 00:15:55,670
kinda like…

259
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,389
rouge.
Rouge…

260
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:02,829
Rouge…

261
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,829
You really say what you think.

262
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:11,430
Maybe today's just special.

263
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,110
Sorry...

264
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:19,509
gotta take this.

265
00:16:20,909 --> 00:16:21,909
I'll hit the restroom.

266
00:16:22,622 --> 00:16:23,622
Don't go anywhere.

267
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:32,389
Hello?

268
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,029
Hey, Zhen-zhen.

269
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:36,389
I'm eating out…

270
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,750
Sounds fun!

271
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,069
Okay...

272
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:54,389
I'll stay with you next weekend.

273
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,990
Miss you, too.

274
00:17:04,989 --> 00:17:05,470
Okay.

275
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,949
You've got an early schedule...

276
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,190
sleep soon.

277
00:17:08,509 --> 00:17:09,509
Bye.

278
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:12,029
Sweetie.

279
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:20,869
You and your girlfriend
have a great relationship.

280
00:17:23,749 --> 00:17:26,710
I envy you—finding a soulmate.

281
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,269
Soulmate?

282
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,430
Bit much, isn't it?

283
00:17:31,629 --> 00:17:33,269
Do you love her?

284
00:17:35,749 --> 00:17:36,749
Yeah.

285
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,509
I do.

286
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:49,989
Guess I'm the loner at this table.

287
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:54,524
You're just too picky.

288
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:55,910
That's part of it.

289
00:17:56,629 --> 00:17:58,590
So what's your type, Mr. Fan?

290
00:18:01,857 --> 00:18:02,857
Honestly?

291
00:18:03,655 --> 00:18:05,976
Your girlfriend seems great.

292
00:18:08,989 --> 00:18:10,589
Maybe I misspoke...

293
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,469
I grew up in Thailand,

294
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,830
my Chinese slips sometimes.

295
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,389
I end up saying funny things.

296
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,269
I mean

297
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,030
she must be beautiful;

298
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,229
I trust your taste.

299
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,430
If she has any sisters…

300
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,950
mind introducing me?

301
00:18:30,989 --> 00:18:32,589
Too bad...

302
00:18:35,869 --> 00:18:37,509
she doesn't.

303
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,589
Thanks for dinner, Mr. You.

304
00:18:41,629 --> 00:18:42,629
See you.

305
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:44,790
Take care, Mr. Fan.

306
00:19:04,749 --> 00:19:05,749
Boss.

307
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:15,509
A Huo.

308
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,389
Find out who You Shulang's girlfriend is.

309
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,029
I think I'm ready for a relationship…

310
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,030
Okay!

311
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:24,710
Zhen-zhen.

312
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:34,430
Hey, Sister Xiaoya.

313
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:35,749
Lu Zhen,

314
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:36,869
did you get there?

315
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:37,950
Yeah.

316
00:19:38,389 --> 00:19:40,149
A pretty tough-looking guy

317
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,150
brought me in.

318
00:19:41,869 --> 00:19:43,430
His Chinese isn't great...

319
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,830
he probably isn't Hua.

320
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,749
Oh?

321
00:19:47,235 --> 00:19:48,875
Then maybe the painters are Hua.

322
00:19:49,349 --> 00:19:50,468
Our agency's been

323
00:19:50,469 --> 00:19:51,829
in the Hua circle for years...

324
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,790
most of our clients are Hua people.

325
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,509
I'll check with biz later.

326
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,950
Don't worry—being a
model doesn't require Thai;

327
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,909
but you've been in Thailand

328
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,628
in such a short period of time and
you've already landed a high-paying gig...

329
00:20:01,629 --> 00:20:02,926
they even asked for you specifically.

330
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,149
Take it seriously.

331
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,589
Got it, Sis.

332
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,749
I'll stop here...

333
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,310
the room's empty, so I'll touch
up my makeup while I wait.

334
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:11,869
Okay.

335
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,430
You're sure?

336
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,070
That's…

337
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,310
You Shulang's lover?

338
00:20:40,776 --> 00:20:41,776
(in Thai) Yes.

339
00:20:44,469 --> 00:20:46,509
He looks so upright and untouchable...

340
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,910
who knew he likes men.

341
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,830
Guess

342
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:55,109
nobody's perfect.

343
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,629
I wonder if his lover

344
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:06,830
smells like wild-rose, too.

345
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,229
Sorry to keep you waiting.

346
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,430
I had to take an important call...

347
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,509
sorry to waste your time, Mr. Lu.

348
00:21:33,749 --> 00:21:34,749
It's fine...

349
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,030
it was just a bit of waiting.

350
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:36,989
So do I need to...
I'm Fan Xiao.

351
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,190
Forgot to introduce myself.

352
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,710
I'm Lu Zhen.

353
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,509
What do you need me to do?

354
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:48,550
Mr. Lu,

355
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,310
Just sit here and keep still.

356
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:52,269
Okay.

357
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:57,355
Do I need to change?

358
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,550
No.

359
00:21:58,749 --> 00:22:00,589
Your beauty is pure as is...

360
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,269
it doesn't need any extra dressing.

361
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:06,509
Hope that doesn't offend you.

362
00:22:08,229 --> 00:22:09,229
Just call me Lu Zhen...

363
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,670
everyone does.

364
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,830
Everyone?

365
00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:14,269
Your lover

366
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,550
too?

367
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,310
No offense,

368
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,669
but I like to build trust
with my subjects...

369
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:24,790
intimacy,

370
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,310
even...

371
00:22:26,589 --> 00:22:27,710
like… lovers.

372
00:22:28,589 --> 00:22:29,589
Like…

373
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,070
lovers.

374
00:22:35,036 --> 00:22:36,036
Don't worry...

375
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,070
no physical contact.

376
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,349
I hope you understand what I mean.

377
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:45,269
I've fallen in love with a
flower in my studio before.

378
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,910
With a cloud.

379
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:48,670
I'll probably

380
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,750
fall for you a little while we work.

381
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:57,070
I hope you don't mind my love...
a man's love.

382
00:22:59,389 --> 00:23:00,989
I get it.

383
00:23:02,109 --> 00:23:04,869
I just don't know what I'm supposed to do.

384
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,869
Just sit still.

385
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,310
And

386
00:23:08,823 --> 00:23:09,982
tell me—what does your lover

387
00:23:10,629 --> 00:23:11,629
call you?

388
00:23:13,629 --> 00:23:15,268
What makes you so sure

389
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:16,628
I have one?

390
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:17,629
Gut feeling.

391
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,190
So...

392
00:23:19,589 --> 00:23:20,710
I'm right?

393
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,310
What does he call you?

394
00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:27,509
Zhen-zhen.

395
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,509
Zhen-zhen.

396
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,710
Okay, Zhen-zhen...

397
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,310
sit up straight

398
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,509
and look ahead.

399
00:23:38,749 --> 00:23:39,989
Okay.

400
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:44,509
Xiao,

401
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,309
these were pre-screened by the team,

402
00:23:46,334 --> 00:23:47,694
that fit our strategy

403
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,670
and Pinfeng Capital's direction,

404
00:23:50,989 --> 00:23:52,469
and have market potential.

405
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:53,910
Take a look.

406
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:55,909
If you're good with them,

407
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,988
I'll have the team

408
00:23:56,989 --> 00:23:58,589
draft term sheets

409
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,310
and start due diligence.

410
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,109
It's a mountain of paperwork.

411
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,589
If you don't want to read it all,

412
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,830
just sign.

413
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:08,269
Vice President Xu...

414
00:24:08,676 --> 00:24:11,436
let's use titles at work,

415
00:24:11,461 --> 00:24:12,461
otherwise,

416
00:24:12,989 --> 00:24:14,389
it confuses the staff.

417
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,109
We'll do it your way,

418
00:24:18,349 --> 00:24:19,109
No!

419
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,389
President Fan.

420
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:22,269
President Fan,

421
00:24:22,389 --> 00:24:23,670
so… these files?

422
00:24:25,509 --> 00:24:27,109
Who's Head of Admin?

423
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:29,310
President Fan,

424
00:24:29,389 --> 00:24:30,748
that's me—Xu Gang.

425
00:24:30,749 --> 00:24:32,070
We focus on Hua country companies

426
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:34,790
and the Hua country market.

427
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:38,550
Most of our people are
Hua people or Thai-born hua people,

428
00:24:39,589 --> 00:24:40,790
so our protocols

429
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,830
should align with Hua country.

430
00:24:43,109 --> 00:24:44,229
Tell me...

431
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:47,310
at a department-head
meeting in Hua country,

432
00:24:48,509 --> 00:24:51,430
is this how the seats are arranged?

433
00:24:53,509 --> 00:24:55,910
That's how company meetings
have always been arranged.

434
00:24:56,109 --> 00:24:57,190
Always been.

435
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,670
Right.

436
00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:02,670
It's my first official meeting here,

437
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,830
so maybe

438
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:07,549
you didn't get a chance to adjust my seat.

439
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,669
My mistake—sorry about that.

440
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:10,830
No big deal.

441
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,989
I'm formally taking over...

442
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:16,229
there's lots I need to learn,

443
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:19,588
and you'll need time to adjust too.

444
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:20,589
Have a seat.

445
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,030
Vice President Xu,

446
00:25:25,469 --> 00:25:27,670
I'll go through these carefully.

447
00:25:28,222 --> 00:25:29,582
Can't have you

448
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:30,670
at your age

449
00:25:31,389 --> 00:25:32,869
working so hard.

450
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,269
Let's wrap for today.

451
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:38,910
The background-check work's been tough...
you've all worked hard.

452
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,190
Tonight, dinner on me;

453
00:25:41,229 --> 00:25:42,229
we'll relax a bit.

454
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,589
You pick the place,
and I'll pay.

455
00:25:45,469 --> 00:25:46,790
Thank you, President Fan!

456
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,310
Oh...

457
00:25:52,869 --> 00:25:54,069
Have the Investment Director

458
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,989
send all project materials to my office,

459
00:25:56,229 --> 00:25:57,229
including

460
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,430
the ones that didn't make the cut.

461
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,070
Boss,

462
00:26:23,229 --> 00:26:25,268
what you asked me to check...
the CFO's son

463
00:26:25,269 --> 00:26:26,845
who's sponsoring his overseas tuition...

464
00:26:26,869 --> 00:26:27,869
is clear now.

465
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,190
It's Mr. Xu's nephew.

466
00:26:29,649 --> 00:26:30,649
Also, from admin's Xu Gang...

467
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:33,229
the ledgers on company procurement

468
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:34,509
are in your inbox.

469
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,109
Always like this..

470
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,149
Here are the project books
from the Investment Director.

471
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:39,950
The tall stack

472
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,349
is the rejects.

473
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,550
I'll head out.

474
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,029
Bohai Pharma?

475
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,030
Bohai…

476
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:03,910
Bohai Pharma.

477
00:27:04,989 --> 00:27:05,989
You Shulang.

478
00:27:09,109 --> 00:27:10,109
Looks like

479
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,030
fate won't stop throwing us together.

480
00:27:18,989 --> 00:27:19,989
Fan Xiao?

481
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:23,070
Why would he call me?

482
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,430
Hello?

483
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:29,790
Hello,

484
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,070
Mr. You.

485
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:33,710
Hello,

486
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,830
Mr. Fan.

487
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,190
What made you call?

488
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,070
I'm lost.

489
00:27:38,509 --> 00:27:39,509
What do I do?

490
00:27:41,469 --> 00:27:42,869
I recall

491
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,349
you owe me one

492
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,350
“point-my-way” from the hospital.

493
00:27:57,349 --> 00:27:59,149
How'd you manage to
strand yourself out here?

494
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,190
No idea.

495
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,469
I followed the GPS,

496
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,469
hit a dead end,

497
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,629
circled around,

498
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:08,990
and somehow ended up here.

499
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,869
You got lost

500
00:28:11,749 --> 00:28:13,085
coming from the airport last time too?

501
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:13,550
Yeah.

502
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,670
I've got a terrible sense of direction...

503
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:16,869
always have.

504
00:28:17,589 --> 00:28:19,589
Bangkok's road system is a maze...

505
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:20,989
not like Hua country.

506
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,670
Honestly, sometimes

507
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,910
getting lost can be fun.

508
00:28:26,823 --> 00:28:29,023
You see things you'd usually miss.

509
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:30,389
Look...

510
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,790
there's a bird's nest.

511
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,070
While I was waiting for you,

512
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,349
I saw a downy chick

513
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,830
that hadn't fully feathered.

514
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:39,030
It fell out.

515
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,989
You think it slipped?

516
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,790
Ever hear what nature docs say?

517
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,550
What?

518
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,869
Nature docs say

519
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,950
when a chick gets shoved out of the nest,

520
00:28:56,509 --> 00:28:58,150
nine times out of ten

521
00:28:58,989 --> 00:29:01,190
it's from siblings fighting for food

522
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:02,749
and pushing it out.

523
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:03,965
(in Thai) Don't call me “big brother,”.

524
00:29:03,989 --> 00:29:04,710
Fan Xiao.

525
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,126
You're just like your mother...

526
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:07,150
an embarrassing nobody.

527
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,790
Sometimes the parents

528
00:29:10,469 --> 00:29:12,629
favor the others...

529
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:15,589
and don't want to waste
hard-won food on the weak one.

530
00:29:15,749 --> 00:29:18,445
Fan Xiao, I heard from your second brother that
you stirred up trouble at the Kamtat place again.

531
00:29:18,469 --> 00:29:20,989
Learn from your brothers—be steady.
Stop messing around all day.

532
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,108
Our clan

533
00:29:25,109 --> 00:29:26,910
runs on seniority.

534
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,589
You're from a concubine branch...

535
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,588
you don't get

536
00:29:32,589 --> 00:29:34,109
a say here.

537
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,550
So which is it?

538
00:29:47,349 --> 00:29:48,349
Let's head back.

539
00:29:48,629 --> 00:29:49,629
It's getting late.

540
00:29:50,349 --> 00:29:51,469
You're not going to save it?

541
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,550
The chick might not be dead yet.

542
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:00,670
Save it how...

543
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,269
put it back?

544
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:05,549
How do you know it won't
just get shoved out again?

545
00:30:08,229 --> 00:30:09,229
You knew

546
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:12,030
catching that baby
wouldn't cure his illness,

547
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,070
but you saved him anyway.

548
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,589
Why?

549
00:30:18,989 --> 00:30:20,989
I just gave life a chance.

550
00:30:21,109 --> 00:30:22,910
And I was right there...

551
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,950
I couldn't just stand and watch.

552
00:30:26,622 --> 00:30:28,143
I just gave life a chance.

553
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,670
And.

554
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,310
I was right there...

555
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:34,509
I couldn't just stand and watch him.

556
00:30:36,389 --> 00:30:38,190
But nature has its rules;

557
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:40,869
we shouldn't meddle too much.

558
00:30:42,677 --> 00:30:44,476
It's a little awkward to say,

559
00:30:45,349 --> 00:30:46,749
but…

560
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:49,069
my company already

561
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,470
covered the kid's medical expenses.

562
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,869
He'll get to grow up healthy.

563
00:30:55,509 --> 00:30:56,509
So.

564
00:30:57,797 --> 00:31:00,317
Thank you—your quick action

565
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,030
bought him that chance.

566
00:31:07,109 --> 00:31:08,109
…I…

567
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,389
It's late.

568
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,389
Let's go.

569
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,108
I'm starving.

570
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:19,588
Let me buy you dinner...

571
00:31:19,589 --> 00:31:20,589
to say thanks.

572
00:31:21,749 --> 00:31:22,910
I've still got work tonight.

573
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:24,910
Rain check.

574
00:31:24,989 --> 00:31:25,989
Work...

575
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,109
as in pushing the new financing?

576
00:31:29,469 --> 00:31:30,469
How'd you know?

577
00:31:31,229 --> 00:31:32,070
A few VC decks

578
00:31:32,229 --> 00:31:34,150
landed on my desk...

579
00:31:35,389 --> 00:31:37,629
your company's in the pile.

580
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,790
We're prepping to talk.

581
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,069
Let's not stand here...

582
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,070
come on,

583
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,389
we can eat and talk.

584
00:31:45,749 --> 00:31:47,229
I know a good spot.

585
00:31:47,589 --> 00:31:48,589
Perfect.

586
00:31:48,629 --> 00:31:49,629
Lead the way.

587
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:08,709
Today,

588
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,228
at Bohai Pharma

589
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:12,349
our meeting with Pinfeng Capital

590
00:32:12,629 --> 00:32:13,869
went great.

591
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:16,790
We've further aligned our goals,

592
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:17,629
President Fan,

593
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,509
anything else you need...

594
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:20,830
any guidance?

595
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,310
Director Liu,

596
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,670
your materials

597
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,109
are thorough.

598
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:26,790
But

599
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,589
our current round has a clear target:

600
00:32:29,869 --> 00:32:32,629
for products for Hua
country's domestic market.

601
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:34,269
That's why

602
00:32:34,629 --> 00:32:37,750
we're looking at
Bohai Pharma from Hua country.

603
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:38,790
So...

604
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:41,310
we'll need more targeted data.

605
00:32:41,509 --> 00:32:42,509
No rush...

606
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:43,670
Shulang and I

607
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,229
can sync anytime.

608
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,269
Wow, what a surprise!

609
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:53,910
President Fan

610
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,830
and our Director You
already knew each other?

611
00:32:56,869 --> 00:32:58,989
This is truly a stroke of
fate for our companies!

612
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,070
Didn't they say President
Fan grew up abroad

613
00:33:03,229 --> 00:33:04,829
and only recently came back to Thailand?

614
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:05,910
How are they so close?
No idea...

615
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:08,191
maybe they knew each other before.

616
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:11,629
Even at the welcome line earlier,

617
00:33:11,749 --> 00:33:13,389
he kept calling him “Shulang.”

618
00:33:13,462 --> 00:33:14,782
Doesn't sound like they just met.

619
00:33:16,749 --> 00:33:17,749
Director,

620
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,790
the banquet's about ready.

621
00:33:20,109 --> 00:33:21,509
Shall we move to the restaurant?

622
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:22,749
Perfect.

623
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,830
President Fan,

624
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:26,629
we brought our own chef team from home...

625
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:27,868
so you can taste

626
00:33:27,869 --> 00:33:29,069
the most authentic.

627
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,070
Hua country dishes,

628
00:33:30,629 --> 00:33:31,910
and good liquor.

629
00:33:31,989 --> 00:33:33,430
Then I'll happily accept.

630
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:35,989
I can hold my liquor...

631
00:33:37,229 --> 00:33:38,710
Shulang knows that best.

632
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:41,950
Then

633
00:33:42,109 --> 00:33:43,109
I'll have Xiao You

634
00:33:43,349 --> 00:33:44,909
keep you company for a few more drinks.

635
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:47,269
Okay...

636
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,430
President Fan

637
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:53,229
is a lifesaver!

638
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,550
Come, President Fan...

639
00:33:54,629 --> 00:33:55,469
cheers!

640
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,950
Open another bottle.

641
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,430
Xiao Ding,

642
00:33:58,749 --> 00:34:00,830
why am I seated next to the main seat?

643
00:34:00,989 --> 00:34:03,749
Shouldn't that be for
Director Liu and the deputies?

644
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:04,950
No mistake, Director.

645
00:34:05,469 --> 00:34:07,430
Director Liu told me

646
00:34:07,469 --> 00:34:09,069
to put you next to President Fan.

647
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,349
I thought you knew.

648
00:34:11,789 --> 00:34:12,270
President Fan...
go on,

649
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,470
and enjoy.

650
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,910
We at Bohai Pharma

651
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,149
have just finished

652
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,350
our state-owned restructuring.

653
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:19,510
We've got

654
00:34:19,589 --> 00:34:21,789
a stack of drug approvals...

655
00:34:22,069 --> 00:34:22,470
but

656
00:34:22,589 --> 00:34:23,589
without capital

657
00:34:23,789 --> 00:34:26,190
approvals don't turn into cash.

658
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:29,028
Everyone here

659
00:34:29,029 --> 00:34:30,389
is an industry pro,

660
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,270
so I won't lecture.

661
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,869
But if we're aiming at Hua country,

662
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,990
I have to talk specifics.

663
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:40,869
You all know

664
00:34:41,109 --> 00:34:42,109
what KunPharm's.

665
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:45,309
Anxin Oral Liquid does yearly...

666
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:47,990
and that's not counting
the halo on other SKUs.

667
00:34:49,309 --> 00:34:50,589
Director Liu,

668
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:52,309
your Shuxin Oral Liquid

669
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,069
never even went into production.

670
00:34:54,549 --> 00:34:55,750
Frankly,

671
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:57,990
that's begging

672
00:34:58,109 --> 00:34:59,349
while holding a gold rice bowl.

673
00:35:02,829 --> 00:35:05,309
President Fan,

674
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:06,709
if you like that.

675
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,829
OTC direction,

676
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:13,270
we'll make a new plan
and have you look at it.

677
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,430
Xiao You,
come, come,

678
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,629
top up President Fan's glass.

679
00:35:23,236 --> 00:35:25,436
Usually I'm the one
pouring for Director You.

680
00:35:26,149 --> 00:35:27,708
How dare I trouble him tonight?

681
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,710
President Fan...

682
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,549
this partnership

683
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:36,069
between Pinfeng Capital and
Bohai is riding on Director You.

684
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:37,869
I say

685
00:35:38,029 --> 00:35:39,109
this project

686
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,589
should be led by Director You.

687
00:35:41,629 --> 00:35:47,869
He's got a medical background but he's
wasting it working as an office director.

688
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:48,950
Director,

689
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,750
please don't flatter me.

690
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:52,309
I'm not that good.

691
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:53,869
How will you know

692
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,789
if you don't try?

693
00:36:02,789 --> 00:36:03,829
As for investment,

694
00:36:04,389 --> 00:36:05,990
President Fan—please favor Bohai.

695
00:36:07,109 --> 00:36:08,109
Well, no problem.

696
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:12,950
Come...

697
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,510
let's raise a glass

698
00:36:14,629 --> 00:36:16,109
to President Fan!

699
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:16,829
Here's to

700
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,069
a great partnership!

701
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,869
Your people were lining up to toast,

702
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:43,355
and you ducked in here
for some peace and quiet?

703
00:37:09,789 --> 00:37:12,510
You don't need a foot
soldier like me, President Fan.

704
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:29,950
You've had a few...

705
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:31,990
watch your step.

706
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,983
Trash can's on your side;

707
00:37:36,822 --> 00:37:37,822
I'll toss this.

708
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:43,187
Mad about what I said
at the table just now?

709
00:37:43,435 --> 00:37:44,435
No.

710
00:37:45,441 --> 00:37:47,201
You were boosting my value.

711
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,710
Why would I be mad?

712
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,349
If we're investing anyway,

713
00:37:52,355 --> 00:37:54,075
why not put Director You's value

714
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,029
on a pedestal?

715
00:37:56,629 --> 00:37:57,829
You're really investing?

716
00:37:58,309 --> 00:37:59,510
The project's got legs.

717
00:38:00,789 --> 00:38:01,789
So…

718
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:03,710
So…

719
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,029
when we go back out,

720
00:38:05,789 --> 00:38:07,348
our “Grand Director You”

721
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:08,749
should play a little hard-to-get...

722
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:10,950
make those clueless folks

723
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,109
all
shut

724
00:38:14,776 --> 00:38:15,776
their

725
00:38:16,802 --> 00:38:17,802
mouths.
