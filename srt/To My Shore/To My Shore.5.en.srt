1
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:17,479
A wind that only seems gentle.

2
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:22,440
Your gaze shimmers with a dark undertow.

3
00:00:23,479 --> 00:00:28,119
Who is laughing at my madness

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,560
yet indulges my startled heart.

5
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:38,959
I see through your mask

6
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:44,159
and let you probe my limits.

7
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,758
It is I who indulge.

8
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,400
Love blazes like fire

9
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,839
spreading.

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,879
Hard to say who crossed the line first

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,758
and who is waiting for whom to yield.

12
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,598
Sharing rouge-scented smoke

13
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,638
and the flame that collides at our lips

14
00:01:07,639 --> 00:01:10,000
fiercer than any tender lingering

15
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,838
a duel that stakes our pride

16
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:18,080
whether a calamity decreed by fate

17
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:23,319
or sweetness bestowed by heaven

18
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,638
I still choose craving, wrath, and folly's

19
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:30,278
mad notion

20
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:33,400
made real.

21
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:40,719
To hold your gaze is far too perilous

22
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,838
I walk devoutly toward my ruin.

23
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:54,839
You are my abyss.

24
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,918
You are my

25
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:08,479
sunshine.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
"To My Shore"

27
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,960
You Shulang.

28
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,039
Director You.

29
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:21,559
My great Director You.

30
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,559
I was just running my mouth...

31
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:26,639
don't take it to heart, okay?

32
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,160
Fan Xiao.

33
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,679
Let's go back to the room...

34
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,120
shut the windows and doors...

35
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,039
then you won't hear those damned waves.

36
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,559
Back to the room, the windows and doors
shut…

37
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:43,719
what exactly does Director
You want to do to me?

38
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,240
Director You,

39
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,479
I admit I was wrong.

40
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:50,600
I won't talk nonsense again.

41
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:52,319
I'll plead guilty and take my punishment.

42
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,936
President Fan, no need to exaggerate.

43
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,360
Then give me a smile?

44
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,639
The whole way back

45
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,838
I've been cracking jokes

46
00:02:57,839 --> 00:02:59,080
and you didn't laugh once.

47
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,039
Your bar is way too high, Director You.

48
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,039
Enough...

49
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:04,679
go shower.

50
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:06,599
We have an early conference tomorrow.

51
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,479
You really won't help me wash?

52
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,000
If this hand gets wet,
it's gonna be a hassle.

53
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,399
“If”?

54
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:18,839
From the way I've water-proofed this,
there's no way that that will happen.

55
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:19,839
Unless

56
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:22,279
you deliberately dunk it in water,

57
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,199
then

58
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:24,479
there won't be an “if.”

59
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,399
Go.

60
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,279
Teasing him like this

61
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,639
should lift his mood a little.

62
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:49,199
Tragic-hero act failed.

63
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,880
Strike the set of props!

64
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,320
Ahh—much better with that splint off.

65
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,720
Why didn't he take his robe in?

66
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:07,119
Fan Xiao...

67
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,479
your robe.

68
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,320
Thanks.

69
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,920
Get dressed before you come out.

70
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,920
Put your clothes on.

71
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,680
If I'm dressed,
how am I supposed to show off the goods?

72
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,160
The wine you brought

73
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,279
really is good.

74
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:00,839
Want to join me

75
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:02,959
for a glass?

76
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,959
Is there a condom in the nightstand?

77
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,600
Pretty sure there's a
vending machine in the lobby.

78
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,079
Or is it that President Fan's hand
is inconvenienced,

79
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,320
and needs my service?

80
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,880
Then I'll need to trouble you,
Director You.

81
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,720
President Fan,

82
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,920
How do you want your drink?

83
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:28,040
From my hand taking sips at a time,

84
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:31,480
or one glass after another?

85
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,320
However Director You
prefers it, that's how I'll have it.

86
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,399
Then… more it is.

87
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:01,239
Shulang...

88
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:05,959
This one's

89
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,040
to your acting skills.

90
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:09,559
Your right hand's fine,

91
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,799
and you're still playing the invalid.

92
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,119
Must be tiring wearing
that splint every day.

93
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,720
It hasn't been long.

94
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,016
Two or three days ago it was fine.

95
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,720
Do you find it fun to play around with me?

96
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,159
Or is my cheap labor

97
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,760
that you satisfying, President Fan?

98
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,959
I did infact trick you.

99
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,160
After my mother died,

100
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,079
no one ever cared fpr me like that.

101
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,399
So I got a little greedy.

102
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,720
That's on me.

103
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,000
I'll take it off and toss it.

104
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,519
So much effort.

105
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,959
Not easy for your left hand?

106
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,560
Since President Fan's hand is
“inconvenienced,”

107
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:53,239
let me help you.

108
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:57,279
Just now, Shi Lihua
couldn't get through to you

109
00:06:57,559 --> 00:06:58,559
and called me instead.

110
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,160
We chatted. He mentioned...

111
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:05,083
that when you were 16, you took
first place in an e-sports tournament...

112
00:07:05,283 --> 00:07:07,237
while playing left-handed.

113
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:19,519
Shulang, whether you believe me or not,

114
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:24,760
I never meant to toy
with you or disrespect you.

115
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,040
I just want you close to me...

116
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,280
so that I'm the only one in your eyes.

117
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,640
Tell me...

118
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,760
why is that?

119
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,000
I don't know

120
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,959
and I don't care to know.

121
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,200
What I do know is I'm off duty.

122
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,279
Tomorrow you sort your own materials.

123
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,239
Pack your own bags.

124
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
And right now...

125
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:49,040
go to sleep ASAP.

126
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,040
You Shulang,

127
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,519
sooner or later you'll be mine.

128
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,880
Mine alone.

129
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,799
Just for me, Fan Xiao.

130
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,500
(Episode 5)

131
00:08:10,119 --> 00:08:11,176
The second the forum ended,

132
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,480
President Fan dragged me
into the car all mysterious-like…

133
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,495
and it turns out you brought me to a gay
bar?

134
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,720
I offended Director You today

135
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:19,359
and didn't get a smile
out of you for a whole day.

136
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,320
I racked my brains for what you might like

137
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,119
and decided to cater to your taste...

138
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:27,079
and to bring Director You to pick up a man.

139
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,839
This is Pattaya's most famous Hua gay bar.

140
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,159
Is Director You pleased with my
arrangement?

141
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,520
I cannot wait.

142
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Then let's go in.

143
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:56,799
He's dancing so sexy.

144
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,840
Look.

145
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,080
Where are you touching?

146
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,000
Let's see who scores first tonight.

147
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,918
I've already picked my target.

148
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:09,919
Cheers!

149
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,479
Hey, Luo Luo...

150
00:09:15,239 --> 00:09:18,080
That tall, angular one
seems like your type, right?

151
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:19,640
Nah, I like the other one...

152
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,320
the cold, aloof, monkish vibe.

153
00:09:22,359 --> 00:09:24,320
Looks like I'm leaving first.

154
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:27,640
Go for it!

155
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,639
Didn't President Fan say
you'd help me “find a man”?

156
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,640
Where are the men?

157
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,039
Right on cue.

158
00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:34,599
Hi, handsome.

159
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,320
Are you two together?

160
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:38,719
No.

161
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,079
I brought a bottle...

162
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,000
mind if we share?

163
00:09:41,001 --> 00:09:42,520
What do you say, Director You?

164
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:57,759
Just straight drinking is boring...

165
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,039
let's play dice.

166
00:10:21,599 --> 00:10:22,599
I lost again,

167
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,320
but I really can't drink anymore.

168
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,479
Maybe Mr. You can help me out?

169
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:33,599
Sure.

170
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:40,320
Director You, ever the soft touch.

171
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:44,239
So you're drinking all his shots for him?

172
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
Why not?

173
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:46,719
He's young...

174
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,240
someone should look out for him.

175
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,479
Young indeed...

176
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,280
compared to the photo of the
boy hanging in your bedroom,

177
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:53,400
this one's even more tender.

178
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:54,479
Come on, pour...

179
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,056
I simply cannot wait to
take his shots for him.

180
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,960
Mr. You, maybe we could go somewhere else?

181
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,520
I know a themed hotel...

182
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:02,719
gaming rigs,

183
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,679
huge screen…

184
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:06,799
What else

185
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,320
can we do there?

186
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,640
Anything you want.

187
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,880
President Fan,

188
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,239
I'll head out first.

189
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,135
I wont be going back to the hotel tonight.

190
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,559
You should go somewhere else too...

191
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:21,400
the bar across the street

192
00:11:21,401 --> 00:11:22,719
is full of gorgeous ladies.

193
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,320
No need to worry about me.

194
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,960
I hope you have fun.

195
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,320
He's leaving...

196
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,039
Luo Luo's getting taken home!

197
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,799
Your turn—go, go!

198
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,679
Bro,

199
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,919
buy me a drink?

200
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,280
Sit.

201
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:53,359
Yes?

202
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,520
Handled?

203
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:57,239
Got it.

204
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:03,599
Think I'll get what I want tonight?

205
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:04,919
Huh?

206
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:06,359
Yeah.

207
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:09,599
Sure.

208
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,640
Keep the bottle...

209
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,239
it's yours.

210
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:17,159
You're much more obedient than he is.

211
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:19,599
Shame you're not my type.

212
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,679
You've got the wrong
guy. It's really not me.

213
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,239
Please stay calm.

214
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:36,520
We're not accusing you,

215
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:37,239
but the stuff

216
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,799
was in your bag.

217
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:40,718
Come with us to the station

218
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,080
for a routine interview.

219
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:43,599
Brother You, I...

220
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,479
Go on.

221
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,919
Just explain it clearly.

222
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,280
Can we swap numbers?

223
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:51,239
No need.

224
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,279
I'm on a business trip...

225
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,280
I'm leaving tomorrow.
Okay then.

226
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:56,559
This way.

227
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
President Fan...

228
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,719
enjoyed the show?

229
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,856
I wouldn't have the nerve to
watch Director You's show.

230
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,880
President Fan,

231
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:09,159
Don't mess around.

232
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:10,400
We're friends.

233
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:11,695
I don't want this getting ugly.

234
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:12,719
Ugly?

235
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,919
How would it get ugly?

236
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,119
I spoil you like a bodhisattva every day.

237
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,919
Is your heart made of stone...

238
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,480
that you really can't feel it?

239
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,559
Or is it that...

240
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:25,080
I failed to find you

241
00:13:25,081 --> 00:13:26,719
a suitable spring-fling partner?

242
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,159
How about me?

243
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,320
What? Do you care to say that again?

244
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,320
Director You,

245
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:37,080
do I make the cut?

246
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:39,520
Can I be your… guest for the night?

247
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:45,959
I told you to repeat it
to give you a chance to take it back...

248
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,599
and you fucking doubled down.

249
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,039
I meant it.

250
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,239
No take-backs needed.

251
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,520
Fine,

252
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,880
then I'll answer you:

253
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,840
No, you don't. I'm not interested.

254
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,039
Why not?

255
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,559
What am I lacking?

256
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,640
Lacking?

257
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,320
Your skin isn't fair enough;

258
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:06,839
your lashes aren't long enough;

259
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,359
your face isn't soft enough;

260
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,640
And

261
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,640
that waist—nope...

262
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,119
not flexible.

263
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,960
Stiff as a board...

264
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,640
no feel at all.

265
00:14:26,719 --> 00:14:27,919
“Fair, pretty,

266
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,320
and soft and supple”...

267
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,119
which box do you check?

268
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,280
Sounds like Director You's
taste needs correcting.

269
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:37,519
Do I need to point out
the flaws of your argument,

270
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:39,599
Or are you just saying that

271
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:41,479
to scare me off...

272
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,239
just like that boy you took away.

273
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,160
You weren't really going to
a hotel with him, were you?

274
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:49,919
You're overthinking it.

275
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:52,159
Fine, maybe I am.

276
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,599
But just now when your
hands were all over me,

277
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,479
you looked pretty into it.

278
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,799
Men know men best...

279
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,640
you can't deny that.

280
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,719
Fan Xiao,

281
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:03,559
for the sake of our friendship,

282
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:05,840
I've been intentionally holding back.

283
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,799
But if you're not
afraid of tearing it apart,

284
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,400
then answer me...

285
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:11,880
what do you want?

286
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,840
You want to sleep with me?

287
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,159
Yes.

288
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,520
Very much.

289
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,880
Then tell me this...

290
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,280
are you gay?

291
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,239
Answer directly.

292
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:29,919
Are you?

293
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,039
I can be.

294
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:33,679
Fan Xiao,

295
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:35,919
you just want a fling.

296
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,519
I don't know when you started

297
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,119
dabbling in men,

298
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:40,640
but if it's because of me,

299
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,039
I'm sorry.

300
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,320
I can promise you

301
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,880
I never tried to lure you,

302
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:47,599
and I never
did anything

303
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,719
to seduce you.

304
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:51,479
Meaning...

305
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:53,960
you've never had the
slightest interest in me.

306
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,200
If I'm not mistaken,

307
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,280
the day I kissed you during my episode,

308
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:00,000
you reacted.

309
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:02,479
And just now when you grabbed my waist...

310
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:03,959
you were pretty excited.

311
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,719
That's just a normal male reflex!

312
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:08,200
It has nothing to do with liking you.

313
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:10,719
Fan Xiao,

314
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:14,960
this is just a phase.

315
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,599
Curb your curiosity,

316
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,440
find yourself a girlfriend,
and call it a day.

317
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,880
I'm not going back to the hotel tonight.

318
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,056
See you at the airport in the morning.

319
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,080
And after that...

320
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,359
let's keep our distance.

321
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,679
You Shulang, wait.

322
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,359
Do you ever quit?

323
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:41,280
If you want to play,

324
00:16:41,281 --> 00:16:42,559
go back to that bar.

325
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:43,520
With your status,

326
00:16:43,521 --> 00:16:44,721
you'll have plenty of company.

327
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,176
Do me a favor—don't bother me again.

328
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,200
I love you.

329
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:52,039
I love you.

330
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:05,719
It's not a game.

331
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,319
I mean it...

332
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,400
I love you.

333
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
Nonsense.

334
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,760
You say it's nonsense...

335
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,656
fine, then let me say
it “nonsense” and all.

336
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,839
I want to see you every day.

337
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,256
When I do, I don't want to part;

338
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,800
when I don't, it itches under my skin.

339
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,319
To see you,

340
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,960
I've cooked up all kinds of dumb excuses.

341
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,479
Bohai never had that much work

342
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,599
that required me on site.

343
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,439
I don't even like

344
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,880
wetland parks.

345
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,016
My sense of direction is bad,

346
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,719
but not so bad I can't use GPS.

347
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:32,959
Every time I “got lost,”

348
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,560
it was just to make you come get me.

349
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:36,215
My right hand healed long ago...

350
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:37,920
hell, my left is even better...

351
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:38,800
Every lousy excuse

352
00:17:38,801 --> 00:17:40,400
was just to stay by your side,

353
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:42,199
to be with you.

354
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:51,560
I don't know if that's “love.”

355
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:53,800
You've seen a lot...

356
00:17:57,199 --> 00:17:58,519
why don't you diagnose it for me?

357
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,040
Fan Xiao...

358
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,479
You say you want to be with me.

359
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:07,199
That it's not a fling,

360
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,959
not a whim.

361
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:15,119
You Shulang,

362
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:18,079
I'm serious.

363
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,199
When I picture the future...

364
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:21,640
it's you I see.

365
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:29,199
This road—being gay—is hard.

366
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:32,199
I don't want to drag you into it.

367
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,000
I gave you a chance.

368
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,319
You didn't take it.

369
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,400
Don't blame me

370
00:18:43,719 --> 00:18:45,079
for being blunt now.

371
00:18:51,479 --> 00:18:52,479
Then kiss me.

372
00:19:05,199 --> 00:19:06,238
I can't wait,

373
00:19:06,239 --> 00:19:07,239
my bodhisattva.

374
00:19:31,479 --> 00:19:34,560
You like them fair, pretty, and soft?

375
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:37,799
And what are you bringing to the table?

376
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:39,680
Let your big bro test the goods.

377
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,000
You like men,

378
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,640
not sissies.

379
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,040
Go on...

380
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:57,239
keep going.

381
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,920
Director You...

382
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:14,119
did I pass inspection?

383
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,520
President Fan...

384
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:18,838
with a body this good,

385
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:20,079
you should've stripped earlier.

386
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,400
I'd take you even if you were straight!

387
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:49,319
Shulang!

388
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:55,160
What?

389
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,760
I want a smoke.

390
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,160
Chickening out?

391
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,560
No.

392
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:21,280
I'm just used to being… on top.

393
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:23,199
Now...

394
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:25,319
It's fine...

395
00:21:26,199 --> 00:21:27,640
Give me a minute to reset.

396
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,080
I need to prep a little mentally.

397
00:21:45,199 --> 00:21:46,199
You do it.

398
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,680
You sure...

399
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:58,839
me?

400
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,959
I don't want our first
time to come with regrets.

401
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:11,599
Still… some regrets.

402
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,199
It's fine—the timing wasn't exactly short.

403
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:19,920
You hit—uh—the regular mark for a guy…

404
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,560
I was too excited.

405
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,359
And a little
nervous.

406
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:26,479
Mm.

407
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,880
Damn. It's my first time,

408
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:30,160
so…

409
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,599
Mm.

410
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:34,199
I've never done it—with anyone.

411
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,560
Not even women.

412
00:23:36,479 --> 00:23:37,479
You're the first.

413
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:40,959
Really?

414
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:50,520
Hey, I'm not laughing at you.

415
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,920
I'm just...

416
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:54,760
surprised.

417
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,040
Don't rush...

418
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,800
I'll teach you.

419
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,280
Fan Xiao...

420
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,520
how are you...

421
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,346
OK, that's enough.

422
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,560
Even if half of what I
said earlier was B.S.,

423
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,800
let me say this again:

424
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:24,479
You Shulang,

425
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,280
I love you.

426
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,359
I love you a lot.

427
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:36,839
My hair's sticking up...

428
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:38,280
I just fell asleep on it.

429
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,719
You didn't even wake me.

430
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,680
It's cute that way.

431
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,119
Besides,

432
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,319
why would I wake you?

433
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:46,839
You barely slept these past few days.

434
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,839
Zip it.

435
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,400
Hand me the suitcase...
answer your phone.

436
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,838
No need. Take it for me...

437
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:56,760
check who it is.

438
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:57,800
Front pocket.

439
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:03,999
That tickles.

440
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,160
Keep it in your pants.

441
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,160
Answer?

442
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:10,599
Yeah—tell me who it is,

443
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,880
then put it to my ear.

444
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:14,719
It's so noisy here—hold it tight.

445
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:16,479
Mm.

446
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,118
Hello—yeah.

447
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,478
Just finished a meeting;
I'm getting off a flight.

448
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:24,479
Pick me up?

449
00:25:25,199 --> 00:25:27,719
No need to fuss.

450
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,479
Tomorrow?

451
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,800
No, I'm busy tomorrow.

452
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,920
Full day of meetings.

453
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,239
The day after works.

454
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,199
Text me the address.

455
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:38,520
Okay—see you then.

456
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:44,520
Not gonna ask who that was?

457
00:25:45,199 --> 00:25:47,199
Director You manages
his boyfriend pretty loosely.

458
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:48,959
Who was it?

459
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,040
A pharma R and D team

460
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,640
that keeps courting me and wanting funding.

461
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,239
They're very attentive.

462
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,479
You planning to invest?

463
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,760
No interest.

464
00:26:00,199 --> 00:26:01,719
But they're so enthusiastic

465
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:03,160
I can't exactly refuse a meal.

466
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,760
That's fair.

467
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:08,199
Did your ex ever pick
you up at the airport?

468
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:10,920
Why suddenly ask
such a question?

469
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,319
Because I realized

470
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,199
everything I'm doing…

471
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:15,839
your ex probably did for you already.

472
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,720
It doesn't sit right with me.

473
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:22,119
What a child.

474
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:32,040
Fan Xiao, enough— I'm done.

475
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,239
Teacher You—did I do it right?

476
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,839
You taught me all of this.

477
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:40,760
Cigarette—hand me the “Rouge.”

478
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:01,599
You Shulang...

479
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,640
You know,

480
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:06,000
you were born to be under a man.

481
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,560
No one's sluttier than you.

482
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,640
…What?

483
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,760
You Shulang—change the curtains.

484
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,560
Huh?

485
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,680
These let in too much light.

486
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,318
I remember your place

487
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:37,880
has thick blackout drapes.

488
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:40,319
You don't like the sun?

489
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:43,959
No.

490
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,800
During the tsunami,

491
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,800
I watched my mother drown.

492
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,920
I ran out of matches.

493
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:57,400
It was pitch black...

494
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,239
no light anywhere.

495
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,520
In the dark.

496
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,479
I can't see anything.

497
00:28:09,959 --> 00:28:11,640
I could pretend...

498
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,959
she was still with me.

499
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:20,199
If she had just held her breath a
little longer, she wouldn't have died.

500
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,959
But when the rescue team came

501
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,319
and pushed the wooden door open

502
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:31,160
and that blinding sunlight flooded in,

503
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,520
I saw her

504
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,040
pale face under the water.

505
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:40,079
I fear the cold

506
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:46,640
it's the shadow left from
being wet for so long that day.

507
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:54,599
It's over now.

508
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,160
Actually,

509
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,839
darkness isn't all bad.

510
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,680
It hides a lot of cruelty...

511
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:07,880
and it protects me who is so weak.

512
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:14,599
We'll change them...

513
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:16,920
add ten layers if you want.

514
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,719
Sun...

515
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,280
or darkness...

516
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:34,680
wherever you are,

517
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:36,880
I'll be there.

518
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,640
I'm showering first.

519
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,280
I'm coming too.

520
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:52,078
Don't cling.

521
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:53,079
Shulang.

522
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,400
Shulang.

523
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:57,079
Your ex

524
00:29:57,439 --> 00:29:58,719
still has a key?

525
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,239
He forgot to return it...

526
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:04,520
and I forgot to ask.

527
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,520
I didn't expect him to come today.

528
00:30:07,719 --> 00:30:08,719
Let's head out...

529
00:30:09,199 --> 00:30:10,199
together.

530
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
I'm not going.

531
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:15,760
You know, when two people break up,

532
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,120
do you know what's the best
way to make an ex miserable?

533
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,959
Beat him to it...

534
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:23,400
have a lover already hidden in your room.

535
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:26,119
Fan Xiao…

536
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:28,280
things with Lu Zhen ended peacefully.

537
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,000
There's need to hurt him.

538
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,560
And you're my boyfriend
in the bright light of day,

539
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,079
not some hidden fling.

540
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,760
Got it.

541
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:44,959
Fan Xiao...

542
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,040
Fan Xiao...

543
00:30:47,719 --> 00:30:49,280
Fan Xiao—cut it out.

544
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:53,879
Since Director You can't bear to upset him,

545
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,760
then I'll spare him the
shame of seeing me.

546
00:30:58,359 --> 00:30:59,000
You home,
Shulang?

547
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:06,599
Lu Zhen.

548
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,359
Shulang.

549
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,199
Is there a reason you've
come to see me today?

550
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:17,000
The person inside is your…

551
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,359
Mm. That's my boyfriend.

552
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,599
Oh, I see.

553
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,160
I thought

554
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:31,400
you wouldn't get a new boyfriend so soon.

555
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,040
I didn't expect it either.

556
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:34,839
But

557
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,839
fate is strange like that sometimes.

558
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
By the way, Lu Zhen...

559
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,520
I had your stuff
sent to your place already.

560
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,520
Is there anything missing?

561
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,680
Yeah...

562
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Yeah.

563
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:48,959
I left a painting here.

564
00:31:49,479 --> 00:31:50,079
Where?

565
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:51,319
I'll get it.

566
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:52,839
No...

567
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,439
I

568
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,839
I'll grab it.

569
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,160
How've you been?

570
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,560
Pretty good.

571
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,760
Makes sense...

572
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:18,199
you've got a new boyfriend.

573
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:23,160
Who is he?

574
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,640
Would I know him?

575
00:32:27,199 --> 00:32:30,719
After all, your social circle's small so...

576
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,560
Wait...

577
00:32:34,251 --> 00:32:35,871
(Fan Xiao)

578
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,680
I've got something else—
Gotta run.

579
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,560
Lu Zhen...

580
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,079
The key... to my place.

581
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:51,520
Oh.

582
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:54,359
I'm putting it here.

583
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:56,959
Bye.

584
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:00,520
Hello, Mr. Fan?

585
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:04,040
Hello? Mr. Fan?

586
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:05,359
Can you hear me?

587
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,400
Hello?

588
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,760
You've been out there forever.

589
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,559
Did your ex steal your soul?

590
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,920
Don't be jealous.

591
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:25,000
And I haven't settled the score with you
yet.

592
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:27,239
Did your ex

593
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:29,239
cheat on you?

594
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,640
Cause I can't imagine

595
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:33,880
anyone better than you.

596
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,000
Is he blind?

597
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,479
Don't speculate.

598
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,079
Don't gossip.

599
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Don't stir trouble.

600
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:44,359
Still protecting him, huh?

601
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,479
I want to shower with you.

602
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:52,199
Seared foie gras...

603
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:52,920
enjoy.
Thank you.

604
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,040
Mr. Fan.

605
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,560
Mr. Fan,

606
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:13,319
The gifts you've sent lately

607
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,760
are too expensive.

608
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,000
I can't accept them with nothing in return.

609
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,159
They're nothing...

610
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,399
little trinkets.

611
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,760
My friends keep asking

612
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,639
what we are,

613
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:28,638
and why you keep giving me things.

614
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,839
I…

615
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,040
Honestly...

616
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,080
I don't even know

617
00:34:33,081 --> 00:34:34,120
how to answer.

618
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,199
Friends...

619
00:34:35,479 --> 00:34:37,000
you mean your boyfriend?

620
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,238
Did I... cause
trouble between you?

621
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,239
No, no...

622
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,679
just regular friends.

623
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,159
I've broken up.

624
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,719
I'm single now.

625
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,840
Why?

626
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,840
It seemed like

627
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,000
your boyfriend was good to you.

628
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,679
It's just...

629
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,600
our personalities didn't gel.

630
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,399
Mr. Fan,

631
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,760
you're single too, right?

632
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,360
Zhen-zhen,

633
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,840
take a guess.

634
00:35:11,919 --> 00:35:14,040
I'd guess you should be single.

635
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,159
If you had a partner,

636
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,320
you wouldn't be

637
00:35:17,321 --> 00:35:19,320
casually showering gifts on someone else.

638
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,879
Then...

639
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,280
Mr. Fan,

640
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,879
why do you keep sending me things?

641
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,959
Why?

642
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,520
Because I love you, of course.

643
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,800
Mr. Fan...

644
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,000
that's… a lot, all of a sudden.

645
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:41,239
I...

646
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,879
When I asked you to model,

647
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,600
I told you...

648
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:47,359
I fall in love with

649
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,360
every life I paint.

650
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,840
Every

651
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:51,280
life.?

652
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,320
Yes.

653
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:53,800
Every life...

654
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:56,520
a water-borne flower,

655
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,679
a caged bird,

656
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,679
a dying cicada...

657
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,199
and you, too,

658
00:36:01,879 --> 00:36:02,879
Zhen-zhen,

659
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,320
To you, I'm the same as a flower,

660
00:36:07,919 --> 00:36:08,760
a bird,

661
00:36:08,761 --> 00:36:13,239
and a dying cicada?

662
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,600
That's right.

663
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:15,639
I love them...

664
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,120
and I love you.

665
00:36:17,121 --> 00:36:18,320
Since you “love” me...

666
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:20,119
would you be my boyfriend,

667
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,159
be with me as a couple?

668
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,120
Pardon?

669
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:23,800
Will you be my boyfriend?

670
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:27,040
When I invited you to model,

671
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,040
I thought I was clear:

672
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,840
it's just an exchange of inspiration.

673
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,879
I build a bond with my subject

674
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,959
to ignite creativity.

675
00:36:37,879 --> 00:36:38,879
It is “love,”

676
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,280
but not romance.

677
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,280
Is that clear enough?

678
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:45,959
Not romance.

679
00:36:48,919 --> 00:36:50,639
Then what are all these things you've done?

680
00:36:51,399 --> 00:36:52,399
Don't tell me you don't realize
you've been courting me!

681
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,080
It seems like you misunderstood.

682
00:36:57,719 --> 00:36:59,280
Giving you gifts, to me,

683
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,920
it's like watering a flower

684
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:03,119
finding a quiet patch of
earth for a dying cicada;

685
00:37:03,479 --> 00:37:04,479
it's all the same.

686
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,760
No distinction at all.

687
00:37:08,399 --> 00:37:09,520
No distinction?

688
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,560
What's more,

689
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,879
I plan on switching models.

690
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,719
You no longer fit.

691
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,478
I imagine we probably won't
see each other much in the future.

692
00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:20,479
Fan Xiao...

693
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,479
are you screwing with me?

694
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,360
Do you think I'm an idiot?

695
00:37:25,399 --> 00:37:27,199
Do you believe your own crap?

696
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,599
I don't need to waste money

697
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,800
messing with someone “without value.”

698
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,600
Lu Zhen...

699
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,520
Since we met,

700
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,879
I've never done anything
that crossed a line with you...

701
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,719
I never said anything frivolous.

702
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,959
I didn't try to pick you up
or sleep with you.

703
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,319
Everything you read into my actions

704
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,919
is your own fantasy.

705
00:37:45,919 --> 00:37:46,919
Do I

706
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:50,600
have to pay for your fantasies?

707
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,479
I want to build trust...

708
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:00,800
even intimacy...

709
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,360
like

710
00:38:03,479 --> 00:38:04,479
lovers.

711
00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:05,959
I might

712
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,640
even fall in love with you for a time.

713
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,760
I hope that when it comes to my love,

714
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:11,719
a man's love,

715
00:38:11,919 --> 00:38:12,919
you won't reject it.

716
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:39,719
Fan Xiao...

717
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,560
To you,

718
00:38:40,561 --> 00:38:41,879
I may not be worth much.

719
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,919
But you can't even let go of
someone you deem “worthless,”

720
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,800
which makes you a pervet.

721
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,040
Go to hell, you pervert!

722
00:39:22,479 --> 00:39:23,479
Mr. Sha...

723
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,239
the model you manage...

724
00:39:25,479 --> 00:39:26,159
yeah...
Lu Zhen...

725
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,199
he's been down lately.

726
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,360
Book him some out-of-town gigs.

727
00:39:31,399 --> 00:39:32,639
Help him clear his head.

728
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:36,159
I don't have a need for
any other models right now.

729
00:39:37,879 --> 00:39:38,879
Thanks.

730
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:39,800
Bye.

731
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:41,199
Oh...

732
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:43,399
Don't tell him
I was the one who asked.

733
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,800
Director You...

734
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,840
my hands are itching.

735
00:39:53,479 --> 00:39:54,479
I want to paint you.

736
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,238
In the crowd

737
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:15,800
I was spotted in an instant.

738
00:40:16,919 --> 00:40:19,319
The desolation in your eyes.

739
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,478
Hiding the same fire inside.

740
00:40:22,479 --> 00:40:25,158
No need for words.

741
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:28,479
No need to ask what's right or wrong.

742
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:30,999
The moment we drew close.

743
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,719
The outcome was already destined.

744
00:40:41,879 --> 00:40:44,399
Is the moth drawn to the light.

745
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:47,760
Or the whale sinking into the deep.

746
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,878
With nothing but solitary courage

747
00:40:49,879 --> 00:40:52,439
I wager it all on tomorrow.

748
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:56,438
The walls of the world.

749
00:40:56,439 --> 00:40:59,719
What does it matter if I break them down.

750
00:41:00,879 --> 00:41:03,158
My chest burns with heat.

751
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:05,360
Screaming only for you

752
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,158
I'll love you until it boils over.

753
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:11,439
Loving without a care for the world.

754
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,198
Like two stars.

755
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:15,199
Colliding and shattering in the night sky.

756
00:41:15,399 --> 00:41:16,399
Even if it's just for a moment.

757
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,999
It's more than enough to surpass forever.

758
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,279
Hate and love both burn brightly.

759
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,958
Loving until the sky falls dark.

760
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:23,919
Loving until we reach the end of the road.

761
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:25,718
Before the altar.

762
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:27,839
We burn all the incense.

763
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,918
Not asking for the next life.

764
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:30,438
Only desiring this moment.

765
00:41:30,439 --> 00:41:31,638
Drowning together with you in.

766
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:33,879
This blazing fire of fate
