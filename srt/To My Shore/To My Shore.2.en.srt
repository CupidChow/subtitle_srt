1
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
"To My Shore"

2
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:37,039
What's with you tonight?

3
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,199
You don't usually get
that worked up with me.

4
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,720
Where does it hurt?

5
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:45,679
Nowhere.

6
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:48,079
I'm gonna step out for a smoke.

7
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,038
Deputy Director Wang.

8
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,479
Hey, keep it up, you hear me?

9
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,320
Good drinker, too.

10
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,160
President Fan,

11
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:31,478
looks like you haven't had your fill.

12
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,240
Come on...

13
00:03:32,241 --> 00:03:33,639
let me keep you company.

14
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,240
Bet you didn't know...

15
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,558
when we set up the branch,

16
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:48,960
the location was my idea.

17
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,999
Some colleague wanted India...

18
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,800
said their meds were great.

19
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:55,759
Know what I told him?

20
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,960
I said...

21
00:03:56,961 --> 00:04:00,000
“You only ever used that
‘Indian magic oil, ' huh?”

22
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,679
Come on, another toast.

23
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:14,160
How's it taste this time...

24
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,119
still like rouge?

25
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,320
Not bad...

26
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,839
kind of intoxicating.

27
00:04:25,805 --> 00:04:27,006
Still over half a pack.

28
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,000
Take it. Savor it...

29
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,920
you might end up liking it.

30
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,720
Without the matches, the cigarette

31
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,279
really does feel like
it's missing something.

32
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:13,880
Uncle You,

33
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,839
I got you a present.

34
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,640
A present?

35
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,160
Did I forget an anniversary?

36
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,839
Here—have some water.

37
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:26,814
If you'd forgotten our anniversary

38
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:28,399
and still wanted a gift from me,

39
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,760
I'd have to tie you up and
keep you as my present.

40
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Come here.

41
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,519
Wait...

42
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,358
This serum is amazing.

43
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:47,319
Last time I had a shoot the next morning

44
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,798
and my skin was a mess...

45
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:50,320
this totally saved me.

46
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,039
So I bought one for you, too.

47
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,480
It's pricey,

48
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,919
but seriously perfect.

49
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,799
If it's pricey,

50
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,239
keep it for yourself.

51
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,000
It's not like I need to be on camera.

52
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,239
I got paid for a painting
model gig a few months back...

53
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,599
Three hours made me

54
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,160
what I usually get for a month of
magazine shoots in Hua country.

55
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:12,679
You don't like it?
That's not it.

56
00:06:13,481 --> 00:06:15,799
You're wondering if I
posed nude, aren't you?

57
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I figured…

58
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,959
you'd use your own judgment.

59
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,118
Can't you just ask me straight up?

60
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,879
Keeping it bottled and
guessing all the time...

61
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,920
doesn't that tire you out?

62
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,238
I just didn't want you to...

63
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:34,239
feel embarrassed?

64
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,359
Even if I had done it,

65
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,678
you'd be worrying about my feelings,

66
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:40,040
not getting jealous, right?

67
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,839
Zhen-zhen,

68
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,880
I think I should respect
you and your choices.

69
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,359
So…

70
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,720
you didn't?

71
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,040
Of course not.

72
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,760
I wouldn't strip for a few lousy bucks.

73
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,176
I was wrapped up tight from head to toe,

74
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,400
sitting there for three hours.

75
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:01,720
Three hours?

76
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:03,239
Must've been tiring.

77
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,320
Not really...

78
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:06,999
he just wouldn't open a window.

79
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,239
It was so stuffy.

80
00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:10,239
“He”?

81
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,760
Your employer?

82
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,399
…Yeah.

83
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,160
Zhen-zhen,

84
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:21,239
you're beautiful in my painting…

85
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,519
Zhen-zhen…

86
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:24,839
Zhen-zhen…

87
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:26,679
Lu Zhen!

88
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,559
Huh…
oh—right, my employer.

89
00:07:30,511 --> 00:07:34,000
Anything new from your
out-of-town gigs lately?

90
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:38,320
Work has been smooth.

91
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:39,640
But,

92
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,518
some of the fellow Hua people
who came to Thailand before me

93
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,798
kept bossing me around.

94
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:44,799
I ignored them,

95
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,160
so they teamed up to make things hard.

96
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:50,559
I'll have to see them at
tomorrow's celebration party.

97
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,480
Ugh—I really don't want to see those faces.

98
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,720
Zhen-zhen,

99
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,679
I dragged you to Thailand

100
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:04,000
and you had to restart your career here.

101
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,360
I'm sorry you've had to put up with this.

102
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,678
I'm not feeling bad at all...

103
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:09,799
I chose this.

104
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:13,160
It's not even some grand “career.”

105
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,919
Petty people are everywhere.

106
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,920
It's fine.

107
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,160
The important thing is being with you.

108
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,959
Then don't force yourself.

109
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:24,320
If you don't want to
go to the party, skip it.

110
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,399
Now,

111
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:30,839
how can we cheer our Zhen-zhen up?

112
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,679
I was pretty happy just now.

113
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,320
Then… as you wish.

114
00:08:39,313 --> 00:08:42,013
(Episode 2)

115
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,798
Yolanda really goes hard...

116
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,839
drinks like she never cares her health.

117
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:50,500
Her?

118
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:52,841
She's gotta bankroll her
precious “phoenix man,” after all.

119
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,520
Anyone singing?

120
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Come on, join in.

121
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,640
Oh right,

122
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:01,158
the guy dating a so-called
“phoenix man” is right here.

123
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,159
Lu Zhen,

124
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,199
you still dating that…
what's-his-name… “Director”?

125
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,118
He gives you ten grand a month to spend?

126
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:08,119
You...

127
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:12,039
Heat it in the microwave before eating.

128
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:13,080
Also,

129
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,559
Zhen-zhen...

130
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,279
if you go to the party,

131
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,880
take this card.

132
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:18,840
You know the PIN.

133
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:21,159
No point arguing with these people.

134
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,519
I should be calm and composed—like Shulang.

135
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,760
Yeah, I'm dating...

136
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,119
and it's going great.

137
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,718
I'm a grown man with
two hands and two feet.

138
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:30,279
Why would I spend someone else's money?

139
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,678
More like no one's spending on you.

140
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:34,798
Exactly...

141
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:35,999
probably even paying out of pocket.

142
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,519
We just think you could do better.

143
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,798
Find another one, right?

144
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:39,320
Right?

145
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,679
Sorry...

146
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,240
something came up. I'm heading out.

147
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,798
Oh, so you've got time
to “contact resources,”

148
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,199
but not to hang with friends? That's
so transactional.

149
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,159
Lu Zhen,

150
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,598
we agreed...

151
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:52,320
whoever leaves first pays the bill.

152
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:53,640
When did we agree to that?

153
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:55,119
When we walked in.

154
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,856
Don't tell me you can't pay
and you're playing dumb.

155
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,199
Spent all your cash
raising that phoenix man?

156
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,719
Don't go too far.

157
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Careful.

158
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:07,239
Mr. Fan.

159
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:09,478
Yolanda walks out

160
00:10:09,479 --> 00:10:11,599
and comes back with a total hunk.

161
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,319
Look closer...

162
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,799
the watch is a limited edition.

163
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,000
I met this lady in the hall...

164
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,719
she said her friends were in this room.

165
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:20,799
Folks,

166
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,480
I didn't walk into the wrong place, did I?

167
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,119
No, no—this is it.

168
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:26,479
Thanks so much.

169
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,678
Zhen-zhen...

170
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,679
what a coincidence.

171
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,039
You're here too.

172
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:33,839
Mr. Fan.

173
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,119
What a coincidence.

174
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,558
Hand her to me...

175
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:38,039
I'll call her friends to get her.

176
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:43,719
Been a while since I've seen Zhen-zhen.

177
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,839
Oh, you're Lu Zhen's friend...

178
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,520
chat away,

179
00:10:48,521 --> 00:10:50,199
I'll take Yolanda.

180
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,159
Having fun with your friends?

181
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:55,200
Who is this?

182
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:56,319
Yeah,

183
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,520
but I'm leaving now.

184
00:10:57,599 --> 00:10:58,479
Mr. Fan,

185
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,000
let's talk outside.

186
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:03,359
Since fate brought me

187
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,640
to Zhen-zhen's door,

188
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,319
how could I leave without buying a round

189
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,000
for your friends?

190
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,559
Waiter...

191
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,640
put the whole tab
for this room on me,

192
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,839
and bring three more sets of the 5A.

193
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
Mr. Fan...

194
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,840
Be good.

195
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,559
Ooh, landed himself a new sugar daddy?

196
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,359
Didn't see that coming...

197
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,039
Lu Zhen's got moves.

198
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:35,239
I'm Fan Xiao...

199
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:37,918
probably a few years older than you,

200
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,599
so call me Brother Fan.

201
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:40,599
I'm especially happy

202
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,799
to run into Zhen-zhen again.

203
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,679
His friends are my friends.

204
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
A small token...

205
00:11:47,001 --> 00:11:48,479
hope you all have fun.

206
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,400
Thanks, Brother Fan.

207
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,359
Thanks, Brother Fan!
Brother Fan's generous!

208
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,200
Our Zhen-zhen's straight forward...

209
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,919
not like those scheming types.

210
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,320
If he does something wrong,

211
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,239
I hope you'll cut him some slack.

212
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,959
Don't worry, Brother Fan...

213
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,320
we'll take good care of him.

214
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:10,918
Handsome and generous...

215
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:11,840
Zhen-zhen's lucky

216
00:12:11,841 --> 00:12:13,400
to have a friend like you.

217
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,320
Come on,
bottoms up.

218
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,880
Cheers, everyone.

219
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,320
Cheers!

220
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:19,400
Cheers!

221
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,239
Mr. Fan—cheers.

222
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,159
Zhen-zhen.

223
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,359
You're still here, Mr. Fan?

224
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,919
Thanks for tonight...

225
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,039
you didn't have to spend like that.

226
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:49,760
They're… not really my friends.

227
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,640
I know.
You know?

228
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,718
The second I walked in,

229
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:56,320
you were strutting like a little rooster...

230
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:59,960
I had a feeling
something went down.

231
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,679
Weren't you the last one to notice me?

232
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,760
Just putting on a show...

233
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,520
adds drama.

234
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,760
Careful.

235
00:13:09,946 --> 00:13:12,080
Buying the booze was to slap their faces.

236
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,960
No one gets to bully my Zhen-zhen.

237
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,559
Do I need to make myself scarce?

238
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,039
It's fine.

239
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,640
Hello...

240
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:32,679
Zhen-zhen,

241
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
where are you?

242
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:35,919
Party over?

243
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:38,359
Almost.

244
00:13:38,599 --> 00:13:41,999
I'm with a friend.

245
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,320
I'm still working late...

246
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,799
can't pick you up.

247
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,320
Mosquito...

248
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
got it for you.

249
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,159
Zhen-zhen?

250
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:02,960
Zhen-zhen?

251
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,000
The guy on the phone sounded… anxious.

252
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,640
Hello...

253
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,520
I'm fine—don't worry.

254
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,119
Just a bug buzzed me.

255
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:16,119
I'm hanging up. Bye.

256
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:20,000
And that was…?

257
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,879
Mr. Fan...

258
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,839
thanks for tonight.

259
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,400
I'll pay you back for the drinks,

260
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,960
but it'll take some time.

261
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,478
Also, the guy on the phone—that was my…

262
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:38,000
Lu Zhen—still here?

263
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:41,478
Brother Fan,

264
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:43,039
you paid so quickly

265
00:14:43,239 --> 00:14:45,840
and now you're leaving
me drunk and unattended?

266
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Is that so?

267
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,080
My bad, then.

268
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,359
You were saying—who was on the phone?

269
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:56,239
Oh...

270
00:14:57,359 --> 00:14:59,598
it was... family.

271
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:00,599
Family, huh?

272
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,640
They sure care about you.

273
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:07,678
Brother Fan I'm drunk...

274
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:08,839
how you gonna make it up to us?

275
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,840
Name it.

276
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:12,918
I'm dizzy.

277
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,840
Why don't you take me home?

278
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,479
I'm homophobic...

279
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,760
so keep your distance.

280
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,599
But,

281
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,080
Zhen-zhen's the only exception.

282
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,760
Mr. Fan.

283
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,238
My ride's here,

284
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:38,400
Thanks again...

285
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,960
I'm off.
See you.

286
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:00,039
Hello?

287
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,320
…Right now?

288
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,159
Downstairs at our building?

289
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,358
Got it...

290
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm coming.

291
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:13,479
President Fan...

292
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,880
what brings you here this late?

293
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:17,478
Heard everyone's working overtime

294
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:19,080
on my business plan.

295
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:21,080
I felt bad...

296
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:24,255
so I brought milk tea

297
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,719
to treat the team.

298
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,919
This one's yours.

299
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,640
Thanks for the thought.

300
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:32,119
I'll take the rest up,

301
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,640
but I'll pass...

302
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:34,599
I don't like sweet drinks.

303
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:36,320
This shop's famous...

304
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,039
won't you try a sip?

305
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:40,479
Sorry...
President Fan...

306
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:42,239
one sec,

307
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:43,359
I need to take this call.

308
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,519
Zhen-zhen loves Uncle You so much.

309
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,520
You home?

310
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:52,599
Yep.

311
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,678
Just walked in.

312
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:55,919
Uncle You,

313
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,798
I really, really love you.

314
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:01,000
That's the fifth time
since you got in the cab.

315
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:02,358
Did you drink too much?

316
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:03,359
Tired of me already?

317
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:06,319
When I was chasing you, I said it even more

318
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,959
and you didn't mind.

319
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,520
Are you in a meeting—can't talk?

320
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,400
No.

321
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,079
I just don't want you
feeling sick if you overdid it.

322
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,719
I feel fine...

323
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:20,520
I just suddenly missed you.

324
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,560
Okay, I won't keep you from work.

325
00:17:23,719 --> 00:17:24,719
Take care.

326
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,400
Sleep early...

327
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,599
good night.

328
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:31,519
I put so much work into getting these,

329
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,800
and got snubbed.

330
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:35,280
President Fan...

331
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,040
lend me a stick of “Rouge.”

332
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,040
Hooked already?

333
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,560
Not hooked...

334
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:44,958
I just rushed down

335
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,119
and forgot mine.

336
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,359
And that cup? I got
it with all the add-ons.

337
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:01,920
Guess my flattery missed the mark...

338
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,000
and still can't buy a
smile from Director You.

339
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:09,000
How could I accept such flattery from you?

340
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,639
Vecause you're my only friend

341
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,680
in this city.

342
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,000
And my only fun.

343
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,760
Can I chalk that up to…

344
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:21,959
poor wording?

345
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:23,880
Any time I say the wrong thing,

346
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,719
treat it like that.

347
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,920
You're my only friend...

348
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:32,880
but I'm not your only.

349
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:35,319
If you can't say it
right, then don't say it.

350
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,000
You're missing the mark.

351
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,920
Did I hear that right...

352
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,598
Director You actually swore?

353
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,455
Where's your “gentle,
modest, frugal, yielding”

354
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:43,920
code of conduct?

355
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,599
If you know all that

356
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,160
and still mangle my words,

357
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:53,119
I'll curse, yeah.

358
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,520
It's not a hallucination.

359
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:57,119
And thanks for the treats
on behalf of the team...

360
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:58,319
hand them over;

361
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,560
I'm heading up.

362
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,119
I was very clear:

363
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,119
you're my only one...

364
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,479
I'm not yours.

365
00:19:06,199 --> 00:19:07,199
See?

366
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,800
It's late

367
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:10,920
and people are still pinging you to chat.

368
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,040
Different relationships...

369
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,520
can't compare.

370
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:16,119
What's so different?

371
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,920
That's my partner.

372
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,319
How do you compare that?

373
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,680
Oh—your girlfriend, huh?

374
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:28,800
Yeah, can't compete with that.

375
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:31,000
He's not...

376
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,719
He isn't...

377
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:35,358
I'm good at spotting my own kind.

378
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:37,239
Working this late...

379
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,160
aren't you worried your
girlfriend will get lonely

380
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,560
and be swept away?

381
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:43,520
Or are you

382
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:45,400
that confident

383
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,239
no one can steal her?

384
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,680
If it can be stolen,

385
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,880
the foundation was bad to begin with.

386
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,160
I've got work...

387
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:56,599
I'm heading up.

388
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,000
And the treats?

389
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,000
They're from you to the team...

390
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,999
it's better if you bring them up yourself.

391
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,199
It shows sincerity.

392
00:20:19,682 --> 00:20:20,210
Shit.

393
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,599
Bohai's leadership catches on fast...

394
00:20:31,046 --> 00:20:33,686
already putting You Shulang
on the project team.

395
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:38,319
Time to put the company on ice.

396
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,800
When You Shulang comes begging,

397
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:44,000
I'll refuse to invest.

398
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,160
Wonder if by then

399
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:50,199
his standing will tank?

400
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,520
(in Thai: The higher he's
lifted, the harder he falls.)

401
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,760
Come to think of it,

402
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:02,815
I've kept the project—and
him—dangling for over a month.

403
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:04,800
He hasn't reached out either.

404
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,160
President Fan?

405
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,640
President Fan?

406
00:21:08,153 --> 00:21:08,633
Mr. Huang...

407
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,800
sorry.

408
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:12,800
You were saying Changling Pharma's juggling
research

409
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:14,599
and revenue...

410
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,199
I thought

411
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:18,400
it's not easy.

412
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:20,400
We're the secondary industry

413
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:24,719
under Changling University in Hua country.

414
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,359
There's state support,

415
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,519
but it's a drop in the bucket.

416
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,520
Otherwise,

417
00:21:32,545 --> 00:21:33,944
researchers like us

418
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,799
wouldn't be out hunting for investment.

419
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,599
Understood.

420
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,160
The fact you flew to
Bangkok shows real sincerity.

421
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:43,799
Once I learned your firm

422
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,120
is led by a someone with Hua heritage,

423
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:47,838
investing specifically
in Hua country pharma,

424
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:51,119
I wanted to buy a ticket that instant.

425
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Here are the hard copies for the
Honeysuckle Drink project I mentioned...

426
00:21:58,479 --> 00:22:00,680
handy for you to browse anytime.

427
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:01,839
Thoughtful.

428
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:11,599
Mr. Huang,

429
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,520
to understand a product,

430
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,400
you've got to start at the root.

431
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,959
Like this “team highlight” photo...

432
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,199
interesting shot.

433
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,238
Mr. Huang, please

434
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:24,319
tell me about it?

435
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:28,760
This one…

436
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:31,760
must've been six or seven years ago.

437
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:36,839
I was leading a team on a project...

438
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,560
days and nights blurred together.

439
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:42,319
We even won an award.

440
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,400
Back then, Changling University
had just one research center;

441
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,160
every project

442
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,199
was professor-led with students.

443
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,279
Most people in this picture

444
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,119
were my students...

445
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:00,359
so green back then.

446
00:23:02,199 --> 00:23:03,199
Director You,

447
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,839
You look great when you smile.

448
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,920
(in Thai: Many sins begin with a smile.)

449
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:29,239
Shilihua.

450
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,039
Fan Xiao...

451
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,358
without you to get into trouble with,

452
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:36,640
I can't sleep alone at night.

453
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:39,679
Now that's what I call

454
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,719
mangled wording.

455
00:23:41,199 --> 00:23:41,839
Let's go.
Go.

456
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:45,560
Thought you were done with business...

457
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,839
weren't you gonna party around the world

458
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:49,719
like a pampered prince?

459
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,718
I've got a whole pile
of uncles and big bros.

460
00:23:51,719 --> 00:23:53,198
Unless a plague or war wipes them out,

461
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:54,759
the position of heir

462
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,319
will never be mine.

463
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,519
What else am I good for

464
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,640
but being a layabout prince?

465
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,999
Not like your
Nanwa family; few heirs,

466
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,318
and you're outstanding.

467
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:06,263
Might just make a splash.

468
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:07,695
I've set something up for tonight...

469
00:24:07,719 --> 00:24:08,719
don't be late.

470
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:10,000
You just landed

471
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,720
and already set up a party?

472
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:14,319
Your phone's ringing.

473
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,680
Let it ring.

474
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,639
What was I saying?

475
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,640
Oh—party.

476
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,239
I'll tell you,

477
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,478
this time I come back,

478
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:25,040
plenty of folks begged to pick me up,

479
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,839
but I gave that honor to you
and you alone, Young Master Fan.

480
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:30,839
Fine.

481
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:32,719
Tonight,

482
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:34,479
I'll find you some “fun”.

483
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:35,839
Deal.

484
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:38,199
Director You...

485
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
long time no talk.

486
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,040
Sorry, Shulang...

487
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:55,279
I got stuck with a few business partners

488
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,199
and neglected you.

489
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,598
President Fan's a busy man.

490
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:58,999
I invited you on short notice anyway...

491
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,358
sorry to intrude.

492
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:01,879
It might be an intrusion for others...

493
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:03,160
not for you.

494
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,479
We could reschedule.

495
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,119
You thought of me today...

496
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:09,400
no way I'm rescheduling.

497
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,520
I wanted to have you to myself,

498
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,839
but my childhood friend flew back

499
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:16,000
and I promised to host him.

500
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,215
You'll have to bear with me.

501
00:25:17,239 --> 00:25:18,359
No need to “bear with”...

502
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,040
you flatter me.

503
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,839
Come...

504
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,959
meet someone.

505
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,680
Mr. Xue.

506
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,199
Oh—President Fan.

507
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,838
Heir to Ruixiang Chain Pharmacies...

508
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:31,479
Deputy GM Xue.

509
00:25:31,719 --> 00:25:33,318
This is Bohai Pharma's office director,

510
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:34,319
You Shulang.

511
00:25:39,479 --> 00:25:40,560
New friend,

512
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,760
but it's like we've known
each other for years.

513
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:46,496
With an intro like that from President Fan,

514
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,040
you must be something special!

515
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Shulang,

516
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:54,000
one key task for Bohai's Thailand branch

517
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,319
is securing shelf space
in local pharmacies.

518
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,238
Whether you can break in,

519
00:25:59,239 --> 00:26:00,239
find a market...

520
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,760
Deputy GM Xue plays a key role.

521
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,319
Ruixiang's distribution network

522
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:07,800
is top-three nationwide...

523
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,496
mainly serving the Hua community.

524
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,800
Thanks for the intro.

525
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,880
I'd already heard about Ruixiang's
market share when I first arrived.

526
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,999
Didn't expect the one at the helm

527
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,479
to be so young and capable.

528
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:21,959
You flatter me.

529
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,920
President Fan's friend

530
00:26:22,921 --> 00:26:24,319
is my friend.

531
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:25,079
Come,
first drink's on me.

532
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Mr. Xue,

533
00:26:28,001 --> 00:26:29,598
I've been looking everywhere for you.

534
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:31,040
Won't you have a drink with me?

535
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,959
How could I not? Come, let's go top off.

536
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,040
Come on, drinks!
Go on...

537
00:26:35,801 --> 00:26:37,359
don't waste the lady's kindness.

538
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,560
I'm off then...
come on,

539
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,400
drinks!

540
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,839
President Fan, excuse me...

541
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:44,239
I'm stepping out for a smoke.
Sure.

542
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,680
What are you staring at, Xiao...

543
00:26:51,239 --> 00:26:52,239
Why so serious?

544
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:54,359
Nothing...

545
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,920
something dirty.

546
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,640
Your “fun”

547
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,920
looks decent,

548
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,680
but man is he dull.

549
00:27:04,199 --> 00:27:06,160
Not just because he's a guy...

550
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:07,520
he's just…

551
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,359
boring.

552
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,160
He's interesting.

553
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:12,599
A saint, really.

554
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:14,800
A saint?

555
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:16,478
With you, a saint

556
00:27:16,479 --> 00:27:18,159
is gonna get skinned.

557
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,400
Give us a show later, yeah?

558
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,680
Sure.

559
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:25,599
You,

560
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,319
it's a critical moment for the funding.

561
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,718
What's President Fan's stance, exactly?

562
00:27:30,719 --> 00:27:32,358
As project lead,

563
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,560
you need to push...

564
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:37,479
stop dragging your feet.

565
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,400
Hey—this the suite up ahead?

566
00:27:43,479 --> 00:27:44,160
Yeah...

567
00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:45,239
let's go.

568
00:27:46,199 --> 00:27:48,118
That stuff you brought—is it strong?

569
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:48,880
Don't worry...

570
00:27:48,881 --> 00:27:49,919
fresh batch.

571
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,080
They'll feel heaven and hell.

572
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:52,239
Go.

573
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,760
Go.

574
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,119
Come on, President Fan...

575
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,160
come on,

576
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:09,359
Let's go, Xiao...

577
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,199
come sit.
Everyone,

578
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,119
have a seat.

579
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,959
Let me introduce you...

580
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,718
this is our new office clerk,

581
00:28:18,719 --> 00:28:19,839
Xiao Wan.

582
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:22,919
And this is… the director...

583
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,599
You.

584
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,640
Right, Director You.

585
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:26,040
Xiao Wan...

586
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:28,160
your job's like his.

587
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,000
Learn from him.

588
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,799
See how he handles a room?

589
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,239
Take notes.

590
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,560
Heh, listen to my big mouth.

591
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,719
No offense, Director You.

592
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,000
You're not wrong.

593
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,040
Office work is service work...

594
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:50,799
know the right move for the right setting.

595
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,760
Xiao Wan, was it?

596
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:56,839
Since your boss wants you to learn,

597
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:58,719
I'll play teacher today.

598
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,238
To do a good job in service,

599
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,800
first rule: stay sober.

600
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,238
If you get drunk,

601
00:29:04,239 --> 00:29:05,560
who will take care of your boss?

602
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,039
So—office staff

603
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,040
with no tolerance

604
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,358
shouldn't lift a glass.

605
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:10,359
Here—have water.

606
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,000
Thank you.
Director You.

607
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,118
Our Xiao Wan can hold her liquor.

608
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:18,198
She can take care of all the “big brothers”

609
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:19,718
and her boss...

610
00:29:19,719 --> 00:29:20,719
right, Xiao Wan?

611
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,920
Y-yes.

612
00:29:22,199 --> 00:29:23,679
That's better.

613
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,238
Put the water down.

614
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:27,520
Bring the liquor.

615
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,640
Hold up...

616
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:31,520
drinking alone is boring.

617
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,199
How about

618
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:35,680
playing cards?

619
00:29:35,681 --> 00:29:37,640
Loser drinks.

620
00:29:40,807 --> 00:29:41,807
I'm in.

621
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,119
Come on!
Cards!

622
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,199
Should've started with that.

623
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:46,719
Fine.
What game?

624
00:29:47,239 --> 00:29:48,239
How do we drink?

625
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:49,839
Texas hold 'em?
Deal.

626
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,400
Shuffle up.

627
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,318
Damn it—me again?

628
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:17,400
Hurry up.

629
00:30:17,719 --> 00:30:19,319
Want Xiao Wan to feed you?

630
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:22,039
I've had four.

631
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,000
Fan Xiao had one.

632
00:30:23,001 --> 00:30:24,040
Director You had two.

633
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:25,159
How many have you had?

634
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,839
Don't worry about me...

635
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
worry that.

636
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,718
Xiao Wan's row of shots is untouched.

637
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:34,920
Of course people trained by Deputy
GM Xue have got skill and luck.

638
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,880
Come on...

639
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,160
next round.

640
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,800
I'll deal this time...

641
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,760
can't have Director You doing it all.

642
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:44,680
This little chore—how
could I trouble Deputy GM...

643
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:46,599
Don't be so polite...

644
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,160
ah! Xiao Wan lost.
Time to drink.

645
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,640
Wait...

646
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,560
don't make a young woman drink alone.

647
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,760
Come,

648
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:05,839
I'll match her.

649
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Pop quiz:

650
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,520
if someone's drunk

651
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,680
and wants to do a cross-arm toast with you,

652
00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:17,599
what should a host do?

653
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:22,479
Then let me be a know-it-all.

654
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,800
I'll teach you.

655
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,479
You can say, “Cross-arms isn't convenient,

656
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,040
but we can swap glasses.”

657
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:34,640
That way you keep things professional

658
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,920
without offending anyone.

659
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,919
If a guy's halfway decent,

660
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,839
he won't push for more.

661
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:41,199
Got it?

662
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,280
Got it.

663
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:45,199
Cheers.

664
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Sorry,

665
00:31:51,199 --> 00:31:52,599
to waste good liquor.

666
00:31:52,719 --> 00:31:53,160
Otherwise...

667
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,640
There's plenty more.

668
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:57,199
Director You...

669
00:31:58,239 --> 00:31:59,599
this one

670
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,319
just don't spill this one.

671
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,359
Nice tolerance!

672
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:28,560
You Shu...

673
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,318
Director You's got class,

674
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,920
but swapping drinks for a lady...

675
00:32:37,479 --> 00:32:38,838
one for one...

676
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:39,680
won't do.

677
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:41,040
You're right, Deputy GM Xue.

678
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,400
Water?

679
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,520
Sorry...

680
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:08,359
don't feel well.

681
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:10,359
I'm heading out.

682
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,199
Enjoy.

683
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I'll take you.

684
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:27,239
Thanks...

685
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,239
no need.

686
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,799
I've already called a driver.

687
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,800
I'll go with you.

688
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,560
Hot?

689
00:33:48,199 --> 00:33:49,319
Want your collar loosened?

690
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:51,599
I'll help.
No…

691
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,520
no.

692
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,199
Shulang,

693
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,360
Thirsty?

694
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,320
Let me help you.

695
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,239
Shulang,

696
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,239
let me...

697
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,719
Shulang,

698
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,639
I'll...

699
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:40,959
Stop the car.

700
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,239
What's wrong?

701
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,679
Don't turn on the light.

702
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,800
Park here.

703
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,679
Please grab a taxi back...

704
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,879
I'll pay triple the fare.

705
00:35:15,399 --> 00:35:16,679
I drank too much...

706
00:35:17,313 --> 00:35:19,513
sorry for the scene, President Fan.

707
00:35:21,479 --> 00:35:22,679
Shulang,

708
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,919
No outsiders here...

709
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:26,600
don't “President Fan” me.

710
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,320
If you say it again,

711
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:32,919
there'll be a penalty.

712
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:39,719
I'm uncomfortable...

713
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,760
let me get out and walk.

714
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,760
I'll grab a cab later.

715
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,360
I'll go with you.

716
00:35:47,919 --> 00:35:48,919
Don't.

717
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,840
You have a fever?

718
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:54,239
You're burning up.

719
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:55,560
Let go...

720
00:35:55,561 --> 00:35:56,679
I'm getting out.

721
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,239
You've been drugged.

722
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,918
The girl's drink...

723
00:36:01,919 --> 00:36:04,199
there was something in it.

724
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,800
So you swapped drinks

725
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,040
to save her?

726
00:36:19,919 --> 00:36:21,519
Maybe I

727
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,639
pushed this too far.

728
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:28,479
President Fan...

729
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,918
could you… step out?

730
00:36:32,919 --> 00:36:35,360
I said—don't call me that.

731
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,399
Or there's a penalty.

732
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:42,320
What… kind of penalty?

733
00:36:53,538 --> 00:36:54,538
President Fan,

734
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:57,000
can you get out?

735
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,000
I might be a mess in a minute.

736
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,360
…Okay.

737
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,800
Can't see…

738
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:33,239
can't see a thing.

739
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,679
Damn—this is insane.

740
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,319
I'd already decided to stop playing games

741
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,919
when I dropped him off.

742
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,879
Mr. You...

743
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,600
get some rest.

744
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:56,360
Thanks for the ride,

745
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:58,239
See you, President Fan.

746
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,280
(in Thai: No man is hotter than you.)

747
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,320
What did you say?

748
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,560
I said...

749
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,080
good night.

750
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,360
Good night.

751
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,800
You asked me out...

752
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,520
don't you have anything you wanted to ask?

753
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:17,639
You Shulang...

754
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,560
You asked me out...

755
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:22,919
don't you have anything you wanted to ask?

756
00:39:24,399 --> 00:39:26,600
I did...

757
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:28,360
about the investment.

758
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:30,632
But don't worry about me when you decide.

759
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,199
I'm just an employee.

760
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,120
Whatever you decide,

761
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,600
I won't starve.

762
00:39:35,919 --> 00:39:37,040
The project looks strong;

763
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:38,840
it's passed evaluation.

764
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,239
Next is locking business terms.

765
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:44,000
Trust my professionalism...

766
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:46,560
I don't throw my money away,

767
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,520
even if we're…

768
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:51,719
friends.

769
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,120
I won't rush an LOI,

770
00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:59,560
but I'll pull your company's deck

771
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:02,800
back out of the “discarded” pile

772
00:40:03,919 --> 00:40:05,159
and have the team reevaluate.

773
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:07,159
Then…

774
00:40:07,919 --> 00:40:08,560
thanks.

775
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,840
How will you thank me?

776
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:12,040
Dinner won't cut it.

777
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,040
Not enough.

778
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,040
President Fan...

779
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:22,159
What do you want me to do?

780
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:24,399
When I think of it,

781
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,520
I'll tell you.

782
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,840
Okay.

783
00:40:30,513 --> 00:40:33,313
Want me to avenge you for tonight?

784
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,639
Who...

785
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,239
Ruixiang's Xue Baotian?

786
00:40:38,959 --> 00:40:39,959
No need.

787
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:42,000
I'll handle it.

788
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,080
What's your play?

789
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:48,000
He's loaded.

790
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:50,320
I can't go head-to-head.

791
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:52,239
I thought you were a pure saint...

792
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,879
to take the hit and swallow it.

793
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
…Damn. Bye.

794
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,080
What...

795
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,280
did I scare you?

796
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Hardly.

797
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:54,159
Got the matches?

798
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,120
This cigarette really is kinda addictive.

799
00:42:04,919 --> 00:42:05,919
I'm off...

800
00:42:06,479 --> 00:42:07,479
bye.

801
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,679
Damn it—why did I think
he was going to kiss me?

802
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:21,360
Fan Xiao, what the hell
is wrong with your brain?

803
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,320
Forget it...

804
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,320
why am I so worked up?

805
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,520
It's just a porn flick.

806
00:42:29,959 --> 00:42:32,639
Some hardworking soft-core actor.

807
00:42:36,479 --> 00:42:37,479
Zhen-zhen…

808
00:42:40,479 --> 00:42:41,599
There it is again—Zhen-zhen.

809
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,360
You two really are something!
