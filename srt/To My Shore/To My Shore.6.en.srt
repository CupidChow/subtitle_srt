1
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:17,479
A wind that only seems gentle.

2
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:22,440
Your gaze shimmers with a dark undertow.

3
00:00:23,479 --> 00:00:28,119
Who is laughing at my madness

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,560
yet indulges my startled heart.

5
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:38,959
I see through your mask

6
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:44,159
and let you probe my limits.

7
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,758
It is I who indulge.

8
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,400
Love blazes like fire

9
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,839
spreading.

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,879
Hard to say who crossed the line first

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,758
and who is waiting for whom to yield.

12
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,598
Sharing rouge-scented smoke

13
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,638
and the flame that collides at our lips

14
00:01:07,639 --> 00:01:10,000
fiercer than any tender lingering

15
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,838
a duel that stakes our pride

16
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:18,080
whether a calamity decreed by fate

17
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:23,319
or sweetness bestowed by heaven

18
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,638
I still choose craving, wrath, and folly's

19
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:30,278
mad notion

20
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:33,400
made real.

21
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:40,719
To hold your gaze is far too perilous

22
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,838
I walk devoutly toward my ruin.

23
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:54,839
You are my abyss.

24
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,918
You are my

25
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:08,479
sunshine.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
"To My Shore"

27
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:17,360
Director You,

28
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,080
I had a great time drinking today.

29
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:20,336
You sure can hold your liquor.

30
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,039
I'm impressed.
You flatter me.

31
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,038
It's your booze that's good...

32
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,199
I just got greedy

33
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:25,279
and had a few more cups.

34
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,558
You have an eye for the good stuff.

35
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:27,838
This tiger-bone liquor

36
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:29,799
was a gift from the
then–Police Commissioner

37
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,880
soaked for years.

38
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,198
Back in the day...

39
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,439
I wouldn't take this out for just anybody.

40
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,919
Then I'm lucky tonight.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,880
Director You,

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,440
you haven't been here long,

43
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,759
but the local Hua Community

44
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:41,360
thinks highly of you.

45
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,198
Director Zheng praises you all the time...

46
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,278
says you're

47
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:44,759
thoughtful,

48
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,918
meticulous,

49
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,520
and quite the good-looker.

50
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,919
He even wants to introduce
his daughter to you...

51
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,759
to make you his son-in-law.

52
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Minister Chen, don't tease me.

53
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,760
I'll still be counting on
you and Director Zheng.

54
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,799
Your car's here, Minister.

55
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,800
OK.

56
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,119
We'll meet again another day.

57
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,638
I've still got some treasures tucked away—
I'll let you try them next time.

58
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,758
That's a deal.

59
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:07,918
I'll be waiting.

60
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:08,320
No problem.

61
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,559
Take care, Minister Chen.

62
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,759
OK.

63
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,838
We'll head out too.

64
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:20,079
Young man, I've got my eye on you.

65
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,759
Director Zheng,

66
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:21,919
rest early.

67
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:25,440
Take care.
We'll head out too.

68
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,559
It's a bit chilly at night.

69
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,639
What are you doing here?

70
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,199
I figured

71
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,839
your dinner was ending...

72
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:39,919
I came to pick you up.

73
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,439
I reek of smoke and liquor.

74
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,759
What's there to smell?

75
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,360
You smell good.

76
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,520
So,

77
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:55,918
the tiger-bone liquor went down easy, huh?

78
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,919
Couldn't stop at one?

79
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,240
How long were you here...

80
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,679
eavesdropping now?

81
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,279
Do I need to eavesdrop?

82
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,839
That guy's voice

83
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,360
carries a mile.

84
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,479
He used to be military...

85
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:10,839
he's used to barking.

86
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,919
No wonder he drinks “tiger-bone”...

87
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,160
a dragon roars, a tiger howls.

88
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,480
Don't even mention that stuff.

89
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,519
They tossed in who knows how many herbs...

90
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:21,799
the taste

91
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,200
is… indescribable.

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,359
Yet you still said it was good?

93
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,736
It was our first time meeting,

94
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,480
and he brought homemade booze.

95
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,679
It's the thought that counts.

96
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,798
One can't throw away goodwill.

97
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:34,239
Funny.

98
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:36,480
The first time I handed you a cigarette,

99
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,720
I asked how it tasted...

100
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,119
you didn't spare my feelings.

101
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:43,440
You said it tasted weird

102
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,200
and called it...

103
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,720
“rouge.”

104
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,760
Why?

105
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,200
A double standard？

106
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,279
I don't know.

107
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:55,679
I surprised myself when I said it...

108
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:57,559
it wasn't my usual style.

109
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,559
Which means...

110
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,640
Means what?

111
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:05,480
Which means that to me, you're different.

112
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,040
Different from the start.

113
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,760
Then what does Director You want
to do to someone who's “different”?

114
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,320
Right now I want to kiss you.

115
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:19,559
Come on...

116
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,559
give Director You a kiss.

117
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,040
Me,

118
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,239
I've always

119
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
kept life,

120
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,040
work,

121
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,440
love

122
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,559
all within the palm of my hand.

123
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,160
I've never gambled on what I couldn't win.

124
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,480
But you,

125
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,040
you're the exception.

126
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:49,239
Fan Xiao,

127
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
you're hard to read.

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,160
I don't even have you figured out yet

129
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,959
and I've already started to
let my feelings off the leash.

130
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,600
I'm already starting to love you.

131
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:02,760
You're my big gamble.

132
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:04,920
Can I win?

133
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,200
Since when has Director You ever lost?

134
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Fan Xiao...

135
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,600
even though I'm a few years older than you,

136
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,760
but sometimes I still
want to hear sweet talk.

137
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,519
Please, President Fan, be nice...

138
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:27,359
and say something.

139
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,440
Like...

140
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:32,040
am I handsome?

141
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,160
Handsome.

142
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,200
You're the most charismatic,

143
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,040
best-looking man I've ever seen.

144
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,600
That's all I needed.

145
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:42,239
Let's go home.

146
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,200
Didn't you keep saying

147
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,920
you wanted to paint me?

148
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,200
(Episode 6)

149
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,079
Sit.

150
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,480
Paint me seriously.

151
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,440
Then stop staring at me...

152
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,880
I'll drop the brush.

153
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:43,279
At first I just thought

154
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,920
your hands were pretty.

155
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,079
But I didn't know

156
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,160
these hands could actually paint.

157
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,079
I never studied properly,

158
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,600
but I've got some talent.

159
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,640
Then show me...

160
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,920
my boyfriend's talent.

161
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,480
It might be genetic.

162
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,920
My mom loved painting all her life...

163
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,640
she was talented,

164
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,720
but had no opportunities.

165
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:12,880
When she was young she tutored kids...

166
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,440
she taught them drawing.

167
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:17,839
My eldest brother was her student.

168
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,920
He always felt

169
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:22,798
the art teacher that he picked

170
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:23,959
broke up his family...

171
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,359
causing his parents to divorce,

172
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,920
so he hated my mom's guts.

173
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,039
After my mother passed,

174
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,039
our whole family left Bangkok.

175
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,239
I was basically alone.

176
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,799
He targeted me even more...

177
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,600
he smashed my easels when I was a kid,

178
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,359
sabotaged my deals when I grew up.

179
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:48,760
So...

180
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:50,760
you “ran back” here?

181
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:53,039
What would count as running back?

182
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:55,599
My father approved me
setting up on my own...

183
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,880
he sent me back with a lot of capital.

184
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,280
My two brothers

185
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:00,960
were green with jealousy.

186
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,640
So looking at the situation now,
it seems like I've got the upper hand.

187
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But…

188
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,159
But what?

189
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,479
Relax your back, Director You.

190
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,320
I need you loose.

191
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:24,080
But I could lose my position at any time.

192
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,159
That's my family...

193
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,039
eat-or-be-eaten,

194
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:31,479
survival of the fittest.

195
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:34,840
If you lose your position...

196
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,479
then what?

197
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,320
I'll end up with nothing.

198
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,479
You won't have nothing...

199
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,880
you'll still have me.

200
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,640
If that day comes,

201
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,320
I'll take care of you.

202
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:54,479
Director You...

203
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:58,159
can your words you've
said today be counted on?

204
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,280
They can.

205
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,520
Or maybe,

206
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:04,936
you could come and
validate them yourself?

207
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,679
Behave...

208
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
I'm painting.

209
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Lie down.

210
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,799
Undo two more buttons on your shirt.

211
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,359
Pull up the trousers...

212
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,559
show some ankle.

213
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,135
Sounds like your “painting requirements”

214
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,280
aren't very proper.

215
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,559
I thought it over...

216
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,039
I want a taste first,

217
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:43,200
that'll help me paint even better.

218
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:58,760
I didn't know your office hid a secret
chamber...

219
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,080
you even have a little archive.

220
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,599
How'd I miss this the last time I was here?

221
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,880
These...

222
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:07,440
and these...

223
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:09,559
are files I compiled earlier.

224
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:11,440
Even though it's historical data,

225
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:14,039
it'll be a good reference.

226
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,240
When Director You is
really focused on his work,

227
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,080
it's really attractive.

228
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,440
President Fan!

229
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,679
We're at work.

230
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:41,159
Fan Xiao...

231
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,640
you're in my office.

232
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Don't tell me I've spoiled you into...

233
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,840
Come in.

234
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,840
Director You,

235
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,719
this “Vehicle Request Form”...

236
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:19,719
both vice directors want

237
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,200
the top-tier business van.

238
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,280
They both say their guests are important.

239
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,119
How should I deal with this?

240
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:32,919
Xiao Ding,

241
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:34,039
come here a sec.

242
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,760
Director.

243
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:40,320
Xiao Ding,

244
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,839
Confirm whether Director Li's guests

245
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,080
are the wife and daughter of
Qingyu Pharma's chairman.

246
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:45,519
If so,

247
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,080
send the convertible...

248
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,239
have flowers and plushies in the car.

249
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,440
Chairman Shang Qingyu's
daughter is young...

250
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,719
she'll like those.

251
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
Got it, Director.

252
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,320
Xiao Bai,

253
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,559
The vice directors
using the top-tier van

254
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,000
is just a way to show respect.

255
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,880
But there's more than
one way to show respect.

256
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,640
Use your head.

257
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,976
If you can't even coordinate
something this simple

258
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,359
and just execute orders blindly,

259
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:11,640
maybe General Office work isn't for you.

260
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,599
I'll do better, Director.

261
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:15,479
Oh— Xiao Ding,

262
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:18,320
get a set of
PROTYOUTH's hottest serum.

263
00:13:18,493 --> 00:13:19,773
Make sure the packaging is nice.

264
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,080
Understood.

265
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,479
Go on.

266
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:23,719
Alright.

267
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,599
Director You was fierce just now.

268
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,080
Even in there I was scared.

269
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:43,239
If I'm fierce then you better behave.

270
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,200
Straighten your clothes.

271
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,000
I do believe you were just
trying to give me a hickey...

272
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,640
I didn't dare disobey.

273
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:53,039
Five workdays a week

274
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,120
and you've spent three
camped out at Bohai...

275
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:57,960
of those three days, you've
spent most of it in my office.

276
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,760
People will think you're a corporate spy,

277
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,960
stealing trade secrets

278
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:04,840
behind the guise of investment.

279
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,799
Is the tea any good?

280
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:20,959
Judge for yourself, President Fan.

281
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,359
Is Director You serving tea
in order to to chase me out?

282
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,919
Look at you—you know so much.

283
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:34,239
So when you said your
Hua language skills were bad

284
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,919
and you misspoke,

285
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,599
that was just an act?

286
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,479
Now I know it after I started
watching palace dramas with you.

287
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:47,840
Sit down.

288
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:54,679
Since you're pouring tea,

289
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:56,879
it's only fair I bring a gift.

290
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,760
I'll make tom yum soup
for you this weekend.

291
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,479
You'll make it?

292
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:02,599
I'll make it.

293
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:07,520
I'll add curry crab,

294
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,239
spicy beef salad,

295
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:10,840
pad thai.

296
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:14,159
You like old movies...

297
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:16,919
I'll pick some Thai classics.

298
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:20,239
We'll eat and watch.

299
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,039
Sounds great.

300
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,919
Then your weekend

301
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,239
belongs to me.

302
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:38,200
One sec—I've got a call.

303
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:53,799
Hello?

304
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,799
What?

305
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:09,239
OK.

306
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,880
Got it.

307
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,919
What is it?

308
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,919
Something came up this weekend.

309
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,359
I can't spend it with you.

310
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,000
Xiao You,

311
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:34,358
you're here...

312
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:35,639
why aren't you coming out?

313
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,799
Where do you think you're going?

314
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,039
Mr. Zhao,

315
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,359
I spaced out...

316
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:43,320
I didn't see the elevator arrive.

317
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,359
You're probably exhausted.

318
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,200
You're looking a little pale.

319
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,440
Are you working this Sunday?

320
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:52,559
No...

321
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,719
just running an errand.

322
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,799
Take care of your health, young man.

323
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,320
Go.

324
00:16:58,479 --> 00:16:59,520
Get some rest.

325
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,520
By the way,

326
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,999
I changed your door lock

327
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,479
to a fingerprint one.

328
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,718
Tossed the old lock

329
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:18,719
along with that ex's key.

330
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,520
With Director You's rich history,

331
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,238
who knows what weirdos

332
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:23,920
still had keys.

333
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:03,839
I'll do it.

334
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:08,040
The oil spurted...

335
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:09,239
are your hands okay?

336
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:10,680
I'm fine.

337
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,239
Why are you back so early?

338
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:14,359
Wasn't there a half-hour left?

339
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,485
I was just missing you,

340
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,319
so I sped a little
on the way home.

341
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:26,439
I didn't think you could actually cook.

342
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,079
I can't...

343
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,079
I called the chef at home for tips.

344
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,680
Just now

345
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,239
watching you using that ladle

346
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,160
you looked

347
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:37,239
especially,

348
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,520
especially...

349
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:39,760
Especially what...

350
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,079
especially dumb?

351
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,359
Especially

352
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,680
sexy.

353
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,815
It's a waste to keep you in the kitchen...

354
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:47,079
you belong in the

355
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,119
bedroom.

356
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,439
Sure...

357
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,680
Director You's orders.

358
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,359
C'mon...
bedroom.

359
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:54,160
Quit it...

360
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,359
let's do the dining table.

361
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,680
So Director You plays wild...

362
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,359
the dining table works too.

363
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:03,000
Hey, Fan Xiao...

364
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:04,760
eat first.

365
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,160
I'll eat you first.

366
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:07,879
I'm actually hungry.

367
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,079
Me too.

368
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,680
Fan Xiao!

369
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,560
Okay, okay.

370
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,280
I'll reduce the sauce...

371
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:18,839
then we eat.

372
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:30,640
The tom yum soup is great.

373
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,199
Of course...

374
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,000
I've nearly worn out this cookbook.

375
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,239
Spent two weekends experimenting...

376
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,520
I ruined a few pots.

377
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,319
If you like it,

378
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,280
I'll make you other dishes next time.

379
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,560
Sorry...

380
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,160
I promised to spend the
whole weekend with you.

381
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,040
I spoiled it.

382
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:55,280
Spoiled what?

383
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:56,920
It's still Sunday...

384
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:58,640
the weekend's not over.

385
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:00,119
Mm.

386
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:03,439
I actually like spending
weekends like this...

387
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,280
quietly, just the two of us.

388
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,319
You and your ex

389
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,040
never did quiet weekends?

390
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:12,640
He's young...

391
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,000
he likes crowds.

392
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,119
We went to parties more.

393
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:18,839
How's his cooking?

394
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,959
Cooking?

395
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,439
He barely set foot in the kitchen.

396
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,283
Right— I remember...

397
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,990
I believe you said that

398
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:30,160
you were the one who did the cooking.

399
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,000
Babe,

400
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,119
please dont be so jealous in the future,

401
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,800
it's too much for me.

402
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,560
I hope no one interrupts tonight.

403
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,358
This weekend

404
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:49,000
belongs to the two of us.

405
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,920
Then what does Director You

406
00:20:58,199 --> 00:21:02,680
want to do with me in
this beautiful weekend?

407
00:21:05,439 --> 00:21:07,199
You want it?

408
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:10,359
Don't you?

409
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:13,280
What I want—can you give me?

410
00:21:16,199 --> 00:21:18,520
I've given you the most
precious thing I have.

411
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,359
What more do you want?

412
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,640
Hey, you already slept with
that You-something-Lang.

413
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,280
What more do you want?

414
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,800
What do I want?

415
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:30,800
Life's boring...

416
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,359
I'm using him to pass the time.

417
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,680
When I'm done and over it,

418
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,119
I'll dump him.

419
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:54,238
Don't you think you're pathetic?

420
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:56,239
You fall in love way too easily.

421
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,839
You've reached your goal.

422
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:03,879
With someone like You Shulang...

423
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,920
who rarely trusts or leans on anyone...

424
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:08,719
you're already pulling his strings.

425
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,640
So why...

426
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:12,319
Fan Xiao

427
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,160
why aren't you happy?

428
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,719
It's a bit chilly at night.

429
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,199
Did I wake you when I got up?

430
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,439
Every time I see

431
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,319
your silhouette alone on the balcony,

432
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:00,640
I feel like

433
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,319
you don't belong to this world...

434
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:05,280
like

435
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,199
just one more look

436
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:11,119
and you'll go back.

437
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:13,880
Something on your mind?

438
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:19,280
No.

439
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,319
Go back to bed...

440
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:25,479
I'll stay a bit.

441
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:28,119
I'm your boyfriend...

442
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,040
you've got secrets from me?

443
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:38,520
Come on...

444
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,959
back inside.

445
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,239
I'm planning to sell the apartment

446
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,719
and take a trip back home.

447
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,560
What happened?

448
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:58,719
The urgent thing this weekend

449
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:00,439
was my younger brother.

450
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,680
He needs money back in the country,

451
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:05,760
and my savings aren't enough,

452
00:24:06,199 --> 00:24:08,479
so I'm getting ready to sell the place.

453
00:24:10,536 --> 00:24:11,640
How much do you need...

454
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,520
I can...
Fan Xiao.

455
00:24:13,439 --> 00:24:15,479
That's why I didn't want to tell you...

456
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,680
I don't want you involved.

457
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,359
But

458
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,359
the agent's bringing potential buyers
tomorrow,

459
00:24:26,206 --> 00:24:28,326
so I had to say something.

460
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,920
Fan Xiao,

461
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:32,839
we may be lovers,

462
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,479
but first and foremost we're independent
people.

463
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:41,119
This is still within what I can handle.

464
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,920
If,

465
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,599
I really can't handle it myself,

466
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,560
I'll ask for help.

467
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,040
I just set up a whole slew of my dashing
photos…

468
00:24:59,719 --> 00:25:01,000
Forget it.

469
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,760
You've decided...

470
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,839
I know can't talk you out of it.

471
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,079
Tomorrow move to my place.

472
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,680
This dump

473
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,839
can go...

474
00:25:16,439 --> 00:25:18,119
buy a better one later.

475
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,239
But.

476
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:24,599
I already applied for a company apartment,

477
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:26,560
so…

478
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,040
So what,

479
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,119
Director You?

480
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,600
Does that mean you don't want me?

481
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,920
I'm tired...

482
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:33,119
don't start.

483
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,839
Let's put off the talk of living together
for now,

484
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,359
and lets go to sleep.

485
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,800
“Younger brother.”

486
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,560
Why are there so many
people around You Shulang?

487
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,880
When will he see only me...

488
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,319
only me!

489
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,599
Fan Xiao,

490
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,718
my mentor heard I'm back

491
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:48,800
and wants to meet.

492
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,319
It's been a while.

493
00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:52,598
So, you'll...

494
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:53,599
Go ahead.

495
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,136
I'll handle some company business first.

496
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,160
Mm.

497
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:08,040
Share your location.

498
00:27:25,439 --> 00:27:26,920
Zhang Chen?

499
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,479
You Shulang's younger brother?

500
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,760
That's me.

501
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:32,319
You picked this spot...

502
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,280
did you plan to stand and talk?

503
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,920
There are benches over there...

504
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,119
shall we sit?

505
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,640
It was bold of you...

506
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,478
posing as a grad student
from a financial university

507
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:43,239
to coax seniors into
investing their savings

508
00:27:43,439 --> 00:27:45,680
so you could skim from the commissions.

509
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:47,319
Bad luck...

510
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,120
running into a global short-selling hit.

511
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,040
You tried to buy the dip

512
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:52,359
and got trapped.

513
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,680
Per the contract,

514
00:27:54,681 --> 00:27:55,760
I'm just the trader.

515
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,599
Losses are

516
00:27:56,719 --> 00:27:57,640
the investor's problem...

517
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:59,119
it nothing to do with me!

518
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,000
That wouldn't be a big deal.

519
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,959
Your mistake was one of greed.

520
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,280
On top of commission,

521
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,959
you took a little extra,

522
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:13,640
stuffing your pocket with way more
than the numbers on the contract.

523
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:16,040
Mind if I smoke?

524
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:22,439
You thought the elderly
would be easy marks...

525
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,319
you didn't expect it to get tough,

526
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,760
and now you're exposesd.

527
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,959
I'm not here for your gloating.

528
00:28:28,439 --> 00:28:29,719
On the phone you said

529
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,839
you're You Shulang's friend

530
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,920
and you could help.

531
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:34,599
You call your brother by name like that?

532
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:35,959
As far as I know,

533
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:38,040
he covers your expenses,

534
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:39,920
But aside from asking
him for money this time,

535
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:41,079
I don't see you

536
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,560
keeping in touch with him often.

537
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,760
I know what you are to him.

538
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:52,536
If you want to score
points with You Shulang,

539
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,160
then do your job and help me.

540
00:28:54,479 --> 00:28:55,479
I'll tell him

541
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,680
to sleep with you a few more times.

542
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,119
This is better than I expected...

543
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:03,079
guess the trip was worth it.

544
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:04,160
Compensation

545
00:29:04,199 --> 00:29:05,319
plus principal...

546
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,520
that's not a small sum.

547
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:10,119
Thai apartments are cheap...

548
00:29:10,439 --> 00:29:12,839
even if he sells, it won't cover it.

549
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,959
The old lady's son

550
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,896
won't wait for you to
scrape money together.

551
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,920
Once he makes a scene,

552
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:19,199
your degree

553
00:29:19,439 --> 00:29:20,199
and future

554
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:21,280
are toast.
I...

555
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,719
I've got money

556
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:23,839
and connections.

557
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,880
For me, this

558
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,160
is easy.

559
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:27,599
But

560
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,119
I don't need you

561
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:30,520
to win favor with him.

562
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,160
If I want to sleep with him,

563
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:33,479
I will.

564
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,839
Then why call me out...

565
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:36,319
just to laugh at me?

566
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,040
I don't want to

567
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,239
pack up those photos I just put up.

568
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,640
What?

569
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,839
I'll pay the principal and
compensation for you.

570
00:29:46,479 --> 00:29:47,599
The old lady's son

571
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,680
has already agreed to drop the case.

572
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,719
My lawyer is drafting the settlement.

573
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,160
You can sign

574
00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:56,719
the letter of understanding tomorrow.

575
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,439
But I have one condition.

576
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:00,239
Bro...

577
00:30:00,439 --> 00:30:01,439
name it.

578
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,199
I'll agree to anything.

579
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,560
The condition is...

580
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,560
Stay away from your brother.

581
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,560
Stop running to him with every mess.

582
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:13,160
Like I want to hang around him?

583
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,079
I only go to him

584
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,599
because he owes me...

585
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:17,759
owes my family...

586
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,239
debts he'll never pay off.

587
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,280
Meaning?

588
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,439
Why don't you go ask him?

589
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,680
Right...

590
00:30:23,719 --> 00:30:24,719
like he'd

591
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,479
ever bring it up himself.

592
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,800
Zhang Chen,

593
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:29,439
I'm paying good money.

594
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:31,599
You can at least tell me
a bit of ancient history.

595
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,759
Since you want to hear it...

596
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,160
there's nothing stopping me.

597
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:36,839
He's not my real brother.

598
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:39,640
My mom picked him up at a trash dump.

599
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,040
He was seven...

600
00:30:41,199 --> 00:30:42,679
dead of winter, wearing a thin shirt,

601
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:44,079
scavenging for scraps.

602
00:30:45,239 --> 00:30:47,199
My mom pitied him and brought him home.

603
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:04,040
It was always just my mom and me.

604
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,319
Then there was You Shulang.

605
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,479
She glued cardboard,

606
00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:09,599
did housecleaning...

607
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,880
anything...

608
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,839
to put him through school,

609
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,239
all the way to college.

610
00:31:14,479 --> 00:31:15,479
And him?

611
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:20,040
He's gay.

612
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,295
What does that have to do with anything?

613
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:24,319
Everything!

614
00:31:24,479 --> 00:31:27,439
In high school, someone outed him.

615
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,199
The whole class ostracized him.

616
00:31:29,439 --> 00:31:31,319
Even thugs came after him.

617
00:31:32,719 --> 00:31:34,199
You Shulang

618
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:35,719
fought back—hard.

619
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,160
After a few close calls,
no one dared touch him.

620
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:40,599
He cruised through high school

621
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,760
and got into college,

622
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,119
but he ruined me!

623
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:44,359
When he graduated,

624
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,800
I'd just started high school.

625
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:48,119
The thugs couldn't touch him,

626
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:49,959
so they bullied me instead.

627
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,839
You know what those years were like?

628
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,760
Trash on my desk every day.

629
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,879
School uniform soaked.

630
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,640
Beaten in a bathroom by a crowd.

631
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:00,800
They said since he was gay

632
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,439
and I was his brother,

633
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,680
so I must be too.

634
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,640
I endured it all...

635
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,560
he's my brother,

636
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,359
the one I admired my whole life.

637
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:12,959
But one day they beat me again...

638
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:14,920
Xiao Chen, home from school…

639
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,680
what happened to your face?

640
00:32:18,681 --> 00:32:19,880
They hit you again?

641
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:21,920
Take me to them.

642
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,959
Take me.
Don't, Mom.

643
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:25,280
We can't take them.

644
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:26,879
I'll go talk reason with them.

645
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,359
How can they beat you like this?

646
00:32:28,439 --> 00:32:29,439
No reason needed.

647
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,479
He's weak...

648
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:31,959
so he deserves it.

649
00:32:32,239 --> 00:32:33,359
You're raising two losers...

650
00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:34,599
one coward

651
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,640
and one faggot.

652
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,839
Who knows what bastard sired them.

653
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:39,959
What did you say!

654
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,239
Don't...

655
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,599
Xiao Chen,

656
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:43,719
Outta the way.

657
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,920
Ma...

658
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,560
Mom!

659
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,680
Xiao Lang...

660
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,920
take care of yourself.

661
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:57,719
For me,

662
00:32:58,079 --> 00:32:59,759
look after your brother.

663
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,760
Mom...

664
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,479
Mom...

665
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:02,599
Mom!

666
00:33:03,719 --> 00:33:05,040
I'm sorry...

667
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,199
but how is that your brother's fault?

668
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,079
If he hadn't been damned gay,

669
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,959
this wouldn't have happened.

670
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:14,199
If he hadn't fought back so hard,

671
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,160
they wouldn't have held a grudge

672
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,719
and hit me so viciously.

673
00:33:18,239 --> 00:33:19,920
My mom wouldn't have died!

674
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,496
What the hell is wrong with your brain?

675
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,920
You're weak and take it
out on the one who's strong?

676
00:33:24,439 --> 00:33:25,839
If he'd let them trample him,

677
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,719
you think you'd have been spared?

678
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,560
You don't get it.

679
00:33:29,719 --> 00:33:31,119
My mom saved his life...

680
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:32,800
and he got my mom killed.

681
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:34,640
He owes me.

682
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,800
Owes our family...

683
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:37,319
debts he can never pay off!

684
00:33:37,439 --> 00:33:39,559
I see that in your heart of
hearts you know the truth.

685
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,040
You're just playing dumb.

686
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:44,880
You want to keep him guilty...

687
00:33:45,239 --> 00:33:47,119
keeping him as a scapegoat for
life.

688
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,359
Ten a.m. tomorrow

689
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,360
at the Man Fu building—sign the agreement.

690
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,560
I'll pay.

691
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,000
And don't tell him you met me.

692
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,040
Call your brother tonight.

693
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,920
Say the other side's evidence is thin...

694
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:04,439
you just need to return
the extra you pocketed.

695
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:05,920
Okay,

696
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:07,479
okay.

697
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:09,080
Hands up...

698
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
higher.

699
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,679
Sorry...

700
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:31,239
no trash cans nearby.

701
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,760
Keep the city clean...

702
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,120
it's everyone's responsibility.

703
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:54,439
Shulang,

704
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,040
didn't you say

705
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,159
you'd introduce me to someone?

706
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:59,199
Mm.

707
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Where is...

708
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Here—take it.

709
00:35:15,479 --> 00:35:16,479
No need...

710
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,679
I'm not that cold.

711
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,800
Wear it.

712
00:35:25,479 --> 00:35:26,479
Wait up.

713
00:35:30,731 --> 00:35:32,378
(Tombstone of the late
mother Luo Qinqin, 1965-2013)

714
00:35:32,402 --> 00:35:34,282
(Surived by her sons You
Shulang and Zhang Chen)

715
00:35:48,439 --> 00:35:49,439
Mom...

716
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:51,479
did you miss me?

717
00:35:52,879 --> 00:35:53,879
I'm sorry.

718
00:35:54,879 --> 00:35:56,239
Last year I was so busy.

719
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:59,919
I didn't make it back on your anniversary.

720
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:01,639
Right, Mom...

721
00:36:02,439 --> 00:36:03,919
didn't you always say

722
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,439
if I found someone I liked...

723
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,959
man or woman...

724
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:10,120
that I should bring them to see you?

725
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:13,000
I brought him this time.

726
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,959
He's handsome,

727
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:18,560
and he treats me well.

728
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:21,080
Mom...

729
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:24,159
you always said

730
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,760
there'd definitely be someone
in this world who'd appear,

731
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:32,120
and make you think this world isn't so bad.

732
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I think...

733
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,239
I found him.

734
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,719
Fan Xiao...

735
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:05,560
why are you zoning out?

736
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,120
I'm not.

737
00:37:08,879 --> 00:37:09,959
I was thinking

738
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:13,719
what to say to your mom.

739
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,479
Ma'am,

740
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,800
we'll visit often.

741
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:19,719
I'll

742
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,840
take care of Shulang.

743
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,639
Why so nervous?

744
00:37:25,479 --> 00:37:26,959
I'm not nervous.

745
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:29,760
No need to be solemn.

746
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:31,279
I used to sit here

747
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,600
and tell her jokes.

748
00:37:32,919 --> 00:37:33,600
She loved

749
00:37:33,601 --> 00:37:35,280
the tall tales from that radio show.

750
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,760
It's my first time meeting your mom...

751
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,080
I should be proper.

752
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,719
Fan Xiao...

753
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,719
aren't you freezing?

754
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:49,120
Your hands are like ice.

755
00:37:50,879 --> 00:37:51,879
The mountain's

756
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:53,239
a bit cold.

757
00:37:54,479 --> 00:37:55,479
I told you

758
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,040
to wear a puffer this morning...

759
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,576
you wanted to look sharp in that overcoat.

760
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,800
This isn't Thailand...

761
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,520
it's cold in the morning.

762
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,600
Come on...

763
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:03,719
let's head down.

764
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,600
Did your ex ever come here?

765
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
What?

766
00:38:15,439 --> 00:38:16,919
To pay respects to your adoptive mom.

767
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,560
No.

768
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,800
He never did.

769
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,239
Really...
not lying?

770
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:22,879
Really...

771
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,120
not lying.

772
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:26,199
Why?

773
00:38:26,479 --> 00:38:27,879
It felt like

774
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,200
you two were together a while.

775
00:38:29,439 --> 00:38:30,520
He's young...

776
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,919
hasn't seen much.

777
00:38:32,439 --> 00:38:34,199
He didn't understand a lot of things.

778
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,439
He didn't know my past either.

779
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:39,439
So Director You thinks I'm old...

780
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:41,679
no need to shield my innocent heart.

781
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,439
Honestly,

782
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:51,320
with my ex

783
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:53,159
it felt like coaxing a kid.

784
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,760
Beyond daily life,

785
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,959
we rarely connected on a deeper level.

786
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,879
I thought loving him
meant looking after him...

787
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:03,320
doing what I could

788
00:39:03,321 --> 00:39:06,479
to give him comfort.

789
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:09,600
He asked to break up suddenly.

790
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,040
I didn't pry...

791
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,000
didn't want to embarrass him.

792
00:39:13,879 --> 00:39:16,320
Truth is, his heart had drifted...

793
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,760
wasn't with me.

794
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:22,919
I can guess the rest.

795
00:39:23,879 --> 00:39:26,159
I looked cool on the surface,

796
00:39:26,879 --> 00:39:29,520
but I did blame him a little...

797
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,639
until he said...

798
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,560
he thought I was always cold to him,

799
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:39,639
my heart locked tight,

800
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:42,919
he couldn't get into my world.

801
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,600
All of it made it hard for him.

802
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,280
That's when I realized

803
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:50,718
I never thought about

804
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:52,919
leting him see all of me...

805
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,198
or whether I wanted to know

806
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:57,479
what he really felt.

807
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:01,360
Maybe I didn't love him that much.

808
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,120
And me?

809
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,840
You?

810
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:17,560
I don't know.

811
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,560
I used to analyze the pros and cons
before doing anything...

812
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,199
even when starting a relationship.

813
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:29,600
With you,

814
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,199
I've done all kinds of foolish things...

815
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,840
And

816
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,199
I'll own every foolish result.

817
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:44,439
Your ears are red...

818
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:46,560
let's get in the car.

819
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:48,560
Let's go.

820
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,560
It's warmer in here.

821
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:05,040
What's this...

822
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,360
a promissory note?

823
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,520
The money you paid for my brother...

824
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:09,760
I owe you for it.

825
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,719
How did you...

826
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,840
Thanks.

827
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,199
I talked to those people twice...

828
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:20,239
they weren't reasonable people.

829
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,639
When my brother said it was resolved,

830
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,120
I knew you stepped in.

831
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,800
I checked...

832
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,560
and it was just as I thought.

833
00:41:30,439 --> 00:41:31,639
I told you not to get involved

834
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:34,239
because there could be legal risk.

835
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:38,600
But you went all in
behind my back.

836
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,479
If money can fix it,

837
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,639
it's not a problem.

838
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,239
Don't worry...

839
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,120
there's no risk.

840
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,640
The main thing was your
door lock that I just changed.

841
00:41:53,479 --> 00:41:54,800
The curtains

842
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
and bed

843
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,199
were pricey...

844
00:41:57,439 --> 00:41:58,959
it'd be a waste to lose them.

845
00:41:59,879 --> 00:42:01,320
And my

846
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,520
dashing photos...

847
00:42:03,919 --> 00:42:05,360
I spent ages

848
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,439
finding the perfect angles

849
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:13,239
so you can see me from every
room and angle in your home.

850
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:20,360
For almost thirty years...

851
00:42:20,919 --> 00:42:23,238
I've always been the one shielding others.

852
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:24,679
I never thought

853
00:42:24,879 --> 00:42:26,999
there would be someone
who would stand in front of me.

854
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,560
Now,

855
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,560
I can be the weak one too.

856
00:42:32,919 --> 00:42:35,120
Being taken care of by my
boyfriend feels… pretty good.

857
00:42:35,479 --> 00:42:36,479
Fan Xiao,

858
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,840
thanks.

859
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,520
But

860
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,639
if you dare ignore me again,

861
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,560
I won't let it slide.

862
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,360
Understood.

863
00:42:58,879 --> 00:43:00,520
My Director You.

864
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,840
Shulang...

865
00:43:04,439 --> 00:43:05,439
So.

866
00:43:06,439 --> 00:43:08,360
If your ex and I

867
00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:10,279
both fell into a lake...

868
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,560
who would you save?

869
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:13,600
Since dating me,

870
00:43:13,601 --> 00:43:16,239
have you been binging costume dramas
or family melodramas?

871
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:17,719
Who would I save?

872
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,000
Neither.

873
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,000
I'd let you drown.

874
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:37,718
In the crowd

875
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:41,280
I was spotted in an instant.

876
00:43:42,399 --> 00:43:44,799
The desolation in your eyes.

877
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,958
Hiding the same fire inside.

878
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,638
No need for words.

879
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:53,959
No need to ask what's right or wrong.

880
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:56,478
The moment we drew close.

881
00:43:56,479 --> 00:43:59,199
The outcome was already destined.

882
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,879
Is the moth drawn to the light.

883
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:13,239
Or the whale sinking into the deep.

884
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,359
With nothing but solitary courage

885
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,919
I wager it all on tomorrow.

886
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:21,918
The walls of the world.

887
00:44:21,919 --> 00:44:25,199
What does it matter if I break them down.

888
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,638
My chest burns with heat.

889
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:30,840
Screaming only for you

890
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,638
I'll love you until it boils over.

891
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:36,919
Loving without a care for the world.

892
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,678
Like two stars.

893
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:40,679
Colliding and shattering in the night sky.

894
00:44:40,879 --> 00:44:41,879
Even if it's just for a moment.

895
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,478
It's more than enough to surpass forever.

896
00:44:43,479 --> 00:44:44,759
Hate and love both burn brightly.

897
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,438
Loving until the sky falls dark.

898
00:44:47,439 --> 00:44:49,399
Loving until we reach the end of the road.

899
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:51,198
Before the altar.

900
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:53,319
We burn all the incense.

901
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,398
Not asking for the next life.

902
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,918
Only desiring this moment.

903
00:44:55,919 --> 00:44:57,119
Drowning together with you in.

904
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,360
This blazing fire of fate
