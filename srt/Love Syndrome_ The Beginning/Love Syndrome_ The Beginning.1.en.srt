1
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,640
Itt.

2
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:37,720
I heard from my friend that your friend,
Gear has a resort on an island.

3
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,120
You know and choose not to tell me right?

4
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,280
Huh?

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,840
Day.

6
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:04,200
When you are a friend, if you can’t protect them
then why would you be friends?

7
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,360
I like you.

8
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,760
Then you know what is coming for you right?

9
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,600
Until you come

10
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,040
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

11
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,520
Came very late

12
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,600
Yea, what were you up to?

13
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,720
- I was hurrying.
- The traffic was bad.

14
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,040
Hey, Look at that boy.

15
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,280
He is really good-looking.

16
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,960
Which one?

17
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,200
That one. The middle table.

18
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,400
Oh, yeah. He is cute!

19
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,880
Hey Gear, those two boys down there.

20
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,320
Is that your brother and that kid?

21
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,440
Where? My sugar baby?

22
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,560
Wow

23
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,800
Why are you taking off your shirt?

24
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,520
- I’m just feeling a little bit hot.
- Hot?

25
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,880
I think the AC is rather cold.

26
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,480
It’s colder abroad.

27
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,840
Is that right?

28
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,720
Where is my sugar baby?

29
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,240
Down there.

30
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,960
Wearing such seductive clothes.

31
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,840
Let me do it.

32
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,040
Mike, make a drink for me?

33
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,360
Sure.

34
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,600
Make it strong.

35
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,480
You got it.

36
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,960
Gear.

37
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,080
I think those two kids are trying to seduce everyone in the club.

38
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,160
What a slut.

39
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,080
This is yours.

40
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,800
Let’s drink! Bottom up!

41
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,440
He got smashed by me once and
completely lost his shit acting all slutty.

42
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,760
I want to dance,
who wants to dance with me?

43
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,960
Let’s go?

44
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,000
Yeah, I want to dance!

45
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,200
Gear, I think he is trying to seduce you.

46
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,960
Acting all hard.

47
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,440
He thinks he is good at everything.

48
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,960
Hey, don’t stop. Come on.

49
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,880
Another glass!

50
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,400
Can I dance with you?

51
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,080
Sure.

52
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,640
Who is that? He doesn’t look familiar.

53
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,920
My friend's nickname is Gus.

54
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,040
Nice to see you.

55
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:50,200
I think he looks a lot better
coming back here this time.

56
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,560
I regret that night now that I think about it.

57
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,560
Actually, I have to thank you, Itt.

58
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,440
That you came up with that bet that day.

59
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:09,240
What do you actually mean?

60
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,840
I will make him moan again.

61
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,000
Fucking hell, you are confident as usual.

62
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,160
You guys, I will be right back.

63
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,440
Where are you going?

64
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,240
I am going to have a chat with your bro.

65
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,120
Sure

66
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,720
What’s up?

67
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,880
Did you get any man yet?

68
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,840
Fuck off

69
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,880
Four, you are coming here to party?

70
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,440
If not for a party,
why would I be here? To sleep?

71
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,000
Don’t fuck with my friend.
Go back to where you come from.

72
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,120
And are you interested in going back
the same way as me?

73
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:27,040
You and I going back the same way?
Won’t be that easy.

74
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,720
If you don’t give it a try,
how will you know that it won’t be easy?

75
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,720
I think it is easy.

76
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,160
Be right back, I am going to the toilet.

77
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,440
Let’s have a drink.

78
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,680
Cheers.

79
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,480
Hey. You dare to ignore me, lil bro?

80
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,320
I’m sorry, who is your lil bro?

81
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,640
Ha, I haven’t seen you for a minute,
you have become a lot feistier.

82
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,520
You weren’t that feisty that night!

83
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,600
Which night?

84
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,600
Haven’t seen you for half a year and you have forgotten?

85
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:51,280
That night. That you moaned beneath my body.
You can’t remember.

86
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,800
That time…

87
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,640
- Fucking hell, you were so hot.
- Hard position!

88
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,600
Told you, don’t make a bet with me.
You would only lose.

89
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,520
Yea. I will pay you.

90
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,360
- Don’t forget, pay me quickly.
- Okay

91
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,240
You are pretty good.

92
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,240
Very skilful.

93
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,000
That was easy.

94
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,720
I didn’t want to fuck him. I am so satisfied.

95
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,400
Day, his brother deserved this.

96
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,920
I don’t think he knows
that his brother is just like a toy to me.

97
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,960
Very skilful.

98
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,960
You are awake.

99
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:07,240
I’m sorry, I can’t remember your name.
I moan with a lot of people.

100
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,720
I haven’t seen you for half a year.

101
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,760
You probably fucks many guys.

102
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:22,320
But don’t forget that
the first guy you fucked is me.

103
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:29,120
On what evidence do you use to claim that you are my first?
My first guy is well dead.

104
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,920
Is there any problem, Night?

105
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,960
Excuse me. Are you Itt?

106
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,680
Yes, what do you want?

107
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,680
There’s another customer who crashed into your car.

108
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,960
Fuck!

109
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,120
He is waiting to pay for the damage outside.

110
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,520
Who crashed my baby?
Which fuckers crashed into my baby!

111
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,160
There’s no problem.
I called the wrong guy.

112
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,800
That’s good.

113
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,400
Ouch, let me go!

114
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,240
Hey!

115
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,240
What are you doing to my boy?
Get away from him?

116
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,480
What did you just say?

117
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,600
Your boy?

118
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,120
Ha.

119
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,640
I heard that you have just met.

120
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,960
And you know my boy, Night?

121
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,800
Of course, I do.

122
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,680
Way better than you.

123
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,440
And if you don’t believe it.

124
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,560
I can show you the evidence.

125
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,280
Just go fuck yourself.
I don’t want to talk to you anymore.

126
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,200
You are interrupting my fun.

127
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,600
Fuse, you said you would take me to your condo.

128
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,080
Then let’s go dance.

129
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,600
Shit.

130
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,200
Was it you who hit my car?
huh?

131
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,320
I’m sorry. I am the one who crashed into your car.

132
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,080
How will you be responsible for it?

133
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:10,520
Well, I am planning to pay for everything,
the dent, the scratches, I will take care of it.

134
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,880
Then pay me. May me now.

135
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,120
Calm down.

136
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,200
Pay me!

137
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,560
I don’t have any cash with me and my phone is dead.

138
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,280
In that case, would you be able to follow me to my condo,
so I can give you the money?

139
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,360
You are lucky I don’t punch you in the face.

140
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,000
- Quick!
- I’m sorry.

141
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,800
Lead the way.

142
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,160
Cheers.

143
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,320
Oh you are back. You were gone for a while.

144
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,480
Night, please excuse me,
I have to go outside for a bit.

145
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,440
You can come out now.

146
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,000
I’m sorry about that, I had a phone call.

147
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,320
Was it a long wait?

148
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,200
No.

149
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,360
Should we go?

150
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,160
I will see you guys at the university.

151
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,000
See you!

152
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,200
Gear! Did you throw the bottle at us?

153
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,640
No, I didn’t. It slips.

154
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,920
I will leave first.

155
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,840
Please come in first.

156
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,960
Are you going to pay?

157
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,200
Calm down.

158
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,040
Make it quick. I am in a hurry.

159
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,160
Well then, let me grab it from the bedroom.

160
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,240
Take a seat.

161
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,840
Have a beer.

162
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,960
So you will be more calm.

163
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:04,760
Just pay me, so it will all be done.
I am in a hurry.

164
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,680
Seems like you are scared of me. Itt.

165
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,360
Who are you?

166
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,880
How do you know my name?

167
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,200
Know?

168
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,240
Ittipol Charoendararat, 20 years old.

169
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:39,120
Rich family, Spoiled by parents.

170
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,840
That’s why you are acting like a fuck up.

171
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,080
Who are you?

172
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,400
And how do you know my information?

173
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,480
My name is Day.

174
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,760
I don’t want to know your name,

175
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,160
But I want to know how do you have my information.

176
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,280
How do you have my information? huh?

177
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:13,760
If I say a name,
will it trigger your dumb brain to remember?

178
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,720
What are you talking about?

179
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,880
Do you remember Night?

180
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,600
And how do you know Night?

181
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,400
What do you have to do with him?

182
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,800
I, Day, I am his older brother.

183
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,760
Let say.

184
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,920
I don’t want your money,
you don’t have to fix my car,

185
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,640
I will take care of it myself.

186
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,920
I’m leaving.

187
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,880
Wait.

188
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,720
No one ever comes in here and leaves that easy.
Remember my word.

189
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,240
You fucker!

190
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,480
You twat!

191
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,400
So tough huh?

192
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,120
Whatever you did to my brother, you will hurt hundreds of times more.

193
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,280
Fuckers.

194
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,680
So Though huh? Tough huh?

195
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,920
- Tough huh?
- Ouch, Im hurt!

196
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,360
Are you still tough?

197
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,280
Fuck sake.

198
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,360
Where are you going?

199
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,560
So tough huh?

200
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,320
What the fuck is going on? Day!

201
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,880
You are just waking up and
already making so much noise.

202
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,360
What!

203
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,920
What are you doing to me?

204
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,120
I haven’t done anything to you.

205
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,720
I was waiting for you to be awake.

206
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,760
What will you do to me?

207
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,200
Dumbass.

208
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,360
You aren’t just having a dumb face.

209
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,280
You really don’t know what I will do to you?

210
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,120
Please I beg you.

211
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,040
I am sorry about your brother.

212
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,040
I didn’t mean it.

213
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,360
I, I, I what?

214
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,480
Even if you say sorry for a million times.

215
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,280
I couldn’t give a fucks.

216
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,040
You know? I raised him up with my own hand.

217
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,320
I can do everything to make him happy.

218
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,040
When he is troubled, I am troubled even more.

219
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,520
And if he is hurt.

220
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,640
Those who hunted him will be hurt a hundred times more

221
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,080
Do you understand?

222
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,840
Day

223
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,160
I can’t breathe.

224
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,400
Why does it have to be me?

225
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,720
Why does it have to be me?

226
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,600
Wasn’t it you who came up with this fucked up thing?

227
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:12,960
You and your friend will have to face the sin you created.

228
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,680
Day, don’t! Please,

229
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:23,520
Help, Help! Help!

230
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,680
Help!

231
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,440
Why would you scream?

232
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,560
No one can hear you, because this room is soundproof.

233
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,160
Day, don’t do anything to me.

234
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,960
I beg you.

235
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:51,480
I will do everything or you.
Whatever you want.

236
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,120
Everything?

237
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,280
In exchange for you not doing anything to me.

238
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,400
But this is what I want.

239
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:07,320
&lt;i>[moaning sound]&lt;/i>

240
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,040
Day, Don’t!

241
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,920
&lt;i>[moaning sound]&lt;/i>

242
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,360
Day!

243
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,520
&lt;i>[moaning sound]&lt;/i>

244
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,520
Day!

245
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,920
Day!

246
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,160
Don’t! Fuck.

247
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,920
I told you to stop.

248
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,240
Day!

249
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,040
Day!

250
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,520
Stop!

251
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,000
You are not so bad.

252
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,360
I am better than you.

253
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,840
Fuckers.

254
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,200
Don’t let me get out of here.

255
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,280
Why?

256
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,400
Will you revenge me if you get out?

257
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,640
Well, I’m sorry it’s hard to get out of bed.

258
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,280
&lt;i>[moaning sound]&lt;/i>

259
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:37,960
Shit!

260
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,080
How dare you bite my lip?

261
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,760
You think you are tough? huh?

262
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,480
Fuck

263
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,760
Do you know?

264
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,280
Those who hunted me,
will be hurt a hundred times more

265
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,880
Day. No!

266
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,240
Day.

267
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,960
Don’t.

268
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,440
- Don’t.
- Don’t move!

269
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,280
Day! I am hurt!

270
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,920
Day!!!

271
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,520
Night.

272
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,400
Can I talk to you?

273
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,080
Sure.

274
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,240
But I don’t have that much time for you.

275
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,200
Make it quick.

276
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,720
I know that I did a very bad thing to you.

277
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,600
But I want to let you know that…

278
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,040
I can’t forget about you, Night.

279
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,120
So what?

280
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:32,720
I want to ask for a chance to start again.

281
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,040
You say that you can’t forget about me…

282
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,920
So you want to ask me to be your boyfriend?

283
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,040
Yes.

284
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,880
Can I have another chance?

285
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,240
Sure, but with a condition.

286
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,960
What condition?

287
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,560
You must obey me in every aspect.

288
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,840
Wherever I want to go you have to take me.

289
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:15,160
You can’t get jealous.
And you can’t flirt with anyone else.

290
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,600
And most importantly,

291
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,640
you can’t do anything to me.

292
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:27,240
If you can’t do what I ask,
then get out of my face.

293
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,720
Fine. It’s a deal.

294
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,400
Good.

295
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:48,440
Then this weekend, you better pick me up.
I want to go shopping.

296
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,920
Get your cash ready.

297
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,680
You are awake?

298
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:25,880
You are tougher than I thought.
I thought you wouldn’t survive the night!

299
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,520
Fuck you.

300
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,560
Are you happy?

301
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,520
Will you let me go now?

302
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,120
Not yet.

303
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,080
Do you think I would let you go so easily?

304
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,680
What else do you want from me?

305
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,360
I want to fuck you again.

306
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,680
Do you understand?

307
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,560
Last night wasn’t enough?

308
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:04,040
No. You have to be my emotional punchbag.

309
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,840
Until I feel satisfied.

310
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,480
(So you are planning to spend all my money?)

311
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:17,200
(I thought you said you would give me everything!)

312
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,320
(Fine. I surrendered.)

313
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,200
Shit. That’s Day!

314
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:06,760
Get out!

315
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,120
Ouch! Day!

316
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,000
Ouch! Bro.

317
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,160
Why are you going with him?

318
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,040
Please listen to me. I can explain.

319
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,440
Can’t you remember what he did to you?

320
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,560
Day.

321
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,760
Calm down. Talk it out. Night has come back safely.

322
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,320
You too! Fuse!

323
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:30,640
I told you to look after my brother and
you let my bro go out with him?!

324
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,120
Can I dance with you?

325
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,640
Who is that? He doesn’t look familiar.

326
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,800
Let me go!

327
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,680
Hey!

328
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,680
What are you doing to my boy?
Get away from him?

329
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,400
What?

330
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,880
Your boy?

331
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,080
Ha.

332
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,280
I heard that you have just met.

333
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,480
Don’t worry, I will fuck you up, Gear.

334
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,400
Day! Let your brother go!

335
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,680
Can’t you see? you are hurting him!

336
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,160
If you are pissed about something, take it out on me.
Why would you hurt your bro?

337
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:22,200
It’s none of your business.
This is between me and my brother.

338
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Don’t you care about your bro? Huh?

339
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,720
Don’t you care about him?
He is hurt. Let him go now!

340
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,440
No.

341
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,480
I told you to let him go.

342
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,600
No.

343
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,320
Will you let him go?

344
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,160
No.

345
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,920
- Will you let him go?
- No.

346
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,240
Day!

347
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,840
I know my bro is fucked up
but don’t you care for your brother?

348
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,720
You are squeezing his arm so tight.

349
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,000
Guss.

350
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,280
Take your bother home.

351
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,920
Go back the way you came from.

352
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,040
And don’t let him come here again.

353
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:08,560
Because if you come here again,
I won’t let you talk to me like this, Gear.

354
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,960
That’s enough, Day.

355
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:18,000
Gear, I think you should leave,
because if you stay, Night will get hurt.

356
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,320
Night, I will see you later.

357
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,560
If anything call me.
Watch your back.

358
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,680
Night won’t be calling you.

359
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,960
- Night won’t be calling you.
- I will come and get you.

360
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,400
Come, get inside.

361
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,600
Come here, Night.

362
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,720
Let me really ask you.
What were you thinking? Huh?

363
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,560
Knott, go and wait upstairs.

364
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,320
But…

365
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,440
Just go up, trust me.

366
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,440
Stop crying. Let me ask you.

367
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:21,200
Six months that have passed,
it doesn’t make you stop being weak? Huh?

368
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:29,600
I am who I am.
I just want to go out today. That is all.

369
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,320
Go out? with him?

370
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,040
Night, you told me, you would make him trust you?

371
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,640
But what I have seen, it is not what you said.

372
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:49,440
Bro, I’m sorry.
I just don’t want you to be disappointed in me.

373
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,640
Don’t. Don’t say that you love him again.

374
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,080
What? Or have you fucked him again?
Say it.

375
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,840
Bro! Why are you talking to me like that?

376
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,120
How could I believe you?

377
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,360
For the time that has passed,
you never stick to plan.

378
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,720
And you ended up going out with
a fucked up guy like that again!

379
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,520
Day, you are going too far.

380
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,640
Shut the fuck up.

381
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,000
Day.

382
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:28,080
All the time that has passed, I just realised that you never trusted me,
never cared for me, never understood me.

383
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,080
You are so selfish.

384
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,280
Day! What are you doing to your brother?

385
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,320
Night, wait.

386
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,480
Day.
Stop.

387
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,840
Don’t follow him.

388
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,200
But he…

389
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:02,360
You need to calm down.
You just slapped him, did you realise that?

390
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,360
Ughhhh!! Fuck.

391
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,800
Gear…

392
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,960
Why does it have to be like this?!

393
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,000
Let me ask you.

394
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,960
Six months that have passed,
it doesn’t make you stop being weak? Huh?

395
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,040
For the time that has passed,
you never stick to plan.

396
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,960
And you ended up going out with
a fucked up guy like that again! huh?

397
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,200
Day.

398
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:03,520
All the time that has passed,
I just realised that you never trusted me,

399
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,480
never cared for me, never understood me.

400
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,400
You are so selfish.

401
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,560
&lt;i>[Knocking]&lt;/i>

402
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:34,200
Night, are you asleep?
Please let me in?

403
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,760
&lt;i>[Knocking]&lt;/i>

404
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:46,000
Can you hear me, come out and eat.

405
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,760
I’m not hungry

406
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,040
I know you still don’t want to talk to me,
then just go to sleep.

407
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,120
But I am still standing my ground that
I will not let you go out with Gear.

408
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,680
Night.

409
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,400
&lt;i>[Knocking]&lt;/i>

410
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,320
Night.

411
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,560
How did you get up here?

412
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,080
I climb up.

413
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,480
I threw some rock from downstair
but I wasn’t sure if you heard it.

414
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,240
Hey, Night.

415
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,760
You are crying that badly?

416
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,400
Fuck.

417
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,720
Why does your brother have to do such a thing to you?

418
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,440
If he hates me so much,

419
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,320
why wouldn’t he take it out on me?
Why would he take it out on you?

420
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,520
It’s not about you. I argued with him.

421
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:25,080
Night, come with me.

422
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,920
To where.

423
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,440
Doesn’t matter. Just come with me

424
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,680
I won’t abduct you.

425
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:40,480
I have to bring you back to your brother.

426
00:45:47,840 --> 00:46:02,520
I just want to spend time with you.
I know, that after this, your bro won’t let me see you again.

427
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:11,280
But if he knows he will be so pissed.

428
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,600
Of course, he will.

429
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,680
Night please come with me.

430
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:25,120
Four and Guss are waiting downstair.

431
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:32,480
But I don’t want to wrong my brother again.

432
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,040
Night, listen.

433
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:43,520
You did nothing wrong
because you aren’t the one who would run away from your brother,

434
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:50,240
but rather me who would take you away from your brother.

435
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,520
Come on, Night.

436
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,840
Get in on that side

437
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,120
Four, Let’s go.

438
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:24,600
Night, are you awake?
Time to eat.

439
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,200
Night, can you hear me?

440
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,200
Night.

441
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:03,040
Gear, It must be you.

442
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,320
Day, That fuckers take Night with him?

443
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,360
If it’s not him then who the fuck would it be.

444
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,720
I better not see him, I will fucked him up.

445
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,680
Have you asked people in his house?

446
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:37,280
Yea, no one knows anything about it.

447
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:45,320
Why is it so loud, I want to sleep.

448
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,880
Fuck you want? huh?

449
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,440
Fuck you want?

450
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,360
What are you doing?

451
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,920
What do you know?

452
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,480
What are you talking about?

453
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,120
Don’t act innocent.

454
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:05,000
Didn’t you hear that my brother has disappeared?
What is your friend, Gear taking him? Spill it!

455
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:09,160
I told you, I don’t know.

456
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,360
Where is this place?

457
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:44,520
My resort, that I told you about.

458
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,320
Can’t you remember?

459
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,720
How is it? Nice?

460
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,640
You have arrived.

461
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,200
- Hi, Uncle Geua.
- Hi

462
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,240
Are you well?

463
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,160
I am. This is the room keys.

464
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,640
Thank you so much.

465
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:07,880
And the stuff you told me to prepare.
I have to do it for you.

466
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,720
Thank you so much, Uncle.
Oh and please handle my car and luggage for me?

467
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,760
My pleasure.

468
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,960
Four, here’s your room key.

469
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,240
Thank you.

470
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,480
And you, Night.
You will be sleeping with me.

471
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,640
No. I will be sleeping with Guss.

472
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:39,800
Ok, fine. Then, Four, you will be sleeping with me.

473
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,160
No, I will be sleeping with Guss.

474
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,360
No, Who said I will be sleeping with you?

475
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,360
Let’s go, Night.

476
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,440
What the…

477
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:59,720
This way? let’s go.

478
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,640
Ouch, That hurts.

479
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:07,640
Well, can you tell me now?
Where is Gear taking me, brother?

480
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,520
Day.

481
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:14,880
Honestly, I haven’t been in touch with Gear for ages.

482
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,160
Day!

483
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,280
Let me go.

484
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,160
Let me go.

485
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:22,920
I won’t.

486
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,200
It hurts.

487
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:38,240
Hey, Hey, Hey Day! Let him go before he dies.
And if you go to jail, who will take care of Night?

488
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,040
Come here.

489
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,600
Shit, that hurts.

490
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,040
Hurt huh?

491
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,320
Day.

492
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,000
Where are you going?

493
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,360
- No, that’s enough.
- You are hurt?

494
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,800
Seems like your body is wanting it so much.

495
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,320
Get up

496
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,760
- Come here!
- No!

497
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:08,640
No, I won’t go, I won’t go. I won’t go.

498
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:09,880
I don't want it.

499
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:10,960
Come here!

500
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:27,320
Night, did you put sunscreen on?

501
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,720
Not yet, why?

502
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,840
Here, put it on.

503
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,920
Then, why are you not putting it on for me?

504
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:47,520
Excuse me, sir, are you not gonna do anything yourself?

505
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,880
If you don’t do it for me, then I won’t put it on.

506
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:57,560
Jesus, fine. I will do it for you.

507
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,400
Are you comfy enough, sir?

508
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,200
That side as well.

509
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,960
You don’t want to damage your skin.

510
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,040
That’s done.

511
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:29,800
What about my leg,
can’t you see I am wearing a short?

512
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,320
This is getting too much.

513
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:35,200
You are being greedy.

514
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:41,000
Fine.
I will do it for you.

515
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:50,400
Gear, give me the sunscreen.
I will put it on for Guss.

516
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,520
Ok.

517
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:54,680
Here.

518
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,560
I am not putting it on. You are dreaming.

519
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,920
You must.

520
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,520
If you get sunburned,
you can’t say that I didn’t warn you.

521
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:09,800
You always argue with me! For once, believe me.

522
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:13,720
Fine, I will put it on.

523
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:19,120
Do it then, what are you waiting for?

524
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,600
For you to put it on for me.

525
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,160
Gear is putting it on for nice.

526
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,680
Can’t you do it for me?

527
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:36,000
Ok, I will. Give me your arm.

528
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,160
So demanding.

529
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:47,200
You want me to put it on? huh?

530
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,920
Ouch, that hurts are you putting it on or
rubbing for the lottery number?

531
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,320
So what’s the number?

532
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,600
You can get hurt?
I thought your skin was so thick that it was numbed.

533
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,920
You are the one who is numbed.
Both face and skin

534
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:04,040
If you aren’t willing then don’t do it.

535
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:07,200
Fine, I won’t do it. You do it yourself.

536
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,440
Hey, you two.

537
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,720
I will be right back.

538
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,680
Going to the toilet. Four, come on.

539
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,440
Four, come on.

540
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,320
We'll come soon.

541
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,600
So what will you do now, Day?

542
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,520
Have you managed to find a guy for me?

543
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,480
Don’t worry about that.

544
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,680
I will find it in time for you.

545
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:51,040
Tell me what you want before
that fuckers do something bad to Night.

546
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:58,960
Don’t rub it in.
If I see him, I will get rid of him.

547
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:06,240
Are you sure that it’s him who abducted your brother?

548
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,320
I am sure that Night is with him.

549
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:13,800
I don’t care about other things,
I will get my brother back.

550
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,520
What about that handsome face in your condo?

551
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,480
Has he said something?

552
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:25,360
I think, today or tomorrow, he will.

553
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:46,760
Hey!

554
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:59,920
Hey! Let’s go jet skiing

555
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:05,240
Guss,
do you want to go?

556
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,440
Yes!

557
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,880
Hey, Night, I will teach you to ride

558
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,240
Fine

559
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,680
Are you ready?

560
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:10,440
Be gentle, I have never done it.
I am not used to it.

561
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:14,120
Your word is rated!

562
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,120
Which way is Guss going?

563
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,200
Why do you have to focus on them?

564
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,160
Focus on me.

565
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:03,320
Gear, what are you doing?
Sit properly! It’s not comfortable.

566
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,360
Hey, what are you doing?

567
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,880
Just a little bit.

568
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:16,440
Gear! No!

569
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:20,160
What the fuck are you doing?

570
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,440
Trust me.

571
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:27,720
Look where we are! In the middle of the ocean!

572
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:33,760
I am! I am looking! Can’t you see?
we are so far away from the coastline! No one will see it.

573
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:37,680
I said No!

574
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,520
Are you angry with me?

575
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:06,800
You’re angry that I shouted at you, isn’t it?

576
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:12,760
No, I am not angry with you.

577
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,240
I understand.

578
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:25,120
You probably feel bad about all the things I have done to you.

579
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,920
Why do you have to be sarcastic?

580
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,240
Im not.

581
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:47,320
I really do feel bad about it.

582
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:02,160
Night, what the fuck are you doing.

583
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:05,280
Today, I will let you do anything to me.

584
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,600
What are you saying?

585
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:12,880
I said it, you don’t have to ask anymore.

586
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:44,920
I can’t hold it anymore

587
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,760
Gear, wait stop! That’s enough

588
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,960
What’s wrong with you?

589
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:52,880
Let me, just a little.

590
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,040
That’s enough.

591
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:57,680
Trust me, nobody can see.

592
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,320
Ouch.

593
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:02,200
What did you do? That hurts.

594
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,560
I told you to stop.

595
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,040
That’s disappointing

596
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:14,560
Hey, What are you guys doing?
That’s disgusting. You are in the middle of the sea.

597
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,760
I haven’t done anything.

598
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,040
Just the way you sit is already rated!

599
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,800
What are you smiling at?

600
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:28,120
What are you guys doing?
Aren’t you shy?

601
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:30,000
It’s in the middle of the sea.

602
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,760
Hey Four, why don’t you try it next time?

603
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:37,280
Do it with Guss and let me know who it went.

604
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:30,440
(I got my boy to investigate.
Gear’s family has a resort on an island.
In sure they went there.)

605
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:33,160
(Ok, Thanks.)

606
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:01,440
Fuck sake,
Why would Gear turn off his phone!

607
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:20,160
That was amazing!

608
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:20,920
Was it good enough?

609
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:21,800
Yes

610
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,600
I sing it from my heart.

611
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,920
Guss, Do you want to go play sparkler by the beach?

612
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,080
Sure, let’s go.

613
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:35,920
Hey, you can play here.

614
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:40,520
It won’t take long.
You can drink with Four for now.

615
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,240
But.

616
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:45,560
Hey, don’t act like I am a child.

617
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:49,320
Fine, don’t go far.

618
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,680
Come on Guss.

619
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,440
Take care.

620
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,280
- Be good.
- Sure.

621
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:59,240
Hey Four, Cheers.

622
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,080
Hey, help me sing.

623
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:05,440
What will you play?

624
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:11,240
Hey, you guys.
I’m going to buy some beer. Just wait here.

625
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:12,480
Ok.

626
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,360
Hey, I am coming with you.

627
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:18,600
Be fast.

628
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,000
See you.

629
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,440
Hey, Night.

630
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:31,560
Are you cold? It can get windy.

631
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:34,120
If I am cold, will you hug me?

632
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:48,640
Of course. How’s that, still cold? Any better.

633
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,760
Yea.

634
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:37,240
Hey, you got to be that sweet?
Hugging each other so tight.

635
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:43,040
I don’t want your brother-in-law to be cold.
Can’t you see he is shaking?

636
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:48,000
Take this, I will take one, you guys take one.

637
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,720
Cover yourself.

638
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:05,640
Four, I want to sit like that too.

639
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,800
You are drunk, aren’t you?

640
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:16,400
Hey, it’s once in a while.

641
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,360
And another thing.

642
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:25,360
I only drink with you.

643
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:30,360
Just don’t moan that you have a headache tomorrow.

644
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:48,000
So warm.

645
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:51,760
Gear.

646
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:57,240
Tomorrow we will travel for another day,
then the next day let’s go back to Bangkok.

647
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,600
Why would you want to go back so quickly?

648
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,760
I want to see Day.

649
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:16,920
Faster or later, you and I will have to face him.

650
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:20,480
I want everything to fit. We can’t just keep running away.

651
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:24,520
We can’t just keep running away.

652
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:29,760
I think what Night said is right.

653
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:40,520
Fine, we can go back.

654
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:57,920
Already sleeping. Such a baby.

655
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:03,880
I thought so.
I didn’t hear him.

656
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,400
Baby.

657
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,280
Itt.

658
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:36,360
I heard from my friend that your friend,
Gear has a resort on an island.

659
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,760
You know and choose not to tell me right?

660
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:45,920
Huh?

661
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:52,480
Day.

662
01:11:54,320 --> 01:12:02,840
When you are a friend, if you can’t protect them
then why would you be friends?

663
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:08,000
I like you.

664
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:19,400
Then you know what is coming for you right?

665
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:39,000
I will sleep with you.

666
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:41,120
What did you say?

667
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:45,440
Tonight, I will be sleeping with you.

668
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:49,160
In case I puke, so I won’t bother Night.

669
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,760
But you will be bothering me.

670
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:56,480
Why? Can’t I bother my boyfriend?

671
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,120
Guss, I think -

672
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:01,640
Four, aren’t you sleeping just yet?

673
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:08,280
Gear, tonight I will be sleeping with Four.

674
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:13,080
What about Night, who will be sleeping with him?

675
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:15,280
It's okay, I can sleep alone.

676
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,280
Ok, Four, please take care of him.

677
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:24,760
Sure. I will, See you tomorrow morning.

678
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:27,480
Year, take care.

679
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,280
Hey, Night, are you drunk?

680
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:40,680
No, I only drink a little.

681
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:45,160
Good, Go to bed.

682
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:50,040
And if you don’t want to take a shower,
at least wash your face and brush your teeth.

683
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:52,360
I will give you a wake-up call tomorrow.

684
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:57,560
Time for bed, Sweet dream.

685
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:01,000
Hey Gear,

686
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,280
Will you sleep with me tonight?

687
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,720
What are you saying?

688
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:11,640
Are you drunk?

689
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:14,440
Will you come or not?

690
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:20,480
Let’s go.

691
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:45,920
Four.

692
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,200
Four.

693
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:59,120
What’s up?
Do you want to puke?

694
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:05,480
No, I just want to let go.

695
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:09,440
Can you help me?

696
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,960
Do you know what you are saying?

697
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:19,000
Of course.

698
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:28,800
You are the first person who taught me about it.

699
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:35,760
And I want you to be my first.

700
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:24,680
Night, Have you ever done something like this with anyone?

701
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:28,800
I have never done anything with anyone except you.

702
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:17,840
What are you smiling at?

703
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:20,920
I am happy.

704
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,240
I have something to confess.

705
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,280
What?

706
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:33,840
Last night, Guss and I.

707
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:39,520
He let you? or you forced him?

708
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:46,440
He let me. I just want you to know.

709
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:52,560
Ok.

710
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:59,640
You guys are dating,
I can’t stop you from having sex.

711
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:05,000
Thank you for understanding.

712
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:06,520
Sure.

713
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:09,680
Origano?

714
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:15,120
Thank you.
That’s enough.

715
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:25,680
Guss, you are dating Four?

716
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:39,920
Yeah, But it’s a long story, I will tell you later.

717
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:14,080
What do you think is happening in Bangkok right now?

718
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:22,200
I think Night’s brother will be trying
to find us like a headless chicken.

719
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:25,240
Gear.

720
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:28,320
Did you bring your phone?

721
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:35,920
Yes, in my pocket,
but I have it turned off. Is there any problem?

722
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:42,560
I just want to ask Itt what’s going on that end.

723
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:51,680
Yea, that’s a good idea,
maybe he can help us deal with Day.

724
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:07,400
&lt;i>[miss call]&lt;/i>

725
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:34,280
Gear! Where are you?!

726
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:38,680
What’s up? say it slowly.

727
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:44,400
I asked where you are.
Are you on the island?

728
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,040
Yea I am.

729
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:49,520
Going back tomorrow, what’s up?

730
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:52,440
You took his brother?

731
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:55,560
I ask if you brought his brother?

732
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:59,000
Yea, Im with Night? why?

733
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:04,280
Shit, listen to me carefully.

734
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:08,440
You have to leave there as soon as possible.

735
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:09,960
Anywhere.

736
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:13,400
Day and his friend are on their way to beat you up.

737
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:15,840
He might already arrive.

738
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,600
He will kill you.
