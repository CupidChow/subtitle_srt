1
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,809
I'll introduce the guest who is with us today.

2
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,219
We have BTOB's Lee Min Hyuk.

3
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,249
(Yura)

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,449
(Lee Yong Jin)

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,149
Hello. I'm BTOB's Lee Min Hyuk,

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,319
also known by the name HUTA.

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,320
(Jeong Ki Seok)

8
00:00:23,321 --> 00:00:25,219
- He's cool.
- Do you...

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,489
enjoy watching EXchange?

10
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,260
Yes. I'm a big fan.

11
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,659
- He really loves it.
- Really?

12
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,660
He's a true fan.

13
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:33,270
But now that I'm really here, I feel very nervous.

14
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,999
He debates about it every season.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,239
- Really?
- "That couple is so and so..."

16
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,169
- That's so nice.
- What part do you get immersed in?

17
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,080
- When they fight.
- Of course.

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,639
- Right.
- When I see...

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,909
the emotions that had built up start to melt away after that,

20
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,209
I also get touched.

21
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,449
I've already watched episodes 1, 2, 3, and 4...

22
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,779
three times.

23
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,689
I recommend you to watch it 2 or 3 times.

24
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,889
If you watch it from episode one after knowing the exes,

25
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,359
- True.
- it feels different.

26
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,829
- You can see things.
- You can see things...

27
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,029
that you couldn't see at first...

28
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,829
when you had no knowledge.

29
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:03,959
- You can see them now.
- Also,

30
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,569
you only look and listen to the person speaking,

31
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,169
but you get to hear what someone else is saying...

32
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,869
- from the side.
- Right.

33
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,069
That's really fun.

34
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,569
- Me too.
- It's so fun when you know things.

35
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,840
It was the most shocking...

36
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:16,939
out of all the seasons so far.

37
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:17,940
Right.

38
00:01:17,941 --> 00:01:19,240
Every time the exes were revealed.

39
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,460
I was sure Jae Hyeong was in the Talking Room.

40
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:37,830
I thought he was the person who was curious about me.

41
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,270
But I hoped it would be Yoo Sik.

42
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,990
(Hyeon Ji's date is Yoo Sik.)

43
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,890
Did you wait long?

44
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,789
- A little.
- A little?

45
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:09,900
Yes.

46
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,660
- Did I come too late?
- No.

47
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,600
I really didn't see that coming.

48
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,570
Yoo Sik came.

49
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,410
I was surprised and happy.

50
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,090
I thought, "Why did he choose me?"

51
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,550
"That's really unexpected."

52
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,260
I try not to get swayed by every text.

53
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,890
Still,

54
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,199
it looked like Yoo Sik didn't have plans,

55
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,700
but he didn't send me a text.

56
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,080
You said you liked making things with your hands.

57
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,780
I thought we could go do that.

58
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,220
Really?

59
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,590
I'm not sure if it's something we make with our hands, though.

60
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,859
(Yoo Sik asked her what kind of dates she liked.)

61
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,130
I like making things with my hands.

62
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,200
I want to do things like that.

63
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,130
Do you draw well?

64
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,969
I can't draw well.

65
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,500
I'm really bad at it too.

66
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,210
I'm really bad with my hands.

67
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,610
Are we going to draw?

68
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,440
Something like that.

69
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,780
- Nice.
- Shall we go?

70
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,079
They look good together.

71
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,049
It's really nice to see that they're both shy.

72
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,779
People who were in long-term relationships...

73
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,320
remember all the conversations they had.

74
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,259
- They pay attention to people.
- Yes.

75
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,330
Many people fail to remember such things after hearing them.

76
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,130
(Drinking Drawing)

77
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,170
Drawing. It looks fun.

78
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,839
I'm excited.

79
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,370
(You can draw and enjoy wine here.)

80
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,440
Have you ever tried doing art?

81
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,269
I used to go to an art academy...

82
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,939
- when I was young.
- You went to an art academy?

83
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,010
When I was young.

84
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,509
- What about you?
- Never.

85
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,619
- You haven't?
- No.

86
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,950
Today,

87
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,820
you're going to draw each other on the art toy.

88
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,460
That's what we're going to do.

89
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,289
I'm really bad at drawing. Would that be okay?

90
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,330
(They're going to draw each other on the bear.)

91
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,760
Each other?

92
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,460
I'll do my best.

93
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,630
Black?

94
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,429
Black?

95
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,140
You have black on your shirt.

96
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,410
(Yoo Sik chose a blue paint.)

97
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,280
(Hyeon Ji is in thoughts before starting.)

98
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,250
What?

99
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,260
Why?

100
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,460
Should I give you something?

101
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
I was looking to decide what I'll do.

102
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,580
I'll really do this well.

103
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,380
You could put it in your room.

104
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,550
What if Kyu takes it?

105
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,490
What if he's really old?

106
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,220
It doesn't matter.

107
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,800
What if I'm way older than you?

108
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,760
That also doesn't matter.

109
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,940
Did you know who was going to come?

110
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,010
No. I thought it was going to be someone else.

111
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,880
Why?

112
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,710
I wonder. Why...

113
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,780
Why did you come?

114
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,149
I made a choice. If you ask me why I came...

115
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,990
- I mean...
- I wanted to drink red wine.

116
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,330
Did you call me yesterday in the Talking Room?

117
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,670
Was it not you?

118
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,470
I don't know.

119
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,300
Do you think I did?

120
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:15,240
I had an idea about who one person was.

121
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,210
I guess many people called you.

122
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:23,080
- See? I was so busy, and...
- Seriously. I...

123
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,650
This is crazy.

124
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,860
I don't have a talent for this.

125
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,800
It's not over yet.

126
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,130
Don't make me lose all my expectations.

127
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,569
Let me look forward to it.

128
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,000
(She keeps laughing.)

129
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,610
The chin is a bit messy.

130
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,170
My skin isn't that bad.

131
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,980
We're done.

132
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,350
Please grade us.

133
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,520
Tell us who went to the art academy.

134
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,549
They're both cute.

135
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,190
They have their own feelings.

136
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,790
It kind of looks cute when you keep seeing it.

137
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,690
- They're cute.
- They're really cute.

138
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,160
They're so cute.

139
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,499
Be careful with it.

140
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,030
(They're done painting the bears that look like each other.)

141
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,169
It's a Korean restaurant.

142
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,170
(Onryu Seongsu)

143
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,940
But it doesn't just have Korean dishes.

144
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,010
(They came to have dinner after painting the bears.)

145
00:07:23,011 --> 00:07:24,180
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

146
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,780
Try this first.

147
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,350
I'm really hungry.

148
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,090
Is it good?

149
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,720
Why are your eyes so big?

150
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,900
It's tasty.

151
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,440
Why?

152
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,410
Do you eat all kinds of meat?

153
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,450
Yes. I eat everything I want.

154
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,720
I really love meat.

155
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:11,520
Did you sign up for that yesterday?

156
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,490
- The call?
- Yes.

157
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,160
I did.

158
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,029
(She learned that Yoo Sik came to the Talking Room.)

159
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,130
Why?

160
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,000
Why?

161
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,769
Then did you talk so I wouldn't know it was you?

162
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:29,770
- Me?
- Yes.

163
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,680
I think I did that to some extent.

164
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,980
I see.

165
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,250
You really didn't know who was going to come?

166
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,060
I had no idea.

167
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,459
- Really?
- I thought it was going to be...

168
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,590
someone else.

169
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:52,700
The only keyword I saw was "red wine."

170
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,470
I wanted to talk to you more.

171
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,610
I was most curious about "red wine."

172
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,440
This is crazy.

173
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,349
I think I'm going to get indigestion.

174
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,480
You feel like getting indigestion?

175
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,080
I think my stomach is already upset.

176
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,390
There's a way Yoo Sik talks.

177
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,630
He says "This is crazy" a lot.

178
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,670
I thought he was normally like that,

179
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,639
but he said that...

180
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,770
especially when he expressed his feelings.

181
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,709
So I thought it didn't really mean that he was uncomfortable.

182
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,380
That's what I thought.

183
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,780
Are you feeling hot?

184
00:09:43,781 --> 00:09:45,520
I'm fine. Do I look hot?

185
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,819
You're red.

186
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,720
That's not because it's hot.

187
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,890
This is crazy. The wine.

188
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,460
This thing.

189
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,330
- Are you feeling hot?
- No. I'm fine.

190
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,330
Am I getting indigestion?

191
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:02,600
I think I am.

192
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,439
Her charm?

193
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,410
(What's Hyeon Ji's charm?)

194
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,510
Her honesty.

195
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,080
Her expression says everything.

196
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,750
It's been a while...

197
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:20,419
since I realized that this feeling...

198
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,619
is attraction and affection.

199
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,559
So I think I'm a bit careful...

200
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,060
not to express myself too soon.

201
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,930
(Yoo Sik is expressing his feelings at his own speed.)

202
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,240
Shall we have the last sip and go?

203
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,640
Okay.

204
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,639
- They're not awkward now.
- Right.

205
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,449
When he first met Hyeon Ji,

206
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,779
he couldn't even talk properly.

207
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,879
- Right.
- That's right.

208
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,179
He's more active now.

209
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,849
Yoo Sik said that the only keyword...

210
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,949
- he saw was "red wine." - Yes.

211
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,289
He expressed his affection 100 percent.

212
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,059
- That's right.
- That's flirting.

213
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,159
He was flirting.

214
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,289
"I knew it was yours."

215
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:03,699
"But that's the only thing I saw."

216
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,659
He said he should make a clear decision...

217
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,529
and take action proactively.

218
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,069
I think he's really doing that.

219
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,269
Also, he must be feeling such emotions after a long time.

220
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,139
- Right. Somehow...
- The feeling of being attracted...

221
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,140
- to someone new.
- That's right.

222
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:16,839
It's something he's feeling for the first time after a while.

223
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,479
I think he's saying "This is crazy" because he's really...

224
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,609
about to go crazy.

225
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,679
- Seriously.
- Really about to go crazy.

226
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,079
- "This is crazy." - It's his first time feeling it.

227
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,319
Hyeon Ji's honest reactions were shown a lot. You can see...

228
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,289
- that she really likes him.
- She's feeling shy.

229
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,919
She was almost falling down.

230
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,959
- Like that.
- She's like a transparent person.

231
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,760
Right. I hope it works out well for the two of them.

232
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,840
(Kwak Min Kyung and Cho Yoo Sik)

233
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,410
(Park Hyeon Ji and Sung Baek Hyun)

234
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,380
(Hong Ji Yeon and Kim Woo Jin)

235
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,110
(Park Ji Hyeon and Jung Won Kyu)

236
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,050
(Lee Jae Hyeong)

237
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,820
(Choi Yun Nyeong)

238
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,100
(EXchange 4)

239
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,970
(Episode 10: Our Night Shines Brighter than the Day)

240
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,670
(Pyeongchang-dong House)

241
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,440
(Yoo Sik is back from the date)

242
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,480
You startled me.

243
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,150
- Did you just get back?
- Yes.

244
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,920
Yoo Sik. Did you enjoy the date?

245
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,290
Hey.

246
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,090
I'm thirsty.

247
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,459
(He tries to avoid talking about the date.)

248
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,530
There's no water.

249
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,059
I was curious about who he went on a date with.

250
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,530
I think I wanted to talk to him.

251
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,800
I wonder what you did.

252
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,610
Cheers.

253
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,809
What time is it? Why is no one here?

254
00:12:58,810 --> 00:12:59,910
- I know, right?
- It's 9pm.

255
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,250
There's not much time left for us.

256
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,320
People will start coming.

257
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,390
Did you drink the juice in the morning?

258
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,129
- There was no kale.
- Who...

259
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,830
There was only coriander.

260
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,260
I thought, "Should I just make it with coriander?"

261
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,729
Apple and coriander juice?

262
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,470
(She almost made him drink apple and coriander juice.)

263
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,370
I'm curious what your face looks like when your forehead shows.

264
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,240
Do you normally reveal your forehead?

265
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,939
I do that a lot.

266
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,039
- Really?
- Yes.

267
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,339
I have my hair up when I practice.

268
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,010
Show me. Please.

269
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,709
- Now?
- Yes.

270
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,750
Now...

271
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,050
Just a little.

272
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,480
- No.
- Why not?

273
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,319
I'll soon style it like that.

274
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,350
Okay.

275
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,720
How do I look...

276
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,790
with bangs?

277
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,630
You look young.

278
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,860
I should cut it tomorrow.

279
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,140
I want to see you perform at Arko.

280
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,440
- Arko?
- Please invite me.

281
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,139
Please.

282
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,809
Okay. But...

283
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,380
I'll be practicing then.

284
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,479
It's crazy. I have to warm up.

285
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,180
Warm up. I'll help you.

286
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,079
- How can I help?
- This is crazy.

287
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,820
I should go downstairs and warm up later.

288
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,460
Should we go to the trail tomorrow?

289
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,430
- Mount Bukhan?
- Mount Bukhan.

290
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,130
We could hike as well.

291
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,700
We could use the real Mountain Gym there.

292
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,970
With the couple shoes I have with Baek Hyun?

293
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,470
I've never seen anyone wear those shoes.

294
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,879
How is it possible?

295
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,649
(She gathered her courage, but he brushed it off...)

296
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,510
(with a joking comment.)

297
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,980
I thought...

298
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,820
it would be nice if he approached me more.

299
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,520
At first,

300
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,730
I felt that we had feelings for each other.

301
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,030
But with time,

302
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,630
I could see that compared to how much...

303
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,800
I express my feelings to Yoo Sik,

304
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,670
the reactions he gives back...

305
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,010
are much less than mine.

306
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,410
(A sense of hurt keeps building up.)

307
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,779
Are you hungry?

308
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,980
A bit.

309
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,520
(Glancing)

310
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,620
The vacuum cleaner is working.

311
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,190
It's working hard.

312
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,100
Did you have fun?

313
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,300
It was fun.

314
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,939
I'm not sure.

315
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,510
I feel more confused.

316
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:46,780
He wasn't the kind of person I thought he was.

317
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,910
- Really?
- Yes.

318
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,689
It's not that I don't like that.

319
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,619
- Then why?
- It was really nice.

320
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,220
I wanted to talk to him, and he was a really nice person.

321
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,329
I wanted that person to come, and I thought he would.

322
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,859
But he didn't,

323
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,499
so I feel very weird.

324
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,830
- Really?
- Yes.

325
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:15,410
He should get to know new people if he wants.

326
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,740
But I felt a bit upset.

327
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,580
So it felt very weird.

328
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,019
What's that?

329
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,349
(The doorbell suddenly rang.)

330
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,490
Hold on.

331
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,360
(There's a letter in the mailbox.)

332
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,499
- Goodness, Hyeon Ji.
- Hold on!

333
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,730
Hold on. This isn't right.

334
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,769
- Yes? I'm taking a shower.
- Are you taking a shower?

335
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:43,800
Are you washing your hair?

336
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,199
I'm taking a shower.

337
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,540
The doorbell rang.

338
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,170
- What?
- The doorbell rang.

339
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,370
- The bell?
- Yes.

340
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:02,350
(What letter awaits the residents?)

341
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,119
(Everyone gathered in the living room.)

342
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,420
Shall we open the envelope now?

343
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,520
I'm excited.

344
00:17:06,521 --> 00:17:07,590
Who's going to open it today?

345
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,789
- Which of us hasn't opened it yet?
- Who hasn't?

346
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:10,830
- Me.
- Me.

347
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,860
- Them? Okay.
- One of you two should do it.

348
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,729
- Go ahead.
- Shall I do it?

349
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm going to open it now.

350
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,840
I'm nervous. What is it about?

351
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,810
- I'm curious.
- What is it about?

352
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,979
Oh, my goodness.

353
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,280
- I think it's our age.
- Read it for us, please.

354
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,079
"You can reveal your age now."

355
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,149
- Why?
- I can't believe it.

356
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,150
It's surprising.

357
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,489
(You can reveal your age now.)

358
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,790
(Say the year you were born in.)

359
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,059
- It's the age!
- We can see it.

360
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,689
- Nice!
- It should be revealed quickly.

361
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:46,900
We even said that Won Kyu might be in his 40s.

362
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,969
We thought he could be about the same age as us.

363
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,299
He might be only a few years younger than me.

364
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,899
We even said that he and us are of similar age.

365
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,439
Right. Our misunderstanding is growing.

366
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,169
- No way.
- We even said he's in his 40s.

367
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,209
They need to reveal it quickly.

368
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,009
I think it can be a game-changer.

369
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,979
- It will be.
- It matters more than you think.

370
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,449
- The age definitely matters.
- Yes.

371
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,419
If Yoo Sik is younger, would it change things?

372
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,049
Girls can see him as a child,

373
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,149
not as a man.

374
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,419
- It totally will feel different.
- Absolutely.

375
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,719
And Woo Jin doesn't know Cyworld and Epic High.

376
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,830
- I wonder how old he is.
- Exactly.

377
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,230
The time has come.

378
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,059
We'll sort out how we address each other right away.

379
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,070
(The moment of truth has arrived.)

380
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,600
Let's get this over with, if we have to do it anyway.

381
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,940
When we meet someone,

382
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,470
we can't ignore the age.

383
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,440
What if Won Kyu is actually in his 40s?

384
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,309
I know he isn't.

385
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,710
I was just afraid that our age difference...

386
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:37,980
might be too big.

387
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,550
I've been waiting for this. The age.

388
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,320
Maybe I was more anxious for it to be revealed, rather than the job.

389
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:47,330
It was something I didn't want to reveal.

390
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,130
(When their age is revealed, it might affect their feelings.)

391
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,230
We might use honorifics right away.

392
00:18:53,231 --> 00:18:54,599
Let's just keep talking casually.

393
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,029
- We can keep talking casually.
- We can.

394
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,239
Let's just sort out how we address each other.

395
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,240
Let's stick to the usual.

396
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,940
Shall we call each other casually?

397
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:01,670
(Guys start to sort out how they address each other.)

398
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:04,209
- I'm so excited!
- Shall we drop the honorifics too?

399
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,239
I'm very excited.

400
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,240
Why do I feel so nervous?

401
00:19:06,241 --> 00:19:08,449
I know. I've been so curious,

402
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,209
but I feel so nervous now that I should reveal it.

403
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,220
(Girls are somehow nervous.)

404
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,250
Shall we decide the order by rock-paper-scissors?

405
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:15,749
I'll go first.

406
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,019
- Really?
- Are you sure?

407
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,020
Shall he pick the next person?

408
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,660
It will feel less pressuring if we take turns.

409
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,289
Okay. Let's take turns this way.

410
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,400
- Guys will go first.
- Sounds good.

411
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,230
Then I'll reveal my age first.

412
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,740
(It somehow makes her smile.)

413
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,200
I was born in 2000...

414
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,240
No way!

415
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,570
I was born in 2000...

416
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,640
No way!

417
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,150
You're lying.

418
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,819
I was born in 1998. I'm 28 years old.

419
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,919
(Baek Hyun is 28 years old, born in 1998.)

420
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,920
- I see.
- Yes.

421
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,590
(Jae Hyeong is next.)

422
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,059
I was born in 1999.

423
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,429
(Jae Hyeong is 27 years old, born in 1999.)

424
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,629
- What?
- Really?

425
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,630
Is that so?

426
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,540
I was born in 1996.

427
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,310
- Born in 1996?
- You look younger than your age.

428
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,080
(Woo Jin is 30 years old, born in 1996.)

429
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:17,310
He looked like an idol singer.

430
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:21,390
From the beginning, I felt that he was young.

431
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,960
Woo Jin surprised me the most.

432
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,500
It's like this? Revealing in front of everyone?

433
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,900
I...

434
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,900
Yoo Sik was the one I was most curious about.

435
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,110
I hoped that he was older than me.

436
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,879
I thought he was the same age as me...

437
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,240
or 1 or 2 years younger.

438
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,749
I guess my ex looked old...

439
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,280
to other girls.

440
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,989
They all said...

441
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,450
that he looked older than them.

442
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:59,220
I actually know his age,

443
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,930
and he didn't feel like someone older.

444
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,300
I was born...

445
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,130
in 2000...

446
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,000
- No way.
- You're lying.

447
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,200
- What?
- You surprised me.

448
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,169
- I was born in 2000.
- Really?

449
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:18,339
Yes. I was born in 2000, the Year of the Dragon.

450
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,479
Really?

451
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,480
(Staring off into space)

452
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,210
- Born in 2000? Wait.
- I'm curious.

453
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,480
- Why?
- Is that true?

454
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,120
- Yes, it's true.
- I'm way older than you.

455
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,290
Wait.

456
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,590
Wait a minute.

457
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,389
(Everyone is shouting, "Wait.")

458
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,390
Goodness.

459
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:36,990
I see.

460
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,200
- Wait.
- Wait.

461
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,200
I'll move to a different room.

462
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:44,970
Born in 2000?

463
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,170
He said he was born in 2000, the Year of the Dragon.

464
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,209
I thought Yoo Sik might be older than me...

465
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,650
or the same age as me. But he's two years younger than me.

466
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,810
I predicted all of their ages.

467
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,020
But Yoo Sik was much younger than I thought.

468
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,420
I feel that my ex wants...

469
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:06,620
to look older than others.

470
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,290
He looked disappointed.

471
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:12,460
I was afraid they'd consider me as a child due to my age.

472
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:17,639
I didn't want to be the youngest, so I didn't feel good.

473
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,770
(Yoo Sik is inwardly displeased that he's the youngest.)

474
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,569
(Here's another one who's not pleasant.)

475
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,340
I was born in 2000...

476
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,409
I was born in 1993.

477
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,579
(Won Kyu is 33 years old, born in 1993.)

478
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,149
- You're actually older.
- He's the oldest guy.

479
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,180
I'm actually an older brother here.

480
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,389
I thought I was probably the oldest,

481
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:39,520
but I expected someone to be close to my age.

482
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,000
Wait a minute. Who said he was in his 40s?

483
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,269
- I'm sorry.
- I apologize.

484
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,169
- Sorry, Won Kyu.
- "In his 40s."

485
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,139
It's because he looked the most mature among them.

486
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,310
It's because he looked mature, and because of his job.

487
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,870
He turns out to be a baby oriental doctor.

488
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,279
- "A baby?" - Yes, a baby oriental doctor.

489
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,340
"Wah!"

490
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,249
I...

491
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,010
(Min Kyung's turn)

492
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,149
was born in 2001.

493
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,850
(Min Kyung is 25 years old, born in 2001.)

494
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,090
Born in 2001?

495
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,859
- Goodness.
- Born in 2001?

496
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,920
He's almost...

497
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,530
It's incredible.

498
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,330
What? We're eight years apart.

499
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,499
- Born in 2002?
- In 2001?

500
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,139
- I was born in 2001.
- In 2001.

501
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,570
Gosh. In 2001?

502
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,370
Everyone was startled.

503
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,610
I think a five-year age gap is fine.

504
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,950
I don't think age really matters.

505
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,419
(Next, Ji Yeon's turn)

506
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,420
- Go ahead.
- Me?

507
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,850
I was born in 1998. I'm the same age as Baek Hyun.

508
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,119
(Ji Yeon and Baek Hyun were born in the same year, 1998.)

509
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,160
Really?

510
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,330
They're the first ones who are the same age.

511
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,060
I want to get out of here now.

512
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,570
- Hyeon Ji, why are you laughing?
- I'm worried.

513
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,210
I prefer someone younger than me.

514
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:04,379
Ji Yeon also told me earlier...

515
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,910
that she likes a guy older than her.

516
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:09,249
In a way, she found out that I'm older than her,

517
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,350
so she might get more attracted to me.

518
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,220
I had my fortune told,

519
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,020
and I heard that I'm compatible with someone 4 or 5 years older.

520
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,960
Am I wrong?

521
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,060
I like an older guy.

522
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,900
So I thought that the age difference was just right.

523
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,830
- Right away.
- I was born in 1998.

524
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,370
How old do you think I am?

525
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,240
- I think you were born in 1997.
- In 1997?

526
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,709
- I think you were born in...
- 1999?

527
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,179
- It's hard to tell.
- 1999?

528
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,509
- Yes, 1999.
- 1999.

529
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,550
I see.

530
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,380
I was curious about how old Yun Nyeong was.

531
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:50,220
I've told my friends, "I can never date someone younger."

532
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,019
Since I have a younger sister,

533
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,220
a younger girl feels like a younger sister.

534
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,330
Baek Hyun said that he didn't date anyone younger.

535
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,570
It made me a bit worried.

536
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:06,540
(Baek Hyun prefers someone older.)

537
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,470
I was born in 2000, the Year of the Dragon.

538
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,209
Really?

539
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,579
I was born in 2000, the Year of the Dragon.

540
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,379
(Yun Nyeong is 26 years old, born in 2000.)

541
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,910
Wait. I think I'll have to go home.

542
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,080
I seriously need to go home.

543
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,390
I thought so.

544
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,860
I was very glad.

545
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,590
I was born in 2000, the Year of the Dragon.

546
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,830
(Baek Hyun found out Yun Nyeong's age, which he was curious about.)

547
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,730
Yun Nyeong turned out to be younger than me.

548
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,069
It's a two-year age difference.

549
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,070
I think it will be all right for him to date a younger person.

550
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,310
In what year were you born?

551
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:47,040
I was born in 1997.

552
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,679
You're the oldest girl here?

553
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,810
(Hyeon Ji is 29 years old, born in 1997.)

554
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,980
- Everyone is young.
- Yes.

555
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:57,350
To be honest,

556
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:02,230
I expected most guys to be younger than me.

557
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,529
But I was afraid that Yoo Sik might think...

558
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:08,029
that I'm too old.

559
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,670
That was what bothered me.

560
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,999
(Does age matter when you date someone?)

561
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,240
When I date someone?

562
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,070
No, it doesn't matter.

563
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,780
I had already become close to her.

564
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:21,750
So age wasn't a major factor.

565
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,649
Everyone is young.

566
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,320
(Last one, Ji Hyeon's turn)

567
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,019
I was born in 1998.

568
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,159
(The trio of 1998-borns is formed.)

569
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,890
We have 3 people born in 1998,

570
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,960
Baek Hyun, Ji Yeon, and Ji Hyeon.

571
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,400
We're the strongest force here...

572
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:43,970
because there are three of us.

573
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,770
I think we can be really good friends from now on.

574
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,069
Are we friends?

575
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,870
I had a feeling.

576
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:55,250
I think what matters is personality, not age.

577
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,950
So I wasn't worried about it.

578
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:00,319
- Then you're the youngest girl.
- Yes, I am.

579
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,789
How about guys?

580
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:03,090
He's the youngest.

581
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,920
(The youngest, Kyu)

582
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,860
It's nice to meet you.

583
00:27:07,861 --> 00:27:09,189
- It's not much of a difference.
- Hi.

584
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,590
I'm the oldest girl here.

585
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,060
- Sister!
- I don't like being the youngest.

586
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:15,930
You're an older sister.

587
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,739
- How come everyone is so young?
- I know.

588
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,940
What's happening? Wait a minute.

589
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,379
You're very mature.

590
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,179
I naturally thought him to be older than me.

591
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,209
Exactly.

592
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,079
I expected him to be definitely older than me.

593
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,750
His actions are very mature.

594
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,619
And you said you've taught people for a long time.

595
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,990
It's been a long time since I started teaching.

596
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,390
I've been teaching and performing for a long time.

597
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:43,190
I've been active as a dancer since I went to college.

598
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:44,900
Should I apologize on my knees?

599
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,699
There was a reason he went to bed late.

600
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,169
Now I see why.

601
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,440
Of course, he has good stamina.

602
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,770
I'm not objectively old, but here, I feel old.

603
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,710
I feel sad.

604
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,149
It's getting awkward.

605
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,279
(Who made your heart flutter today?)

606
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,880
(Let them know via text.)

607
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,730
(The time has come, as always.)

608
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:22,600
(Once a day, only one text)

609
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:31,910
(Where is your heart heading?)

610
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,279
They're texting after their ages were revealed.

611
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,379
I don't think it will change their minds.

612
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,919
I don't think that will be the cause.

613
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,379
It won't affect their texts,

614
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,919
but other things, from now on.

615
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,549
- Things could change tomorrow.
- Yes, a bit.

616
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,349
An age gap of 1 or 2 years will be fine.

617
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,789
But for someone who doesn't like to date a younger person...

618
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,159
Considering Yoo Sik's personality,

619
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,829
he didn't like to reveal his age in the first place.

620
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:53,329
- Right.
- And for those...

621
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,769
who are connected through Yoo Sik,

622
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,029
the atmosphere could get strange.

623
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,830
- I know.
- Right.

624
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:03,410
(Ji Yeon)

625
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:07,080
(Gather on the terrace at midnight.)

626
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:10,410
"Gather on the terrace at midnight."

627
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,480
Is it from Won Kyu?

628
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,220
"Gather?"

629
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:19,490
I felt Ji Yeon was always calling me.

630
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:23,130
So I thought I should call her and have a talk.

631
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:27,130
(Won Kyu)

632
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:31,100
(You really are older than me.)

633
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,640
Ji Yeon had thought that I was older than her,

634
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:38,540
so now she thinks she was right.

635
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:45,720
(Today, they clicked again.)

636
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,519
(Woo Jin)

637
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,490
(You're actually older than me! Am I close to the age you guessed?)

638
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:58,059
It seems that Woo Jin...

639
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:01,200
is showing interest in me.

640
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,040
I also wanted to talk with him.

641
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,580
(Min Kyung)

642
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:18,019
(I'm glad that you enjoyed the water leisure park today.)

643
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,580
(Let's have a simple and comfortable date next time.)

644
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,789
I was so happy that there was someone...

645
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,220
interested in me.

646
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,590
And I like that we talk honestly about our true feelings via text.

647
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,070
I liked the date, and there were definitely heart-fluttering moments.

648
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:38,639
I thought it could develop into something more...

649
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,900
in the future.

650
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,740
I had a good feeling about the date.

651
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:47,580
(Today's date made them click.)

652
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,109
Yes, I certainly think they look good together.

653
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,149
They look good.

654
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,949
- Their date was nice.
- The date was very nice.

655
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:55,790
Everyone's attention is gradually shifting toward the new people.

656
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,890
(Your ex did not pick you.)

657
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,560
(Your ex did not pick you.)

658
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:11,400
(As they approach someone new, their feelings seem to cross.)

659
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,340
Shall we start speaking casually now?

660
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,840
We're going to do that anyway.

661
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,970
What? You're Kyu?

662
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,779
Brother Kyu.

663
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,579
- We decided how to call each other.
- How?

664
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,749
We'll just call first names.

665
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,919
For everyone?

666
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,720
(Yoo Sik)

667
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,349
(See? I told you I'm older.)

668
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:31,960
(Hi, Younger Yoo Sik.)

669
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:37,930
(He received two texts from older girls.)

670
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,870
I guessed Hyeon Ji and Ji Hyeon sent them.

671
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:52,640
Hyeon Ji had already said that she'd be older than me.

672
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,979
In the car, I told him,

673
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,220
"I think I'm older than you."

674
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,420
But he said it didn't matter.

675
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,290
Every date with him fluttered my heart.

676
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,959
From the text, "Younger Yoo Sik,"

677
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,460
I felt that Ji Hyeon sent it.

678
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:12,199
I think that I made a mistake in sending the text...

679
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,560
on the third day.

680
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,369
I sent one to Baek Hyun,

681
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,970
and Yoo Sik sent one to me.

682
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,740
So, I didn't want to confuse him.

683
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,710
Although I had a date with someone else,

684
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,080
I'm still interested in you.

685
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,510
That was what I wanted to tell him, I guess.

686
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:35,050
(Two girls' hearts were delivered to Yoo Sik.)

687
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:41,760
- He's so popular among older girls!
- Big sisters!

688
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:44,129
He feels good but a bit bitter at the same time.

689
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,729
He suddenly feels like he's a child, so he's upset, I guess.

690
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,169
You should call them by their names, Yoo Sik.

691
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,669
Maybe Yoo Sik likes it when he's older than his date.

692
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,199
We can treat a three-year difference as the same age.

693
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,439
I came out in the middle.

694
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,639
That's right.

695
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:00,580
(Hyeon Ji)

696
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,920
(Ji Hyeon)

697
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,959
(First of all, the teddy bear was really cute.)

698
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,990
(And I think it's about time we go out for meat.)

699
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,230
I think Yoo Sik sent it.

700
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,870
I was happy.

701
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,440
(Yoo Sik's text went to Hyeon Ji.)

702
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,649
I keep saying that I was happy.

703
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:36,910
But I was happy.

704
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,050
I can't hide my facial expression.

705
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,360
When we had our first date,

706
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:50,290
he sent me a text that went, "Thank you for your hard work."

707
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,560
Compared to that,

708
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:56,900
he was quite expressive in this text.

709
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,169
I'm in the process...

710
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:02,509
of ascertaining my emotions for the person...

711
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:05,480
I feel for and care about the most.

712
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:09,680
(Yoo Sik and Hyeon Ji texted each other.)

713
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,350
What? Why?

714
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,580
(Your ex did not pick you.)

715
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,800
I felt annoyed... "Annoyed?"

716
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,770
It got on my nerves.

717
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,810
(Your ex did not pick you.)

718
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,250
(I had fun today! Let's get closer.)

719
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,280
(Your ex did not pick you.)

720
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,459
Yoo Sik didn't send me a text,

721
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,930
but Jae Hyeong did.

722
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,900
At first, I just wanted to talk to her.

723
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,439
Now, I want to get to know her better.

724
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,570
I became more curious about her.

725
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,310
I think I'm beginning to like her.

726
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,380
(Jae Hyeong)

727
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:16,110
(Your ex did not pick you.)

728
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,150
I didn't receive any texts today.

729
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,479
Ji Hyeon is free to do what she wants.

730
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,950
It's okay if she doesn't pick me.

731
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,320
I plan to talk to Ji Hyeon a lot...

732
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,360
and continue texting her in the future.

733
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,530
(Jae Hyeong's heart goes out to Ji Hyeon.)

734
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:39,540
(Baek Hyun)

735
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:43,870
(I want to use my wish card. Let's go on a date tomorrow.)

736
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,240
When we went bowling last time,

737
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,079
Team Women won.

738
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,320
Men said that each woman would get a wish card.

739
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,789
I meant that I wanted to use that wish card.

740
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:59,060
So that he wouldn't refuse, I said that I'd use my wish card.

741
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,890
(Today as well, Yun Nyeong sends Baek Hyun a text.)

742
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,000
(Yun Nyeong)

743
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:10,800
(I'm so sorry about the mishap.)

744
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:16,010
(Your ex did not pick you.)

745
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:21,340
He didn't choose me for the keyword date.

746
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,410
I thought the text was from Baek Hyun...

747
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,580
who chose someone else by mistake.

748
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:38,090
(Your ex did not pick you.)

749
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,530
I knew that I wouldn't get a text from him.

750
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,100
(Your ex did not pick you.)

751
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,969
It didn't bother me.

752
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,210
I hope things will continue to be that way.

753
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,640
I'm getting a text from someone I want,

754
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,810
so I don't ask for more.

755
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,710
I don't need a text from her.

756
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,519
He's doing that again.

757
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,019
- He's doing that again.
- Stop it.

758
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,319
- Why does he speak so aggressively?
- I feel like...

759
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,789
he hasn't adjusted to the show yet.

760
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,819
Why does he speak...

761
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,959
- so aggressively?
- Seriously.

762
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,059
I think he's defensive.

763
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,099
- Despite what he did at night, - He's cynical.

764
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,200
He's too cool about it.

765
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,900
(Everyone's text has been delivered.)

766
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,200
Did you know that you were older?

767
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,599
- What? Me?
- Did you know that you were older?

768
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,369
I told you that I'd never be the youngest.

769
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:24,639
- Really?
- I'm pretty old.

770
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,940
Are we two years apart?

771
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,780
I didn't want to know about everyone's age.

772
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:31,280
Why not? Do you want to switch ages with me?

773
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,420
Would you please do that?

774
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,579
I really want to switch ages with you.

775
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,590
Why?

776
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:37,590
You'll reach my age soon.

777
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,889
Well,

778
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,790
it's my 1st time hating the fact that I was born in 2000.

779
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,900
I hoped that I'd be the youngest.

780
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,170
I thought you'd be older than me.

781
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,500
- Really?
- Yes.

782
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,969
I thought you'd be 1 or 2 years older.

783
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,500
- You just had that vibe.
- Really?

784
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,469
You can call me Baek Hyun in here,

785
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:58,140
but you have to call me "Big brother" outside.

786
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,150
That's so funny.

787
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,420
- You're strict.
- He's so funny.

788
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:08,049
Call me Baek Hyun in here. Put yourself at ease.

789
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:10,650
Otherwise, things might get a bit uncomfortable.

790
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:15,529
- Do I seem like an old fart?
- I seriously thought...

791
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:18,060
- you guys were the same age.
- Really?

792
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,330
All of you guys seemed to be similar in age.

793
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,830
- What do you think?
- All of us?

794
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,900
(There was an outlier.)

795
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:31,240
- The year of 1998.
- The year of 1998.

796
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:34,379
I thought you were younger than me.

797
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,410
How about me?

798
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:36,680
My age.

799
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,819
Without a doubt.

800
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,290
I thought Ji Hyeon was the oldest among women.

801
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:44,989
No, I meant that you were mature. I meant that as a compliment.

802
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,920
Your voice has that power.

803
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,460
I'll only use a nasal voice from now on.

804
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,000
- Try it.
- Hello.

805
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,230
Hey.

806
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,670
I didn't say anything.

807
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,170
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

808
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:04,240
I'm sorry about slapping you.

809
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,879
You guys look good together.

810
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,140
- Do we?
- Yes.

811
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,909
Shall I take a photo of you guys?

812
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,310
I'll take it from the top.

813
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,050
One, two, three.

814
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:18,890
How cute.

815
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:21,290
Is it a good photo?

816
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:23,190
What? It's a good photo.

817
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:24,530
Good.

818
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:25,900
What?

819
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,430
What is it?

820
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,700
What? Did you set a password?

821
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,070
Really?

822
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,070
You're very thorough.

823
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,740
- Seriously.
- I should learn from you.

824
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,210
You marked the back too.

825
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,580
Here.

826
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,680
Hey.

827
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,990
You took the photo while we were talking.

828
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:50,790
Let me see.

829
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,290
What? It's a good photo.

830
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,730
Hey, what are you talking about?

831
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,160
You look nicer in person. I'll take a photo again.

832
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,760
What? You look great now.

833
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,140
What's wrong?

834
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,810
Right now...

835
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,050
I'm sorry.

836
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,350
Goodness.

837
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,360
(Sighing)

838
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,410
Gosh.

839
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,039
- What?
- Gosh, Yun Nyeong.

840
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,479
Just now,

841
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,109
she put down the beer can with force.

842
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,110
He took another woman's photo...

843
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,110
- and called her cute.
- Yes.

844
00:40:51,111 --> 00:40:54,619
I understand why she's worried even after receiving a text.

845
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:58,089
Baek Hyun said that he had never dated a younger woman.

846
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,859
- He put an emphasis on that.
- He had only dated older women.

847
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,229
I think she's hung up on that.

848
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:04,190
Did his thoughts change after her age was revealed?

849
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:05,860
Did you finish the bottle already?

850
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,229
You left your clothing...

851
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,299
- on the chair.
- Did it hurt?

852
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,699
- Did the slap hurt?
- I'm okay.

853
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,069
- I'm sorry.
- You can slap me some more.

854
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,769
I think your mom will be angry.

855
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:14,900
Come on.

856
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,670
It's okay. You can slap me some more.

857
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:20,980
Are you going upstairs?

858
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:22,710
I'm going to come back downstairs.

859
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,850
Are you going to drink?

860
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:45,500
(Yoo Sik also goes straight into the room.)

861
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,020
I wanted to check up on you.

862
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,550
Me? Why are you worried about me?

863
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,290
- Do you want to switch it?
- What?

864
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,860
The age.

865
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,430
Why?

866
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,700
I might hate being young.

867
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,200
It's because the person you're interested in...

868
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:20,270
might like an older man, right?

869
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,740
(Yoo Sik doesn't answer.)

870
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,610
Shall we drink by ourselves?

871
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,980
Shall we come downstairs with Chungha?

872
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,980
Really?

873
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:31,549
- Is he that worried?
- Age isn't that big of an issue.

874
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,749
Is he worried that he'll seem childish?

875
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,749
You know how people are when they talk to someone young.

876
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:36,219
"What do you know?"

877
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,489
- They have preconceptions.
- That's right.

878
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:39,860
They go, "You're a baby if you were born in 2000."

879
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,659
When you're young, you don't like having older women pay for meals.

880
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,859
- It hurts your pride.
- That's right.

881
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,599
- Is it something simple like that?
- Yes.

882
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,259
You feel small.

883
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,429
- You want to pay.
- I see. Okay.

884
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:52,240
Yoo Sik, let's switch with me. I'll give you 300,000 dollars.

885
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,739
- I'm serious.
- With you?

886
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,239
If you switch with me, I'll give you 300,000 dollars.

887
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,510
I'll give you 500,000 dollars.

888
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,110
I'll give you 550,000 dollars.

889
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:01,309
I take that. I'll give you 600,000 dollars.

890
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:03,149
Seriously, I can give you more.

891
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,349
Take my age. I was born in 1984.

892
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:05,779
One million dollars!

893
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:08,149
- That age...
- He doesn't know how happy he is.

894
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:10,289
We need to die and be born again to have that age.

895
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:12,219
It's the best age in life.

896
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,220
It's the best age. Seriously.

897
00:43:13,221 --> 00:43:14,619
I know. It's the best time.

898
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,159
It's so cute to see him like that.

899
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,629
- I know.
- I guess he hates...

900
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:21,629
that he's younger than the women he's interested in.

901
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:23,229
- That's right.
- It's a simple reason.

902
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:24,569
- Just because.
- That's the repercussion...

903
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:26,099
- of revealing the age.
- You're right.

904
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,769
Those who feel worried due to their age are Yun Nyeong...

905
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:30,140
- and Yoo Sik.
- Yoo Sik.

906
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:42,390
(Hyeon Ji takes the teddy bear she has made with Yoo Sik.)

907
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,590
(Halting)

908
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:53,030
(Baek Hyun is cooking in the kitchen.)

909
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,540
(Hyeon Ji goes back to the room.)

910
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05,910
(She puts the teddy bear in the launry basket.)

911
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,620
(She passes the kitchen without suspicion.)

912
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:17,790
Why?

913
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,859
I love that I have a same-aged friend.

914
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,589
I'm going to work out in the room, so don't look for me.

915
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:22,730
Come on.

916
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,060
This isn't the place.

917
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,070
- What?
- Go down one more floor.

918
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,180
(This time, Woo Jin appears.)

919
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,349
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

920
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:48,350
(Woo Jin enters the laundry room.)

921
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:53,660
Is it my load?

922
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:57,629
- Isn't this...
- I combined mine with Yoo Sik's,

923
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:58,760
so he must've moved it.

924
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,400
- Okay.
- I thought you were going to bed.

925
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:04,099
- Yes. I need to do my laundry.
- If you have...

926
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,699
If you have nothing to do afterward, come to the second floor.

927
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,700
Okay.

928
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,469
- I can speak casually, right?
- Of course.

929
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:09,540
- Speak casually to me too.
- Okay.

930
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:17,650
(It isn't easy to deliver a teddy bear.)

931
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:29,330
(She hears Yoo Sik's voice upstairs.)

932
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:33,060
By any chance, are you washing the towels?

933
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:36,070
- Whose are those?
- I am. What is it?

934
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,669
I need to speak politely.

935
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:42,740
- I forgot.
- It's driving me crazy.

936
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:47,640
- What about the laundry?
- Someone asked.

937
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,709
Who did? This load?

938
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:53,120
- It's driving me crazy.
- Well... Who was it?

939
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,020
- Woo Jin?
- Woo Jin.

940
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,789
- This...
- He asked if it was combined.

941
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:58,150
- Yes.
- With our load?

942
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:02,190
I put down our combined load and started a cycle for mine.

943
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,830
- You did it separately.
- I did it separately.

944
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,299
I combined it with Woo Jin's...

945
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,360
Woo Jin's load.

946
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,369
If you're going to speak casually to Woo Jin,

947
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:12,770
do the same to me.

948
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,340
- Okay.
- All right.

949
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,270
- Take this.
- What?

950
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,340
- It's so funny.
- Is it here?

951
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,710
Here.

952
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:25,680
- Why?
- I came here because of this.

953
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:28,320
- Really?
- Yes.

954
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:30,949
- Seriously.
- You should've said something.

955
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:33,660
- Why did you pass me by?
- I couldn't do that.

956
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:36,160
I couldn't do that. You were with other people.

957
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:39,900
Okay. I won't come our in three days.

958
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:43,499
Yun Nyeong, why do you look so comfortable?

959
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,699
- What do you mean?
- Why do you look so comfortable?

960
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:48,070
I'm comfortable. I'm so happy that we're the same age.

961
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:50,540
It makes me so...

962
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:53,740
- Don't you like it?
- It makes me so relieved.

963
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,910
- It makes me so happy.
- Forget it. Too late.

964
00:46:58,810 --> 00:46:59,879
This is driving me crazy.

965
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,589
Hold on. Let's see if there's trash. There's trash indeed.

966
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:03,590
(She pretends to get laundry.)

967
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:04,590
- What's this stain?
- Is there a stain?

968
00:47:04,591 --> 00:47:05,960
It isn't my doing.

969
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:11,830
It's a waste to keep using a trash bag.

970
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,859
Is she pretending to get the nonexistent laundry?

971
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,060
What is she doing?

972
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,670
Did she pretend to do that?

973
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,640
- She's like an extra...
- I mean...

974
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,809
who pretends to chop ingredients.

975
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:24,309
- They slice in the air.
- She moved her hands...

976
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:25,609
in the air.

977
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:27,479
She could just leave. Why did she act?

978
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,149
She put air into the basket.

979
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:30,449
- She put air into the basket.
- It was so funny.

980
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:31,980
- How is she so funny?
- She's so eccentric.

981
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,319
Shall I do it? Shall we go together?

982
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,420
- Yes.
- Let's go together.

983
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:39,859
Age isn't important.

984
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:42,020
- That's what I think.
- Age isn't important.

985
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,629
I don't think age is important.

986
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:45,930
I agree. I'll tell myself that.

987
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:49,199
It's the person that's important.

988
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,099
That's what I think, but who knows what he will think?

989
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,140
Seriously.

990
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,480
It depends on the person.

991
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,810
- You can go downstairs.
- Okay.

992
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:08,780
What?

993
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:16,960
- Big sister.
- What?

994
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:19,630
Do I look like the oldest woman?

995
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,500
No.

996
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:26,770
If I say that you do, you'll nag at me.

997
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:29,840
Be serious.

998
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:33,439
- Should I be serious? You don't...
- Be honest.

999
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,780
You're tall, so you do look a bit...

1000
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:39,319
- Do I look old?
- You look mature.

1001
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,219
But you don't look old.

1002
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:42,849
- Well...
- What was that?

1003
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:44,349
- Nothing.
- What was that?

1004
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:46,820
I thought everyone was born in 1998 or something.

1005
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,360
And? Were you surprised?

1006
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:49,960
I was totally surprised.

1007
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:52,760
So, how do you feel?

1008
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,630
Are you flustered?

1009
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:58,230
- A little bit.
- It's okay.

1010
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,770
I'm okay with it, but...

1011
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,510
- Are you okay with it?
- What?

1012
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:06,709
Are you okay with it? Then it's fine. Who cares?

1013
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,310
- I'm okay with it.
- Really?

1014
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,180
Then it's fine.

1015
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:13,419
I don't care if the man is younger or older.

1016
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,119
I don't care about the age.

1017
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,520
What do you care about?

1018
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,089
The character.

1019
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:20,220
The character? That's right. That's the most important.

1020
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,730
It's nice to have that thought.

1021
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,600
Did you decide to show off your charms starting today?

1022
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:29,930
I haven't shown off my charms.

1023
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:31,430
Go ahead and show off your charms.

1024
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,139
(1st floor, Yoo Sik and Won Kyu's room)

1025
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:37,439
To be honest, there's someone I'm curious about.

1026
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,010
Okay. It's understandable.

1027
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,480
But...

1028
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:45,280
I don't want to hurt anyone.

1029
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,520
It's like that.

1030
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:49,890
What are you saying?

1031
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,560
I really hope my choice doesn't overlap...

1032
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:58,990
with anyone's.

1033
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,930
That'll be impossible.

1034
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:03,870
That'll be impossible.

1035
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:07,040
If that woman is...

1036
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,610
very charming,

1037
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:14,510
someone else might become interested.

1038
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,180
But I hope that doesn't happen.

1039
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,720
Because...

1040
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,750
I don't want things to get awkward either.

1041
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:27,759
You're right. But the thing is, the person you're interested in...

1042
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,759
is someone's ex-girlfriend.

1043
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,560
True. That's what...

1044
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:34,530
- bothers me the most.
- Of course.

1045
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,330
If I were to notice...

1046
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:40,300
whose ex she was...

1047
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:45,980
I know that I'd become extremely self-conscious...

1048
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:48,540
around that ex.

1049
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,149
I thought the roommate...

1050
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:54,420
turning out to be the ex would be the worst-case scenario.

1051
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,490
But...

1052
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,260
- What can be done?
- Are you serious?

1053
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:02,729
No, right?

1054
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:04,790
What? I don't know. I swear I don't.

1055
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:06,329
I'm simply talking about you.

1056
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:07,500
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1057
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:09,030
After all, you're serious.

1058
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:14,770
- Hey, friend.
- Yes?

1059
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,079
Got it. Let's go over there.

1060
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,249
(Ji Hyeon asks to talk to Baek Hyun.)

1061
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:24,280
What is it?

1062
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:30,450
Hi, hello.

1063
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:31,950
What is it?

1064
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:36,530
I'm curious about Yoo Sik.

1065
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,300
Yoo Sik? I see. So what about him?

1066
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:44,000
Do you think he's not interested in you right now?

1067
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:46,170
He was interested in me.

1068
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:47,670
Was he?

1069
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:50,269
We kept texting each other.

1070
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:51,969
Did it stop all of a sudden?

1071
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:53,140
No, it didn't, but...

1072
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,150
This is the source of my delusion.

1073
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:01,280
I'll tell you from my perspective, okay?

1074
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,819
What came up during my chat with Yoo Sik...

1075
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,220
over drinks was that I said,

1076
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:10,390
"I've only dated older guys."

1077
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:13,059
"I don't like younger guys."

1078
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:15,160
I said that multiple times.

1079
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:17,970
When the card arrived today,

1080
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:19,999
everyone was going on about...

1081
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,740
how it was about our age.

1082
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:26,640
Yoo Sik said that he didn't want to look at it. It was out of the blue.

1083
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:29,980
Was it because he was self-conscious around me?

1084
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,619
Was it because he's younger than me?

1085
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:37,090
If it's not through text messages, there's no other way to know...

1086
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,919
if we have feelings for each other.

1087
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:39,990
Of course not.

1088
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:41,420
Did you not get a text?

1089
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:42,930
No, not today.

1090
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:44,930
But Yoo Sik...

1091
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,329
went on a date today...

1092
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,029
and could've had a great time.

1093
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:52,270
- Right.
- Or maybe he has feelings for her.

1094
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:54,870
But I'm not sure. That's why...

1095
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:59,379
I want to know what you two talked about...

1096
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,980
and such.

1097
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,810
But if Yoo Sik really has feelings for you...

1098
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:06,449
He said he didn't care about...

1099
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:08,020
- the age gap.
- Exactly,

1100
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,749
and that just makes it more confusing.

1101
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:12,420
Honestly, I...

1102
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:17,189
It's up to you to decide.

1103
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:18,529
What I should do?

1104
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:20,629
Yes. Do what makes you happy.

1105
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:21,759
Like you said,

1106
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,930
- So I should do as I please?
- a certain...

1107
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:26,600
Your happiness is what matters.

1108
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:30,869
- Like that?
- She's asking for help?

1109
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:32,509
- Is she asking for help?
- She wants to team up.

1110
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:34,379
The two have become real friends.

1111
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:35,509
Really?

1112
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:37,409
- They've become best friends.
- They're best friends.

1113
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:38,949
They became close after revealing their ages.

1114
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:41,079
At first, we thought they were exes...

1115
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,689
because of their great chemistry.

1116
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:44,149
- Yes.
- Exactly, at the beginning.

1117
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:46,759
In a way, Ji Hyeon is incredible.

1118
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,059
She's quick to act.

1119
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:50,259
Ji Hyeon never sits still.

1120
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,659
- She's all action, not just words.
- Right?

1121
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,529
The type who goes after what she wants.

1122
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,329
Yes, Ji Hyeon said she's a conqueror.

1123
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:57,399
I was wondering why we didn't have a scene like that.

1124
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,029
- In my mind, - Yes?

1125
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:00,339
If you were to move into a place like that,

1126
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:02,069
- You'd ask the guys.
- you'd definitely end up...

1127
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:03,809
- with a guy friend.
- That's right.

1128
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:05,169
Nice. I didn't expect to see a scene...

1129
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:06,180
- I know.
- like that in EXchange.

1130
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:12,919
Honestly, there's a handful of people we need to care about.

1131
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,580
Exactly, it's a handful.

1132
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:16,850
Yes?

1133
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:20,589
- You're here.
- I'm here too.

1134
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,990
(Baek Hyun and Ji Hyeon visit the 1st-floor male's room.)

1135
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:24,390
- May I take a seat?
- Yes, please.

1136
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:25,560
Make yourself comfortable.

1137
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,000
You can sit on the bed.

1138
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:31,169
- We only have Chungha.
- What were you two doing in here?

1139
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:32,329
What time is it?

1140
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:34,299
It's 2:55am. It's not that late.

1141
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:36,110
For three hours, we've been...

1142
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:37,710
What were you two doing?

1143
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,840
- It's been three hours?
- Yes.

1144
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:42,410
To think I'd join such a party.

1145
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,520
I'll get more drinks.

1146
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,820
- No, I'll do it.
- Let me.

1147
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:53,690
We're drinking more than I imagined.

1148
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:58,790
- I'm going to get my lip tint.
- Okay.

1149
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:20,220
(She waits for Yoo Sik as if nothing happened.)

1150
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:23,720
(Yoo Sik goes downstairs with some drinks.)

1151
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:31,959
- Hey, what's wrong?
- What?

1152
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,499
- What's wrong?
- With what?

1153
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,730
- Why are you sad?
- I'm not sad.

1154
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,730
Where are you going?

1155
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:40,969
- To find you.
- To find me?

1156
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:42,970
I stopped by the bathroom before getting these.

1157
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,340
You go first.

1158
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:50,379
Go first? You're not coming?

1159
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,380
In a bit.

1160
00:55:58,250 --> 00:55:59,490
It must've been a surprise.

1161
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:04,860
After chatting with everyone,

1162
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:08,899
I got the feeling that I might be the youngest.

1163
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,000
- Yes?
- Yes?

1164
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:12,399
- That's why...
- I see.

1165
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,939
(Ji Hyeon comes in after a while.)

1166
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,400
I hoped I wasn't.

1167
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,939
I'd love to change it if I could.

1168
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:19,039
What? Your age?

1169
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,080
Yes.

1170
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:22,509
- Earlier...
- I would change it right away.

1171
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:24,610
I asked Won Kyu if he wanted to switch ages.

1172
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:26,380
Why do you want to change it?

1173
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:30,490
I feel like an outsider.

1174
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:33,659
- But...
- That means I'm an outsider too.

1175
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:35,259
No, I'm normally close...

1176
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:37,330
- with those younger than me.
- You two are polar ends.

1177
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:39,429
Being the youngest here...

1178
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,460
has a different meaning.

1179
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:44,300
I didn't want to look like the youngest either.

1180
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:48,440
But that's not to us.

1181
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:51,469
That's to the girl you're interested in.

1182
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:54,410
True, but everyone feels like that.

1183
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:56,910
Why are you drinking alone?

1184
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:59,080
Is this yours, Ji Hyeon?

1185
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,550
Why did you give me so much?

1186
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:02,250
Drink it in bits.

1187
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:03,950
You can drink it in bits.

1188
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:05,520
Since you're here, drink.

1189
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:12,390
- What should we get?
- Yes?

1190
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,399
(One more person has joined.)

1191
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,169
How did we end up gathering again?

1192
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:18,530
Why this room?

1193
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,070
What were you all doing here?

1194
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,640
It's just...

1195
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,070
- Yes?
- Yes?

1196
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,069
(Ji Yeon also dropped by.)

1197
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:26,640
- Come in.
- Come in.

1198
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:28,780
Seriously, I'm kind of happy right now.

1199
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:31,080
To think that a lot of people can come in here.

1200
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:32,709
(The room is crowded now.)

1201
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:34,520
(I only have eyes on you)

1202
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:38,250
Kyu.

1203
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,190
- Yes?
- Yes?

1204
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,289
(Yun Nyeong has also come.)

1205
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:45,959
- Come in.
- Hurry up, my friend.

1206
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,229
Gather up.

1207
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:48,359
- Come.
- My friend.

1208
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:49,459
This is wild.

1209
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:50,469
This bed is about to sink.

1210
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:52,729
Why are there so many people here?

1211
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:54,170
- Come.
- If you want to drink, get a glass.

1212
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:56,640
Today is the Renaissance time of this room.

1213
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:58,769
Would you like some?

1214
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:00,139
- What?
- Would you like some?

1215
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:01,939
I thought nobody was interested in this room.

1216
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:03,079
- A glass?
- No.

1217
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,080
- I'm good.
- Same.

1218
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:06,450
What? Again?

1219
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:08,879
Is that a must-visit place or what?

1220
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,520
What was the point of renting such a big house?

1221
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:14,519
- Rent an inn next time.
- Exactly.

1222
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:15,790
- An inn is more than enough.
- Yes.

1223
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:17,890
It does look cozy.

1224
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:21,060
(4th floor, Min Kyung, Ji Hyeon, and Hyeon Ji's room)

1225
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:25,000
I think my date has a lot on his mind.

1226
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:28,770
Is that so?

1227
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:34,010
It looked like he was trying to focus on that day's date.

1228
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:38,650
But did he seem distracted?

1229
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:42,520
He seems preoccupied once we get back.

1230
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:44,620
Really?

1231
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:51,060
Seeing his ex in a tough spot must be bothering him.

1232
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:53,130
I think he cares about his ex.

1233
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:01,600
(With mixed feelings, she goes to bed.)

1234
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,539
(The 1st-floor male's room is still bustling...)

1235
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,670
(with Yoo Sik, Yun Nyeong, Won Kyu, Jae Hyeong, and Ji Yeon.)

1236
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,070
All your clothes are pretty.

1237
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:08,180
- I just...
- She's good at styling clothes.

1238
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:09,810
- Really?
- Yes.

1239
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:12,180
- Gosh.
- Did you major in that field?

1240
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:14,679
- I majored in design.
- Did you tell us already?

1241
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:15,879
I can tell you're not interested in me.

1242
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,020
I'm sorry.

1243
00:59:18,290 --> 00:59:19,989
- No, I remember.
- Cheers.

1244
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:20,990
Here.

1245
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:22,820
Are you really into clothes?

1246
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,360
Of course.

1247
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:25,930
- That's cool.
- Why?

1248
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:28,359
Because I'm not interested in them at all.

1249
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,799
It doesn't look like it.

1250
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,599
Give me the ADERERROR top.

1251
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,069
I don't mind giving it to you.

1252
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,369
- Really? Then give it to me.
- Yes.

1253
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:36,769
- But isn't it too big?
- Take it.

1254
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:37,770
Promise me.

1255
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:40,410
- I'm serious.
- Can I really wear it?

1256
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,049
- Stop lying.
- No, you can actually wear it.

1257
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:44,409
- Then I'm taking it out.
- Jae Hyeong, where are you going?

1258
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:45,450
Where are you going?

1259
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:46,850
- What?
- Don't go.

1260
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,679
- I'll be right back.
- Are you two dating?

1261
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,519
This room suddenly isn't popular anymore.

1262
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,049
I'm going to take the ADERERROR top out.

1263
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:53,590
Go ahead. Give me a second.

1264
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:55,360
Give me something too.

1265
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:57,059
- What?
- Give me something too.

1266
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:58,689
- What?
- Give me something too.

1267
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:00,959
- No, but I... Me?
- It might be too big.

1268
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,030
- Let me try it on.
- You weren't asking Yoo Sik?

1269
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:07,640
He's giving one away. You should too.

1270
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:09,140
I see.

1271
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:12,939
But there's something that'd look good on you.

1272
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:14,309
Really? Then give it to me.

1273
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:16,139
- Right now.
- Wear it when you want to.

1274
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:17,309
- Really?
- Yes.

1275
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:18,879
Got it. Then I'm borrowing it for a day.

1276
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,880
- I'm serious.
- Isn't it big?

1277
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:21,980
It is.

1278
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,420
But it looks good.

1279
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:26,690
- No, I...
- It suits me. It's just my top.

1280
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:29,390
- It's actually nice.
- It's totally my style.

1281
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:32,189
All of a sudden...

1282
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:34,900
- What's with your outfit?
- You're giving it to me, right?

1283
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:38,069
I've always had my eye on this top.

1284
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:39,169
You did?

1285
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:42,400
(Ji Yeon goes straight to her room with Won Kyu's top.)

1286
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,590
- Ji Hyeon.
- I have a certain style.

1287
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,990
What's your favorite brand, Ji Hyeon?

1288
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:02,419
Me? I don't really have one.

1289
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:03,629
Thanks for the top.

1290
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:06,060
- I like street brands.
- Did you actually take it?

1291
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,459
You gave it to me.

1292
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:08,759
I actually don't know much about brands.

1293
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,229
You said it'd look good on me.

1294
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:11,430
- Really?
- What?

1295
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:13,199
- How do you know so well?
- Jae Hyeong is back.

1296
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,640
- I brought beer.
- I really don't.

1297
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:18,440
I thought it'd be best to have even numbers.

1298
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:20,180
Do you think it'll look good on me?

1299
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:22,280
That one there?

1300
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:23,909
I think it will.

1301
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:25,950
I'll make sure to wear the top.

1302
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:29,349
- It suits you.
- Doesn't it?

1303
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:30,489
It's yours now.

1304
01:01:30,490 --> 01:01:33,020
Wear it whenever you want.

1305
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,059
- Won Kyu, - Yes?

1306
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:36,460
A tissue, please.

1307
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,630
- One for me too.
- You only like ADERERROR.

1308
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:46,469
- By the way, - It's awkward.

1309
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:49,199
- What?
- that top is special to me.

1310
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,569
- Okay. I'll take good care of it.
- For real.

1311
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:53,480
- I really will.
- Good.

1312
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:03,220
- Do you have water?
- Regardless of the age...

1313
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,819
- No, there's no water.
- I thought we were the same age.

1314
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:07,160
- Really?
- Shall we go get some?

1315
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:09,060
- Am I too drunk?
- Yes.

1316
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:11,490
- I'll go get some.
- Let me tag along.

1317
01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:16,330
Where are you going?

1318
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:19,500
I'm too drunk. That's what she said.

1319
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:28,780
You don't have to get up.

1320
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,780
On someone else's bed?

1321
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:37,890
(A night with mixed feelings roiling)

1322
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:43,290
Didn't you text me because you wanted to talk to me?

1323
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:46,059
Honestly, it kept bugging me.

1324
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:47,060
Why?

1325
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:49,929
It's just that being here makes me...

1326
01:02:49,930 --> 01:02:52,370
- uncomfortable.
- Take a seat.

1327
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:54,200
That's why,

1328
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,910
- no matter who it was, - Yes?

1329
01:02:57,270 --> 01:02:59,570
I didn't join any drinking get-togethers.

1330
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,310
Yoo Sik was pretty upset too.

1331
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:06,720
We decided to drink, just the two of us.

1332
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,520
We were having a small drinking party.

1333
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:12,049
But it suddenly turned out like that.

1334
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:13,090
I see.

1335
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:15,590
I wanted to see you,

1336
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:19,860
- not for any special reason.
- Right.

1337
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:23,029
I just wanted to talk to you more in person.

1338
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:26,170
- You wanted to talk more?
- Yes. That's why I texted you.

1339
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:29,570
- That was what happened.
- Really?

1340
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:30,710
Yes.

1341
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:34,210
But the others...

1342
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:38,480
- noticed I was too drunk.
- I see.

1343
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:41,679
And at that point, I realized I really was drunk.

1344
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,020
Drink some water.

1345
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:52,230
What is it?

1346
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:54,760
You're funny.

1347
01:03:55,930 --> 01:03:58,199
You might hate it.

1348
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,800
- You might.
- I don't.

1349
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,570
- Here's the biggest problem.
- Yes?

1350
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,640
I didn't even realize I was slurring my words.

1351
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:08,040
But in fact, I was.

1352
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:12,880
(Won Kyu is worried about how he'll be tomorrow.)

1353
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,749
Were you upset today?

1354
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:17,720
- Yes, I was.
- Why?

1355
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:20,889
I was kind of conscious...

1356
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:23,190
- Conscious of your ex?
- of my ex.

1357
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:29,560
Because I was conscious of her,

1358
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:32,670
- I was upset.
- Were you?

1359
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:36,400
Right. I don't blame you for that.

1360
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:40,509
You mind your ex more than before, right?

1361
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:41,580
I do.

1362
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,880
And so, I wanted...

1363
01:04:46,410 --> 01:04:48,880
to see you as soon as possible...

1364
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,550
to talk...

1365
01:04:50,650 --> 01:04:53,219
and shake off all those negative feelings.

1366
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:55,060
That's what went through my mind.

1367
01:04:55,790 --> 01:04:57,960
Same here. When I talk to you,

1368
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,459
I barely think about my ex.

1369
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:01,730
- Really?
- Yes.

1370
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:05,430
Drink a bit more water.

1371
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,070
Was it fun today?

1372
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:11,340
To be honest,

1373
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:14,740
- there were fun bits.
- I see.

1374
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:19,480
But overall, it wasn't that enjoyable.

1375
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,680
I had a lot of fun today.

1376
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,420
That's only natural.

1377
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:28,020
But I find hanging out with you way more fun.

1378
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:32,390
- But you said you had fun.
- What?

1379
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,369
He's become talkative after drinking.

1380
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:41,639
Won Kyu gets charming.

1381
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,639
He must look cute in Ji Yeon's eyes.

1382
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:46,009
It's kind of cute when a normally quiet guy...

1383
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:48,080
opens up like that after getting drunk.

1384
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:51,150
Why are you so sad?

1385
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,580
Why are you so sad?

1386
01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:54,280
- Me?
- Yes.

1387
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,390
I don't think it's because of me.

1388
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:00,620
- It's just that...
- Yes?

1389
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:04,330
What I hoped wouldn't happen ended up happening.

1390
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:06,660
It's okay to be younger.

1391
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:09,930
- Yes, it's okay, but...
- Do you want to be older?

1392
01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:12,400
At least here,

1393
01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:13,969
- I hoped...
- You didn't want to be...

1394
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,000
the youngest, but you are?

1395
01:06:16,270 --> 01:06:17,840
If by any chance...

1396
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:22,740
you're feeling that way because of me,

1397
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,650
I want to say don't.

1398
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:28,020
But if you're feeling like that toward everyone...

1399
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:33,089
It's okay...

1400
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:34,289
(Ji Hyeon cares about Yoo Sik, while he cares about everyone.)

1401
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:35,790
to be the youngest.

1402
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:40,630
Would you like some ramyeon?

1403
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:42,400
I think I should eat one.

1404
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:44,169
- Do you want ramyeon?
- Yes.

1405
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:46,300
Should I cook one? Should I pour the water in?

1406
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:48,600
- Yes.
- Okay.

1407
01:06:49,770 --> 01:06:51,140
You should've said so earlier.

1408
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:54,980
I didn't think I'd get this drunk.

1409
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:57,750
Would you like one too?

1410
01:06:58,810 --> 01:06:59,850
It's still there.

1411
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:03,590
(After ordering one ramyeon, Won Kyu disappears leisurely.)

1412
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:08,760
(His destination is the guys' room on the 1st floor.)

1413
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:11,830
Are you talking?

1414
01:07:11,831 --> 01:07:13,360
(Yoo Sik and Ji Hyeon are talking alone in the room.)

1415
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:16,130
Should I leave?

1416
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:18,970
Feel free to do what you want.

1417
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:21,669
Seriously?

1418
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:23,300
(He goes right back out.)

1419
01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:25,140
What's wrong with him?

1420
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:36,279
(My ex and my roommate are...)

1421
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:40,490
(alone in my room.)

1422
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:52,500
(Won Kyu can't leave the area.)

1423
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,800
- What are you eating again?
- It took a long time.

1424
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:57,140
Is everyone drinking downstairs?

1425
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,069
Things are starting to wind down.

1426
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:00,070
Really?

1427
01:08:00,071 --> 01:08:01,739
Won Kyu seems quite drunk.

1428
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:02,940
Won Kyu? Really?

1429
01:08:05,310 --> 01:08:08,850
(Won Kyu is still pacing around on the 1st floor.)

1430
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:19,390
What is it?

1431
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:22,959
- It's nothing.
- What are you doing?

1432
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,029
Where did you go?

1433
01:08:24,030 --> 01:08:26,000
(Won Kyu comes back into the room.)

1434
01:08:26,030 --> 01:08:27,040
Don't be jealous.

1435
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:30,310
What?

1436
01:08:30,670 --> 01:08:35,980
- You told me to make ramyeon.
- What?

1437
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,450
You told me to add water to the ramyeon.

1438
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:40,480
Gosh, what?

1439
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:43,220
- When did you come downstairs?
- I didn't know.

1440
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,219
- When did you come downstairs?
- Was it delicious?

1441
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:46,449
Okay.

1442
01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:48,120
It's chaotic here.

1443
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:49,260
It's chaotic.

1444
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:51,890
That's why no one should sleep.

1445
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:58,500
(She feels tangled up in confusion.)

1446
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:02,370
I want to talk to Yun Nyeong.

1447
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:04,710
- With Yun Nyeong?
- She's taking a shower.

1448
01:09:04,810 --> 01:09:07,180
- I'll go and wash up too.
- Yes, when you come back...

1449
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:12,650
- What? I...
- Won Kyu.

1450
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:19,050
What's wrong?

1451
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:21,660
- Is it because I'm drunk?
- No.

1452
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:23,990
No?

1453
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:26,230
You told me to pour water in the ramyeon.

1454
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:27,959
Do I have to come and find you?

1455
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,960
No, that's not it. I thought...

1456
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:33,800
So this is... Never mind, I'm sorry.

1457
01:09:35,370 --> 01:09:36,800
This situation makes me laugh.

1458
01:09:37,910 --> 01:09:38,940
It's funny.

1459
01:09:46,510 --> 01:09:47,820
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1460
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:51,490
What time is it now?

1461
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:54,890
It's 4:30am.

1462
01:09:58,290 --> 01:10:01,530
(He enjoys it even though it's 4:30am.)

1463
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:16,810
Isn't it funny that we're eating at 4:30am?

1464
01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:20,049
If I get into a relationship with you,

1465
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:23,990
I would gain 10kg in 2 months.

1466
01:10:25,690 --> 01:10:26,850
You could lose weight.

1467
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:28,690
I don't think so.

1468
01:10:30,790 --> 01:10:33,730
While eating ramyeon, he said in a slurred voice,

1469
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:37,530
"If I go out with you, I'd gain 10kg."

1470
01:10:38,330 --> 01:10:39,670
I was surprised when I heard that.

1471
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:44,870
It's not something you can say thoughtlessly.

1472
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:50,180
It made me feel good when I heard it.

1473
01:10:52,510 --> 01:10:54,679
His comment isn't totally innocent.

1474
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:57,489
This will definitely break Ji Hyeon's heart.

1475
01:10:57,490 --> 01:10:58,919
Isn't he the first resident to say...

1476
01:10:58,920 --> 01:10:59,949
- something like that?
- He is.

1477
01:10:59,950 --> 01:11:01,659
He became more daring because he was drunk.

1478
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:03,459
The look between them...

1479
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:05,359
Isn't it more pleasant to hear it from someone drunk?

1480
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,599
- He's being honest.
- Yes, drunk and honest.

1481
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,999
Also, you usually gain weight...

1482
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,729
- when you're happy.
- Right.

1483
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:13,999
"If I go out with you, I'd be happy."

1484
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,599
Isn't that what he's saying?

1485
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,469
- Of course.
- He's not simply joking.

1486
01:11:17,470 --> 01:11:19,469
Right. Tonight will be long.

1487
01:11:19,470 --> 01:11:20,540
This is so much fun.

1488
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:23,910
(They finished their private ramyeon date.)

1489
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:25,879
- Are you done?
- Yes.

1490
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:26,880
Let's go.

1491
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:28,950
Where are we going?

1492
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:30,890
You should go to bed.

1493
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:34,990
Didn't you see what was going on in my room?

1494
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:36,720
Gosh, are you okay?

1495
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:40,090
It's okay.

1496
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:42,559
- It's okay.
- No.

1497
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,070
Just leave it.

1498
01:11:44,370 --> 01:11:47,499
Won Kyu, go downstairs for now.

1499
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:48,969
- No.
- Go downstairs.

1500
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:50,300
- No.
- Don't move.

1501
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:54,340
- We should use this.
- Yes, I'll take it out.

1502
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:57,949
- Oh, no.
- Wait.

1503
01:11:57,950 --> 01:12:00,920
I'll put the big pieces over there.

1504
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:03,150
- Wouldn't that be better?
- Okay.

1505
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:05,490
Can you wipe off the surface?

1506
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,420
Okay. It's good for now.

1507
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,360
Shall we go?

1508
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:12,759
Let's go.

1509
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:16,060
(After cleaning up together, they go down to the 1st floor.)

1510
01:12:23,570 --> 01:12:24,610
Baek Hyun.

1511
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:30,650
(Baek Hyun passes by without noticing Yun Nyeong.)

1512
01:12:31,550 --> 01:12:32,750
Mr. Sung Baek Hyun.

1513
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:35,180
Yes?

1514
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:40,119
Where are you going?

1515
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:41,620
- Do you want to go upstairs?
- What?

1516
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:43,690
- Do you want to go upstairs?
- Okay.

1517
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,530
Your outfit looks pretty.

1518
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:50,360
- Did you wash up thoroughly?
- Yes, definitely.

1519
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:53,969
- That's my bed.
- Really?

1520
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:55,570
- Make yourself at home.
- Okay.

1521
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:59,070
I completely picked the wrong person.

1522
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:02,140
I had no doubt even for a second.

1523
01:13:02,810 --> 01:13:03,810
Why not?

1524
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:05,550
I was sure that...

1525
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:08,750
Maybe I was blinded by something.

1526
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:11,090
- Did you want to pick mine?
- Of course.

1527
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:13,150
Which keyword did you pick?

1528
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:16,660
I picked the last one.

1529
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:23,970
My drinking habit is not falling asleep at all.

1530
01:13:25,230 --> 01:13:27,370
Who told you that and when?

1531
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:29,639
Do you want to get to know someone else...

1532
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:30,739
- No.
- Really?

1533
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:32,740
Yes, but feel free if you want to get to know someone.

1534
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:38,650
These days, I feel sure of myself.

1535
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:39,750
- Really?
- Yes.

1536
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:46,050
While I was on a date today,

1537
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:48,920
I wanted to be there with you.

1538
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,630
I kept thinking about you instead.

1539
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:57,060
I kept thinking, "Is she having fun? I really hope not."

1540
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:00,400
- I had fun.
- Oh, really?

1541
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:03,040
I'm glad to hear that.

1542
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:05,739
This is so funny.

1543
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:09,440
(They take one step closer to each other's heart.)

1544
01:14:12,950 --> 01:14:13,950
Yes?

1545
01:14:13,951 --> 01:14:15,750
(Someone comes to Ji Yeon's room.)

1546
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:18,389
- Hey.
- Can I come in?

1547
01:14:18,390 --> 01:14:19,719
Yes, I'm alone.

1548
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:22,720
Really? Then can you come out?

1549
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,329
- Do you want to go out?
- Let's go outside.

1550
01:14:24,330 --> 01:14:25,390
That sounds good.

1551
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:31,170
(They decide to spend more time in private.)

1552
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,509
This one isn't wet at all.

1553
01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:47,010
Really? That's good.

1554
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:54,060
(They spend time together while breathing in the air at dawn.)

1555
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:56,490
This is how it feels at this hour.

1556
01:14:57,220 --> 01:14:58,230
It's nice.

1557
01:15:04,730 --> 01:15:05,770
It's funny.

1558
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,140
I didn't expect it.

1559
01:15:10,910 --> 01:15:12,340
You didn't expect it?

1560
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:17,950
- I didn't expect myself to feel...
- Right.

1561
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:19,510
This strongly.

1562
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:23,720
It's already been a week.

1563
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:27,490
Won Kyu, time will fly by.

1564
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:29,160
- You think so?
- Yes.

1565
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:32,290
You should stop drinking.

1566
01:15:32,430 --> 01:15:33,529
- Me?
- Yes.

1567
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:36,529
- I...
- You're wasted today.

1568
01:15:36,530 --> 01:15:37,900
- It's that bad?
- Yes.

1569
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,729
You're completely wasted.

1570
01:15:39,730 --> 01:15:40,840
- Really?
- I've never seen you like this.

1571
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:45,210
I'm not saying that you look terrible.

1572
01:15:45,710 --> 01:15:47,980
- It's just unexpected and cute.
- Am I that drunk?

1573
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:50,710
- Am I that drunk?
- Yes, you are.

1574
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:54,920
I only drank a little, but I got red very quickly.

1575
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:59,020
Your tolerance isn't the same as when you're outside.

1576
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:00,690
In here, it's so...

1577
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:03,859
- That's why...
- Right.

1578
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:04,960
Wait.

1579
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:07,629
- Come.
- Can I talk...

1580
01:16:07,630 --> 01:16:08,899
to Ji Yeon for a minute?

1581
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:10,599
- Sure.
- I'm sorry.

1582
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,499
It's okay. Go ahead.

1583
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:13,669
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1584
01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:14,940
Don't be sorry.

1585
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:16,800
- I'm sorry.
- Talk to her.

1586
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:27,080
You don't mind me at all?

1587
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,950
- Is he angry?
- Gosh.

1588
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:33,249
That's how he felt.

1589
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:34,259
Is he being resentful?

1590
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:36,689
- Isn't he furious right now?
- Right.

1591
01:16:36,690 --> 01:16:40,059
Usually, people wouldn't interrupt like that.

1592
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:42,329
- He even asked Won Kyu to leave.
- Exactly.

1593
01:16:42,330 --> 01:16:43,699
- We've never seen this before.
- Right.

1594
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:45,669
He interrupted them in the middle...

1595
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:46,729
- of their conversation.
- It's never happened.

1596
01:16:46,730 --> 01:16:49,139
He asked if he could talk to her. We've never seen this happen.

1597
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:50,839
He didn't even knock.

1598
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:53,609
- Right. He opened up suddenly.
- He opened the door abruptly.

1599
01:16:53,610 --> 01:16:56,209
He must've gotten angry from seeing her act like that.

1600
01:16:56,210 --> 01:16:59,779
- When she took him out for ramyeon, - Right.

1601
01:16:59,780 --> 01:17:01,079
- the look on his face was serious.
- And she asked for a shirt.

1602
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:02,879
He didn't like it when she prepared ramyeon for him.

1603
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,089
He exploded with anger.

1604
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:05,390
He lost his temper.

1605
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:16,030
You don't mind me at all?

1606
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:19,099
Of course I do.

1607
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:20,430
Then why are you doing this?

1608
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:25,510
I went downstairs to talk to you,

1609
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:27,070
but I couldn't find you.

1610
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:32,950
(Woo Jin wanted to talk to Ji Yeon.)

1611
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:34,620
Do you like Won Kyu?

1612
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:36,980
Are you interested in him?

1613
01:17:39,090 --> 01:17:40,420
I'm asking you sincerely.

1614
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:45,559
To be honest, you're very different from what I expected.

1615
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:46,630
Me?

1616
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:51,370
I didn't expect you to act like this before coming here,

1617
01:17:51,470 --> 01:17:55,240
but it seems like you don't care about me at all.

1618
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,970
Seeing you talk to him at this hour makes me think...

1619
01:17:59,670 --> 01:18:01,610
that you're being sincere.

1620
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:04,750
I'm being honest.

1621
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:08,180
I was about to go to bed, but he asked me if we could talk.

1622
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:10,780
Right. You were about to go to bed.

1623
01:18:10,950 --> 01:18:12,089
If you weren't serious about him,

1624
01:18:12,090 --> 01:18:13,919
you could've said that you were tired and talked later.

1625
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,059
When everyone was together,

1626
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:18,159
- you two went out to eat ramyeon.
- Who isn't serious at this place?

1627
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:19,560
I'm asking if you're serious about him.

1628
01:18:20,590 --> 01:18:23,399
- Woo Jin.
- I'm asking you...

1629
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,030
seriously, Ji Yeon.

1630
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:29,269
I was talking to him because I feel serious about him.

1631
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:30,370
So you're serious?

1632
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:33,970
You're disappointing.

1633
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:39,909
I thought that you'd care about me...

1634
01:18:39,910 --> 01:18:42,350
and be considerate of me.

1635
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:44,520
At least in front of me...

1636
01:18:44,690 --> 01:18:46,319
I already told you.

1637
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,260
I don't mind my ex.

1638
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:51,289
Neither do I mind the ex of someone I'm interested in.

1639
01:18:51,290 --> 01:18:53,660
I'll be true to my feelings.

1640
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:56,500
Didn't I tell you that during our preliminary meeting?

1641
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,270
Yes, you did.

1642
01:18:58,870 --> 01:19:00,199
But I thought...

1643
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,070
Am I not being considerate of you in my behavior?

1644
01:19:03,970 --> 01:19:05,170
That's how I feel.

1645
01:19:05,870 --> 01:19:08,709
I understand...

1646
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:12,979
that you're acting based on how you feel.

1647
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:15,619
But why do I feel like you're scolding me?

1648
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:16,780
I'm not scolding you.

1649
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:18,520
The look in your eyes is scary.

1650
01:19:18,950 --> 01:19:22,020
I've been surprised ever since you came out here.

1651
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:26,389
You look very angry.

1652
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:29,060
I came downstairs to talk to you, but you weren't there.

1653
01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:31,400
When I saw you out here...

1654
01:19:31,630 --> 01:19:34,370
I had no idea that you wanted to talk to me.

1655
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,270
I understand.

1656
01:19:37,570 --> 01:19:40,240
When everyone was drinking together,

1657
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:42,610
you went out alone with him to eat ramyeon.

1658
01:19:43,410 --> 01:19:46,680
I thought, "Does she have to make it obvious in front of me?"

1659
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:50,580
Am I on your mind a lot?

1660
01:19:51,150 --> 01:19:52,320
- You?
- Yes.

1661
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:53,820
Isn't it obvious?

1662
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:56,660
I won't do it anymore.

1663
01:19:57,290 --> 01:19:58,690
I'll be considerate of you.

1664
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:01,900
So you'll just do it when I'm not around?

1665
01:20:06,370 --> 01:20:07,530
- Woo Jin.
- What?

1666
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:09,699
You're scaring me.

1667
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:12,869
- I'm not scolding you, but...
- It feels like you're scolding me.

1668
01:20:12,870 --> 01:20:14,239
I'm not scolding you.

1669
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:16,310
This is what we came here to do.

1670
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:26,150
I feel flustered every time you act like this.

1671
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:32,789
I wouldn't barge in on your conversation...

1672
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:34,529
and try to talk to you while looking angry.

1673
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:36,659
I didn't look angry.

1674
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:38,129
You clearly looked angry.

1675
01:20:38,130 --> 01:20:39,830
That's why I was so startled.

1676
01:20:47,810 --> 01:20:50,510
- There's no one.
- They're there.

1677
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:56,149
(Without finishing their conversation, )

1678
01:20:56,150 --> 01:21:00,320
(both of them leave.)

1679
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:06,260
(It's confusing as relationships get more complicated.)

1680
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:09,329
I'm sure that many people agree.

1681
01:21:09,330 --> 01:21:12,869
There are definitely people who are on Woo Jin's side.

1682
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:14,439
- Right.
- "She's being inconsiderate."

1683
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:16,699
Some might think, "Does she have to make it obvious?"

1684
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:17,809
However, it can't be helped.

1685
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:19,209
This is what our show is about,

1686
01:21:19,210 --> 01:21:20,210
and it can happen.

1687
01:21:20,211 --> 01:21:23,910
It must feel unfamiliar to see his ex getting along with someone new,

1688
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:25,179
but that's still not right.

1689
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:27,149
I can understand how Woo Jin feels,

1690
01:21:27,150 --> 01:21:28,779
- Right, but his approach...
- but his approach...

1691
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:31,089
He could've talked to her in a different way.

1692
01:21:31,090 --> 01:21:34,249
I agree. He acts like he holds authority over her.

1693
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:36,589
He accused Ji Yeon of breaking rules.

1694
01:21:36,590 --> 01:21:38,889
Like Ji Yeon said, he talked to her...

1695
01:21:38,890 --> 01:21:40,589
like he was scolding her.

1696
01:21:40,590 --> 01:21:43,029
What he did will disappoint Ji Yeon.

1697
01:21:43,030 --> 01:21:44,929
- She'll get over him more easily.
- Right.

1698
01:21:44,930 --> 01:21:46,869
We can understand how he feels, but what he did was wrong.

1699
01:21:46,870 --> 01:21:47,999
- Right.
- Yes.

1700
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,139
- Tonight is no joke.
- This is crazy.

1701
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:51,740
It's very intense.

1702
01:21:52,270 --> 01:21:53,670
We already broke up.

1703
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:58,850
I never said that I wanted to get back...

1704
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,279
with my ex.

1705
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:02,320
I'm completely over him, and I want to meet someone new.

1706
01:22:02,650 --> 01:22:04,989
I never made my ex confused...

1707
01:22:04,990 --> 01:22:06,520
even for a moment.

1708
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,120
But he keeps scolding me.

1709
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:14,459
His behavior really disappointed me,

1710
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:17,360
and it also made me angry.

1711
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:19,570
I felt bad toward Won Kyu.

1712
01:22:20,730 --> 01:22:23,240
So I felt very upset.

1713
01:22:26,140 --> 01:22:27,670
I shouldn't have done it.

1714
01:22:29,610 --> 01:22:31,610
However, I got very emotional.

1715
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:36,020
It was intense.

1716
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:40,220
I thought that I'd made a mistake.

1717
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:45,590
I could've offended Won Kyu,

1718
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:47,190
so I went to see him.

1719
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:51,270
(Woo Jin came to see Won Kyu.)

1720
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,439
- What?
- Can you come out for a minute?

1721
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:56,640
- Me?
- Yes.

1722
01:22:57,670 --> 01:22:58,710
I'm very sorry.

1723
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:05,410
(Woo Jin asked Won Kyu to talk to him.)

1724
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:11,920
But why...

1725
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:21,400
- I'm very sorry.
- About what?

1726
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:22,630
It's because...

1727
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:26,330
I'm very sorry.

1728
01:23:27,330 --> 01:23:29,740
It's hard for me...

1729
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,039
to control my feelings...

1730
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:34,480
especially after drinking.

1731
01:23:35,810 --> 01:23:37,949
All of a sudden, I got emotional...

1732
01:23:37,950 --> 01:23:39,850
from the hard things I went through.

1733
01:23:40,350 --> 01:23:41,350
And so,

1734
01:23:41,351 --> 01:23:43,179
when I thought about how I came across to you,

1735
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:47,589
I realized that I had made a huge mistake.

1736
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:48,790
I couldn't stop thinking that.

1737
01:23:51,130 --> 01:23:53,560
I really wanted to apologize to you from the bottom of my heart.

1738
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:54,860
It's okay.

1739
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:58,270
I mean it. I wasn't offended.

1740
01:23:59,670 --> 01:24:02,539
It's okay. Even if I was angry,

1741
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:04,170
you apologized to me.

1742
01:24:04,270 --> 01:24:05,510
I'm fine.

1743
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:08,480
It's all right.

1744
01:24:10,780 --> 01:24:13,680
In a way, I'm grateful for your apology.

1745
01:24:17,890 --> 01:24:19,320
It's morning now.

1746
01:24:19,620 --> 01:24:21,119
Aren't you sleepy? Should we get up...

1747
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,390
- and go downstairs?
- Let's go.

1748
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:24,190
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

1749
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:26,330
I'll go back to being myself then.

1750
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:27,929
- Yes. Be yourself.
- Okay.

1751
01:24:27,930 --> 01:24:31,570
(He went to sleep after delivering a sincere apology.)

1752
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:35,899
I'm glad he apologized to Won Kyu.

1753
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:37,939
He realized what he did was wrong. That's good.

1754
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:40,309
Woo Jin regretted it too. His emotions got the better of him.

1755
01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:42,439
- Everyone gets carried away once.
- Of course.

1756
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:43,479
- I can understand that.
- It happens to everyone.

1757
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:45,049
It's impossible not to get carried away in there.

1758
01:24:45,050 --> 01:24:46,449
That's right. Seriously.

1759
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:48,579
People get aggressive when they drink too.

1760
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:49,619
- Right.
- And they get emotional too.

1761
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:51,050
- Right.
- They become honest too.

1762
01:24:58,230 --> 01:25:01,130
(9:22am: Min Kyung wakes up.)

1763
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:05,470
(9:43am: Yoo Sik wakes up.)

1764
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:09,040
(10:24am: Baek Hyun and Woo Jin wake up.)

1765
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:17,040
(Sighing)

1766
01:25:18,210 --> 01:25:19,409
Out of all days,

1767
01:25:19,410 --> 01:25:20,910
- you look the most tired.
- Today?

1768
01:25:21,980 --> 01:25:23,380
I am tired indeed.

1769
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:26,020
Something came over you yesterday.

1770
01:25:26,150 --> 01:25:27,549
- Something came over me.
- Right.

1771
01:25:27,550 --> 01:25:29,789
I used up my energy last night when I got so emotional.

1772
01:25:29,790 --> 01:25:30,790
Exactly.

1773
01:25:32,230 --> 01:25:34,130
This is bad. I'm out of energy.

1774
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:36,330
I should fix that.

1775
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:39,830
Why? That was also you, being yourself.

1776
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:45,410
I realize my mistakes when I sober up.

1777
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:48,680
But my emotions get the better of me when I drink.

1778
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:52,349
- Emotional Woo Jin.
- What?

1779
01:25:52,350 --> 01:25:54,050
- Emotional Woo Jin.
- Emotional Woo Jin.

1780
01:25:57,550 --> 01:25:59,850
(Sighing)

1781
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:04,990
(While Woo Jin is regretting what he did last night...)

1782
01:26:05,390 --> 01:26:07,290
(Yun Nyeong and Ji Yeon's room on the 1st floor)

1783
01:26:07,490 --> 01:26:10,300
I saw a side of my ex that I hated last night.

1784
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:12,629
I had the worst night yesterday.

1785
01:26:12,630 --> 01:26:13,670
Why?

1786
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:19,469
I thought he and I talked enough yesterday.

1787
01:26:19,470 --> 01:26:21,740
- But he wanted to talk more.
- Who?

1788
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:24,009
- The guy I'm interested in.
- Okay.

1789
01:26:24,010 --> 01:26:26,949
So he wanted to talk some more outside.

1790
01:26:26,950 --> 01:26:28,250
- That's what we were doing.
- Okay.

1791
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:30,480
Then my ex barged in all of a sudden.

1792
01:26:31,590 --> 01:26:35,060
My ex asked him to leave because he wanted to talk to me.

1793
01:26:35,620 --> 01:26:36,959
- He suddenly wanted to talk to you?
- That was so sudden.

1794
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:39,030
- Had he gone mad?
- That came out of nowhere.

1795
01:26:39,330 --> 01:26:41,090
He and I were in the middle of our conversation.

1796
01:26:41,190 --> 01:26:42,300
My gosh. That's crazy.

1797
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:44,999
Can you understand what he did?

1798
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,069
No, not at all.

1799
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:48,340
- He was so rude.
- That was really rude. Yes.

1800
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:50,739
My ex was so rude to him. I could put up with what he did.

1801
01:26:50,740 --> 01:26:52,469
- I can talk to him about it later.
- Yes.

1802
01:26:52,470 --> 01:26:54,539
But he was being so rude to the guy I was talking to.

1803
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:56,639
Exactly. Did something come over him?

1804
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:58,210
I think that's what happened.

1805
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:00,010
That was quite sudden.

1806
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:04,990
That's why I should wear something comfortable today.

1807
01:27:05,790 --> 01:27:07,949
I'll wear the short-sleeve shirt...

1808
01:27:07,950 --> 01:27:10,320
- I took from Won Kyu.
- A short-sleeve shirt.

1809
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:12,860
Won Kyu is so sweet.

1810
01:27:13,190 --> 01:27:14,259
Isn't he so innocent?

1811
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:16,800
Yes. He's so sweet and innocent.

1812
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:19,570
It was so funny when he got drunk...

1813
01:27:20,530 --> 01:27:21,700
last night.

1814
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:24,170
He just looked more innocent. It made me like him more.

1815
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:26,170
He was even more innocent when he got drunk.

1816
01:27:26,570 --> 01:27:27,570
Right.

1817
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:34,750
Oh, I didn't mean it like that. I liked him more as a person.

1818
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,120
- Seriously.
- Hey.

1819
01:27:37,650 --> 01:27:40,150
- I must be losing myself.
- No need to cover it up now.

1820
01:27:50,230 --> 01:27:54,570
(Min Kyung comes down to have breakfast.)

1821
01:27:58,710 --> 01:27:59,940
Aren't you going to eat breakfast?

1822
01:28:00,210 --> 01:28:01,510
- Breakfast?
- Yes.

1823
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:02,980
I need to leave soon.

1824
01:28:03,910 --> 01:28:05,409
I haven't seen much of you lately.

1825
01:28:05,410 --> 01:28:07,150
- What?
- I haven't seen much of you lately.

1826
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:10,579
I'm so tired. I just pass out.

1827
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:13,289
- Really?
- I heard you guys drank last night.

1828
01:28:13,290 --> 01:28:14,990
- Me?
- Everyone.

1829
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:16,990
No, I wasn't with them.

1830
01:28:18,290 --> 01:28:19,460
With another woman.

1831
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:21,190
(Surprised)

1832
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:23,060
I'm curious.

1833
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:25,230
Just the two of you in the house?

1834
01:28:25,570 --> 01:28:26,970
We didn't drink together.

1835
01:28:27,770 --> 01:28:29,070
I just wanted to be with her.

1836
01:28:31,670 --> 01:28:32,869
It must've been so fun for you.

1837
01:28:32,870 --> 01:28:34,810
But your exes must be heartbroken.

1838
01:28:34,910 --> 01:28:37,740
Right. But that's their business, not mine.

1839
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:41,080
Gosh, this is such a tough place to be in.

1840
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:44,720
That would've been really hard on me.

1841
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,290
If I were your ex.

1842
01:28:46,490 --> 01:28:47,789
I don't think it would affect you that much.

1843
01:28:47,790 --> 01:28:54,460
(The Ex Room will open soon. Go to the Ex Room now, Min Kyung.)

1844
01:28:57,130 --> 01:28:58,429
That's interesting.

1845
01:28:58,430 --> 01:29:01,840
(Min Kyung gets up quickly after getting the sudden message.)

1846
01:29:03,670 --> 01:29:07,370
I got a message I wasn't expecting. So I was flustered.

1847
01:29:07,940 --> 01:29:10,279
But I was curious...

1848
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:13,250
about what would be in our Ex Room.

1849
01:29:13,710 --> 01:29:14,780
- What?
- What?

1850
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,080
- Ex Room?
- Now?

1851
01:29:17,650 --> 01:29:19,219
- Now?
- After that emotional night?

1852
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:20,489
- They'll go there now?
- Now?

1853
01:29:20,490 --> 01:29:21,490
Now?

1854
01:29:21,491 --> 01:29:23,659
They'll go there after spending an emotional night?

1855
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:25,089
This will just make things worse.

1856
01:29:25,090 --> 01:29:26,759
- My gosh.
- What?

1857
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:28,060
(The Ex Room opens up when everyone is confused.)

1858
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:29,529
- Gosh, now?
- Right now,

1859
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:32,469
- everyone is confused emotionally.
- Right.

1860
01:29:32,470 --> 01:29:34,769
- It's the right time to go there.
- This is great.

1861
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:35,999
Going to the Ex Room...

1862
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,039
when things are going well with someone new...

1863
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,710
- must be so confusing.
- Right.

1864
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:45,810
(The Ex Room will open soon. Go to the Ex Room now, Baek Hyun.)

1865
01:29:47,650 --> 01:29:48,950
It's time.

1866
01:29:50,450 --> 01:29:53,390
I didn't know what would be in that room.

1867
01:29:57,990 --> 01:30:04,660
(The residents receive the message one at a time.)

1868
01:30:05,130 --> 01:30:06,670
It was a weird feeling.

1869
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,110
I felt a bit bitter.

1870
01:30:12,510 --> 01:30:15,310
But I did want to see the room.

1871
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:17,040
I thought seeing that room...

1872
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:18,980
would help me understand my feelings more.

1873
01:30:21,650 --> 01:30:24,020
I thought, "Finally. It's time."

1874
01:30:24,450 --> 01:30:27,049
Since I was open to getting back together with her,

1875
01:30:27,050 --> 01:30:28,489
I wanted to see the room.

1876
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:30,890
I wanted to go in and sort out my feelings.

1877
01:30:46,770 --> 01:30:52,250
(Ji Yeon opens the closet again after getting the message.)

1878
01:30:56,750 --> 01:30:59,989
The message said the Ex Room was open.

1879
01:30:59,990 --> 01:31:03,020
I thought a lot about changing my shirt.

1880
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:08,090
But I wanted to wear that this morning, so I put it on.

1881
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:11,530
I wanted to show to Won Kyu that...

1882
01:31:11,730 --> 01:31:13,670
it looked great on me.

1883
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,500
I decided to stick to my initial intention.

1884
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:19,070
I shouldn't worry about how my ex would take it.

1885
01:31:19,170 --> 01:31:22,209
I should follow my heart. I wanted to wear this shirt...

1886
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:23,780
because I really liked it.

1887
01:31:26,150 --> 01:31:31,150
(She decides to wear Won Kyu's shirt.)

1888
01:31:31,420 --> 01:31:32,619
- Gosh.
- Really?

1889
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:34,120
She'll really wear that?

1890
01:31:34,150 --> 01:31:35,589
- Gosh.
- Go.

1891
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:36,819
- She's so cool.
- She's so cool.

1892
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:38,189
- My gosh.
- She'll wear his shirt to the room.

1893
01:31:38,190 --> 01:31:39,889
If I were Woo Jin, seeing that would break me.

1894
01:31:39,890 --> 01:31:41,359
- That's...
- If I were him,

1895
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:42,530
I would leave the show.

1896
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:44,899
- For real?
- I don't think I could handle it...

1897
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:46,069
- if I were him.
- Same here.

1898
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:48,199
I would go to the staff and cry my eyes out.

1899
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:52,009
Actually, being very clear with her intention...

1900
01:31:52,010 --> 01:31:53,469
might be better for Woo Jin.

1901
01:31:53,470 --> 01:31:55,409
It might be difficult now.

1902
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:57,009
But this is better for him.

1903
01:31:57,010 --> 01:31:58,909
- It will help him move on.
- He can move on then.

1904
01:31:58,910 --> 01:32:02,019
Woo Jin is also interested in Min Kyung.

1905
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:04,349
- This must be tough on Woo Jin.
- Of course it is.

1906
01:32:04,350 --> 01:32:06,320
This new side of him is the sixth guy on our show.

1907
01:32:10,990 --> 01:32:16,830
(While bearing emotions of all shapes and shades, )

1908
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:26,210
(the residents head over to the Ex Room.)

1909
01:32:31,810 --> 01:32:35,220
(Yoo Sik is the first one to enter the Ex Room.)

1910
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:48,029
(In a white room...)

1911
01:32:48,030 --> 01:32:50,860
(lies an envelope.)

1912
01:33:07,310 --> 01:33:11,319
(Only one may enter the Ex Room, either you or your ex.)

1913
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:15,660
(Only one may enter the Ex Room, either you or your ex.)

1914
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:19,889
- What?
- What? Only one of them?

1915
01:33:19,890 --> 01:33:21,899
- Only 1? If I decide to enter, - Just 1?

1916
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:24,429
- my ex can't enter the room?
- My ex can't enter the room...

1917
01:33:24,430 --> 01:33:25,829
- if I decide to go in.
- Right.

1918
01:33:25,830 --> 01:33:27,330
What if both of them want to go? What should they do?

1919
01:33:32,810 --> 01:33:35,209
(Only one may enter the Ex Room, either you or your ex.)

1920
01:33:35,210 --> 01:33:41,250
(Only one may enter the Ex Room.)

1921
01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:45,550
It said only one of us could enter.

1922
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:47,189
(If you decide not to enter, leave through the door you came in.)

1923
01:33:47,190 --> 01:33:48,389
(If you want to enter, enter through the left door.)

1924
01:33:48,390 --> 01:33:50,419
If I wanted to enter the Ex Room,

1925
01:33:50,420 --> 01:33:51,890
I had to enter through the left door.

1926
01:33:52,590 --> 01:33:53,859
If I didn't want to enter,

1927
01:33:53,860 --> 01:33:56,360
I had to leave through the door I came in.

1928
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,840
(Min Kyung also enters the Ex Room.)

1929
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:17,720
It was a bit confusing.

1930
01:34:17,980 --> 01:34:21,320
I was starting to have lingering feelings about my ex.

1931
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:26,360
If I were to enter the Ex Room, I'd only be feeding these feelings.

1932
01:34:26,630 --> 01:34:28,030
So I was scared.

1933
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:32,930
I didn't want to go in.

1934
01:34:33,530 --> 01:34:35,770
But I was curious too.

1935
01:34:37,570 --> 01:34:38,640
I thought about it for a while.

1936
01:34:41,170 --> 01:34:44,510
(Only one of them can enter the Ex Room.)

1937
01:34:45,450 --> 01:34:49,880
(If both of them give up, the Ex Room will not open.)

1938
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:53,719
Right. Both of them might give up on entering the room.

1939
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:56,890
Right. Both of them might decide not to enter.

1940
01:34:56,990 --> 01:34:59,559
But both Yoo Sik and Min Kyung would want to enter the room.

1941
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:02,099
She just said that she might not be able to move on,

1942
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:03,529
so she didn't want to go in.

1943
01:35:03,530 --> 01:35:07,769
Or how about this? If I enter, my ex wouldn't be able to enter.

1944
01:35:07,770 --> 01:35:10,399
- Right.
- Then will some of them give up...

1945
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:11,969
on entering, so their ex can see the room?

1946
01:35:11,970 --> 01:35:13,269
- Right.
- Some might do that.

1947
01:35:13,270 --> 01:35:14,509
- Right.
- That might be the case for most.

1948
01:35:14,510 --> 01:35:15,909
- Right.
- They want their ex to see it?

1949
01:35:15,910 --> 01:35:18,549
Or if they want their ex to still feel something...

1950
01:35:18,550 --> 01:35:19,579
- for them, - If that's what they want...

1951
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:21,450
- they don't need to see the room.
- Right, don't see the room.

1952
01:35:22,450 --> 01:35:24,419
- You have to be strategic.
- Right.

1953
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:26,919
By the way, this new system might be good for them.

1954
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:28,249
It allows them to consider...

1955
01:35:28,250 --> 01:35:30,059
getting back with their ex and starting a new relationship.

1956
01:35:30,060 --> 01:35:31,759
That's the idea behind it.

1957
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:32,830
That was clever of the staff.

1958
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:56,519
But I was still curious about the room.

1959
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:59,350
I wanted to see what was in our Ex Room.

1960
01:35:59,690 --> 01:36:02,659
It was time for me to face the time...

1961
01:36:02,660 --> 01:36:04,520
we spent together.

1962
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:08,760
Honestly, I was quite sad.

1963
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:11,230
So I kept crying.

1964
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:20,410
(She bravely steps into the Ex Room.)

1965
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:35,620
(Yoo Sik had already chosen to see the Ex Room and was waiting.)

1966
01:36:36,660 --> 01:36:41,589
(Yoo Sik and Min Kyung face each other in a mysterious room.)

1967
01:36:41,590 --> 01:36:43,759
- My gosh. What is this?
- Wait. What's going on?

1968
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:45,829
- What is this?
- All my body hair is standing...

1969
01:36:45,830 --> 01:36:46,830
- on end.
- What's this?

1970
01:36:46,831 --> 01:36:47,969
- I got the chills.
- And I'm not even that hairy.

1971
01:36:47,970 --> 01:36:49,669
- My hair is standing on end.
- What's going on?

1972
01:36:49,670 --> 01:36:50,699
- What a surprise.
- This is weird.

1973
01:36:50,700 --> 01:36:53,739
If I entered, and my ex didn't, I would've been alone.

1974
01:36:53,740 --> 01:36:56,239
They now know that they both chose to see the room.

1975
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:57,709
- They know that now.
- They know.

1976
01:36:57,710 --> 01:36:58,750
- Right.
- Oh, my gosh.

1977
01:37:02,380 --> 01:37:06,990
(Yoo Sik had already chosen to see the Ex Room and was waiting.)

1978
01:37:15,430 --> 01:37:18,360
It was sad and confusing at the same time.

1979
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:21,730
I wondered if it meant that he had feelings left for me.

1980
01:37:25,910 --> 01:37:28,840
(Two envelopes are placed on the chair.)

1981
01:37:29,710 --> 01:37:33,750
(She opens up the first envelope.)

1982
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:40,849
(Only one of you can enter the Ex Room.)

1983
01:37:40,850 --> 01:37:42,619
(Flip the sandglass now. Talk until sand runs out...)

1984
01:37:42,620 --> 01:37:44,490
(which will take 10 minutes and pick 1 person to enter the room.)

1985
01:37:45,390 --> 01:37:50,000
(They must decide who will enter through the 10-minute conversation.)

1986
01:37:55,970 --> 01:38:00,410
It felt like I was standing in front of the last door.

1987
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:03,540
The room made me feel like this was our last chance to talk.

1988
01:38:04,810 --> 01:38:07,179
They'll talk and pick one person? Okay.

1989
01:38:07,180 --> 01:38:08,209
- They'll decide who will go in.
- Yes.

1990
01:38:08,210 --> 01:38:09,749
- They will have to agree on it.
- That's good.

1991
01:38:09,750 --> 01:38:11,919
- This is a great show.
- This is just crazy.

1992
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:14,049
- This is great.
- Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

1993
01:38:14,050 --> 01:38:16,059
Anyway, both of them want to see it.

1994
01:38:16,060 --> 01:38:17,890
- Right.
- Gosh, what will they do?

1995
01:38:18,260 --> 01:38:21,060
- My heart is already aching.
- Right.

1996
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:23,330
It's sad that one of them must give up on entering.

1997
01:38:25,260 --> 01:38:30,100
(She opens up the second envelope.)

1998
01:38:37,740 --> 01:38:42,050
I saw the reason we broke up on the card.

1999
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:44,519
(Priority)

2000
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:47,350
It said, "priority."

2001
01:38:47,620 --> 01:38:51,490
I could see that he thought this was the biggest reason we broke up.

2002
01:38:57,500 --> 01:39:00,800
(And the reason Min Kyung thought they broke up)

2003
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:04,099
(Future)

2004
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:05,810
It said, "future."

2005
01:39:06,740 --> 01:39:09,340
The future we imagined didn't align.

2006
01:39:16,980 --> 01:39:21,690
(They begin talking after checking the reason behind their breakup.)

2007
01:39:24,690 --> 01:39:25,890
Do you want to go in?

2008
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:30,830
We dated for a long time.

2009
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:33,200
So...

2010
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:39,940
the first item I got from you was the letter which I didn't expect.

2011
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:44,310
I think there might be many things I wouldn't have known about.

2012
01:39:45,950 --> 01:39:47,180
So I want to see it.

2013
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:49,050
Then you can go in.

2014
01:39:51,150 --> 01:39:54,250
No. I think it's better if you go in.

2015
01:40:00,990 --> 01:40:03,560
I really don't have any regret about our relationship.

2016
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:10,000
I want you to have this chance to look back on our relationship.

2017
01:40:13,070 --> 01:40:14,940
There's nothing I can do.

2018
01:40:16,310 --> 01:40:17,310
Why?

2019
01:40:17,980 --> 01:40:19,380
We broke up...

2020
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:23,450
- Because of me?
- Yes.

2021
01:40:27,020 --> 01:40:29,260
You had your feelings sorted first.

2022
01:40:31,990 --> 01:40:34,330
Who made me do that?

2023
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:38,060
You always made me choose.

2024
01:40:47,870 --> 01:40:50,940
I don't know. I just don't want to talk.

2025
01:40:54,780 --> 01:40:56,750
I wished you were happy.

2026
01:40:57,550 --> 01:41:00,990
And I still want you to be happy.

2027
01:41:03,420 --> 01:41:04,720
Think carefully...

2028
01:41:06,530 --> 01:41:08,030
after seeing it..

2029
01:41:14,030 --> 01:41:18,840
(Min Kyung leaves first.)

2030
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:30,680
(Yoo Sik is left alone.)

2031
01:41:32,050 --> 01:41:34,790
I think she sent me in,

2032
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:38,090
so I'd understand her heart...

2033
01:41:38,690 --> 01:41:41,060
without getting confused.

2034
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:45,329
The feelings of standing in front of the door...

2035
01:41:45,330 --> 01:41:48,100
to check the ex's heart...

2036
01:41:48,830 --> 01:41:52,670
was like opening the box against my will.

2037
01:42:14,890 --> 01:42:16,800
(Back in school, you were my everything. Even after growing up.)

2038
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:34,910
(A space stopped in time, filled with their memories)

2039
01:42:40,690 --> 01:42:44,660
The Ex Room was decorated like a classroom.

2040
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:47,960
There were uniforms on the chairs.

2041
01:42:49,260 --> 01:42:51,860
We were together for 365 days.

2042
01:42:52,260 --> 01:42:54,470
It meant a lot.

2043
01:42:56,540 --> 01:42:59,810
It reminded me of the old days.

2044
01:43:04,410 --> 01:43:06,849
(Cho Yoo Sik, Kwak Min Kyung)

2045
01:43:06,850 --> 01:43:09,350
(Cho Yoo Sik)

2046
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:12,390
(Cho Yoo Sik)

2047
01:43:38,310 --> 01:43:40,750
The pictures from high school...

2048
01:43:41,080 --> 01:43:44,420
and our good memories were hung.

2049
01:43:48,150 --> 01:43:49,759
(I wanted to buy everything you wanted to eat or have...)

2050
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:52,160
(no matter what.)

2051
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:55,859
I read every one of them...

2052
01:43:55,860 --> 01:43:57,730
carefully.

2053
01:44:16,050 --> 01:44:18,279
(The feeling that I can finally breathe when we meet)

2054
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:21,050
(I wanted to take care of her because she was small.)

2055
01:44:34,930 --> 01:44:37,000
Looking at our good memories,

2056
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:41,409
what I felt was not sadness...

2057
01:44:41,410 --> 01:44:44,910
but a deeper emptiness.

2058
01:44:54,490 --> 01:44:57,720
(Yoo Sik, I love you.)

2059
01:44:58,490 --> 01:45:00,560
There were snacks in the locker.

2060
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:04,729
I often bought her snacks.

2061
01:45:04,730 --> 01:45:06,300
(He bought me my favorite snacks every day.)

2062
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:10,270
When I got her something trendy, but hard to find,

2063
01:45:11,370 --> 01:45:14,910
her reaction was so cute.

2064
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:17,579
She liked how I got it for her...

2065
01:45:17,580 --> 01:45:19,750
no matter what.

2066
01:45:23,050 --> 01:45:26,390
When I think about it, it makes me smile.

2067
01:45:39,730 --> 01:45:42,900
(Pictures of them traveling together)

2068
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:48,710
We loved traveling.

2069
01:45:53,210 --> 01:45:57,380
I thought I should take care of myself even on a trip.

2070
01:45:57,980 --> 01:46:00,919
I don't think I just wanted to...

2071
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:02,590
spend the time happily.

2072
01:46:19,470 --> 01:46:23,040
Min Kyung often had to drink alone.

2073
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:25,540
I think she was lonely.

2074
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:28,979
I thought I should've enjoyed it together...

2075
01:46:28,980 --> 01:46:33,250
at least when we were traveling.

2076
01:46:35,150 --> 01:46:36,260
I felt so bad.

2077
01:46:57,480 --> 01:47:01,250
(He stands in front of the wall full of pictures.)

2078
01:47:10,190 --> 01:47:13,430
(Their happy moments when they became adults in 2020)

2079
01:47:19,970 --> 01:47:21,329
(I liked how you called me a baby. I liked how you were consistent.)

2080
01:47:21,330 --> 01:47:23,770
I liked taking pictures of her.

2081
01:47:23,940 --> 01:47:26,070
And we spent so much time together.

2082
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:30,340
Every time we were together, I took pictures for memories.

2083
01:47:33,580 --> 01:47:35,149
(You've always been indispensable, )

2084
01:47:35,150 --> 01:47:36,950
(but now you've become someone more indispensable.)

2085
01:47:37,120 --> 01:47:40,750
(Now that it's been 900 days, I'll make you even happier.)

2086
01:47:41,690 --> 01:47:43,460
I'd forgotten.

2087
01:47:43,790 --> 01:47:46,260
That reminded me of everything at once.

2088
01:47:48,830 --> 01:47:52,560
(Their memories together fill the floor.)

2089
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:06,309
We had so many good memories.

2090
01:48:06,310 --> 01:48:08,079
(He said we should date for at least 5,000 days before we break up.)

2091
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:09,820
(He always got me food first and treated me like a princess.)

2092
01:48:17,290 --> 01:48:21,059
(I like you so much. I love you.)

2093
01:48:21,060 --> 01:48:25,459
At the time, she probably waited for our happy days together.

2094
01:48:25,460 --> 01:48:27,169
(After we began dating, I'm excited and nervous to see the date.)

2095
01:48:27,170 --> 01:48:29,069
(That's how much this date means to me.)

2096
01:48:29,070 --> 01:48:30,969
(As we spent so much time together, I learned a lot.)

2097
01:48:30,970 --> 01:48:35,310
As years went by, we spent less and less time together.

2098
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:49,089
My thoughts about taking pictures became dull.

2099
01:48:49,090 --> 01:48:51,519
So there were fewer pictures.

2100
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:53,060
(Our memories together started to reduce.)

2101
01:49:04,940 --> 01:49:06,709
I became busy.

2102
01:49:06,710 --> 01:49:09,640
I didn't treat her nicely.

2103
01:49:17,250 --> 01:49:20,350
(Facing 2025 at the end)

2104
01:49:23,260 --> 01:49:27,559
(The biggest reason we fought was my busy schedule.)

2105
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:31,259
(I'm always waiting for you.)

2106
01:49:31,260 --> 01:49:34,129
(I was the one next to him. But I was always waiting.)

2107
01:49:34,130 --> 01:49:36,670
(I wasn't happy. I felt miserable.)

2108
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:46,179
(If you want someone who has fun, date him. I don't plan to do that.)

2109
01:49:46,180 --> 01:49:48,449
If you want to have fun so much,

2110
01:49:48,450 --> 01:49:50,720
date someone who does.

2111
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:52,680
Because I don't do that.

2112
01:49:55,490 --> 01:49:59,690
Those moments must've hurt Min Kyung's feelings.

2113
01:50:25,580 --> 01:50:28,150
I was such a mean boyfriend.

2114
01:50:29,590 --> 01:50:33,160
It was all my fault. That made me sad.

2115
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:54,770
(The reason we broke up, Min Kyung's heart before moving in)

2116
01:51:58,510 --> 01:52:01,079
Throughout three years in high school,

2117
01:52:01,080 --> 01:52:02,950
we spent so much time together.

2118
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:04,979
We spent 360 days...

2119
01:52:04,980 --> 01:52:08,450
out of 365 days. That's how much time we spent together.

2120
01:52:09,020 --> 01:52:12,690
After we got into universities, we had different lives.

2121
01:52:13,030 --> 01:52:16,599
Sometimes I said, "We've already been dating..."

2122
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:18,630
"seven, eight years."

2123
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:21,070
From time to time, I said,

2124
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:23,669
"Let's continue dating and get married later."

2125
01:52:23,670 --> 01:52:26,309
And I said,

2126
01:52:26,310 --> 01:52:30,010
"Our children will look cute if they take after us."

2127
01:52:30,140 --> 01:52:31,340
But Yoo Sik...

2128
01:52:32,640 --> 01:52:34,950
never replied to that.

2129
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:38,949
It took me too long...

2130
01:52:38,950 --> 01:52:41,249
to realize that we had different values.

2131
01:52:41,250 --> 01:52:43,220
That was our seventh year.

2132
01:52:44,220 --> 01:52:46,660
I've been thinking about it since last year.

2133
01:52:47,060 --> 01:52:51,159
"I'm not part of your future."

2134
01:52:51,160 --> 01:52:53,369
"And you don't even plan to marry me."

2135
01:52:53,370 --> 01:52:57,540
I became emotional when I said that.

2136
01:52:57,800 --> 01:53:01,470
Then he replied seriously.

2137
01:53:01,970 --> 01:53:05,209
"We're still too young."

2138
01:53:05,210 --> 01:53:07,380
"It's too early to talk about marriage."

2139
01:53:07,550 --> 01:53:11,050
"And I can't say anything I don't mean."

2140
01:53:11,380 --> 01:53:14,090
"So I can't give you the answer you want."

2141
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:18,490
He said something that'd hurt me like it was nothing.

2142
01:53:18,660 --> 01:53:20,530
I knew our relationship was over.

2143
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:24,760
It was time to end it.

2144
01:53:27,030 --> 01:53:31,200
I got to wonder if I could marry him.

2145
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:36,070
Even before I knew,

2146
01:53:36,340 --> 01:53:38,709
I was thinking I wanted to date someone else.

2147
01:53:38,710 --> 01:53:42,080
How would it feel to be in a relationship as an adult?

2148
01:53:42,180 --> 01:53:45,580
I want to date someone who plans the future with me.

2149
01:53:46,180 --> 01:53:49,789
I want someone stable.

2150
01:53:49,790 --> 01:53:51,090
So I can rely on him.

2151
01:53:56,430 --> 01:54:00,770
I've always thought to myself in my head.

2152
01:54:00,970 --> 01:54:04,540
But I never heard it in person before.

2153
01:54:05,070 --> 01:54:08,539
It was a chance to check...

2154
01:54:08,540 --> 01:54:11,439
what I wanted to check.

2155
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:14,410
It was quite heartbreaking.

2156
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:19,520
Because we dated for so long,

2157
01:54:20,390 --> 01:54:22,220
when she talked about marriage,

2158
01:54:24,220 --> 01:54:28,060
I always acted realistically.

2159
01:54:29,190 --> 01:54:32,200
She knows more than anyone...

2160
01:54:32,530 --> 01:54:34,600
that I can't make her feel stable...

2161
01:54:34,870 --> 01:54:37,199
if I continue to live this way.

2162
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:38,999
(He can't yet dream of a stable future Min Kyung wants.)

2163
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,410
I felt really bad.

2164
01:54:41,370 --> 01:54:45,379
I wonder if it was a good idea for Yoo Sik to see the Ex Room.

2165
01:54:45,380 --> 01:54:48,249
I think Min Kyung...

2166
01:54:48,250 --> 01:54:50,750
- wanted Yoo Sik to return to her...
- Right.

2167
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:52,849
- after seeing the Ex Room.
- Return to her.

2168
01:54:52,850 --> 01:54:55,919
- But it only made Yoo Sik...
- Exactly.

2169
01:54:55,920 --> 01:54:59,559
To settle his feelings realistically.

2170
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:01,460
But when I think about it,

2171
01:55:01,960 --> 01:55:04,159
even if Min Kyung saw it,

2172
01:55:04,160 --> 01:55:06,299
- it wouldn't have changed anything.
- No.

2173
01:55:06,300 --> 01:55:10,099
I think this was meant to happen.

2174
01:55:10,100 --> 01:55:12,269
- That's sad.
- He must feel helpless.

2175
01:55:12,270 --> 01:55:13,270
I know.

2176
01:55:25,850 --> 01:55:28,250
If I give up a lot,

2177
01:55:28,950 --> 01:55:32,620
it might solve the problem.

2178
01:55:33,230 --> 01:55:36,630
She knows...

2179
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:39,160
that I can't do that for her.

2180
01:55:40,370 --> 01:55:43,640
I want her to meet someone who wouldn't hurt her feelings.

2181
01:55:44,270 --> 01:55:47,410
I decided to...

2182
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:53,180
get my feelings sorted as well.

2183
01:56:01,620 --> 01:56:04,420
(The reason I worked hard was you.)

2184
01:56:04,990 --> 01:56:08,630
(EXchange 4)

2185
01:56:08,890 --> 01:56:11,500
I can see who you're interested in.

2186
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:15,000
I don't hide it.

2187
01:56:15,770 --> 01:56:17,670
(Why do you make me upset?)

2188
01:56:20,170 --> 01:56:22,110
I want to talk...

2189
01:56:23,940 --> 01:56:25,340
to him.

2190
01:56:26,950 --> 01:56:28,349
We'll go inside.

2191
01:56:28,350 --> 01:56:29,450
No.

2192
01:56:29,950 --> 01:56:32,150
I saw it with my own eyes.

2193
01:56:32,820 --> 01:56:34,090
I had mixed feelings.

2194
01:56:35,150 --> 01:56:38,020
Do you want an apron? You're wearing white. What do you say?

2195
01:56:38,390 --> 01:56:39,690
I need an apron.

2196
01:56:40,360 --> 01:56:42,889
Ji Yeon was wearing the T-shirt...

2197
01:56:42,890 --> 01:56:44,860
my ex wore the day before.

2198
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:46,900
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

2199
01:56:47,330 --> 01:56:48,830
I thought, "They even have matching shirts?"

2200
01:56:49,700 --> 01:56:51,800
(It's a quirk of fate.)
