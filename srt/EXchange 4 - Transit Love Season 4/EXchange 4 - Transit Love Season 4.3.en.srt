1
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,079
People are going crazy about this.

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,209
(EXchange 4)

3
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,479
People I know are saying, "It's finally back,"

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,119
or "The cast looks really pretty and handsome."

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,919
- Right. This time, - The cast of this season.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,149
- it's the best ever.
- Right.

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,589
I'm sorry to say this now,

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,620
but I'll introduce some people.

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,690
We invited two guests today. Sung Ho and Jae Hyun.

10
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,160
Hello.

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,059
- We have a good start.
- Right.

12
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,799
Also, I heard you participated...

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,099
- in the soundtrack.
- That's right.

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,640
You're part of the family, then.

15
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,609
What soundtrack is it?

16
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:43,179
- Kim Ea Na wrote the lyrics.
- Really?

17
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,809
The line I really liked was,

18
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,749
"Again, no, never."

19
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,880
There was a line like that.

20
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,780
- "Again, no, never." - "Again, no, never."

21
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,249
I think that really suited EXchange well.

22
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,289
That's a really good line.

23
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,689
I'm really curious to see what story it would have.

24
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,919
I want to work on that as well.

25
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,059
- Work on what?
- Even if it's not music,

26
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,629
I want to contribute.

27
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,300
Should I record the sound of the sword being drawn?

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,929
I could do something like that.

29
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,530
We're like ALLDAY PROJECT.

30
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,769
We can do it.

31
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,069
- ALLNIGHT PROJECT.
- Right.

32
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,269
- We could do it.
- We're not even famous

33
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,479
- Let's do it. It's nice.
- We're not even famous

34
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,909
We invited BOYNEXTDOOR today.

35
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,109
Last week, in the chat room,

36
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,749
it was revealed that Yoo Sik's ex...

37
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,920
- was Min Kyung, and it ended.
- Right.

38
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,419
I kept thinking...

39
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,889
about what story they would have.

40
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,189
We haven't seen that yet.

41
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,689
- The period they dated.
- We haven't seen that.

42
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,759
I watched it alone at home...

43
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,959
and sniffled a bit.

44
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,069
- Really?
- I'm an extreme feeler.

45
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,529
He's a feeler,

46
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,539
- and I'm a thinker.
- Thinker.

47
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,739
We'd be able to hear the opinions of a thinker and a feeler.

48
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,939
When I watched...

49
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,910
the part where she chatted with Ji Hyeon, I was like this.

50
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,549
He really related to it.

51
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,450
- Do you know what big thinkers say?
- Big thinkers.

52
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,850
"They type really fast."

53
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,719
Do you get it? That's what they think.

54
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,489
- "What?" - When I watched them type,

55
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,689
I tried to guess their jobs.

56
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,729
Right.

57
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,059
- That's how it is.
- Right.

58
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,330
- They're really different.
- I thought about those things.

59
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,800
(A week ago, Seongsu-dong)

60
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,790
(Min Kyung arrived earlier.)

61
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,669
(The person coming to meet her is Min Kyung's ex, )

62
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,770
(Yoo Sik.)

63
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,180
(Yoo Sik and Min Kyung's story will be revealed.)

64
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,270
You lost a lot of weight.

65
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,940
Yes.

66
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,719
- Why can't you look at me?
- What?

67
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,080
Why can't you look at me?

68
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,320
I'm nervous.

69
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,330
You've gotten handsome.

70
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,730
I lost a lot of weight lately.

71
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,330
I've been busy.

72
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,470
Don't people around you ask about us?

73
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,380
They do.

74
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,710
People ask why I've lost so much weight.

75
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,780
If I had a change of heart.

76
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:15,320
That's very blunt.

77
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,890
At first, I didn't want to talk about it.

78
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,960
I just said I was doing well.

79
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,070
I felt a bit embarrassed.

80
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,970
- We met for a very long time, - Right.

81
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,140
But now, I had to tell them we weren't together.

82
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,080
That's right.

83
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,710
- Were you nervous yesterday?
- Yesterday?

84
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,750
About coming here today.

85
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,350
I wasn't exactly nervous.

86
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,590
I thought, "It's already tomorrow."

87
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,730
Or...

88
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,830
"I'd be staying with him..."

89
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:00,030
"after four days."

90
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,700
That's what I thought.

91
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,310
- I couldn't sleep.
- Really?

92
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,810
I was shaking when I woke up.

93
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,280
Really?

94
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,010
- So...
- That's interesting.

95
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,379
- Are you nervous?
- I'm so overwhelmed.

96
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,450
Really?

97
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,990
I'll watch how you do and help you out.

98
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,889
Why would you help me?

99
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,830
Why? I used to coordinate...

100
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,629
- That's...
- everything for you.

101
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,700
You didn't coordinate everything.

102
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,229
I coordinated everything for eight years.

103
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,430
- It was nine years.
- Well...

104
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,900
It wasn't even eight years. Seven?

105
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,840
Count them. 2017,

106
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,710
2018, 2019, 2020, 2021,

107
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,680
2022, 2023, 2024, 2025.

108
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,950
That's nine years.

109
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,320
- Nine years?
- Nine years?

110
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,119
Now I understand why Min Kyung...

111
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,959
- Right.
- was so worked up.

112
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,259
You would be shaking.

113
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,129
- I got goosebumps.
- This is really...

114
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,859
That was unexpected.

115
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,800
I never imagined they would have been together that long.

116
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,469
That's like a big portion of their lives...

117
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,599
They spent their youth together.

118
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,069
While watching episodes 1 and 2,

119
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:18,379
Yoo Sik kept having sad eyes.

120
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,739
- Right.
- I kept thinking...

121
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,449
I wanted to know his story.

122
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,780
After hearing the period,

123
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,949
I realize it was an expression I couldn't have understood.

124
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,250
That's what I feel.

125
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,590
(That's nine years!)

126
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,930
That's too long.

127
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,660
- We can't meet new people.
- We can't reduce the years.

128
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,899
I can't handle that.

129
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,240
Seven to eight years.

130
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,009
Why would you say 7 to 8 years when we dated for 9 years?

131
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,140
Is that so?

132
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:55,310
From July 29, 2017...

133
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:00,390
We broke up on January 8, 2025.

134
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,790
We went to the same arts high school.

135
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,190
We first met at school.

136
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,159
(One studied theatre and film, the other studied dance...)

137
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,459
(in the same arts high school.)

138
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,559
- Right. Since high school.
- From high school...

139
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,869
- Everyone around would know them.
- They would know.

140
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,069
If they had met since high school.

141
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,199
Wouldn't they be each other's first love?

142
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,469
- Right.
- That would be so.

143
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,910
- If they were high school students.
- It's very likely.

144
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,379
When I first joined the school, my friends told me...

145
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,750
there was a really good-looking guy in the acting department.

146
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,849
He was playing soccer,

147
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:35,090
and all my friends were leaning on the railing to watch him.

148
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,590
I saw him and thought...

149
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,490
he wasn't so nice.

150
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,599
She was a year junior at school.

151
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,530
She was short, round, and cute.

152
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,399
I thought, "Why is such a girl in our school?"

153
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,069
Later, he was going to transfer...

154
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,910
from the acting department to the dance department.

155
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,879
The dance department...

156
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,319
was strict when it came to treating the seniors well.

157
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,580
I didn't like that at first.

158
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,619
It was the first day we took the Seoul lesson together.

159
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,989
We went to a tteokbokki place, and he said,

160
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,619
"Get everything you want."

161
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,990
"It's on me."

162
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,200
That time, I told my friend,

163
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,430
"He's nice."

164
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,069
"He's better than I thought."

165
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,470
That's what I said.

166
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,070
Because he bought her tteokbokki?

167
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,539
Because of tteokbokki.

168
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,179
- Tteokbokki in high school...
- If you buy tteokbokki...

169
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,579
- That's everything.
- That's everything.

170
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,349
If there's someone you like, buy the person tteokbokki.

171
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,849
I bought it many times.

172
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,880
I bought it for everyone.

173
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,479
Didn't they say they liked you?

174
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,050
They asked me to buy the tteokbokki restaurant.

175
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,160
You have to get Labubu for them these days.

176
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,119
Labubu works these days.

177
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,160
- Labubu.
- Labubu.

178
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,960
That's funny.

179
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,399
When we traveled from Seoul to Daejeon,

180
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,770
we had to travel by bus.

181
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,970
There was a time my ex and I went to Daejeon together.

182
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,240
We talked a lot that time.

183
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:04,809
That's when we started keeping in touch,

184
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,440
and that never stopped.

185
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:10,680
We were in class, and he kept saying I was pretty.

186
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,019
He kept getting me snacks.

187
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,360
So I thought,

188
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,559
"Is there something between us?"

189
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,700
But after that...

190
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,330
It really wasn't cool, but I called her...

191
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,900
and asked her out.

192
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,840
"Do you want to go out with me?"

193
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,070
I said, "Okay."

194
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,439
That's when we started our secret relationship...

195
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,209
that wasn't a secret.

196
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,679
(That's how their not-so-secret relationship began.)

197
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,650
The teachers couldn't know about it.

198
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,119
We never talked at school.

199
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,490
We talked even less.

200
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,430
Then we would go to watch movies...

201
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,930
or have snacks.

202
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Look at me.

203
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,200
Look over here.

204
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,999
(They spent time together in secret like that.)

205
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,639
Later on,

206
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,740
we realized it was so obvious.

207
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,880
We would wear matching clothes.

208
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,980
We took so many mirror selfies.

209
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:19,979
You could also see the security camera in the picture.

210
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,290
It was always there.

211
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:26,659
So we weren't exactly keeping it a secret.

212
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,789
(They weren't keeping it a secret.)

213
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,960
At that age,

214
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,730
we just thought about how much we liked each other,

215
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,799
so that didn't cross our minds.

216
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,800
(Their feelings couldn't be hidden.)

217
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
They look so good together.

218
00:10:38,601 --> 00:10:40,170
- So cute.
- They were so young.

219
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,539
That's when they were in high school.

220
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,339
In middle schools and high schools,

221
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,309
the prettiest senior and the most handsome senior...

222
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,509
- were always together.
- Right.

223
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,079
I think they were that kind of couple.

224
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,819
- Right.
- Totally.

225
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,519
They would have been a very famous couple.

226
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,149
Their breakup is very heartbreaking,

227
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:59,089
but it's a story that people these days would most like.

228
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,689
- Right.
- Yes. They met in high school.

229
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,690
It's the story that would make you scream.

230
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,329
It's like a drama.

231
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,500
It's really like a youth drama.

232
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,370
We finally got caught by a teacher.

233
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,810
"You can't be dating right now. Break up."

234
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,739
We thought the teachers disliked it because they were worried...

235
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,109
we wouldn't do our best and our grades would drop.

236
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,450
I thought I should practice even harder.

237
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,919
(Dance practice)

238
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,149
I worked really hard,

239
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,560
and I stayed in 1st place in practicals for 3 years straight.

240
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:35,760
We lived the same life for 365 days.

241
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,460
We were together all the time.

242
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,899
I thought I had to take care of her and look out for her.

243
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,070
I thought about that a lot.

244
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,140
I guess he was my everything.

245
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,870
Without him,

246
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,509
I wouldn't have been able to endure that time.

247
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,180
(They entered their 20s together.)

248
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:57,150
We became adults and entered college.

249
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,480
I liked it better.

250
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,149
We could do what we wanted.

251
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,290
We could do what we wanted for a date.

252
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,390
We went to the sea...

253
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:09,860
and had a drink.

254
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,630
We uploaded the photos we took together on our social media.

255
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,399
We tried to express our love more...

256
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,739
because we couldn't do so in high school.

257
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,679
(Year 2021)

258
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,919
(Year 2021)

259
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,549
(Year 2022)

260
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,290
We have great chemistry about hanging out and all.

261
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:38,589
It really felt like hanging out with close friends.

262
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,529
It felt nice and fun.

263
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:48,369
(Year 2022)

264
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:55,569
(Year 2023)

265
00:12:55,570 --> 00:13:00,979
(Year 2023)

266
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,050
We traveled abroad when we wanted to relax.

267
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,649
(A trip to Nha Trang)

268
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:14,059
(A trip to Nha Trang)

269
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:19,099
(A trip to Tokyo)

270
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,069
We've been to almost everywhere.

271
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,800
We went everywhere together.

272
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,300
It was just so fun all the time.

273
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,839
Every moment was memorable.

274
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:33,749
(A trip to Phu Quoc)

275
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,719
(A trip to Phu Quoc)

276
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,989
The nine years didn't feel long.

277
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,690
I think I loved it so much...

278
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,990
when I was with her.

279
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,229
Honestly, it doesn't feel like we dated for eight years.

280
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:51,860
He was always nice to me, that it didn't feel that long.

281
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,500
Every year on her birthday, I brought her...

282
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,039
what she wanted to eat or have.

283
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,270
I put every effort into buying it for her.

284
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,809
She loved that.

285
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:03,979
(Min Kyung's 20th birthday)

286
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,039
(Yoo Sik's 20th birthday)

287
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,109
(Min Kyung's 21st birthday)

288
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,149
(Yoo Sik's 21st birthday)

289
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,449
(Yoo Sik's 22nd birthday)

290
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,219
(Min Kyung's 22nd birthday)

291
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,190
(Yoo Sik's 23rd birthday)

292
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,389
Happy birthday to you

293
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:24,299
Happy birthday, dear Min Kyung

294
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,400
Happy birthday to you

295
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,169
If I had spent my birthday with him this year,

296
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,740
it would have been the eighth birthday spent together.

297
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,280
What did you do on your birthday?

298
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,810
I spent it with my sister.

299
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,380
Why didn't you call me?

300
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,490
I knew it was your birthday, but...

301
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,930
I thought I didn't deserve to call you.

302
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,130
I see.

303
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,470
That's totally an excuse.

304
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,589
When we dated for such a long time,

305
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,330
you should have called me on my birthday, at least.

306
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,870
But it's natural you didn't.

307
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,940
We're not in a relationship anymore.

308
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,609
After he got busy because of his work,

309
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,010
we grew apart, I think.

310
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:53,650
I wanted to see him often as we used to do.

311
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,819
That's a relationship I wanted.

312
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,689
However, he thought differently, I guess.

313
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,659
He said, "I need to prepare for my future."

314
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,870
He told me he didn't want me to interfere with his work.

315
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,570
We argued the most about my schedule.

316
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,470
When she asked me about when she could meet me,

317
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,540
there were times I wasn't available for two whole weeks.

318
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,250
I am currently a manager at a dance company.

319
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,749
I need to practice for performances as a company member.

320
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,590
Now, I'm in the Seoul Metropolitan Opera...

321
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,720
where I need to practice for an opera.

322
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,160
When those practices are on the same day,

323
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:39,330
I need to stay from the morning to dawn the next day.

324
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,469
I teach at an academy,

325
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,430
and I give private lessons too.

326
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,839
That's why I don't have enough spare time.

327
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,910
(The dance company and lessons fill his schedule.)

328
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,040
I tried to understand him,

329
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,879
but I couldn't meet him...

330
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,080
even on our important anniversaries.

331
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,980
As time went by,

332
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,990
I had a feeling...

333
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,060
that I was put on the back burner.

334
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:11,060
I wondered if we had different values.

335
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:16,000
And from the moment I felt that we had different thoughts,

336
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,500
the crisis in our relationship began.

337
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,439
You need to consider it as preparation for the future.

338
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,709
But you can't help but feel you've become secondary.

339
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,809
I know. When you feel you become a lower priority...

340
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,809
- than the work...
- We need work,

341
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,019
but why do we feel upset?

342
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,219
I think it has nothing to do with your age.

343
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,779
- It's natural that you feel upset.
- It's natural.

344
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,049
You know you shouldn't, but you can't help it.

345
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,589
You want to understand...

346
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,059
- but you can't.
- You can't.

347
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,360
In reality, considering Yoo Sik's age,

348
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,729
it's about time he should work more...

349
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,629
- and in earnest.
- That's what I'm saying.

350
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,429
- That's indeed the reality.
- Right.

351
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,929
She knows it, but, naturally, she's upset.

352
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,369
She can feel upset. She can't help it.

353
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,699
- I guess Min Kyung has a job too, - Right.

354
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,139
But when one person waits for the other in a relationship,

355
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,909
they don't have a happy ending.

356
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,580
They end up like that after all.

357
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,149
We didn't meet on January 1,

358
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:06,020
although we promised we'd be together.

359
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,349
I saw him after almost two weeks had passed.

360
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,519
But when I met him,

361
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,160
he looked so tired.

362
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,559
He asked me if he could sleep for ten minutes.

363
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,700
I said okay, and he lay face down on the table.

364
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,200
I woke him up after ten minutes,

365
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,399
but he said, "I want to sleep five more minutes."

366
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,169
He went, "10 more minutes" and "Can I sleep for 30 minutes?"

367
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,779
He delayed waking up like that.

368
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,379
But I didn't want to waste time...

369
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,079
when we met after a long time.

370
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,680
Since I didn't like that,

371
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,820
I expressed...

372
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,590
my anger after I woke him up.

373
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,290
The atmosphere was bad.

374
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,560
She asked, "Why do you keep working when you feel this tired?"

375
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,230
"Why do you give many lessons,"

376
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,800
"and why do you schedule other work?"

377
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,070
Since I'm a freelancer,

378
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,770
if I turn down an offer once, I might keep turning them down.

379
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,750
I think she didn't understand enough about that.

380
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:14,090
Since we had such a conflict of opinion then,

381
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:19,290
I asked her, "Do you want me to quit every job and hang out?"

382
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,660
I lashed out at her, too.

383
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,699
After he works hard and establishes himself,

384
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,959
people around him can be happy.

385
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,570
That's what he said.

386
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,270
So I told him,

387
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,970
"I'm the one staying by your side now,"

388
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,170
"but I'm not happy at all."

389
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,420
"I just wait for you all the time,"

390
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,100
"and I feel so miserable."

391
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:03,830
That was what I said.

392
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,040
I guess I kept thinking about it.

393
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,610
If we break up, this must be the reason.

394
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,710
I thought that all the time.

395
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,649
I told him...

396
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:20,180
that we should break up, and it was the right thing to do.

397
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,050
I said, "Let's have some time to think."

398
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,719
"We need to sort out our relationship."

399
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,990
That's what I said to him.

400
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,059
She said it was tough for her...

401
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:34,030
if we were in a relationship without seeing often.

402
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:39,740
She said, "If you think that's fine, that won't work for me."

403
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,040
"We should break up."

404
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,679
Neither of us ever talked about breaking up...

405
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,820
in our relationship.

406
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,850
Seeing her say so,

407
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,720
I thought,

408
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,220
"She's determined today."

409
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,160
So I didn't want to hold on to her.

410
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,330
Then,

411
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,240
hs said, "I get it."

412
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,570
So it felt...

413
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,050
like the first time he answered.

414
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:30,150
(Their time together stopped like that.)

415
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,160
First of all,

416
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:38,260
I could see him in every place I was.

417
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,829
At my place, there were curtains he hung for me...

418
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,439
and a couch he moved for me.

419
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,800
In that manner, his traces were everywhere I went.

420
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,780
I don't know why he left so many traces.

421
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,480
In just every place...

422
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:02,950
(The traces of 9 years together were left everywhere.)

423
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,290
I literally couldn't do anything.

424
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,400
About one month later, it was my graduation ceremony.

425
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:17,130
I had thought she'd be by my side,

426
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,670
but she was not.

427
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:23,040
Something I had taken for granted wasn't there anymore.

428
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,280
That was when I realized our breakup the most.

429
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,520
When she wasn't there.

430
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,860
It felt like I lost one of my arms.

431
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,740
These days,

432
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,750
- I've been feeling very sad...
- Really?

433
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,580
About not having you by my side.

434
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:14,690
Recently, I went to a get-together to receive a wedding invitation.

435
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,000
They asked me as if it were the most natural thing,

436
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,630
"You guys are going strong, right?"

437
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,000
That's right.

438
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,040
But I couldn't answer the question. I ended up...

439
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,439
crying in the most pathetic way.

440
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
Really?

441
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,550
I don't usually cry. I don't.

442
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,820
You appeared in my dream at times.

443
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,750
You kept appearing in my dream.

444
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,220
It must've been hard.

445
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,360
- Me?
- Yes.

446
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,900
Now,

447
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,030
it's easier for me to talk about it.

448
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:00,240
I just have very good memories.

449
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,679
Now, I just feel a bit bad.

450
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:14,120
I didn't originally think that I was the decisive reason...

451
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,220
behind the breakup.

452
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:21,489
But the thought that I was at fault...

453
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:22,960
became clear.

454
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,700
I didn't let go of the things...

455
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,500
I should've let go.

456
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:36,610
I think I'll get upset if he apologizes to me.

457
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:39,840
Why do it now when he hasn't done it before?

458
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,450
What I've realized at this point...

459
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,949
is that my feelings aren't the same as before.

460
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,620
I had that thought.

461
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,259
"I've been getting over him too."

462
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,430
I've recently begun having that thought.

463
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,260
"I'll need to meet other people..."

464
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,660
"in order to have a good marriage."

465
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:04,269
"Is it worth dedicating my 20s to 1 person?"

466
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:08,540
I've had that thought since last year.

467
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:12,380
I want to meet someone new.

468
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:31,030
(Before moving in, time room)

469
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:37,700
(They expressed their feelings through time.)

470
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,890
Stop.

471
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,300
- Ninety percent?
- Oh, no.

472
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,769
I'm more interested in meeting someone new,

473
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,000
so I turned the clock hand that way.

474
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:23,880
I'm more interested in getting back together with my ex.

475
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:33,890
(3 o'clock, Yoo Sik 9 o'clock, Min Kyung)

476
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:39,130
(Yoo Sik wants his ex and Min Kyung wants someone new.)

477
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,469
- That's right.
- Yoo Sik.

478
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,629
Oh, no.

479
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,800
They're the exact...

480
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,399
- The exact opposites.
- They're the exact opposites.

481
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,409
I guess Yoo Sik is doing okay these days.

482
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,179
I guess he isn't as busy as he used to be.

483
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,209
- That's why he wants her back.
- That's why he wants her back.

484
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,579
- That moment comes to men.
- Yes.

485
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,749
- That's right.
- You feel like you can do it now.

486
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,819
That's right. You feel like you can do it now.

487
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,489
When you feel like you can do it now,

488
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:04,719
- it's too late.
- Yes, it's too late.

489
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,889
It's too late to rekindle the relationship.

490
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,190
They broke up already.

491
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:12,129
It's the same between friends. The more often you fight,

492
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,869
- the better you get at making up.
- That's right.

493
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,300
That way, the relationship can last longer.

494
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,769
But this couple rarely fought.

495
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,239
- That's right.
- So when they fought once,

496
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,939
it must've been more shocking.

497
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,009
You know how some couples are. "Did you guys break up again?"

498
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,449
Those couples stay together for ten years.

499
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,949
- They stay together for years.
- Yes.

500
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,079
But some people break up once after a steady relationship...

501
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,449
- and never see each other again.
- There are such people.

502
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,790
- The two of them are like that.
- It depends on your style.

503
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:41,590
I understand Min Kyung when I put myself in her shoes.

504
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,259
He must've been busy during their nine-year relationship.

505
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,260
That's right.

506
00:27:45,261 --> 00:27:47,999
- He must've been very busy before.
- That's right.

507
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,970
His actions might've been different then.

508
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,239
- Perhaps he saw him change.
- When he was very busy before,

509
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,499
he treated her well.

510
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,140
But nine years passed.

511
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,109
"What? Why does he treat me differently..."

512
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,810
- "when he's busy now?" - It's possible.

513
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,639
- She might've thought...
- She might've thought that.

514
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,949
That the reason was his lack of feelings, not a busy schedule.

515
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,879
She must've had many thoughts.

516
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,790
One time, I was in a relationship where I waited for the other person.

517
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,650
My work wasn't going well.

518
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,989
You waited for the other person.

519
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:16,060
I had to keep waiting for her.

520
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:17,959
I couldn't do anything.

521
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,999
I couldn't even eat.

522
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,799
- I stopped eating and drinking.
- Really?

523
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,100
Back then, my weight dropped to 55kg.

524
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,600
When we met, I became happy because she treated me well.

525
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,269
Of course. She treated you well.

526
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,609
Seeing her face made my anger dissipate.

527
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:32,779
It made your anger dissipate. Right.

528
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,710
After being in that kind of a relationship once,

529
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,580
I realized that I couldn't do it. I couldn't live my life.

530
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,189
Letting that person go is the only thing you can do.

531
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,220
You have to let that person go.

532
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,789
What kind of person was I to you?

533
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:48,860
During the relationship?

534
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,230
You were someone I wanted to protect.

535
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:02,110
(Yoo Sik and Min Kyung, July 29, 2017 to January 8, 2025)

536
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:11,220
(The first day of moving in)

537
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,380
Please sit here.

538
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,690
- What's your name?
- I'm Cho Yoo Sik.

539
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,490
- Yoo Sik?
- Yes.

540
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,100
I looked away quickly.

541
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,870
Had I looked, people would've known from my facial expression.

542
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,010
When I first saw him,

543
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:38,380
I thought that he was well-dressed.

544
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,879
But when he walked over, I could tell...

545
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,310
that his movements were choppy due to nervousness.

546
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,450
It was a bit funny.

547
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,650
He wasn't really on my mind.

548
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,560
I was more focused on my emotions.

549
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:57,360
She was on my mind. I didn't want to worry about her,

550
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,700
but it was impossible.

551
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,740
(That evening)

552
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,770
(My ex always protected me by my side.)

553
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,509
(Now, I hope he'll find someone nice he can lean on...)

554
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:18,420
(so that he wouldn't struggle.)

555
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,649
(I truly hope my ex will be happy.)

556
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,789
(Please take good care of him.)

557
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,920
It's sad.

558
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:30,660
I became certain that she had no feelings for me.

559
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,460
My heart felt heavy.

560
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,539
(His introduction from his ex let him know...)

561
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,800
(about Min Kyung's feeling.)

562
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:44,840
(Min Kyung)

563
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,910
(Thank you. Do well without getting stressed out.)

564
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,080
(Your ex picked you.)

565
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:01,460
I thought my ex would have no interest in me.

566
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,630
I was a bit surprised.

567
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:06,160
That's right. They even sat next to each other.

568
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,230
They really sat next to each other.

569
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,400
- Oh, no.
- They sat next to each other.

570
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,170
- His smile can't be genuine.
- Of course not.

571
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,870
It could suddenly be...

572
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,739
- It's possible.
- If that happens...

573
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,950
(Your ex did not pick you.)

574
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,919
Back then...

575
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,680
That's good.

576
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,090
- He's pouring soju.
- Yes.

577
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,860
It made me even more certain.

578
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:38,230
(He learned about Min Kyung's feelings through text.)

579
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,430
(Then came the farewell package.)

580
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:46,040
(It's light, right?)

581
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,410
The letter was about...

582
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:54,380
promising to stay together forever.

583
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,580
If that letter doesn't sway her,

584
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:02,050
she should choose the path that'll make her happy.

585
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,220
That was why I gave her the letter.

586
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,860
It didn't sway me.

587
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,230
It made me resent him a bit more.

588
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:19,670
Why is he doing this now?

589
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,309
I resented him.

590
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:25,009
(Even the letter with a promise to stay together forever...)

591
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,080
(didn't sway Min Kyung.)

592
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,780
(Was Yoo Sik a good person in your memories?)

593
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:33,420
(And now)

594
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:53,100
(I think it's half and half.)

595
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:05,350
(It seems like you still have feelings for him.)

596
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,590
(It seems like you still have feelings for him.)

597
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,340
(Is there anything else you want to ask?)

598
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,510
I didn't feel jealous.

599
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:39,650
"That person must be very interested in my x."

600
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,250
I had that thought.

601
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,330
(I think this is enough for today.)

602
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,770
(The chat ends.)

603
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,869
- Among the chats we've seen...
- It was the most aggressive.

604
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,609
- Yes.
- It was the most suspenseful.

605
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:06,610
My palms got sweaty.

606
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,109
Ji Hyeon is something else.

607
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,780
Ji Hyeon asked good questions.

608
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,750
When Min Kyung kept beating around the bush,

609
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,519
Ji Hyeon replied with questions that got to the actual meaning.

610
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,049
- That's right.
- That's right.

611
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:21,090
The questions felt like, "That's not what it means."

612
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,259
But they're roommates. This isn't good.

613
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,259
- Exactly.
- Once they find out.

614
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,159
She has to go on a date with Yoo Sik.

615
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,169
But I think Ji Hyeon...

616
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:33,039
won't let it bother her and will...

617
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,369
- stay true to her feelings.
- At her own pace?

618
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:36,370
- I think she'll really enjoy it.
- Right?

619
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:47,319
(Kwak Min Kyung, Cho Yoo Sik)

620
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,319
(Park Ji Hyeon)

621
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,319
(Sung Baek Hyun)

622
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,289
(Choi Yun Nyeong)

623
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:55,189
(Kim Woo Jin)

624
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,989
(Hong Ji Yeon)

625
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,900
(Jung Won Kyu)

626
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,550
(EXchange 4)

627
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,420
(Episode 3: Sweet and Bitter Moments)

628
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,920
(Pyeongchang-dong House)

629
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,760
(4th floor, Baek Hyun and Woo Jin's room)

630
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,760
(Groaning)

631
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:38,740
(The farewell package grabs Woo Jin's attention.)

632
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,679
(Knowing what it was, Woo Jin hesitated.)

633
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,520
(But he finally opens the farewell package.)

634
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:59,260
(Why did you open it today?)

635
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:02,190
I wanted to leave after checking it out.

636
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,130
That was why I could open it.

637
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,099
(As Woo Jin predicted, )

638
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,930
(Hodol and Baeksoon are in the farewell package.)

639
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:15,810
I guess I missed her just at that moment.

640
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,460
(Carrying two bottles of water, )

641
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:40,630
(Yoo Sik prepares for the first date.)

642
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,939
The two bottles of water show how experienced he is in dating.

643
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,239
- He knows what the ladies like...
- Yes.

644
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,579
Because he's been dating for years.

645
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,910
Open the hood, and you'll find everything, even mascara.

646
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,079
Why would mascara be inside the hood?

647
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,479
- He's just being open.
- Really.

648
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,049
"I've got this in the back" and all that.

649
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,649
Date for eight years, and you basically have everything.

650
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,419
Yes. He probably knows what the ladies need.

651
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,490
- Exactly.
- Yes.

652
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:10,659
(Ji Hyeon is also ready.)

653
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:14,000
(Checking herself out while going down the stairs)

654
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:19,640
(Checking herself out again before heading to the door)

655
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,080
(Checking herself out for the last time)

656
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,990
(Smiling)

657
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:44,290
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

658
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:50,370
- Are we going on a date?
- Yes.

659
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,840
- I'm in your care.
- Likewise.

660
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:59,179
(Ji Hyeon and Yoo Sik's pick-a-date)

661
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,240
- Off we go.
- Let's go.

662
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,750
- We're finally grabbing a bite.
- I know, right?

663
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,880
You're hungry, right?

664
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,080
Just a bit.

665
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,920
Even if we skip cooking tonight, we should do some grocery shopping.

666
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,060
I'm in.

667
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,729
It's Yoo Sik's first time...

668
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,399
- dating a girl as an adult.
- Yes.

669
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,400
A new person.

670
00:38:20,401 --> 00:38:22,569
From Yoo Sik's perspective, Ji Hyeon's image...

671
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,299
is the opposite of Min Kyung's.

672
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,499
- Yes.
- Totally.

673
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,769
- It's the complete opposite.
- This is...

674
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:28,409
- Yes, the complete opposite.
- You're right.

675
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:31,509
Ji Hyeon is tall and has a feminine look.

676
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,109
Even their appearances are totally different.

677
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,239
Min Kyung is a total baby.

678
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,310
- Exactly.
- Yes.

679
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,780
(It's already gone quiet inside the car.)

680
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,779
(Looking anxious)

681
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,820
(Fidgeting)

682
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,990
Have you tried apple and peanut butter together?

683
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,629
Do you like it?

684
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,499
- Have you tried it?
- I have.

685
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,299
- It helps lower your blood sugar.
- In the morning.

686
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,769
How about we buy those two?

687
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:57,799
- Shall we?
- If we go grocery shopping.

688
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,900
Do you like peanut butter?

689
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:02,010
- I do.
- I'm a big fan of peanut butter.

690
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,240
- The crunchy type?
- Yes.

691
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,410
We're quite alike.

692
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:09,049
- I like apples.
- Me too.

693
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,710
- I like peanut butter.
- Me too.

694
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,880
- Do you like strawberries?
- I do.

695
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:14,620
All set.

696
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,489
It's perfect to add in Greek yogurt.

697
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:18,960
(His taste in food gets a pass.)

698
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,690
All set.

699
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:24,830
Eonju.

700
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:28,059
This place is basically my playground.

701
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,070
Really?

702
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,500
We're really alike. Hey.

703
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,310
"My playground."

704
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:41,679
Did I exaggerate?

705
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,350
No, it's fine.

706
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:45,110
I know...

707
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,280
Gangnam well. Actually, really well.

708
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,160
I'm curious. It's driving me mad.

709
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,390
You being curious makes me happy.

710
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:57,090
- I'm really curious.
- Really?

711
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:00,600
What could it be?

712
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,070
If I had to pick someone, you'd be the first.

713
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,709
They seem to click.

714
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,009
Unexpectedly,

715
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:13,079
I think Ji Hyeon...

716
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,909
- is quite gentle.
- Yes.

717
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:17,749
Don't men suddenly get interested in women...

718
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,879
- when they show their interest?
- We do.

719
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,880
- Right?
- Yes.

720
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,749
Pork belly or pork shoulder?

721
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:25,860
Pork shoulder? Okay.

722
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,960
Why did you pick me?

723
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:34,100
After hearing the introduction from your ex,

724
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:38,430
the image I had of you changed the most.

725
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,940
What did you think of me?

726
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,040
Was your ex's introduction accurate?

727
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,480
About whom?

728
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,350
- Me?
- Yes.

729
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,580
Yes, more or less.

730
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:58,350
She was pretty accurate.

731
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,200
I don't think I even need to ask whether your ex...

732
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,430
described you accurately.

733
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,140
- Here's your order.
- He wrote it so nicely.

734
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:17,070
Thank you.

735
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,040
Are you good at grilling meat?

736
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,409
Meat? Yes.

737
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:23,449
I remember you grilled pork neck yesterday.

738
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:24,650
Yes.

739
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:29,149
Right. That made me curious about you.

740
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,950
- About what?
- Honestly,

741
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:34,460
your first impression was really cold.

742
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:36,190
- Because...
- Is that so?

743
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,330
Can I really be honest?

744
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:44,600
You seem like a playful person.

745
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,200
You seem like a playful person.

746
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:54,039
Really? The impression I had of him was docile.

747
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,679
- Is that so?
- He has a docile face.

748
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,309
- I agree.
- A puppy-like face.

749
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:59,579
A face like that is popular with women.

750
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,579
That's what people often say about handsome guys.

751
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,650
True.

752
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:06,360
But that's because you're good-looking.

753
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,189
I thought we wouldn't get along easily.

754
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:12,660
- Really?
- Yes.

755
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,430
I'm not like that.

756
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,630
- It's just...
- But...

757
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,269
that's what most people think at first.

758
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,299
(He gets judged by his first impression.)

759
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,500
- Your first impression?
- Yes.

760
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,240
And yesterday,

761
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:25,340
I would've been nervous.

762
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,240
Either way, that was my first impression of you.

763
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,110
But when you started grilling meat,

764
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,480
I thought, "He's grilling meat?"

765
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,019
(Last night)

766
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,619
I assumed...

767
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,290
I wouldn't be able to get along with him.

768
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,319
But seeing him grill meat...

769
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,990
with all his heart, wearing an apron,

770
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,960
was the complete opposite of the first impression...

771
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,370
I had of him.

772
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
For things like these...

773
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Did you think I'd order people around?

774
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,200
I thought you wouldn't do anything.

775
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:58,839
- I take care of everything.
- You do?

776
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:02,980
I prefer doing it myself.

777
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:04,710
That's nice.

778
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:08,989
- Peanuts.
- Peanuts?

779
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:11,720
(Giving the peanuts Yoo Sik likes)

780
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,330
First impression?

781
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,500
What was my first impression of you?

782
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:22,000
My first impression?

783
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,569
Should I say you looked different?

784
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:30,870
- Compared to the others.
- Me?

785
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:34,440
- Do you mean that in a good way?
- In a good way.

786
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:37,780
I like that. Thank you.

787
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:44,450
It looks good.

788
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:46,919
It's cooked.

789
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,289
(Yoo Sik offers it to Ji Hyeon first.)

790
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:50,330
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

791
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:55,200
It's delicious.

792
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:02,470
- You're really digging in.
- Because it's good.

793
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:07,080
- Talking to you...
- Yes?

794
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,379
Makes me want to know more about you.

795
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,810
Really?

796
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,890
It's really random, but do you like changing your hairstyle?

797
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,989
- I don't change it often.
- You don't?

798
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,190
Normally...

799
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,290
I'm a natural woman.

800
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:25,630
- "A natural woman?" - I prefer being comfortable.

801
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,259
I don't think anyone...

802
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,069
dresses up less than I do.

803
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:31,800
How little do you dress up?

804
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:34,139
I hate being uncomfortable,

805
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,909
- so normally...
- Really?

806
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:37,239
I do dress up when I have to.

807
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,509
But that's a rare occasion.

808
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,440
Really? Even though you're so good-looking?

809
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:46,350
Should we get some soju?

810
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:50,750
Why soju when I just complimented you?

811
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:52,690
- Because I'm happy.
- I see.

812
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:54,860
Can we get soju?

813
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:57,990
I'm overjoyed right now.

814
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,960
- Shall we leave?
- Thank you for the meal.

815
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:06,499
As expected, Ji Hyeon is being proactive.

816
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,669
- Exactly.
- Yes, she's being expressive.

817
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:10,539
I think that was one way of flirting with him.

818
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,979
"I normally am a natural woman."

819
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:15,309
When Yoo Sik was asked about his ideal style,

820
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:20,179
he said he didn't like flashiness.

821
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:22,689
But she said she only had showy clothes.

822
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:24,089
- Yes.
- You've got a great memory.

823
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:27,189
Ji Hyeon is making it clear that she usually...

824
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:29,590
- doesn't dress up much.
- She remembered it.

825
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,759
You watched it analytically.

826
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,060
He's like ChatGPT.

827
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,730
It's as if he's watched it 2 or 3 times already.

828
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:37,600
What color was she wearing on the first day?

829
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,470
What color was Ji Hyeon wearing?

830
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:44,470
On the other hand, Yoo Sik is a bit awkward.

831
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:47,079
It shows that he doesn't...

832
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,479
- have much experience...
- Right.

833
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,509
- Right.
- with other women.

834
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:51,249
- He looks awkward.
- He's awkward. But...

835
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:54,179
since he has a bit of curiosity and interest,

836
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:56,019
- he wants to ask.
- Right.

837
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,819
There are some awkward questions.

838
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:01,319
Ji Hyeon is breaking those moments.

839
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,459
It would be very new.

840
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,529
He's met someone new...

841
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:04,789
- for the first time.
- Right.

842
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:07,259
I think he's better than Dong Jin of the previous season.

843
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,699
- Right.
- Dong Jin was too awkward.

844
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:10,799
He was very...

845
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,299
He couldn't even talk...

846
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,669
- when he first dated Hye Won.
- Right.

847
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:16,240
They were very different.

848
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:18,910
Dosan Park.

849
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,679
It's been a while.

850
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:21,780
(Dosan Park)

851
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:23,810
Are you okay with walking?

852
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,920
Totally. I like walking.

853
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:28,550
I'm worried your legs would hurt.

854
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:32,790
Look. There's a lion.

855
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:34,859
(They met a lion at Dosan Park.)

856
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:35,889
- Amazing.
- Cute.

857
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:36,930
So cute.

858
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:38,060
She looks so gentle.

859
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:41,160
Her hair is tied.

860
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,870
- That's cute.
- I think she's a princess.

861
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:47,340
Do you like cats more?

862
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,670
- I like dogs more.
- You do?

863
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,210
What style of clothes did you say you liked?

864
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,210
A guy who looks good in shorts.

865
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:58,179
- What do you think?
- Shorts?

866
00:46:58,180 --> 00:46:59,720
Do you have shorts?

867
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,950
I do.

868
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:05,149
Do you like the mountains or the beach?

869
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:06,590
I was going to ask you that.

870
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,860
I...

871
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:13,000
- I still like the beach.
- The beach?

872
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:15,459
You look like you'd like the mountains.

873
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:17,330
- Mountains?
- You look like you'd like them.

874
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,070
Nice.

875
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:22,969
Nice.

876
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:25,310
The pedestrian didn't even notice. Give him a break.

877
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:28,540
What did he do wrong?

878
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:30,679
He was just passing by.

879
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,779
Why did he think of him as a dump truck?

880
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,349
It was as if a car was passing by.

881
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:36,789
- Like avoiding a car.
- He had nothing to do with them.

882
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:38,989
This means he's acting indifferent,

883
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:41,120
but he's a bit interested.

884
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:43,330
You look like you'd like the mountains.

885
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:45,260
- Mountains?
- You look like you'd like them.

886
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,599
I also like the beach.

887
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,800
Really?

888
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:54,440
What time did you sleep last night?

889
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,539
It was around 2:30am after washing up and lying down.

890
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,570
About 2:30am?

891
00:47:58,340 --> 00:47:59,810
Do you sleep a lot?

892
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,140
I don't sleep so much.

893
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:03,349
- Really?
- Why?

894
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:04,510
Do I look like I'd sleep all day?

895
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:05,720
A little.

896
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,979
I have all the bad things.

897
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:10,690
So you don't sleep so much.

898
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:14,220
On average, I sleep about four hours.

899
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,259
- Really?
- Yes.

900
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,660
Why do you only sleep for four hours?

901
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,200
My work ends late and starts early.

902
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:23,129
Your work? I'm really curious.

903
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:25,500
- It's crazy. I'm so curious.
- That's why.

904
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:26,670
What is it?

905
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,540
It's my greed,

906
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,410
but I keep trying to do something.

907
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:33,010
That's amazing.

908
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:35,410
You are?

909
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:37,150
Are you praising yourself?

910
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:38,510
Just you.

911
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:41,880
That's crazy.

912
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:49,229
Saying "just you" wasn't flirting.

913
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:52,159
Her saying that his style of looking for more work was cool...

914
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,059
sounds like flirting to me.

915
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,970
I think Ji Hyeon...

916
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:58,899
really likes Yoo Sik,

917
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,299
and whatever he says, she compliments him.

918
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,709
Right.

919
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:05,440
She's trying to see everything nicely.

920
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:08,039
"I recently fell down while working..."

921
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,609
"and was given a four-week leave."

922
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:10,910
- "That's cool." - "Of course."

923
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:12,849
Whatever he does, "Just you."

924
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:14,949
"You even fall down in such a cool way."

925
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:17,049
It's a stage where she keeps praising him.

926
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:18,620
- "Just you." - Right.

927
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,220
"Just you."

928
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,290
I was very thankful that she chose me.

929
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:26,930
She kept complimenting me a lot.

930
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:29,000
I thought, "She's a really nice person."

931
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:34,369
(They dropped by the supermarket before going home.)

932
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:36,170
With a cart?

933
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,540
What did they tell us to buy?

934
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:39,410
Here's what we need to buy.

935
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:41,740
- Bread.
- Bread, jam.

936
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:44,380
- Eggs, milk, garlic.
- Onion.

937
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:47,080
It's not here.

938
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,790
- There's peanut butter.
- Where?

939
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:54,990
- You like the chunky one.
- Yes.

940
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:56,190
Let's have the chunky one.

941
00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:00,759
It was the first time choosing things together...

942
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,960
to eat at home.

943
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:05,130
It felt like we were dating.

944
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,170
- I should get another box.
- Yes.

945
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:15,280
He was very considerate in the small things.

946
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:19,880
- I can carry this.
- This...

947
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:22,820
- That's heavy.
- No. I can do it.

948
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,890
Yoo Sik didn't let me carry...

949
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:28,060
even something small.

950
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,690
Watching that,

951
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:35,870
I thought, "He would be such a great person..."

952
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:37,470
"to be with."

953
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,770
- Already?
- Already?

954
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:44,169
- Already?
- You know?

955
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:45,939
With Yoo Sik's story,

956
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:48,739
the period of being single, and his position,

957
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,349
the type of person who can break those...

958
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:52,210
- is Ji Hyeon.
- That's right.

959
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:53,380
You know, right?

960
00:50:53,381 --> 00:50:55,449
That could make him ready for another relationship.

961
00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:57,720
- That's how.
- That mindset.

962
00:50:58,790 --> 00:50:59,790
(Pyeongchang-dong House)

963
00:50:59,791 --> 00:51:01,759
Do you drive?

964
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,590
- I'll drive.
- Okay.

965
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:06,360
It looks so cute.

966
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:12,870
(Min Kyung and Baek Hyun's pick-a-date)

967
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:16,870
Let's have fun.

968
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,610
- Shall we?
- Yes.

969
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:22,480
You felt...

970
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:25,679
a little different yesterday.

971
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,620
- Yes?
- You...

972
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:32,420
looked very blunt on the outside,

973
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:36,260
but you seemed like the type who quietly looks out for you.

974
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:37,890
A tsundere.

975
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:40,900
It seemed like you were quietly paying attention to everything.

976
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:42,300
To the people around.

977
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,530
- Yesterday.
- In everything.

978
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:48,139
This is nice. I like their vibe.

979
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:49,839
Why do they look so good together?

980
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,969
Right. They really look good together.

981
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:53,580
Baek Hyun looks like a rhinoceros.

982
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,579
Rhinoceros.

983
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,649
Why? Rhinoceros types are cool.

984
00:51:57,650 --> 00:51:59,080
Why don't you get rammed by one?

985
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:00,879
Get rammed by one.

986
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,249
You would know how they are. Get rammed by one.

987
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:04,719
Don't you know the rhinoceros types?

988
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,259
There are no rhinoceros types.

989
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:07,819
- I've never heard of that.
- Does it exist?

990
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:08,889
- You've never heard it, right?
- Really?

991
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:10,229
- I've never heard it before.
- It doesn't exist.

992
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:11,829
I've heard of dinosaur types.

993
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:13,699
Don't you know what rhinoceros types are?

994
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,259
I've never heard of that.

995
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:16,399
What is a rhinoceros type?

996
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,399
- Name a celebrity.
- What celebrity is that type?

997
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,469
(What celebrity is a rhinoceros type?)

998
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,439
I think I know what she means.

999
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,009
- What does she mean?
- This is frustrating.

1000
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:24,769
- Literally, a rhinoceros type.
- A rhinoceros type.

1001
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:25,840
What?

1002
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:28,209
- Dependable.
- Dependable.

1003
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:29,709
- Manly.
- Manly.

1004
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:31,210
Dependable?

1005
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,550
You know nothing about rhinos.

1006
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:35,579
You should see one in person.

1007
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:37,589
This is a compliment.

1008
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:38,720
(He's even looking it up.)

1009
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:40,959
- It really exists.
- Right?

1010
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,359
A long, square-shaped face with a strong jaw,

1011
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,659
and a thick broad forehead that make the features look angular.

1012
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,799
- That's right.
- He fits the description.

1013
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,099
Right. He will rise as the new rhinoceros type.

1014
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,500
- The rookie.
- The rookie.

1015
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:54,069
- Let's keep watching.
- It exists.

1016
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:55,769
Let's see if he charges.

1017
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:57,970
I think the rhinoceros will stay on my mind.

1018
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:00,109
I said that because he looked cool.

1019
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:02,110
- It is a compliment.
- He's really cool.

1020
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,310
But...

1021
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:08,420
I didn't think you would come. I didn't think you'd apply for it.

1022
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,190
- Right?
- I didn't expect it.

1023
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:15,319
I had been thinking about it from the first moment.

1024
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,489
Really?

1025
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:19,359
So I told the other female cast members first.

1026
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,260
They were still thinking.

1027
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:24,700
I just told them I'd go first.

1028
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:27,639
- Really?
- I was glad I said that.

1029
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:28,940
- You were?
- Yes.

1030
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:31,639
You seemed to have gotten very close to the other men.

1031
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,879
Right. It was thanks to Yoo Sik.

1032
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:34,880
Right.

1033
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:37,310
They all seemed to have a nice personality.

1034
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:41,580
I don't know about Yoo Sik.

1035
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:43,050
Why? Don't you like him?

1036
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,990
- It became a bromance.
- Right, bromance.

1037
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:49,560
We had very many things in common.

1038
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,860
We both have two sisters.

1039
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,230
You have two older sisters, right?

1040
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:57,899
I have younger sisters.

1041
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:58,969
I see.

1042
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:01,139
(Yoo Sik has two older sisters.)

1043
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:02,140
Amazing.

1044
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:04,270
We have similar tastes as well.

1045
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:07,940
We also like similar styles of clothes.

1046
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,509
It shouldn't be like that. I don't know why it keeps...

1047
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:13,450
- Why do you two keep...
- I know.

1048
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:17,189
They keep talking.

1049
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:18,949
- Stop it. You're like a rhino.
- Stop.

1050
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:20,319
Don't charge.

1051
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,459
Don't charge on the questions.

1052
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:22,889
- Please don't.
- Don't do that.

1053
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:24,929
Maybe that's why she was drawn to him. He...

1054
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:26,699
- was very similar to him.
- I think that's what happened.

1055
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,060
She was instinctively drawn to him.

1056
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:32,000
It shouldn't be like that. I don't know why it keeps...

1057
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:33,870
- Why do you two keep...
- I know.

1058
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:36,240
This is trouble.

1059
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:46,620
I thought he had so many things in common with my ex.

1060
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:49,990
I was worried,

1061
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:53,120
but I also liked it.

1062
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:58,060
(Why were you worried?)

1063
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:02,260
I was worried because...

1064
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:04,800
I might like him too much.

1065
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,440
- Like Baek Hyun too much?
- Really?

1066
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:08,639
- Really?
- What?

1067
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,069
Maybe she thought...

1068
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:12,979
he was closer to her type than Yoo Sik.

1069
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:14,809
- That's right.
- That's possible.

1070
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:16,879
If he's similar to Yoo Sik...

1071
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,349
but isn't as busy as him,

1072
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:23,549
- he could be perfect for her.
- Right.

1073
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:25,390
- If he's not busy.
- Yes.

1074
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:28,019
- He could have a relaxed mind.
- In that case,

1075
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,389
- he could be the best choice.
- She could fall for him.

1076
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:32,229
I think they could work better.

1077
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:34,659
Yoo Sik seems to be more emotional.

1078
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:36,269
Baek Hyun is more...

1079
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:37,829
- He's more manly.
- He's manly.

1080
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:39,169
- He's manly.
- Yes. He's manly.

1081
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:40,599
- He's like a rhinoceros.
- A rhinoceros.

1082
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,670
He has that image.

1083
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:47,339
Hyehwa-dong.

1084
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:49,650
(Daehak-ro)

1085
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:54,819
The place I had the last date with my ex...

1086
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,150
was Hyehwa Station.

1087
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:57,889
We watched a play,

1088
00:55:57,890 --> 00:56:01,620
went to a cafe we liked, and drank coffee.

1089
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:03,960
It was a place with such memories.

1090
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:08,359
It felt new to go there...

1091
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,769
with a new date.

1092
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:11,670
It felt very interesting.

1093
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:17,070
(ILLT Coffee)

1094
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:22,680
- Hello.
- Hello.

1095
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:28,920
It looks tasty.

1096
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,950
I'll do it. Thank you.

1097
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:35,960
Thank you.

1098
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:38,330
I've been to many cafes,

1099
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,430
but I've never seen a teacup this big.

1100
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:44,330
Chamomile.

1101
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,399
It's good.

1102
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,309
I drink chamomile tea every morning.

1103
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:51,739
Really? Did you bring it here?

1104
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:52,809
I did.

1105
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:54,980
I drink it with warm water.

1106
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,650
- Really?
- Yes.

1107
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:58,810
I put the chamomile tea in a mug cup,

1108
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:01,750
take it out, and drink it when I walk.

1109
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:03,990
You seem to be a sentimental person.

1110
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,289
I do have a sentimental side.

1111
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:08,459
- But when I'm with my friends, - You aren't sentimental?

1112
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:11,090
I'm very talkative.

1113
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:13,900
I can see what kind of person you are.

1114
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,400
How was it yesterday?

1115
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:21,300
I'd like to know how you felt...

1116
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:22,870
when you arrived.

1117
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:28,839
I was curious about people who were coming.

1118
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,750
Right. A sense of curiosity.

1119
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,579
I was the first one to arrive.

1120
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,750
- Right.
- I was the first resident.

1121
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:38,389
It turned out for the better.

1122
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:39,589
Was it more comfortable?

1123
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:42,619
- I was the first one...
- You could meet everyone.

1124
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:43,889
To meet everyone.

1125
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:47,530
That must be why you looked so relaxed.

1126
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:49,670
- Did I look very relaxed?
- It was interesting.

1127
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:51,669
You stood out to me.

1128
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:52,900
- Really?
- Yes.

1129
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,470
(On their first day)

1130
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,640
What were you doing?

1131
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:04,809
I was zoning out and looking outside.

1132
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:08,750
(Her first impression of Baek Hyun was ease and calm.)

1133
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:12,550
I was the only one in a single-seat couch.

1134
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,460
How did you end up picking that seat?

1135
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:20,000
I sat there because I could get a nice view.

1136
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:21,799
(Glancing)

1137
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:22,970
That's interesting.

1138
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:25,700
What?

1139
00:58:25,701 --> 00:58:27,369
- You have thumbnails...
- Are they big?

1140
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:30,810
Of an artist. My thumbnails are the same.

1141
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:32,210
What did you say?

1142
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:34,339
- You're an artist.
- An artist?

1143
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:37,509
Many artists have thumbnails like yours.

1144
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:41,080
- Really?
- My nails are long right now,

1145
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:42,819
- but I have wide thumbnails too.
- There it is.

1146
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:44,449
- Like this.
- It's the same as mine.

1147
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:45,490
Right?

1148
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:47,590
Are you an artist?

1149
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:50,889
They say that you're dexterous...

1150
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:54,430
- when you have wide thumbnails.
- I see.

1151
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,800
Are you dexterous?

1152
00:58:55,801 --> 00:58:57,900
Yes, I like making things with my hands.

1153
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:01,140
Me too. Except cooking.

1154
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:04,069
Let's say that I have to make something.

1155
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:05,070
Why don't you like to cook?

1156
00:59:05,071 --> 00:59:07,740
It's because I haven't done a lot of cooking.

1157
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:11,110
I bet you don't like cooking because you're not used to it.

1158
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:13,680
You don't seem like a bad cook. You have basic skills.

1159
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,050
The sauce that you made yesterday...

1160
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:19,150
- I'm not trying to compliment you.
- Really?

1161
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:21,060
It was really delicious.

1162
00:59:21,061 --> 00:59:22,619
- Honestly...
- I'll try harder next time.

1163
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:25,560
The green onion salad doesn't do justice to my cooking.

1164
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:26,930
Really?

1165
00:59:26,931 --> 00:59:29,260
I'll make you something much better...

1166
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,299
- like a chop steak.
- A chop steak?

1167
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:32,769
Yes, I promise.

1168
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:35,400
- I learned the recipe...
- It sounds delicious.

1169
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,909
- You did?
- from my mom.

1170
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:37,910
Really?

1171
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:41,879
I'll try to make it based on what I remember.

1172
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,009
You'll do a good job.

1173
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:44,509
I'll make it very well...

1174
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:45,950
when I get a chance next time.

1175
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:50,920
You look very attractive when you smile.

1176
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:54,819
- Me? Because of my dimples?
- You have dimples.

1177
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:56,930
The corners of your mouth go up.

1178
00:59:57,730 --> 00:59:58,860
- The corners of my mouth?
- Yes.

1179
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,100
When you smile.

1180
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:07,870
I'd like to have dimples, but I don't.

1181
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:10,540
- Give them to me.
- My dimples?

1182
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:12,770
No way.

1183
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:20,079
She's very good.

1184
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,280
"Give me your dimples."

1185
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:23,490
We heard many memorable lines today.

1186
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:25,919
Min Kyung is very forward.

1187
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:26,989
- Yes.
- Right.

1188
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:28,019
But her flirting is different...

1189
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:29,519
- It's light.
- from Ji Hyeon's. Yes, it's light.

1190
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,529
It's very lighthearted.

1191
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:33,560
She gives him compliments without adding personal feelings.

1192
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:34,929
- Yes.
- Because of that,

1193
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:37,570
it's comfortable for the other person to accept them.

1194
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:41,500
- The weather is so nice today.
- I agree.

1195
01:00:41,770 --> 01:00:44,270
I haven't been to Naksan Park in a long time.

1196
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,939
Isn't it beautiful?

1197
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:48,709
Give it to me. I'll take a photo of you walking up.

1198
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:51,350
- Me?
- Let's take a look.

1199
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,180
You trust me, right?

1200
01:00:57,490 --> 01:00:58,490
Do I look funny?

1201
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:01,060
No, wait. I'll take a photo in the count of three.

1202
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:04,230
One, two, three.

1203
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:06,030
(Clicking)

1204
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,360
- Doesn't it...
- It came out well.

1205
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:10,399
- Gosh.
- Aren't I good at taking photos?

1206
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,400
Yes.

1207
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:13,670
I like it.

1208
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:17,240
I suggested taking a photo of her.

1209
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:22,640
She made a cute pose while holding up one leg.

1210
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:25,250
She was very cute at that moment.

1211
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,179
She was very cute.

1212
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:29,350
I wanted to take good photos of her.

1213
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:30,649
I tried my best.

1214
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:32,950
I hope that Min Kyung will like the photos.

1215
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:34,990
It was that moment when she was the cutest.

1216
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:37,459
You have to make me look tall.

1217
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,160
Tall? You're already tall.

1218
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,130
Gosh, go farther.

1219
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:47,140
- That looks good.
- Did it come out well?

1220
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:50,870
- What do you think?
- It looks so blurry.

1221
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:54,080
- I must be bad at taking photos.
- Let me see it.

1222
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:58,350
- I'll do it again. I'll do my best.
- Seriously.

1223
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:00,279
I gave my all to take photos of you.

1224
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:01,450
I'll make you look amazing.

1225
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:14,030
- That doesn't look bad.
- Right?

1226
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:16,399
- It came out well.
- Really?

1227
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,070
- It came out well.
- Yes.

1228
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:19,830
Thank you.

1229
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,440
- Can I tie my shoelaces...
- Later...

1230
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:25,109
Shall I do it for you? I'll do it.

1231
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:26,110
No.

1232
01:02:26,111 --> 01:02:27,980
- It's no big deal.
- Oh, my.

1233
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,849
- Gosh, thank you.
- You're wearing a skirt.

1234
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:37,550
- Thank you.
- If you were wearing pants,

1235
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:40,090
- you could do it.
- Thank you.

1236
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:47,730
Whenever my shoelaces got untied,

1237
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,760
my ex tied them for me.

1238
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:52,930
This time, Baek Hyun tied them for me.

1239
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,440
I was a little surprised.

1240
01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:59,979
"I might feel a wider range of emotions here."

1241
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:02,240
That's what I thought.

1242
01:03:04,310 --> 01:03:06,780
Can you show me the photos again?

1243
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:13,120
Do you want me to take more photos of you?

1244
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,290
Let me see it.

1245
01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:19,759
It's because I'm nervous.

1246
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,199
- You're nervous?
- I'm very good at taking photos.

1247
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,729
- Really? Are you nervous?
- It's because I'm nervous.

1248
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:24,770
Really?

1249
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,670
- It came out well.
- Right?

1250
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:31,170
I'm so grateful.

1251
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:33,680
It'll be memorable, don't you think?

1252
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:35,409
I like this one.

1253
01:03:35,410 --> 01:03:36,410
In this photo...

1254
01:03:36,411 --> 01:03:38,049
(They make a memory together for the first time.)

1255
01:03:38,050 --> 01:03:39,780
You can't see the background clearly.

1256
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:46,090
Which do you prefer, a cat-like or a dog-like face?

1257
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:48,790
- A rhinoceros-like face.
- Rhinoceros?

1258
01:03:48,990 --> 01:03:50,430
- He has a rhinoceros-like face.
- Rhinoceros.

1259
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:53,800
She ended up bringing up face types.

1260
01:03:55,330 --> 01:03:58,169
Which do you prefer, a cat-like or a dog-like face?

1261
01:03:58,170 --> 01:04:01,070
I definitely like girls with a cat-like face.

1262
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:03,410
There's no trace of cats on my face.

1263
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,810
- If you had to choose...
- I look like Squirtle.

1264
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:08,680
- Am I wrong?
- Let me see.

1265
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:14,449
Squirtle? The one that I know?

1266
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:15,450
Yes.

1267
01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:21,520
We could talk to each other easily.

1268
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:24,590
Our date was comfortable.

1269
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:29,900
I was happy to go on my first date with Baek Hyun.

1270
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,200
The weather was so nice...

1271
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:36,240
that simply walking together made my heart flutter.

1272
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:38,109
Aren't they interested...

1273
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:39,539
- in each other?
- Aren't they?

1274
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:40,779
- Don't you agree?
- Yes.

1275
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:41,979
- I agree.
- Me too.

1276
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:45,079
Baek Hyun and Min Kyung hit it off.

1277
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:46,309
Their personalities match.

1278
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:47,619
Watching them made me happy.

1279
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:48,620
- Yes.
- And it felt comfortable.

1280
01:04:48,621 --> 01:04:52,350
The chemistry between them made me smile naturally.

1281
01:04:52,450 --> 01:04:54,059
I want to root for them.

1282
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:56,019
Are you going to root for them?

1283
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:58,429
A while ago, I hoped that Min Kyung would...

1284
01:04:58,430 --> 01:05:00,760
get back together with Yoo Sik.

1285
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,569
- Now, I changed my mind.
- Right.

1286
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:05,329
My mind also changes every time I watch the video.

1287
01:05:05,330 --> 01:05:06,330
- Right.
- It changes every time.

1288
01:05:06,331 --> 01:05:08,039
It means that they make a good match.

1289
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:11,040
In the chat room, Baek Hyun's ex said that...

1290
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:13,679
he only talks to people that he's interested in.

1291
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,980
He only takes photos with people he's close to.

1292
01:05:16,310 --> 01:05:18,749
- He did both.
- He was enthusiastic...

1293
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:20,049
- about taking good photos of her.
- Right.

1294
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:21,179
He took good photos of her.

1295
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:22,449
- He's definitely interested in her.
- Exactly.

1296
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:23,450
He's interested in her.

1297
01:05:23,451 --> 01:05:25,549
Their feelings for each other seemed clearly mutual.

1298
01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:26,690
- They were mutual.
- I agree.

1299
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:28,489
There will be sparks between them.

1300
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:31,660
I will be rooting for them quietly.

1301
01:05:32,290 --> 01:05:34,460
(Yun Nyeong and Woo Jin's pick-a-date)

1302
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:37,270
- Here we go.
- Let's go.

1303
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:41,900
The weather is so bad.

1304
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,569
- The weather?
- It's so gloomy.

1305
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:47,110
(It's a little cloudy.)

1306
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:51,149
Isn't it the perfect weather to wear denim?

1307
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:52,779
- If it was sunny, - Right.

1308
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:54,280
- it would've been hot.
- Right.

1309
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:56,420
Denim looks good on you.

1310
01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:01,060
It looks good on you.

1311
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:03,390
(What is Yun Nyeong's ideal type?)

1312
01:06:03,590 --> 01:06:06,489
A man wearing denim.

1313
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:09,729
I know that she likes men in denim jackets...

1314
01:06:09,730 --> 01:06:12,370
or denim shirts instead of jeans.

1315
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,900
So I dressed in denim from top to bottom.

1316
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:17,370
It looked very good on him.

1317
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:21,340
So I got more interested in him.

1318
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,579
Yong Jin is also wearing denim today.

1319
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:27,619
Yes, I talked about Yun Nyeong a lot.

1320
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:28,620
Really?

1321
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:31,090
It looks good on you.

1322
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:35,920
When I saw you for the first time, I thought your hair looked nice.

1323
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:39,059
On the first day? When I arrived yesterday?

1324
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:41,300
Yes, but your hand made a stronger impression on me.

1325
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:43,200
Oh, no.

1326
01:06:44,370 --> 01:06:45,899
Your hand was remarkable.

1327
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:47,270
You were bleeding as soon as you arrived.

1328
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:50,670
When you arrive,

1329
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:54,910
you have an image of yourself that you want to show.

1330
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:56,909
- Right.
- I had one in mind.

1331
01:06:56,910 --> 01:06:58,680
What image did you want to show?

1332
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:02,149
Someone who's serious.

1333
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:03,590
- Really?
- Yes.

1334
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:07,589
I wanted to look like someone who's clean and calm.

1335
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:08,920
Really?

1336
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:10,020
But I started to bleed.

1337
01:07:10,021 --> 01:07:13,289
You were bleeding a lot when you came in.

1338
01:07:13,290 --> 01:07:15,830
So I thought,

1339
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,270
"I'm in trouble."

1340
01:07:18,670 --> 01:07:22,070
No, it's okay. You made yourself memorable.

1341
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:24,670
Do you like dogs?

1342
01:07:24,770 --> 01:07:26,340
I like both dogs and cats.

1343
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:29,110
What about other animals?

1344
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:31,009
- Like lizards.
- Goodness.

1345
01:07:31,010 --> 01:07:32,279
- You don't like them?
- No.

1346
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,550
- Seriously?
- Yes.

1347
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,549
- You can't touch lizards?
- No.

1348
01:07:36,550 --> 01:07:38,020
Seriously? Me neither.

1349
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,790
Right? You were asking...

1350
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:43,019
like someone who liked lizards.

1351
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:44,760
Right? What about snakes?

1352
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:47,760
What? Why would I touch a snake?

1353
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,159
You could hold one up.

1354
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,030
- Why would I hold one?
- I mean...

1355
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,370
There are cafes with snakes.

1356
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:56,199
Why would you go to a cafe with snakes?

1357
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,240
- A cafe with snakes...
- I wouldn't go there.

1358
01:07:59,570 --> 01:08:02,840
So that's what you're wondering about.

1359
01:08:03,410 --> 01:08:06,079
I wouldn't go out of my way to go to a snake cafe.

1360
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:07,250
- You wouldn't?
- I wouldn't go out of my way.

1361
01:08:07,350 --> 01:08:09,919
There are so many other cafes. I'd go to an ordinary cafe.

1362
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:10,920
Why a snake cafe?

1363
01:08:12,150 --> 01:08:14,420
Where do you think we're going right now?

1364
01:08:15,490 --> 01:08:16,490
To get wine?

1365
01:08:16,590 --> 01:08:18,759
- Do you want some wine?
- Aren't we going to get wine?

1366
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:21,029
- Or are we going out for a drink?
- What do you want to do?

1367
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:23,030
We aren't going to a snake cafe, are we?

1368
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,970
- No way.
- You don't want to?

1369
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:28,800
(Things became a little difficult.)

1370
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,470
If we're going to a snake cafe...

1371
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:33,170
Seriously.

1372
01:08:33,171 --> 01:08:35,040
If you want photos, I'll take them.

1373
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:36,510
That's all I can do.

1374
01:08:37,350 --> 01:08:38,780
I won't get my photos taken.

1375
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:40,679
- You won't hold it for photos.
- No.

1376
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:42,879
- Really?
- I won't touch it.

1377
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,089
Looking at it will be enough.

1378
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:46,320
Unfortunately, we aren't going to a snake cafe.

1379
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:47,860
That's too bad.

1380
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:49,660
I really wanted to go there.

1381
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,329
The energy is so different with these two.

1382
01:08:52,330 --> 01:08:53,599
Her reactions are so enthusiastic.

1383
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:54,699
She's very cheerful.

1384
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:55,729
I want to know what everyone thinks.

1385
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:58,299
Someone you love wants to go and see snakes for a date.

1386
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,029
- Somewhere eccentric?
- Yes. How would you react...

1387
01:09:00,030 --> 01:09:01,369
if your girlfriend wants that?

1388
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:03,199
I'm not very fond of fish.

1389
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:06,210
We have a teammate named Lee Han.

1390
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:08,309
When we go on a tour abroad,

1391
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:11,079
- he always visits the aquarium.
- The aquarium.

1392
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,280
I always accompany him.

1393
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:13,680
- He really does that.
- I'm the type...

1394
01:09:13,681 --> 01:09:14,749
to do what the other wants...

1395
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:16,220
- You're like that.
- even if I want to rest.

1396
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:22,060
(Nike Style)

1397
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:24,860
- It'll be so much fun.
- It'll be so much fun.

1398
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:26,030
Nike?

1399
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,630
- Shall we make it for each other?
- That sounds good.

1400
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:32,569
Don't complain even if it's weird.

1401
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:33,640
Of course not.

1402
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:36,770
What am I going to do?

1403
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:38,810
You'll wear it, right?

1404
01:09:40,170 --> 01:09:42,140
- You have to wear it.
- Of course.

1405
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:45,050
It looks like you in denim today.

1406
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:48,680
- It's me.
- So, I'll go with this one.

1407
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:53,120
(Staring)

1408
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,330
- Are you picking the best color?
- Yes.

1409
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:03,400
Which color suits me?

1410
01:10:03,830 --> 01:10:05,470
Since you have a pale face,

1411
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:08,900
bright colors will suit you.

1412
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:11,610
Colorful items will suit you.

1413
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:15,180
- So, I'll choose the colorful ones.
- Okay. I'll trust you.

1414
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:19,909
Are you going to use a number?

1415
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:20,950
I'm going to use a number too.

1416
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:23,920
Shall I add number one as well?

1417
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:28,560
- Number 1?
- It's the 1st date, so number 1.

1418
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,159
Actually, that was why I wanted to add a number.

1419
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,189
- Really?
- Yes.

1420
01:10:32,190 --> 01:10:33,329
That was why I held up numbers.

1421
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:35,130
I really like this.

1422
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:36,930
- Number one makes it cool.
- Yes.

1423
01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:40,199
He was like, "Where should I put number one?"

1424
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,270
He was so cute.

1425
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:45,210
It was nice.

1426
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:47,709
They're putting a meaning into the hats.

1427
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:49,279
When their exes see the hats...

1428
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,809
- That's right.
- They'll get angry.

1429
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:52,349
"Why didn't you wear the matching hat?"

1430
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:53,720
"Why did you wear the matching hat?"

1431
01:10:56,450 --> 01:10:57,650
It's so pretty.

1432
01:10:58,050 --> 01:10:59,450
Thank you.

1433
01:10:59,690 --> 01:11:00,719
The back is the key point.

1434
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:01,789
(Impressed)

1435
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:02,960
It's pretty, right?

1436
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:04,529
It's so cute.

1437
01:11:04,530 --> 01:11:05,790
Shall we take a photo?

1438
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:09,300
It's cute.

1439
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,469
Number one looks so timid.

1440
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:14,069
There weren't many places...

1441
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:15,670
- to put it.
- It looks so timid.

1442
01:11:17,410 --> 01:11:18,969
(They made the first memory together.)

1443
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:21,340
- Shall we go and drink wine?
- Let's go.

1444
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:25,710
(Pimfy)

1445
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:27,920
- This place is so pretty.
- Yes.

1446
01:11:30,050 --> 01:11:31,849
- The weather is so nice.
- Seriously.

1447
01:11:31,850 --> 01:11:33,790
I haven't been to Hongdae in a long while.

1448
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:35,560
It also has been a long while for me.

1449
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:39,690
It's so cute.

1450
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:41,330
I think...

1451
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:43,500
it resembles me a bit.

1452
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:46,730
- It's a bit flippant.
- Flippant.

1453
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:47,840
It's a bit flippant.

1454
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,440
I have a flippant side, right?

1455
01:11:51,570 --> 01:11:52,839
- Not yet?
- No, not yet.

1456
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,839
- Really?
- I haven't seen that side yet.

1457
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,679
I said this yesterday too.

1458
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,650
- You spread happiness.
- I spread happiness?

1459
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:00,079
Seriously.

1460
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,919
Being with you puts people in a good mood.

1461
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,080
- Really?
- Yes.

1462
01:12:03,450 --> 01:12:04,520
It's very nice.

1463
01:12:05,790 --> 01:12:07,120
Is it because I give good reactions?

1464
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:09,789
I'll go ahead...

1465
01:12:09,790 --> 01:12:10,959
(Feeling embarrassed, she talks about the hat.)

1466
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:11,990
and wear this hat well.

1467
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:14,959
Isn't Yun Nyeong...

1468
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:16,529
- really cheerful?
- She's lovely.

1469
01:12:16,530 --> 01:12:18,369
- Right?
- Yes, she's lovely.

1470
01:12:18,370 --> 01:12:20,299
Watching her surprised me.

1471
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:22,570
I didn't know that it was possible to laugh all day long.

1472
01:12:22,870 --> 01:12:24,240
That's right. Seriously.

1473
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,050
- There's a samoyed.
- What?

1474
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:34,950
It's cute.

1475
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:37,590
Dogs are so cute.

1476
01:12:38,190 --> 01:12:40,119
I love dogs so much.

1477
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:43,020
- What's the name of your dog?
- My dog?

1478
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:44,429
- Howl.
- Howl?

1479
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:45,729
- Yes.
- Why is it Howl?

1480
01:12:45,730 --> 01:12:46,730
- Howl?
- Yes.

1481
01:12:46,731 --> 01:12:48,630
You resemble Howl from "Howl's Moving Castle" a bit.

1482
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,200
That was sudden.

1483
01:12:51,770 --> 01:12:53,030
- Howl?
- Did you watch it?

1484
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:55,199
I didn't watch it, but I know what it is.

1485
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,739
Really? You resemble him.

1486
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:59,009
- Really?
- Yes.

1487
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:00,069
I'm glad.

1488
01:13:00,070 --> 01:13:02,379
- You're very handsome and tall.
- Right.

1489
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:03,439
That's right.

1490
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,150
I see the resemblance.

1491
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:08,850
What is it?

1492
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:11,849
- What is it?
- When someone compliments me,

1493
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:14,720
- Really?
- I don't know how to react.

1494
01:13:17,290 --> 01:13:19,459
- Does it make you feel awkward?
- Yes.

1495
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:20,899
- Really?
- I get embarrassed.

1496
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:23,059
Don't you like it when people compliment you?

1497
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:25,900
I love it. However...

1498
01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:28,400
I really love hearing such words,

1499
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,369
but I can't stand feeling embarrassed.

1500
01:13:32,370 --> 01:13:34,640
I see. I know what you mean. I'm the same.

1501
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:37,109
I think my face is turning red.

1502
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:39,080
- Come on. It's okay so far.
- No?

1503
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:40,379
- It's okay so far.
- Thank goodness.

1504
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:41,920
- You're a bit flushed.
- Just a bit?

1505
01:13:43,050 --> 01:13:44,690
The date closed the gap between us.

1506
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:47,590
I think we've become much closer.

1507
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:51,789
I got the feeling that Woo Jin was working hard...

1508
01:13:51,790 --> 01:13:53,329
to make me feel comfortable.

1509
01:13:53,330 --> 01:13:54,860
I was really thankful.

1510
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,129
(You seemed to be enjoying the date with Yun Nyeong.)

1511
01:13:58,130 --> 01:13:59,570
I was with someone who spreads happiness.

1512
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,800
I kept having fun.

1513
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:07,740
She's someone who makes you happy.

1514
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:10,880
- I had so much fun.
- Seriously.

1515
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:13,880
Do we need to go?

1516
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:15,850
- Shall we stay?
- Let's go.

1517
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:20,619
Those two have good chemistry.

1518
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:23,459
- I know.
- I feel bad about saying this,

1519
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:25,960
but I don't care about their stories with their exes...

1520
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,729
- at this point.
- Oh, no.

1521
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:29,000
I'm more curious about...

1522
01:14:29,130 --> 01:14:30,529
- the new relationships.
- That's right.

1523
01:14:30,530 --> 01:14:32,469
- We don't care about their exes.
- No.

1524
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:34,069
- Right?
- We're beginning to hope...

1525
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:35,269
that they'll just start new relationships.

1526
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:37,909
They have so much chemistry.

1527
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:38,939
All three couples.

1528
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:42,609
- Women decided on these pairs.
- Yes.

1529
01:14:42,610 --> 01:14:45,379
They did a good job of picking the man...

1530
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:47,449
- who suited them.
- They picked well.

1531
01:14:47,450 --> 01:14:48,579
- They picked differently too.
- Yes.

1532
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:51,290
I guess they're drawn to such people.

1533
01:14:52,190 --> 01:14:55,490
(Ji Yeon and Won Kyu's pick-a-date)

1534
01:14:56,490 --> 01:15:00,130
(Cafe EOE)

1535
01:15:13,070 --> 01:15:14,139
Hello.

1536
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:16,640
(Ji Yeon picked Won Kyu as her date.)

1537
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,319
Won Kyu was the only one...

1538
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:25,449
who made me strongly feel,

1539
01:15:25,450 --> 01:15:26,890
"I can't wait to get to know him."

1540
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:30,190
It was nice. It was very exciting.

1541
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:33,690
Did you order a drink?

1542
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,730
She said that she'd bring me a menu upstairs.

1543
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:38,400
- Really?
- Did you order a drink?

1544
01:15:38,401 --> 01:15:39,900
I ordered a drink as I entered.

1545
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:41,670
Did you order a drink as you entered?

1546
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:44,040
- What?
- He ordered as he entered.

1547
01:15:44,070 --> 01:15:45,170
Alone?

1548
01:15:45,570 --> 01:15:47,140
- Just his drink?
- Just his drink.

1549
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:48,979
- He's funny.
- Just his drink?

1550
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:50,809
He ordered just his drink.

1551
01:15:50,810 --> 01:15:51,979
He has a unique character.

1552
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:53,450
- He's so eccentric.
- Yes.

1553
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:56,079
I bet Yun Nyeong is Won Kyu's ex.

1554
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:58,850
Yun Nyeong would break that personality, right?

1555
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:04,660
- We're meeting outside.
- Yes, I know.

1556
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:10,560
- I think it's a bit awkward.
- Right.

1557
01:16:18,810 --> 01:16:21,940
Is there something you can never eat?

1558
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:24,749
- Me? There's nothing like that.
- Something you can never eat.

1559
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:26,010
- Really?
- I eat everything well.

1560
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:31,149
- You asked for a fried egg.
- Yes.

1561
01:16:31,150 --> 01:16:33,220
You must like eggs very much.

1562
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:34,560
- No.
- No?

1563
01:16:34,561 --> 01:16:36,359
- I don't like them very much.
- I see.

1564
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,530
- But people made it, so...
- I see.

1565
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:43,000
(It's a bit awkward.)

1566
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:46,170
It's awkward to speak politely.

1567
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:50,000
Shall we speak casually when we get a bit closer?

1568
01:16:50,670 --> 01:16:53,170
- Okay.
- Let's do it before today ends.

1569
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:55,980
Is it more convenient for you to speak casually?

1570
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:59,079
I just want us to get closer more quickly.

1571
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:00,110
Right.

1572
01:17:00,650 --> 01:17:01,720
Right.

1573
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:05,550
Seriously,

1574
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:09,560
it was unexpected.

1575
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:13,060
- When you asked for a date.
- When I asked for a date?

1576
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:15,700
- Why was it unexpected?
- After all...

1577
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:18,900
I thought I made myself clear...

1578
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:22,040
because I always picked you...

1579
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:23,940
whenever I had to pick someone.

1580
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:26,940
Did you do that?

1581
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:28,710
I see.

1582
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:30,080
Although you did that,

1583
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:33,149
- I thought. "I'm next to her." - You thought that was the reason.

1584
01:17:33,150 --> 01:17:34,320
I thought that was the reason.

1585
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:37,080
(The first day of moving in)

1586
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:39,720
I'm picking one, right?

1587
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:45,490
(She picked Won Kyu to answer a question about the ideal type.)

1588
01:17:46,690 --> 01:17:47,760
Someone with fair skin.

1589
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:50,000
In terms of appearance, I like someone with fair skin.

1590
01:17:54,440 --> 01:18:00,010
(She also picked Won Kyu when they were drinking.)

1591
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:03,080
Usually, I just...

1592
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,280
We hadn't talked much.

1593
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,350
It was too early.

1594
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:12,219
I had no idea. I never thought...

1595
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:15,220
that she'd ask me out on a date.

1596
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:20,090
I wanted to talk to you separately.

1597
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,060
I didn't have to think long.

1598
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:25,070
You came to my mind right away.

1599
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:31,740
Why aren't you drinking this?

1600
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:35,710
Did he wipe the frost?

1601
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:37,209
Seeing Won Kyu sit there...

1602
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:39,080
- makes me laugh.
- He's eccentric.

1603
01:18:39,510 --> 01:18:41,580
The timing was so strange.

1604
01:18:42,820 --> 01:18:44,550
He wiped it fast too.

1605
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:47,249
Most people don't do that.

1606
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:49,159
- I thought he was making pottery.
- Most people approach slowly...

1607
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:50,289
- and wipe the surface.
- Yes.

1608
01:18:50,290 --> 01:18:51,659
- He's unpredictable.
- Yes.

1609
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:53,389
- I can't predict his next move.
- I can't predict his next move.

1610
01:18:53,390 --> 01:18:55,460
He's extraordinary. He'll be funny when you become close to him.

1611
01:18:57,530 --> 01:18:58,930
Why aren't you drinking this?

1612
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,400
- It's hard to drink it, right?
- Yes.

1613
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:20,450
Do you prefer an older woman or a younger woman?

1614
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:24,260
I prefer a younger woman.

1615
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,360
- I think so.
- I like an older man.

1616
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,869
It was "I like an older man," not "I like you."

1617
01:19:31,870 --> 01:19:33,499
- "I like an older man." - It works both ways.

1618
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,439
- I think it works both ways.
- I know.

1619
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:37,269
Didn't it sound like, "I like you?"

1620
01:19:37,270 --> 01:19:38,469
I understood it that way too.

1621
01:19:38,470 --> 01:19:39,969
I didn't hear, "I like an older man."

1622
01:19:39,970 --> 01:19:42,279
- I heard, "I like you." - That's right.

1623
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:43,609
- I think that was implied.
- Right?

1624
01:19:43,610 --> 01:19:44,810
- That was implied.
- It works both ways.

1625
01:19:45,410 --> 01:19:47,110
(I like an older man.)

1626
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:48,280
How about someone your age?

1627
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:50,750
- Even someone my age...
- You don't like that.

1628
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:53,150
I get along with older men better.

1629
01:19:53,890 --> 01:19:56,320
- You prefer guys who are older, - Yes.

1630
01:19:56,490 --> 01:20:00,290
But don't you still have an acceptable age gap?

1631
01:20:00,690 --> 01:20:03,700
When we talked about it, I said,

1632
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:05,999
realistically speaking,

1633
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,670
I was fine with a maximum six-year gap.

1634
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:11,010
A six-year gap.

1635
01:20:12,910 --> 01:20:14,739
- I'm dying to know our ages.
- Right?

1636
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:16,380
What if I'm more than six years older?

1637
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:19,380
Then I'll give it a second thought.

1638
01:20:20,510 --> 01:20:23,419
I didn't mean the age gap, but my mindset.

1639
01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:24,690
- I see.
- Yes.

1640
01:20:24,890 --> 01:20:27,719
I'll try to be more open to dating a guy...

1641
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:29,360
over six years older.

1642
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:35,130
A maximum seven-year gap is also okay.

1643
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:40,299
When he wasn't sure about the six-year gap,

1644
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:43,839
I changed my answer and said...

1645
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,909
a seven-year gap was fine too.

1646
01:20:45,910 --> 01:20:47,540
That made me think...

1647
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:51,280
he might be older than I expected.

1648
01:20:52,150 --> 01:20:55,420
- We could take a little walk.
- Let's do that.

1649
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:59,490
- The weather is perfect for a walk.
- It's perfect.

1650
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:02,889
There are many galleries here.

1651
01:21:02,890 --> 01:21:04,460
Places where we can see exhibitions.

1652
01:21:04,830 --> 01:21:05,860
Do you like them?

1653
01:21:05,890 --> 01:21:07,930
I do like exhibitions.

1654
01:21:10,030 --> 01:21:11,069
An office worker vibe?

1655
01:21:11,070 --> 01:21:12,330
- "An office worker vibe?" - Yes.

1656
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,770
I'm not saying you're not fun.

1657
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:19,169
You have this image of an upright guy.

1658
01:21:19,170 --> 01:21:20,410
- Really?
- Yes.

1659
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:24,710
We'll probably drink tonight, right?

1660
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:26,150
Most...

1661
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:28,080
Most likely.

1662
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:32,519
But I think the guys will drink less than they did yesterday.

1663
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,590
I see.

1664
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:37,059
We should only drink a little.

1665
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:38,930
Yes, we should.

1666
01:21:40,730 --> 01:21:43,960
Let's have a big meal and drink only a little.

1667
01:21:44,970 --> 01:21:47,900
- What do you think?
- Shall we do that?

1668
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:50,570
Did you just drop the honorifics?

1669
01:21:51,270 --> 01:21:52,539
- I tried, - You tried.

1670
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:53,910
But was it unnatural?

1671
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:56,779
I tried to as naturally as possible.

1672
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:58,650
- No, let's drop it.
- Okay.

1673
01:22:00,350 --> 01:22:02,080
I think I can drop it now.

1674
01:22:03,550 --> 01:22:06,250
You can call me by my name since you're older.

1675
01:22:06,450 --> 01:22:07,889
Is it set in stone that I'm older?

1676
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:09,790
Yes. You're older than me.

1677
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:14,499
- Nice.
- Gosh.

1678
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:16,329
- Hold on.
- But older?

1679
01:22:16,330 --> 01:22:17,999
What if Won Kyu had taken...

1680
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,270
the wrong herbal medicine when he was young?

1681
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:23,239
How would you feel if you were in his shoes?

1682
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:25,409
If I were him, it'd make me happy.

1683
01:22:25,410 --> 01:22:26,840
- Yes.
- It'd still make me happy.

1684
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:28,879
This couple looks great together.

1685
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:30,580
- At first...
- They're a good match.

1686
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:33,010
- Is it set in stone that I'm older?
- Yes.

1687
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:34,580
You're older than me.

1688
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:39,590
Both of us were stiff at the coffee shop.

1689
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:41,919
Chatting while walking around...

1690
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:43,160
was more comfortable.

1691
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:46,290
Aside from dropping the honorifics,

1692
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:49,030
she suddenly called me by my name.

1693
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:52,400
That really brought us closer.

1694
01:22:53,770 --> 01:22:58,370
The day before I broke up with my ex,

1695
01:22:59,270 --> 01:23:03,740
the place where we had long conversations was Seochon.

1696
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:06,649
But that didn't bother me.

1697
01:23:06,650 --> 01:23:09,650
Nor was I reminded of it.

1698
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:12,150
Rather, I didn't care about our surroundings.

1699
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:15,060
Doing things I enjoy...

1700
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:18,360
with the person who makes my heart flutter...

1701
01:23:18,930 --> 01:23:22,160
made me really happy.

1702
01:23:25,530 --> 01:23:26,629
(Sambal Choi Satay Club)

1703
01:23:26,630 --> 01:23:28,300
It's pretty. I'm taking a photo.

1704
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:31,169
But you're bad at it.

1705
01:23:31,170 --> 01:23:32,640
(They've come for dinner after their walk.)

1706
01:23:33,010 --> 01:23:34,310
- Go ahead.
- What did you just say?

1707
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:35,610
I'll take some too.

1708
01:23:39,010 --> 01:23:41,750
Let's pick one good photo out of the bunch.

1709
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:44,079
- One is more than enough for me.
- Okay.

1710
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,550
- Okay.
- Show me.

1711
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:48,590
Mine is better.

1712
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:49,960
How annoying.

1713
01:23:49,961 --> 01:23:50,989
(Photo by Ji Yeon and photo by Won Kyu)

1714
01:23:50,990 --> 01:23:52,290
- Let's dig in.
- Okay.

1715
01:23:54,430 --> 01:23:56,000
- Dip in this.
- Okay.

1716
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,800
- It's good.
- Is it?

1717
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:03,740
- It's delicious.
- This one too.

1718
01:24:05,070 --> 01:24:06,210
This is so interesting.

1719
01:24:06,670 --> 01:24:08,310
- We only just met yesterday, - Yes?

1720
01:24:09,810 --> 01:24:11,550
But we got close really fast.

1721
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:14,480
Even though we didn't talk much, right?

1722
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:17,750
- We got to know each other today.
- Yes.

1723
01:24:19,090 --> 01:24:21,090
My guess is that...

1724
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:23,989
your ex isn't here.

1725
01:24:23,990 --> 01:24:25,030
I see.

1726
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:28,000
Got it.

1727
01:24:28,330 --> 01:24:29,400
It's just my guess.

1728
01:24:32,130 --> 01:24:33,599
I think yours is here.

1729
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:34,840
- Really?
- Yes.

1730
01:24:34,970 --> 01:24:36,900
Do you have an idea of who it might be?

1731
01:24:36,970 --> 01:24:38,170
I do.

1732
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:40,169
- For real?
- Yes.

1733
01:24:40,170 --> 01:24:41,240
Who?

1734
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:43,780
What's his last name?

1735
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:47,380
Do you know anyone's last name?

1736
01:24:49,450 --> 01:24:51,449
(Even if he wanted to, he can't recall the name.)

1737
01:24:51,450 --> 01:24:52,490
I...

1738
01:24:56,090 --> 01:24:57,190
Song...

1739
01:24:58,530 --> 01:24:59,730
Song Baek Hyun, right?

1740
01:25:01,190 --> 01:25:03,399
Was it Sung or Song? I'm not sure.

1741
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:06,170
You don't know either. I think it's Song.

1742
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:09,700
I'd better slur his last name.

1743
01:25:12,170 --> 01:25:14,040
Song Baek Hyun, Kim Woo Jin.

1744
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:18,580
I don't know the guys' last names.

1745
01:25:20,010 --> 01:25:21,350
I only know your last name.

1746
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:22,520
What is it?

1747
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:25,990
- Jung.
- Correct.

1748
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:29,220
You have a good memory.

1749
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:32,490
I might remember it well because you're the one who told me.

1750
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:37,730
Right.

1751
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:40,430
I'll try to remember yours too.

1752
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:47,339
We haven't been here long,

1753
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:48,810
but when was the most memorable moment?

1754
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:50,140
Today.

1755
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:51,810
- Today?
- Yes.

1756
01:25:52,510 --> 01:25:53,510
When today?

1757
01:25:53,850 --> 01:25:56,050
- What?
- Which part of today?

1758
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,320
It was...

1759
01:25:59,290 --> 01:26:00,919
- when we went on the walk.
- Me too.

1760
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:02,690
- When we had that walk.
- Yes.

1761
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:05,230
You're right.

1762
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,860
It really made me...

1763
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:10,060
happy, for real.

1764
01:26:10,530 --> 01:26:11,899
The weather was great,

1765
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:13,730
- Yes, it was nice.
- and so was the street.

1766
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:17,870
(How did you express your interest to Won Kyu?)

1767
01:26:18,210 --> 01:26:21,070
I flirted really obviously.

1768
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:25,580
I was so obvious that I wasn't sure if it was okay.

1769
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:30,549
Later in our date, I expressed everything in my heart...

1770
01:26:30,550 --> 01:26:32,350
without any hesitation.

1771
01:26:33,290 --> 01:26:34,420
Do you eat breakfast?

1772
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:36,890
I keep it simple.

1773
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:39,860
How about we have cereal tomorrow morning?

1774
01:26:40,130 --> 01:26:41,260
- Okay.
- Just the two of us.

1775
01:26:42,660 --> 01:26:44,060
When things slow down,

1776
01:26:44,730 --> 01:26:46,800
let's signal each other and head to the fridge together.

1777
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:58,680
Seriously, your straightforwardness amazes me.

1778
01:26:59,910 --> 01:27:01,280
What do you think?

1779
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:05,590
- Do you get taken aback?
- No, I don't.

1780
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:08,460
If you do, I'll try...

1781
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:10,359
to tone it down.

1782
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:11,730
No, I'm not taken aback by it.

1783
01:27:12,630 --> 01:27:15,260
In a way, I want to learn...

1784
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:17,029
how to be straightforward.

1785
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:18,070
Should I teach you?

1786
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:19,900
Is that something you can teach?

1787
01:27:20,430 --> 01:27:21,840
I might imitate you over time.

1788
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:24,100
Then we should hang out often.

1789
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:27,970
That way, you'll be able to pick it up naturally.

1790
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:30,840
- You're right.
- Yes.

1791
01:27:32,150 --> 01:27:35,580
She directly told me she was interested in me.

1792
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:39,850
There were moments when she launched surprise attacks.

1793
01:27:40,950 --> 01:27:42,060
But that made me happy.

1794
01:27:46,930 --> 01:27:47,959
He's not your average guy.

1795
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:49,629
- He must really like it.
- Right?

1796
01:27:49,630 --> 01:27:51,399
Of course, he'd like it.

1797
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:53,669
- I know, right?
- I wanted to become Won Kyu.

1798
01:27:53,670 --> 01:27:55,439
But really, Ji Yeon,

1799
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,739
- Seriously...
- Ji Hyeon, Yun Nyeong,

1800
01:27:57,740 --> 01:27:59,509
and Min Kyung...

1801
01:27:59,510 --> 01:28:01,679
express their interest in their own ways,

1802
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:03,579
- and that's so charming.
- All of them.

1803
01:28:03,580 --> 01:28:05,609
- Everyone is so charming.
- And with their own color.

1804
01:28:05,610 --> 01:28:08,079
I can't sense...

1805
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:11,920
any of the four women thinking about their exes.

1806
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:15,090
It feels like they're completely devoted to their dates.

1807
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:19,689
That made me curious about how the guys would react.

1808
01:28:19,690 --> 01:28:21,329
It's so hard to choose,

1809
01:28:21,330 --> 01:28:23,360
even though my decision doesn't matter.

1810
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:26,430
Really, things are getting so tough.

1811
01:28:26,830 --> 01:28:29,940
Up to episode three, EXchange is all about rebound romances.

1812
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:32,140
Nice.

1813
01:28:32,141 --> 01:28:34,270
I feel like everyone chose well.

1814
01:28:35,010 --> 01:28:39,450
(After the first date with the new person)

1815
01:28:39,910 --> 01:28:43,250
(Pyeongchang-dong House)

1816
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:50,360
(Each resident returns home alone to prevent any guesses about exes.)

1817
01:29:04,170 --> 01:29:08,140
(The living room is empty.)

1818
01:29:11,710 --> 01:29:12,980
(Glancing)

1819
01:29:22,590 --> 01:29:25,929
(No one is in the kitchen...)

1820
01:29:25,930 --> 01:29:29,400
(or living room on the 2nd floor.)

1821
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:34,430
(Checking the 1st floor for anyone)

1822
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:35,600
(Glancing)

1823
01:29:36,570 --> 01:29:37,740
(Knocking)

1824
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:39,070
Yes?

1825
01:29:39,770 --> 01:29:41,010
Who is in there?

1826
01:29:42,980 --> 01:29:45,209
- May I open the door?
- Of course.

1827
01:29:45,210 --> 01:29:47,109
- Stay with me.
- Sure thing.

1828
01:29:47,110 --> 01:29:49,279
- Okay. Are you alone?
- How was your date?

1829
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:50,879
Yes, I just got home.

1830
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:51,920
Really?

1831
01:29:52,150 --> 01:29:53,689
I got home just a little while ago.

1832
01:29:53,690 --> 01:29:55,660
My plan was to touch up my makeup.

1833
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:57,660
- Let's talk while I do that.
- Okay.

1834
01:29:58,020 --> 01:29:59,360
- Over here.
- I'll take this chair.

1835
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:01,160
What's this?

1836
01:30:01,490 --> 01:30:02,900
- Isn't it cute?
- Is it a towel?

1837
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:05,829
(Yun Nyeong has returned.)

1838
01:30:05,830 --> 01:30:06,870
What great timing.

1839
01:30:07,330 --> 01:30:09,439
- What is it?
- I came because I was bored.

1840
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:10,539
- Really?
- Yes.

1841
01:30:10,540 --> 01:30:12,010
Why do you look so tired?

1842
01:30:13,010 --> 01:30:14,210
How was it?

1843
01:30:14,770 --> 01:30:16,409
My eyes... I need to take my contacts out.

1844
01:30:16,410 --> 01:30:18,179
Aren't you exhausted?

1845
01:30:18,180 --> 01:30:19,909
For real. I need to quickly put...

1846
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:22,149
- in new contacts.
- My eye drops...

1847
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:24,250
I left mine behind.

1848
01:30:24,780 --> 01:30:26,820
- Really?
- I also had some drinks.

1849
01:30:26,950 --> 01:30:28,519
- Drinks?
- I said I left my eye drops behind.

1850
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:30,189
- Eye drops?
- Yes.

1851
01:30:30,190 --> 01:30:32,529
- I thought you said you had drinks.
- Really, eye drops.

1852
01:30:32,530 --> 01:30:33,560
Oh, really?

1853
01:30:33,990 --> 01:30:35,060
Did you drink a lot?

1854
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:37,530
No, just a moderate amount.

1855
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:43,240
I'm so tired.

1856
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:44,770
My face is red now.

1857
01:30:45,210 --> 01:30:46,670
I have to touch up my makeup.

1858
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:49,080
Then...

1859
01:30:52,610 --> 01:30:54,050
I have so many questions,

1860
01:30:54,180 --> 01:30:56,650
- but I can't ask them.
- Hold back. Right.

1861
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:00,720
(My ex could've gone on a date with someone here.)

1862
01:31:04,590 --> 01:31:06,230
Did everyone in the next room come home?

1863
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:09,459
- I'm not sure.
- I heard some sound.

1864
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:13,470
You came right when I had just changed after getting home.

1865
01:31:13,770 --> 01:31:14,770
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1866
01:31:16,970 --> 01:31:18,969
There were sounds,

1867
01:31:18,970 --> 01:31:21,440
but there was no one. I wasn't sure about what to do.

1868
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:27,650
(The door that Min Kyung couldn't make herself knock)

1869
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:29,680
- Don't you feel a little strange?
- Yes.

1870
01:31:31,580 --> 01:31:34,050
(Exhaling)

1871
01:31:38,830 --> 01:31:40,160
Did you two talk a lot?

1872
01:31:40,490 --> 01:31:43,000
- Today?
- During your date.

1873
01:31:44,660 --> 01:31:47,269
Yes, we talked a lot.

1874
01:31:47,270 --> 01:31:49,370
- A lot?
- Maybe not.

1875
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:53,140
Did you have fun?

1876
01:31:54,370 --> 01:31:56,710
Yes. Do you feel conscious of your ex?

1877
01:31:57,140 --> 01:32:00,080
- I did in the beginning.
- Okay.

1878
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:05,120
I'm used to it now.

1879
01:32:06,990 --> 01:32:08,250
I should get used to it too.

1880
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:09,659
You aren't used to it yet?

1881
01:32:09,660 --> 01:32:14,860
(Yoo Sik hasn't opened his farewell package yet.)

1882
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:23,670
Should I go upstairs? I'm going upstairs.

1883
01:32:24,270 --> 01:32:25,340
They might be back.

1884
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:27,840
- Whoever it is...
- Was there no one upstairs?

1885
01:32:28,140 --> 01:32:29,180
No.

1886
01:32:34,850 --> 01:32:37,049
(Min Kyung heads to Yoo Sik's room.)

1887
01:32:37,050 --> 01:32:38,050
Yes?

1888
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:42,059
What are you doing?

1889
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:43,790
- Nothing.
- We're just talking.

1890
01:32:46,990 --> 01:32:48,059
What are you doing?

1891
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:49,800
- Nothing.
- We're just talking.

1892
01:32:52,770 --> 01:32:54,429
"We're just talking."

1893
01:32:54,430 --> 01:32:56,170
The look in Yoo Sik's eyes.

1894
01:32:56,900 --> 01:32:58,670
- Let's go upstairs.
- Okay.

1895
01:32:59,070 --> 01:33:01,339
- Aren't you bored?
- Is everyone back?

1896
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:02,639
- I think so.
- Really?

1897
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:03,880
- Yes.
- I see.

1898
01:33:04,180 --> 01:33:05,749
Should I get changed?

1899
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:06,750
(Glancing)

1900
01:33:06,751 --> 01:33:07,880
- That's right.
- But we...

1901
01:33:08,310 --> 01:33:10,349
- Has anyone gotten changed?
- Yes.

1902
01:33:10,350 --> 01:33:11,950
The girls got changed into pants.

1903
01:33:15,890 --> 01:33:19,289
- Right.
- If everyone stays in their room,

1904
01:33:19,290 --> 01:33:21,429
- You're right.
- it won't be very nice.

1905
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:22,599
(Yoo Sik doesn't follow Min Kyung.)

1906
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:25,669
It must be hard for both Min Kyung and Yoo Sik...

1907
01:33:25,670 --> 01:33:27,229
after their date.

1908
01:33:27,230 --> 01:33:28,399
They must be on each other's minds.

1909
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:29,469
They're quite concerned.

1910
01:33:29,470 --> 01:33:33,439
I thought that Min Kyung had a good time with her date.

1911
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:34,810
- But not really.
- Now that she's back,

1912
01:33:34,910 --> 01:33:37,539
she must feel concerned about Yoo Sik.

1913
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:39,109
She's thinking about how Yoo Sik went...

1914
01:33:39,110 --> 01:33:41,379
- on a date with someone else.
- That's why.

1915
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:45,319
When you're out, you don't think about your ex.

1916
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:47,049
- When you come home, you see him.
- Right.

1917
01:33:47,050 --> 01:33:49,119
- That's what's difficult.
- And they live together.

1918
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:52,159
Also, Ji Hyeon had a drink.

1919
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:53,160
She told her about it.

1920
01:33:53,161 --> 01:33:54,359
Maybe she went to check...

1921
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:56,159
- and see if his face was red.
- Right.

1922
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:57,599
- That's possible.
- Right.

1923
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:59,200
- "Did they drink together?" - Exactly.

1924
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:00,830
That's possible.

1925
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,540
(At the same time, Baek Hyun comes out of his room.)

1926
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:12,579
I'm back.

1927
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:14,650
(Unintentionally, he sees her coming back from her date.)

1928
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:18,380
Hello.

1929
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:22,090
You look very happy.

1930
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:23,790
What?

1931
01:34:24,660 --> 01:34:25,890
Where is everyone?

1932
01:34:26,530 --> 01:34:29,660
I don't know. I've been the only one here.

1933
01:34:30,430 --> 01:34:31,500
Really?

1934
01:34:32,570 --> 01:34:34,170
Yes, I'm the only one here.

1935
01:34:34,770 --> 01:34:36,100
- Really?
- Yes.

1936
01:34:36,570 --> 01:34:37,970
But I saw a lot of shoes outside.

1937
01:34:40,270 --> 01:34:42,709
- They keep talking...
- With and without honorifics.

1938
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:44,839
I bet they're each other's ex.

1939
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:47,050
- I'm 80 percent sure.
- Definitely.

1940
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:49,920
Yes, I'm the only one here.

1941
01:34:50,550 --> 01:34:51,920
- Really?
- Yes.

1942
01:34:52,350 --> 01:34:53,720
But I saw a lot of shoes outside.

1943
01:34:54,850 --> 01:34:57,520
My roommate, Woo Jin.

1944
01:34:58,730 --> 01:35:00,790
He's back. I don't know about other people.

1945
01:35:01,460 --> 01:35:03,060
I'll go upstairs.

1946
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:04,530
- Okay.
- To check on the girls.

1947
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:09,340
Did you eat something? Aren't you hungry?

1948
01:35:09,700 --> 01:35:11,300
- I'm hungry.
- Are you?

1949
01:35:11,700 --> 01:35:12,710
Yes.

1950
01:35:19,950 --> 01:35:23,520
(Ji Hyeon opens the fridge.)

1951
01:35:25,550 --> 01:35:31,020
(Yoo Sik arrived earlier than Ji Hyeon and organized the fridge.)

1952
01:35:35,130 --> 01:35:36,130
What?

1953
01:35:42,170 --> 01:35:44,339
- Baek Hyun.
- Yes?

1954
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:46,170
Who brought the groceries?

1955
01:35:47,310 --> 01:35:48,709
(Ji Hyeon who got groceries with Yoo Sik became mischievous.)

1956
01:35:48,710 --> 01:35:49,780
You're right.

1957
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:52,680
You know who? Was it you?

1958
01:35:53,010 --> 01:35:54,510
No, it wasn't me.

1959
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:56,620
The water was already here.

1960
01:35:58,990 --> 01:36:01,090
I didn't bring the ramyeon.

1961
01:36:02,190 --> 01:36:03,889
Someone got groceries.

1962
01:36:03,890 --> 01:36:06,559
Right. It wasn't you who brought the groceries?

1963
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:07,689
(Ji Hyeon confirmed that Baek Hyun doesn't know.)

1964
01:36:07,690 --> 01:36:08,830
You're right.

1965
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:13,470
I think someone bought things from the list...

1966
01:36:13,570 --> 01:36:14,930
- that we made earlier.
- You're right.

1967
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:18,270
But no one took it.

1968
01:36:20,370 --> 01:36:21,370
It was fun.

1969
01:36:22,010 --> 01:36:25,379
It was a little thrilling.

1970
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:26,610
(A thrilling secret that only she knows)

1971
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:28,180
Who could it be?

1972
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:31,720
- Someone got groceries.
- This Parmesan won't work.

1973
01:36:34,650 --> 01:36:35,620
This is...

1974
01:36:35,620 --> 01:36:36,620
(An error occurred to Baek Hyun's order.)

1975
01:36:36,621 --> 01:36:38,490
I can't do anything about it.

1976
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:41,560
I definitely wrote "Parmigiano-Reggiano."

1977
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:46,369
We run out of towels quickly.

1978
01:36:46,370 --> 01:36:47,729
Yes, towels.

1979
01:36:47,730 --> 01:36:50,039
We need four towels per room every day...

1980
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:51,369
- Hello.
- Hello.

1981
01:36:51,370 --> 01:36:52,739
- Hello.
- Did you just get back?

1982
01:36:52,740 --> 01:36:53,740
- I just got back.
- Were you home?

1983
01:36:53,741 --> 01:36:56,480
- Who got these groceries?
- You look like you're in shape.

1984
01:36:57,480 --> 01:36:58,709
Yoo Sik did.

1985
01:36:58,710 --> 01:36:59,710
Yes.

1986
01:36:59,910 --> 01:37:01,679
It's Yoo Sik who bought the groceries.

1987
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:03,019
- Really?
- Yes.

1988
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:04,820
- Yoo Sik?
- By himself?

1989
01:37:05,350 --> 01:37:06,619
I don't know about that,

1990
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:08,959
- but after his date...
- He got the groceries?

1991
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:10,120
I got them with him.

1992
01:37:10,220 --> 01:37:12,289
- Really?
- I thought so.

1993
01:37:12,290 --> 01:37:14,530
- Are you serious?
- Why did you buy that Parmesan?

1994
01:37:15,190 --> 01:37:16,860
- "Parmesan?" - We don't have a cheese grater.

1995
01:37:17,430 --> 01:37:19,729
- Did you really get the groceries?
- Ji Hyeon.

1996
01:37:19,730 --> 01:37:22,440
- I'm sorry.
- How could you lie?

1997
01:37:24,070 --> 01:37:27,440
(The person who bought the groceries arrives.)

1998
01:37:28,540 --> 01:37:30,239
- Did you buy the groceries?
- Yes.

1999
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:31,779
- We went to get them together.
- Who did?

2000
01:37:31,780 --> 01:37:33,079
- Did you buy the groceries?
- Yes.

2001
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:34,979
- Seriously?
- We bought them together.

2002
01:37:34,980 --> 01:37:36,080
- Together.
- When?

2003
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:38,789
- Can I tell them...
- We went on a date.

2004
01:37:38,790 --> 01:37:40,890
- our date?
- You're lying.

2005
01:37:41,090 --> 01:37:44,519
- It's hard to believe.
- After seeing the Parmesan,

2006
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:47,289
- Is your stomach okay?
- he was really upset.

2007
01:37:47,290 --> 01:37:48,329
Who was?

2008
01:37:48,330 --> 01:37:50,060
- I had so much food...
- Really?

2009
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:53,299
Who bought all these? What about this?

2010
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:55,129
I bought all of them myself.

2011
01:37:55,130 --> 01:37:56,200
Do you swear on everything?

2012
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:58,739
- What should I swear on?
- I don't believe you.

2013
01:37:58,740 --> 01:37:59,970
- On everything.
- I swear on Baek Hyun.

2014
01:38:01,170 --> 01:38:02,710
Then he must be telling the truth.

2015
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:07,010
My ex said that he bought the groceries.

2016
01:38:07,450 --> 01:38:10,650
I saw a box of hotteok mix in the kitchen.

2017
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:13,690
I love hotteok.

2018
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:16,960
When I realized that he'd bought it,

2019
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:20,490
I thought, "He must've bought it for me."

2020
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:25,430
I felt like he was looking out for me.

2021
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:26,970
Isn't that amazing?

2022
01:38:27,670 --> 01:38:28,839
They also bought pickled radishes.

2023
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:31,039
A while ago, the four of us...

2024
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:34,010
Everyone thought that Yoo Sik had bought groceries.

2025
01:38:34,410 --> 01:38:37,510
They were feeling grateful to him, but I also took part in it.

2026
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:39,949
"Did you buy this much by yourself?"

2027
01:38:39,950 --> 01:38:41,649
"You're so amazing. That was so clever."

2028
01:38:41,650 --> 01:38:44,180
"He even bought a hotteok mix." I was the one who picked it.

2029
01:38:46,090 --> 01:38:47,119
That's what happened.

2030
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:48,990
(It wasn't Yoo Sik who bought the hotteok mix.)

2031
01:38:49,690 --> 01:38:53,129
(A small misunderstanding occurred after the date.)

2032
01:38:53,130 --> 01:38:54,230
- Gosh.
- It was her?

2033
01:38:55,330 --> 01:38:57,329
That's what made her misunderstand.

2034
01:38:57,330 --> 01:39:00,799
She thought that her ex bought the hotteok mix for her.

2035
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:03,039
- Exactly.
- She misunderstood.

2036
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:05,409
It's just that hotteok mix is popular.

2037
01:39:05,410 --> 01:39:06,439
That's right.

2038
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:07,440
(Hotteok mix is irresistible.)

2039
01:39:07,470 --> 01:39:08,979
How could this happen?

2040
01:39:08,980 --> 01:39:10,739
I can't believe it.

2041
01:39:10,740 --> 01:39:13,679
In a situation like that, you read too much...

2042
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:15,649
- into small details.
- You read too much into them.

2043
01:39:15,650 --> 01:39:16,819
That's right.

2044
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:18,449
- The hotteok mix was misleading.
- It was just something delicious.

2045
01:39:18,450 --> 01:39:20,189
- The hotteok mix was noticeable.
- Yes, it was misleading.

2046
01:39:20,190 --> 01:39:21,190
- It was misleading.
- Right.

2047
01:39:21,191 --> 01:39:22,859
Most people would buy ready-made hotteok.

2048
01:39:22,860 --> 01:39:24,759
After buying the hotteok mix, did he mean to make it for her?

2049
01:39:24,760 --> 01:39:26,859
That could be one of their memories...

2050
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:27,929
- together.
- Right.

2051
01:39:27,930 --> 01:39:30,329
And another woman picked it out.

2052
01:39:30,330 --> 01:39:31,659
- Ji Hyeon picked it.
- It's very fascinating.

2053
01:39:31,660 --> 01:39:33,129
It could be misleading to anyone.

2054
01:39:33,130 --> 01:39:36,069
Min Kyung could think, "Does he still have..."

2055
01:39:36,070 --> 01:39:37,070
"feelings for me?"

2056
01:39:37,071 --> 01:39:38,339
- She could misunderstand.
- Of course.

2057
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:41,470
When you think about how he was sprawling on the floor...

2058
01:39:41,670 --> 01:39:43,910
and the hotteok mix,

2059
01:39:44,110 --> 01:39:45,309
- it's enough to misunderstand.
- Right.

2060
01:39:45,310 --> 01:39:46,449
"While he was on a date,"

2061
01:39:46,450 --> 01:39:47,880
- "he still thought of me." - Exactly.

2062
01:39:48,110 --> 01:39:49,350
My goodness.

2063
01:39:50,850 --> 01:39:52,119
Are you good at playing Halli Galli?

2064
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:54,950
- Halli Galli?
- Bring it on, everyone.

2065
01:39:57,490 --> 01:39:59,329
- Look at this.
- Oh, no.

2066
01:39:59,330 --> 01:40:00,959
(They're playing Halli Galli with a head flick as a penalty.)

2067
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:02,130
I'm on a roll.

2068
01:40:03,130 --> 01:40:04,200
That's hilarious.

2069
01:40:06,030 --> 01:40:07,430
I promise to win.

2070
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,340
It doesn't matter to me.

2071
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:13,569
- I have the upper hand.
- Goodness.

2072
01:40:13,570 --> 01:40:14,809
He might hit her for real.

2073
01:40:14,810 --> 01:40:16,080
- Right away...
- That's so funny.

2074
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:17,280
Bring it on, everyone.

2075
01:40:17,281 --> 01:40:19,079
- Are you cold?
- No, I'm okay.

2076
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:20,150
You're okay?

2077
01:40:20,650 --> 01:40:22,520
- I'll go first.
- Is anyone cold?

2078
01:40:22,780 --> 01:40:24,220
It's not cold anymore.

2079
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,290
It feels hotter when you play games.

2080
01:40:26,390 --> 01:40:27,520
Darn it. Wait.

2081
01:40:29,660 --> 01:40:31,160
That was really scary.

2082
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:32,529
What if it breaks?

2083
01:40:32,530 --> 01:40:34,429
It's hard to control my strength...

2084
01:40:34,430 --> 01:40:35,629
because I'm focused on hitting it fast.

2085
01:40:35,630 --> 01:40:37,729
I'll do the same with my nails.

2086
01:40:37,730 --> 01:40:38,799
- I'll do it like this.
- Really?

2087
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,470
- Yes.
- Then I'll hit it right away.

2088
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:43,639
- I feel like I'm sweating.
- This is hilarious.

2089
01:40:43,640 --> 01:40:45,200
Bring it on.

2090
01:40:47,570 --> 01:40:48,810
Yoo Sik.

2091
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:50,279
His smile looks bitter.

2092
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:52,040
He must be very worried right now.

2093
01:40:52,850 --> 01:40:54,179
You have to stay calm.

2094
01:40:54,180 --> 01:40:55,250
Oh, no.

2095
01:41:00,050 --> 01:41:01,250
Is it part of the Olympic Games?

2096
01:41:01,650 --> 01:41:02,890
- You want to participate?
- Yes.

2097
01:41:05,390 --> 01:41:08,760
Do you have five of them ready?

2098
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:11,800
I feel hot.

2099
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:15,770
I don't have a lot left.

2100
01:41:18,570 --> 01:41:21,869
(Yoo Sik lowers the temperature when Min Kyung says that it's hot.)

2101
01:41:21,870 --> 01:41:23,810
Look at that.

2102
01:41:24,310 --> 01:41:25,979
I got it. I took it away.

2103
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:27,549
- Oh, my. She took it away.
- I took it away.

2104
01:41:27,550 --> 01:41:30,320
I'll go next.

2105
01:41:30,420 --> 01:41:32,050
How is this so funny?

2106
01:41:35,990 --> 01:41:37,719
- I might lose.
- Please hurry up and win.

2107
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:38,720
I will win.

2108
01:41:38,721 --> 01:41:42,160
- Until it comes up...
- No.

2109
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:43,829
I got it.

2110
01:41:43,830 --> 01:41:45,000
(Baek Hyun loses in vain.)

2111
01:41:45,430 --> 01:41:47,830
(Sighing)

2112
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:51,800
You can't hit me, can you?

2113
01:41:59,180 --> 01:42:00,180
Alcohol?

2114
01:42:00,610 --> 01:42:01,649
Do you want me to get hit?

2115
01:42:01,650 --> 01:42:03,220
It's just a game.

2116
01:42:03,320 --> 01:42:05,590
- Do you want a beer?
- Yes, that sounds good.

2117
01:42:06,050 --> 01:42:07,519
He has to hit me.

2118
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:08,549
Really?

2119
01:42:08,550 --> 01:42:09,560
(They get away in a hurry for some beer.)

2120
01:42:15,230 --> 01:42:16,400
Are you going to drink?

2121
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:20,570
I'm thinking about it.

2122
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:22,269
Are you going to drink?

2123
01:42:22,270 --> 01:42:24,500
- I'm also thinking about it.
- You're thinking?

2124
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:30,140
I don't know what to do.

2125
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:31,910
- What?
- Well,

2126
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:33,779
I don't know if I want to drink or not.

2127
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:36,949
Okay, you're really scaring me.

2128
01:42:36,950 --> 01:42:39,520
Why is everyone moving in a group?

2129
01:42:40,450 --> 01:42:41,820
They're like a herd of buffalo.

2130
01:42:42,290 --> 01:42:43,489
It begins...

2131
01:42:43,490 --> 01:42:46,289
(While everyone is busy setting up a drinking table)

2132
01:42:46,290 --> 01:42:47,490
I'll move aside for you.

2133
01:42:48,360 --> 01:42:49,630
(Hovering near)

2134
01:42:50,330 --> 01:42:51,960
You hit her so hard.

2135
01:42:52,330 --> 01:42:56,000
(JI Yeon successfully sits next to Won Kyu.)

2136
01:42:56,270 --> 01:42:57,540
All right.

2137
01:42:57,800 --> 01:42:59,509
- I think we got a text.
- We did?

2138
01:42:59,510 --> 01:43:01,269
- Who wants to drink this?
- Me!

2139
01:43:01,270 --> 01:43:02,440
- We didn't?
- Good.

2140
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:09,150
We got a text.

2141
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:19,229
(Who made your heart flutter today?)

2142
01:43:19,230 --> 01:43:22,259
(Let them know via text.)

2143
01:43:22,260 --> 01:43:25,200
(Your text will be delivered anonymously.)

2144
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:27,270
Shall we sit a little apart?

2145
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:36,940
(The only one who fluttered my heart today)

2146
01:43:40,780 --> 01:43:45,890
(They have a lot more on their mind after the first date.)

2147
01:43:57,400 --> 01:44:01,429
(Where is everyone's heart heading toward?)

2148
01:44:01,430 --> 01:44:03,399
- Is this the soundtrack?
- This is it.

2149
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:05,399
- That's right.
- I like this song.

2150
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:07,569
Listening to the song in a situation I imagined...

2151
01:44:07,570 --> 01:44:09,480
- How do you feel? Is it good?
- Yes, I feel good.

2152
01:44:10,780 --> 01:44:13,349
I have a feeling that they'd exchange a text with each other.

2153
01:44:13,350 --> 01:44:15,680
- This time, yes.
- But Yoo Sik...

2154
01:44:15,850 --> 01:44:17,380
will send one to Min Kyung, I guess.

2155
01:44:17,580 --> 01:44:19,049
Min Kyung will send one to Baek Hyun.

2156
01:44:19,050 --> 01:44:21,989
But if Yoo Sik doesn't send one to Min Kyung now,

2157
01:44:21,990 --> 01:44:24,319
- he'd be in big trouble.
- "Why did you buy the hotteok mix?"

2158
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:25,560
(Min Kyung might misunderstand even more.)

2159
01:44:25,660 --> 01:44:29,529
I learned a toast speech before I came here.

2160
01:44:29,530 --> 01:44:30,659
What is it?

2161
01:44:30,660 --> 01:44:32,499
- Has anyone heard DFO?
- DFO?

2162
01:44:32,500 --> 01:44:33,929
Does anyone here know that?

2163
01:44:33,930 --> 01:44:35,029
DFO?

2164
01:44:35,030 --> 01:44:37,070
- Mind...
- Mind?

2165
01:44:38,340 --> 01:44:40,740
- I don't know.
- Drink with the same mind?

2166
01:44:41,610 --> 01:44:42,639
Am I wrong?

2167
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:44,879
- Drink with the same mind?
- Really?

2168
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:46,580
- What does it mean?
- DFO.

2169
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:49,550
Drink your fill without overdoing it.

2170
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:52,789
Cheers.

2171
01:44:52,790 --> 01:44:55,319
Drink your fill without overdoing it.

2172
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:56,789
- DFO!
- DFO!

2173
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:57,890
That's cute.

2174
01:44:58,520 --> 01:44:59,560
DFO!

2175
01:45:00,330 --> 01:45:02,759
A toast speech is important.

2176
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:04,399
That shows how much a toast speech matters.

2177
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:06,200
It suddenly feels like a workshop.

2178
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,869
- She suddenly became a team leader.
- I know.

2179
01:45:08,870 --> 01:45:10,699
A toast speech matters so much.

2180
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:12,000
You shouldn't say it.

2181
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:13,669
It almost feels like "Cheer for the youth."

2182
01:45:13,670 --> 01:45:14,809
It feels like "Cheer for the youth."

2183
01:45:14,810 --> 01:45:16,440
They look so happy.

2184
01:45:17,010 --> 01:45:19,780
(DFO!)

2185
01:45:27,390 --> 01:45:28,590
How come it tastes so sweet?

2186
01:45:28,990 --> 01:45:30,220
That's true.

2187
01:45:32,060 --> 01:45:36,130
(Won Kyu got a text.)

2188
01:45:36,700 --> 01:45:41,030
(Let's hang out with me in the garden later.)

2189
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:43,870
While talking to Ji Yeon,

2190
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:47,210
we talked about hanging out in the garden too,

2191
01:45:47,310 --> 01:45:48,370
during the date.

2192
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:50,380
I liked it.

2193
01:45:51,740 --> 01:45:54,379
I felt that she paid attention to me...

2194
01:45:54,380 --> 01:45:57,520
and kept watching me. I liked that.

2195
01:46:02,220 --> 01:46:03,190
Really?

2196
01:46:03,191 --> 01:46:05,190
Even a text can flutter your heart like that.

2197
01:46:05,660 --> 01:46:07,490
"Let's hang out with me in the garden later."

2198
01:46:08,590 --> 01:46:10,429
Ji Yeon is the rhino.

2199
01:46:10,430 --> 01:46:11,559
Right.

2200
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:12,970
She's bold.

2201
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:23,080
(Ji Yeon sent a text to Won Kyu again today.)

2202
01:46:27,680 --> 01:46:30,280
(Ji Yeon got a text.)

2203
01:46:30,820 --> 01:46:35,150
(See you again in the warm spot.)

2204
01:46:35,420 --> 01:46:36,620
Won Kyu sent a text to me.

2205
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:41,160
I liked it, and my heart raced.

2206
01:46:41,990 --> 01:46:45,160
I wanted to get to know more about her.

2207
01:46:45,930 --> 01:46:49,600
I was curious about what kind of person she was.

2208
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:52,170
I have a good feeling about her.

2209
01:46:54,510 --> 01:46:58,740
(They're on the same page.)

2210
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:02,309
In the garden and in the warm spot.

2211
01:47:02,310 --> 01:47:03,749
I hope things go well between them.

2212
01:47:03,750 --> 01:47:05,380
I support this couple no matter what.

2213
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:12,860
(Woo Jin got a text.)

2214
01:47:13,290 --> 01:47:19,160
(Thanks to you, I made such a fun and precious memory. Thank you.)

2215
01:47:19,270 --> 01:47:21,200
I think it was Yun Nyeong.

2216
01:47:22,170 --> 01:47:26,010
She felt it nice and pleasant, just like me.

2217
01:47:36,350 --> 01:47:41,650
(Yun Nyeong got 2 texts.)

2218
01:47:41,820 --> 01:47:42,990
- What?
- Two texts?

2219
01:47:44,020 --> 01:47:45,259
I guess her ex sent one.

2220
01:47:45,260 --> 01:47:47,789
Wait. Then one person can't get a text.

2221
01:47:47,790 --> 01:47:50,529
Watching this in reality feels so...

2222
01:47:50,530 --> 01:47:53,270
- Why?
- Watching this in reality...

2223
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:55,469
- makes my dopamine...
- Rush, right?

2224
01:47:55,470 --> 01:47:56,599
- Yes.
- Come on.

2225
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:59,440
Then Woo Jin sent one, and her ex sent the other.

2226
01:47:59,870 --> 01:48:02,010
(Baek Hyun got 1 text.)

2227
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:07,080
(Shall we have chamomile together? And practice games more!)

2228
01:48:15,190 --> 01:48:16,720
- The spicy tteokbokki?
- To pretend I can eat it well...

2229
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:21,029
(Yoo Sik got 1 text.)

2230
01:48:21,030 --> 01:48:22,630
I can't eat hot chicken-flavor ramyeon.

2231
01:48:23,230 --> 01:48:26,670
(Shorts look good on you.)

2232
01:48:29,470 --> 01:48:30,700
I felt good.

2233
01:48:31,670 --> 01:48:32,940
I wondered if it was Ji Hyeon.

2234
01:48:35,170 --> 01:48:36,480
I sent the text to Yoo Sik.

2235
01:48:37,340 --> 01:48:41,380
He asked me what clothes I like when a man wears.

2236
01:48:41,810 --> 01:48:45,450
I told him I like a man with long and straight legs...

2237
01:48:45,780 --> 01:48:49,090
who looks good in shorts.

2238
01:48:49,590 --> 01:48:52,790
And before we sent the text,

2239
01:48:53,130 --> 01:48:55,660
Yoo Sik changed into shorts.

2240
01:48:56,260 --> 01:48:59,530
I saw it and sent him the text saying...

2241
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:01,030
"Shorts look good on you."

2242
01:49:03,770 --> 01:49:05,340
That was so cute.

2243
01:49:20,690 --> 01:49:23,320
(Ji Hyeon got 1 text.)

2244
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:25,789
(You went through a lot walking a long distance today.)

2245
01:49:25,790 --> 01:49:28,090
(I'll take you to my favorite restaurant next time.)

2246
01:49:32,330 --> 01:49:35,030
I got one from Yoo Sik.

2247
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:38,770
We had a date in Gangnam today.

2248
01:49:39,240 --> 01:49:42,440
Yoo Sik said he's very familiar with Gangnam...

2249
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:45,580
and told me we can go to his favorite restaurant next time.

2250
01:50:01,530 --> 01:50:04,460
(Min Kyung got no text.)

2251
01:50:04,630 --> 01:50:08,000
(Your ex did not pick you.)

2252
01:50:08,130 --> 01:50:09,869
- This is the end.
- That's how it goes.

2253
01:50:09,870 --> 01:50:11,599
- Really?
- That's how it happens.

2254
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:13,369
She got no text.

2255
01:50:13,370 --> 01:50:15,339
She got one yesterday, but none today.

2256
01:50:15,340 --> 01:50:18,479
- Why is it that?
- Now the exchange begins.

2257
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:20,079
- He wants someone else.
- Yes.

2258
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:22,349
In Min Kyung's perspective,

2259
01:50:22,350 --> 01:50:24,319
- she didn't get one from Baek Hyun.
- No.

2260
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:26,150
- Her ex didn't send her one either.
- No, he didn't.

2261
01:50:26,250 --> 01:50:27,889
What would make her more upset?

2262
01:50:27,890 --> 01:50:30,189
Not getting one from Baek Hyun might upset her more.

2263
01:50:30,190 --> 01:50:32,289
- That's possible.
- Because they dated today.

2264
01:50:32,290 --> 01:50:33,290
He tied her shoelace.

2265
01:50:33,291 --> 01:50:34,959
- Right. They had a good time.
- Why did he do that?

2266
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:36,360
- He took photos too.
- I supported them.

2267
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:39,799
Wait. Then, to whom did Baek Hyun send his text?

2268
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:41,099
Then he sent it to Yun Nyeong.

2269
01:50:41,100 --> 01:50:43,369
- Then Yun Nyeong is his ex.
- That makes her his ex.

2270
01:50:43,370 --> 01:50:45,739
She might be his ex, or Baek Hyun likes her.

2271
01:50:45,740 --> 01:50:47,069
- He's fond of her.
- Exactly.

2272
01:50:47,070 --> 01:50:49,639
Can he send a text to Yun Nyeong out of the blue,

2273
01:50:49,640 --> 01:50:50,909
- not the one he dated today?
- In the morning,

2274
01:50:50,910 --> 01:50:52,439
- they had cereal together.
- Cereal in the morning?

2275
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:54,179
It might have felt good to him.

2276
01:50:54,180 --> 01:50:55,379
- They had a conversation.
- They ate it together.

2277
01:50:55,380 --> 01:50:56,519
- That's possible.
- Right.

2278
01:50:56,520 --> 01:50:59,279
She might be his ex, or he might have good feelings for her.

2279
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:02,319
- Right.
- I was sure it'd be Ji Hyeon.

2280
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:03,990
- Really?
- I have a headache.

2281
01:51:04,820 --> 01:51:07,760
(Min Kyung got no text.)

2282
01:51:07,860 --> 01:51:13,200
(Your ex did not pick you.)

2283
01:51:16,540 --> 01:51:18,340
- DFO!
- DFO!

2284
01:51:19,910 --> 01:51:21,070
Cheers.

2285
01:51:34,490 --> 01:51:37,020
She didn't look like she was in a good mood.

2286
01:51:37,060 --> 01:51:39,990
She looked unpleasant from time to time.

2287
01:51:40,990 --> 01:51:43,830
I guess she somehow thought...

2288
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:46,200
that I'd send her a text.

2289
01:51:47,530 --> 01:51:49,470
I tried not to care about her,

2290
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,400
but I cared.

2291
01:51:59,510 --> 01:52:01,680
I thought I'd get no text from my ex.

2292
01:52:02,950 --> 01:52:05,380
When I talked to Baek Hyun,

2293
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:09,860
I felt that we were very compatible.

2294
01:52:10,990 --> 01:52:12,619
Since I had a date with him,

2295
01:52:12,620 --> 01:52:15,130
I clearly had good feelings for him.

2296
01:52:17,130 --> 01:52:18,860
Now that I got no text,

2297
01:52:19,100 --> 01:52:22,630
I felt that I don't need to be considerate here.

2298
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:56,770
(EXchange 4)

2299
01:52:56,970 --> 01:52:58,170
Right now,

2300
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:00,070
sit next to another person of the opposite sex.

2301
01:53:00,470 --> 01:53:01,540
That's intense.

2302
01:53:02,040 --> 01:53:03,180
I felt nervous.

2303
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:05,180
I will sit here.

2304
01:53:05,540 --> 01:53:07,310
I didn't feel good about it.

2305
01:53:08,310 --> 01:53:11,220
For five seconds, interlock your fingers with someone you like.

2306
01:53:13,450 --> 01:53:15,619
- This is unbelievable.
- This is insane.

2307
01:53:15,620 --> 01:53:17,090
I felt anxious.

2308
01:53:17,320 --> 01:53:19,830
- I was curious about you too.
- Really?

2309
01:53:20,130 --> 01:53:23,800
(I can have a different relationship with someone like this.)

2310
01:53:23,960 --> 01:53:25,730
- A date?
- Really?

2311
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:28,329
I could sense it,

2312
01:53:28,330 --> 01:53:30,640
and it began to suffocate me.

2313
01:53:30,970 --> 01:53:33,840
Go slowly and look at the center.

2314
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:37,739
- Can you teach me too?
- I will do that.

2315
01:53:37,740 --> 01:53:38,809
- Go this way?
- Yes.

2316
01:53:38,810 --> 01:53:40,410
Mostly, only two of them talked.

2317
01:53:40,650 --> 01:53:42,279
I felt a bit upset.

2318
01:53:42,280 --> 01:53:43,550
What's this?

2319
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:44,850
You got it.

2320
01:53:46,250 --> 01:53:49,420
(I couldn't make up my mind.)
