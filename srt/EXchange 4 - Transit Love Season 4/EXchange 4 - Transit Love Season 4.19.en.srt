1
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,879
Let me introduce the guests who've joined us today.

2
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,249
Sung Hanbin and Zhang Hao of ZEROBASEONE.

3
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,250
Hello.

4
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:21,650
- Hello.
- Hello.

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,459
- Nice to meet you.
- I heard you were big fans.

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,029
I heard you were very invested in EXchange.

7
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,999
Yes. While we were on the plane during the tour,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,230
we kept watching it...

9
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,499
because we had the episodes downloaded.

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,699
That's right. We always sat next to each other on the plane.

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,599
I kept seeing him smile.

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,070
"Are you watching it as well? Me too."

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,140
You too? Me too.

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,979
Is there a scene...

15
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,650
that gave you a sudden rush of dopamine?

16
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,409
- When they fought.
- When they fought.

17
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,319
The viewers like it when they fight.

18
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,350
Seriously?

19
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,360
(After the storm in the night)

20
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:05,230
(It's still a cloudy morning in Kamakura.)

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,139
(Purple Room: Min Kyung and Yun Nyeong's room)

22
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,670
Even yesterday...

23
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,069
- Who's that?
- It must be Baek Hyun.

24
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,380
I can't.

25
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,650
Wait, it's not Baek Hyun.

26
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:22,610
What?

27
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,580
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

28
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,919
I'm getting ready.

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,449
You are? Let's talk when you're out later.

30
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,960
- We can talk now.
- Well...

31
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,229
I wanted to apologize.

32
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,930
- Why?
- I was having a hard time.

33
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,260
- Right.
- In any case,

34
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,370
I should have done my best.

35
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,400
It's okay.

36
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,799
It must be hard for you and Yoo Sik.

37
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,079
Anyway, I was caught up in the thought...

38
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,209
that I wanted to get in between Hyeon Ji and Yoo Sik.

39
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:56,879
So I think I put you under pressure.

40
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,880
You didn't.

41
00:01:57,881 --> 00:01:59,520
I was possessed by an evil spirit.

42
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,320
- I think that's why I did it.
- I was also possessed.

43
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,459
I think I said things I shouldn't have.

44
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,460
(Seung Yong sincerely apologizes to her.)

45
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,459
I think I caused an awkward situation...

46
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,800
for you and Yoo Sik.

47
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,830
I wanted to apologize.

48
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,239
- Have you eaten?
- I haven't.

49
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,169
I won't be eating then.

50
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,380
Okay.

51
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,380
Seung Yong...

52
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,449
seemed to know that Yoo Sik and I...

53
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,590
were having emotional conversations.

54
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,159
I think it bothered him...

55
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,560
that such situations came about unnecessarily,

56
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,130
which were caused by him.

57
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,399
I thought he and I had many things in common,

58
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,840
so I hoped we could get along well.

59
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,240
I guess Seung Yong has a lot of feelings left.

60
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,649
Hyeon Ji has her ex,

61
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,810
Seung Yong, Yoo Sik, and Jae Hyeong.

62
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,880
She was the true popular girl.

63
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:11,059
I shouldn't regret it, but I keep regretting it.

64
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,120
What do you regret?

65
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,430
I should have entered the Ex Room.

66
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,960
I see. Why?

67
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,460
I didn't know how he felt.

68
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,870
If I had seen that...

69
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,670
and done something...

70
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,210
after that,

71
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,639
perhaps my heart would have changed,

72
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,550
not his, and I would have felt better.

73
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,849
I think it could have been a timing issue.

74
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,150
- Right.
- Yoo Sik, at first,

75
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,819
would have seen you do your best in this situation...

76
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,159
and thought, "Min Kyung is doing well."

77
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,699
"She's adapting well."

78
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,429
"I should just stop having feelings for her."

79
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,300
I think he may have thought like that.

80
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,269
"I shouldn't be an obstacle anymore."

81
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,710
"I should just stop having feelings for her."

82
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,509
That's when Hyeon Ji caught his interest,

83
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,540
and they coincidentally went on a date.

84
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,180
They've been going out on dates ever since.

85
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,120
I think that's how it flowed.

86
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,180
That was the timing.

87
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:17,990
(The cruel, ill-timed moments that kept missing each other)

88
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:20,830
Did you sleep well?

89
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,429
- It might be cold.
- Right?

90
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,430
Yes.

91
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,829
(Ji Hyeon and Jae Hyeong's mutual date)

92
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,870
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

93
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,369
I really like the unique Japanese vibe of the houses.

94
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,370
Me too.

95
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,540
After living single for so long,

96
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,450
how do you think it would feel when you get married?

97
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,010
I think I would be happier when I'm married.

98
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,150
- Really?
- You can adjust accordingly.

99
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,690
That's why...

100
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,889
you should marry someone with a big heart...

101
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,759
and someone who doesn't fight so often.

102
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,130
- Someone gentle and easygoing?
- Yes.

103
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,730
What are you like?

104
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,200
I'm a bit sensitive.

105
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,270
So the other person...

106
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,600
- Needs to be easygoing.
- needs to be a bit easygoing.

107
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,970
I'm curious about how you're like when you fight.

108
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,640
It's annoying!

109
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,010
(He happened to witness Ji Hyeon.)

110
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,850
I really don't want to fight.

111
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,379
I really want to be a nice person.

112
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,890
How do people get into fights like that?

113
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,790
Are you not the fighting type?

114
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,219
I've never been in a fight before.

115
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,390
- Really?
- Yes.

116
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,130
How is that possible?

117
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,460
So I find people who fight interesting.

118
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,460
"Why did that person get into a fight like that?"

119
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,769
I also don't fight with other people.

120
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,930
I only fight with my lover.

121
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,670
"How do people fight like that with their lovers?

122
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,210
That's unexpected. I thought,

123
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:44,740
since you're active and very clear about expressing yourself,

124
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,349
you might be somewhat wilder in your way of handling conflict.

125
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,079
- That's what I thought.
- Not at all.

126
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,119
- Really?
- Really.

127
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,950
I'm a really gentle and easygoing person.

128
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,789
Seriously.

129
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,390
I'm not trying to impress you. I'm really like that.

130
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,130
It's such a shame you don't know my charm.

131
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,899
I should show you my gentle side from now on.

132
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,900
(The date starts off on a good note with cute flirting.)

133
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,900
Wait for it.

134
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,269
I guess we've arrived.

135
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,509
(Koajirmori Higejii No Smika)

136
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,640
It's so nice.

137
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,680
- I really like such places.
- I feel calm.

138
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,140
It's really Japanese.

139
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,610
- The view here is really great.
- Right.

140
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,420
I really like vibes like this.

141
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,349
Did you bring the passport case to Japan?

142
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,060
- I have it in my bag.
- Me too.

143
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,990
When I saw it,

144
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,299
I thought, "Maybe I should have come with Jae Hyeong."

145
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,329
- Really?
- Yes.

146
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,640
You should have. What good is regretting?

147
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,440
Well, you thought about me somehow.

148
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:53,310
That passport case did its job.

149
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,080
We have to use it again when we go back.

150
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,320
I think I should think about that.

151
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,550
Why?

152
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,219
- I should think about it.
- The wound...

153
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,520
- Will it wound you?
- My wound is deep.

154
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,060
Why?

155
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,600
What are you talking about?

156
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,870
You're a confident man.

157
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,640
Patting.

158
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,310
It was really okay.

159
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,510
It felt nice.

160
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,009
Ji Hyeon also said the passport case...

161
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,540
reminded her of me at the airport.

162
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,280
It was nice to hear such words.

163
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,159
- Thank you for the meal.
- I really like raw fish bibimbap.

164
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,160
It's totally my style.

165
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,990
It's good.

166
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,970
- Do you like tuna?
- I love it.

167
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:48,970
What about you?

168
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,770
I really love tuna.

169
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,070
I really love tuna, especially the belly.

170
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,979
(Exclaiming)

171
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,610
That's the sound of a real bird, right?

172
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:02,980
I think it is.

173
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,490
(The gentle breeze and the songs of birds on a clear day)

174
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,659
- It really sings...
- It's like...

175
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,300
- so clearly and sweetly.
- it's coming from a phone.

176
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,500
- Everything looks beautiful.
- It really does.

177
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,300
What do you do when you meet up with your friends?

178
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,439
What kind of friends do you usually hang out with?

179
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,070
I usually play sports.

180
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,910
I play soccer.

181
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,279
Do you not drink so often?

182
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,810
I drink when people drink...

183
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,750
and don't when people don't. It doesn't matter.

184
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,750
Would you like your lover to drink well?

185
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,120
I think it would be nice if he drank like me.

186
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,360
- Someone who enjoys it.
- Right. But...

187
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,030
it has to be someone who drinks only when he can enjoy it.

188
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,600
I'm like that as well.

189
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,630
So it's not about how much you drink.

190
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,070
- How often.
- It's about how often.

191
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,969
On our first date,

192
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:02,070
I thought he expressed his feelings well to me,

193
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,410
but it didn't feel like our conversations flowed well.

194
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,750
On our second date,

195
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,250
our conversations felt more natural,

196
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,320
and it felt like the back-and-forth went really well.

197
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,090
I was surprised because the dates were so different.

198
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,260
I almost felt like I wasn't dating the same person.

199
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,960
We talked a lot about our preferences.

200
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,799
Do you think you can go for coffee as well?

201
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,000
I can. Let's go.

202
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,640
(Kabura Coffee)

203
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,780
It's so nice.

204
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,910
This place is really antique too.

205
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,210
Since we're out and enjoying Japan,

206
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,720
I don't want to go back.

207
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,190
What do you want to do most when you go back to Korea?

208
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,229
I want to listen to music...

209
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,029
- Right. I want to listen to music.
- and rest well.

210
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,030
Right.

211
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,070
What's your favorite song?

212
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,470
I like hip-hop and RnB music.

213
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,210
- Like Epik High?
- I love Epik High.

214
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,179
Which Epik High song do you like most?

215
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,210
It's obviously "Love Love Love."

216
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,780
I really like "Us Against The World."

217
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,480
- Which one is that?
- You'd know when you listen to it.

218
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,250
The lyrics...

219
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,419
talk to people in their late 20s and early 30s.

220
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,820
It cheers on the fleeting youth.

221
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,730
When I first heard it, it was really...

222
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,029
I really like such songs.

223
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,030
Really?

224
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,030
Who else do you like? Talking about music is fun.

225
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,599
My favorite singer is Park Hyo Shin.

226
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,670
Park Hyo Shin?

227
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,509
(She automatically shows off her talent.)

228
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,570
You're good.

229
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,639
Why are you feeling shy?

230
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,910
Can you keep going?

231
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,379
(She does it again, empowered by his reaction.)

232
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,520
You're good.

233
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,149
Isn't that such an outdated talent?

234
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,249
All my friends born in 1998 had the same talent.

235
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,590
- That's...
- Yes.

236
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,159
- This one.
- The echo.

237
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,789
Suddenly

238
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,930
It's the same song as well.

239
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,329
- That's the standard one.
- That song is always used.

240
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,369
- It's the standard one.
- That's right.

241
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,969
- It's easy.
- That's funny.

242
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,039
- The same one.
- That was in trend at some point.

243
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,039
- Right.
- To those born in 1998?

244
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,110
- We wouldn't be able to do it.
- I can't do it.

245
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,349
Do you have other talents?

246
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,379
(He boldly requests another encore.)

247
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,610
I think I could get some more.

248
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,050
- I think I could pull out more.
- I don't have anything else.

249
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,720
You...

250
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,950
I found that cute as well.

251
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,790
It's very fun to talk to Ji Hyeon. I like it.

252
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,960
That doesn't happen with everyone.

253
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,700
I really liked those moments.

254
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,030
It's really nice.

255
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,940
Stay there. I'll take a picture of you.

256
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,440
- I break down when I hear that.
- Look forward.

257
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,510
Smile a little.

258
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,949
(Exclaiming)

259
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,479
This is totally boyfriend-picture material.

260
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,190
Please stop.

261
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:05,920
Look at this.

262
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,660
It felt like we were on a date.

263
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,730
I thought it was going to be a really comfortable date.

264
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,630
But there was more romantic tension...

265
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,940
than I expected.

266
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,039
So I thought, "What's going on?"

267
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,610
(Feelings started to bloom again.)

268
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,510
That's how...

269
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,250
I felt.

270
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,090
I really liked today's date.

271
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:36,960
Right.

272
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,189
It's nice because I feel like I've grown closer to you.

273
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,429
Right.

274
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,960
You really need to spend time with someone to know them.

275
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,669
(Sung Baek Hyun)

276
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,469
(Choi Yun Nyeong)

277
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,569
(Lee Jae Hyeong)

278
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,779
(Park Ji Hyeon)

279
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,509
(Cho Yoo Sik)

280
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,309
(Park Hyeon Ji)

281
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,179
(Kim Woo Jin)

282
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,349
(Kwak Min Kyung)

283
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,019
(Jung Won Kyu)

284
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,919
(Hong Ji Yeon)

285
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,790
(Shin Seung Yong)

286
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:23,840
(EXchange 4)

287
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,640
(Episode 19: Summer Night, Regret)

288
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,140
(Kamakura House)

289
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,920
(Yoo Sik is all dressed up.)

290
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,630
You must be cold. Your clothes.

291
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:53,000
- I heard it's going to be warm.
- Really?

292
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:57,070
- What time did you get up?
- I got up at 7:10am.

293
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,700
- What about you?
- Me?

294
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,720
At around half past.

295
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,759
- What is he removing?
- Already?

296
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,860
How big is the dust speck?

297
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,130
- Was it an eyelash?
- Was it a rice grain?

298
00:14:22,131 --> 00:14:23,559
- Can you see that?
- He's flirting.

299
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,630
That's nice.

300
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,130
(They're going to Yokohama on a rainy morning.)

301
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,070
It was so hard to get up.

302
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,310
Today?

303
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,610
It was early.

304
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,010
(She feels sleepy, and her eyes start to close.)

305
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,560
Sleep a little.

306
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,390
You got up early.

307
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,130
- I'll be thinking a little.
- Okay.

308
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,670
(They come out of the tunnel, and the view outside brightens.)

309
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,650
(He covers the light for Hyeon Ji, who is sleeping.)

310
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:23,419
(When her posture looks uncomfortable...)

311
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,189
Lean back a little.

312
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,990
- Just a bit.
- Okay.

313
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,030
Is it good?

314
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,470
(He covers her with his jacket so that she doesn't feel cold.)

315
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,040
He's taking such good care of me.

316
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:50,149
I feel he's changed...

317
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:53,249
in that he got bolder in taking care of me.

318
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,520
He takes it off when something gets on my face,

319
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,620
and things like that.

320
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,560
Whenever he does that, I definitely feel...

321
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:06,629
that he's very close to my ideal man.

322
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,829
That's what I think...

323
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,130
because I want a sweet guy.

324
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,339
- Oh, my.
- He took off his jacket, too?

325
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,669
That's wild. He's hitting her with a triple-combo level of care.

326
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,809
At this point, isn't it basically a couple vibe?

327
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,439
- Exactly.
- How about a foot massage, too?

328
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,550
That's insane.

329
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,819
How can he treat her that well?

330
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,779
He knows how to take care of a girl.

331
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,219
He dated Min Kyung for a long time.

332
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,789
He's been upgraded.

333
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,620
It's impossible for her not to get butterflies.

334
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,170
The weather is really nice.

335
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,940
The sun is shining.

336
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,699
- It's such nice weather.
- Yes.

337
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,110
(They came to take a cruise together on a fine day.)

338
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,210
(KMC Yokohama Marina)

339
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,510
Did you say you get motion sickness?

340
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,350
- Me?
- Yes.

341
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,350
Slightly.

342
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,059
Ultra-luxury.

343
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,620
It really is an ultra-luxury date.

344
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:11,000
- Watch out.
- This is amazing!

345
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,170
It feels refreshing.

346
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:15,770
It's great.

347
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,739
- Have you watched "Titanic?" - What?

348
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,879
Have you watched "Titanic?"

349
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,480
I have. Shall I do it now?

350
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,580
Shall I pose?

351
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,150
Why is it getting cloudy?

352
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,520
- Clouds?
- Yes.

353
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,760
- It's clear over there.
- That's right.

354
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,399
You were watching the clear side alone.

355
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,430
Let's switch spots.

356
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,609
- It's beautiful here.
- The weather is wonderful.

357
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,869
Since I'm watching it here...

358
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:57,910
How come the weather is so fine?

359
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,789
- Shall we have a seat?
- You mean inside?

360
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:08,890
Yes.

361
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,720
- I'll go and place an order.
- Okay.

362
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,160
(While Yoo Sik is away, Hyeon Ji got busy.)

363
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,570
My hair is a mess.

364
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,370
(She unties her tied-up hair.)

365
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,210
(She pretends she didn't do anything.)

366
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,010
- It's a chocolate flavor.
- Chocolate?

367
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,250
Yes.

368
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,150
Is it good?

369
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,290
Do you eat nuts?

370
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,819
I love eating nuts.

371
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,060
- Really?
- Yes.

372
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,560
Do you want to try this?

373
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,540
- This tastes good.
- Does it?

374
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,650
That one is what we rode before.

375
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,290
The Ferris wheel.

376
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:15,890
The giant Ferris wheel.

377
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,320
When did you have the most fun?

378
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,530
Actually, I had a lot of fun yesterday...

379
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,960
although we didn't do anything special.

380
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,470
I liked just being in the car.

381
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,870
The first day is the most memorable.

382
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,040
When I saw you for the first time.

383
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,840
It's the part I remember the least, but somehow remember the most.

384
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,180
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

385
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:49,290
(Their hearts raced at the clumsy first meeting.)

386
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,019
What did you find most fun?

387
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,130
I had the most fun on the day we came to Japan.

388
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,760
The day we came to Japan.

389
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,600
- From the airport?
- Yes.

390
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,530
- Right?
- I'm ruined.

391
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,040
It really felt like going on a trip together.

392
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,610
Yes. This is a trip.

393
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,880
It's a trip.

394
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,350
(Two of them have made a lot of memories.)

395
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,059
You were looking for something on the floor earnestly.

396
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,590
It's because I lost something.

397
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,190
- What did you lose?
- It's a lie.

398
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,030
(Yoo Sik has something in his hand.)

399
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,240
(10 minutes ago)

400
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,870
(While Hyeon Ji was away)

401
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,840
I looked at the ground to see if there was a four-leaf clover.

402
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,710
And there was this cute and small three-leaf clover...

403
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,950
among large three-leaf clovers.

404
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,649
So I wanted to give the small one to her.

405
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:54,920
(He brought the three-leaf clover to give it to Hyeon Ji.)

406
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,690
Isn't it so cute?

407
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,460
It is.

408
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,689
- It's cute.
- It's so cute, isn't it?

409
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:03,690
It is.

410
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,029
It is really small, right?

411
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,970
(The three-leaf clover, meaning happiness, was given to Hyeon Ji.)

412
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,970
How did I feel? Absolutely great.

413
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,939
I mean, something like this...

414
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,280
is the kind of action you can attach meaning to.

415
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,710
Or is it just me?

416
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,690
It's cute.

417
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,020
I mean it.

418
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,800
Okay.

419
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:47,240
(The date gave them small but meaningful happiness.)

420
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,140
That's really amazing.

421
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,179
He definitely knows what to do...

422
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,349
to make his partner happy.

423
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,209
Not preparing a gift,

424
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,879
in every little moment,

425
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,619
he has exceptional competence in catching that quality.

426
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,919
- That's right.
- Right.

427
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,989
I feel that he'd be able to find a flower in a desert.

428
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,190
- I know.
- Right.

429
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,189
For women, romance...

430
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,990
comes first all the time.

431
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,200
That's why she definitely fell for him just now.

432
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:16,029
So I think her heart will turn completely to Yoo Sik.

433
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,039
And when Yoo Sik is with Hyeon Ji,

434
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,539
he often makes a smile that would flutter her heart.

435
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,710
He looks at her and goes like this.

436
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:22,910
- Right.
- Yes.

437
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,679
He smiles like he thinks she's cute and pretty.

438
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,409
- You know.
- Like a lead actor in a drama.

439
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,849
- Right.
- Guilty Cho.

440
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:29,850
Guilty Cho.

441
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,520
Everywhere we go, the entrance looks like this,

442
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,159
- right?
- It feels so.

443
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,160
- Yes.
- Right.

444
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,769
- I like it, though.
- Yes. It's like an inside thing.

445
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,530
Right. It feels like only people who know this can visit here.

446
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,940
It really is located deep inside.

447
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,240
It actually is in the forest, Won Kyu.

448
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,380
- It's beautiful.
- Yes.

449
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,860
This place itself is so beautiful.

450
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,330
The atmosphere is insane, Won Kyu.

451
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,760
- Shall I take you a picture?
- No.

452
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,400
No.

453
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,040
No.

454
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,070
Why are you doing that?

455
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,170
Gosh, what's that? That's scary.

456
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,780
- Let's take a picture.
- Yes.

457
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,780
No.

458
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,550
Yesterday, I...

459
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,160
wanted to have a conversation with Yoo Sik, just the two of us.

460
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,189
But now, I don't think I'll have a chance.

461
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,190
Right.

462
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,600
What's in Yoo Sik's mind?

463
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,630
What's in Ji Yeon's mind?

464
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,500
My mind? What's in your mind?

465
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:02,240
That's what I'm saying.

466
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,810
- "That's what I'm saying?" - We need to talk about that, too.

467
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,079
Right.

468
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,380
It would be nice if we could talk over a drink in the evening.

469
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,589
- Yesterday?
- Today.

470
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,590
Today?

471
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,760
Now, their feeling started to fall apart.

472
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,829
The atmosphere sank, like this.

473
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,889
- Right.
- The atmosphere.

474
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:25,759
It seems both of them are thinking...

475
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,029
about how to bring up the topic.

476
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,669
- Right.
- How to settle the relationship.

477
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:29,799
I hope they can talk about this.

478
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,639
How much feeling they have at this point.

479
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,440
- Just open up?
- Yes, just open up.

480
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,610
This is good.

481
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,050
Yes.

482
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,880
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

483
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,519
Yes.

484
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,619
(He seems pretty satisfied with the ginger lemon tea.)

485
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,119
The ginger tea in Korea...

486
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,059
- doesn't taste that strong.
- Yes.

487
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,359
It tastes so strong here.

488
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,429
(The oriental medical doctor acknowledged this ginger tea.)

489
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,460
- Do you want to try this?
- Yes.

490
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,500
I like this taste since I like ginger.

491
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,070
It tastes strong, right?

492
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,440
- Strong, but in a good way.
- Yes.

493
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,650
We have only a few days left.

494
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,690
The final decision...

495
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:26,020
About the decision,

496
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:30,930
have you made up your mind?

497
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,540
Have your feelings settled in any particular direction?

498
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,670
Why do you stop what you were talking so suddenly?

499
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,380
It might not be easy to talk.

500
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,649
But I really had a good time...

501
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:53,780
because you were here.

502
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,320
I mean it. Definitely.

503
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,820
- Certainly.
- I'm glad.

504
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,430
Yes.

505
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,960
You have so many charms.

506
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:10,230
I guess that's why I fell for you so quickly.

507
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:22,109
Actually, when your ex is in front of you, it's so hard.

508
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,380
It's the same when all of us are together.

509
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,880
But when two of us went outside and had a talk,

510
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,820
- I felt relaxed.
- That's true.

511
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,920
I appreciated you for many things.

512
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,160
You're the first person...

513
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,499
I've ever shown my true self...

514
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,130
to in such a short time.

515
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,540
I sang, said nonsense, and all.

516
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,340
- But you haven't shown everything.
- Yes.

517
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,010
I could feel it as time went by.

518
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,209
The other day, you came to me...

519
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,979
and said, "Let's not make a choice we won't regret."

520
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,980
Yes.

521
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,750
I said, "Let's make a choice we won't regret."

522
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:04,390
Right, You said, "Let's make a choice we won't regret."

523
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,130
I think you'll make a choice you won't regret.

524
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,530
You're thinking carefully.

525
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,570
I should do that, too.

526
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,910
Yes. Let's make a choice we won't regret.

527
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,349
It feels like they're ending the relationship.

528
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,649
- They're wrapping things up.
- It feels like they're ending...

529
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,679
the relationship. Their conversation strongly shows it.

530
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,719
They're saying it in a very natural and smooth way...

531
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,519
They go, "I liked it. I was happy because you were here."

532
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,689
- They're saying it this way.
- Yes.

533
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,919
Both of them are saying it in a past tense.

534
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,990
- That's right.
- Right.

535
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,789
I guess my favorite couple has come to an end.

536
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,229
They're the couple we supported in the beginning.

537
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,230
- Yes. That's right.
- Right.

538
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:47,259
They looked really good together.

539
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,600
- What a bummer.
- Right.

540
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,240
The weather is so nice today.

541
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,940
It's true.

542
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,679
It's going to be fun, since the weather is nice.

543
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,740
It's so nice.

544
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,980
It looks so fun.

545
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,280
It's going to be fun.

546
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,390
Is it this?

547
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,289
We're going to go paddleboarding. that one.

548
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,519
Are we going to do it standing like that? I guess not.

549
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,460
We should sit down, not to fall in the water.

550
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,630
Our outfits are the most colorful.

551
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,359
It really shows we're total beginners.

552
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,430
It shows we're total beginners?

553
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:25,200
That baby is wearing a similar outfit to mine.

554
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,369
- How come it's so heavy?
- Is it heavy?

555
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,740
It's fine.

556
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,680
- It feels so nice.
- Yes.

557
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:37,010
- This is it.
- This is it.

558
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,180
It's cold!

559
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,750
- Yes.
- Yes.

560
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,239
It's fun. It's better now we're out in the water.

561
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,740
I felt scared earlier.

562
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,479
You're good, Yun Nyeong.

563
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,080
- Am I?
- Yes.

564
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,450
How come you're so fast? I'm going to catch up with you.

565
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,790
It's so beautiful.

566
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,230
It's nice.

567
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,700
It's nice. I think we can do it easier here.

568
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,039
Yun Nyeong, where are you going?

569
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,010
Wait. Where am I going?

570
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,380
Where am I heading to?

571
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,450
My goodness.

572
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,079
- Yun Nyeong!
- Wait.

573
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,479
- You need to come here.
- I'm trying hard to do so.

574
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,520
Wait.

575
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,120
How can I turn this thing around?

576
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:57,190
(An unintended solo journey)

577
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,130
I feel tired.

578
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,230
- Are you tired?
- No, it's okay.

579
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:09,209
How can I get there?

580
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:10,370
Gosh, seriously.

581
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:18,080
It was so windy. A headwind blew.

582
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,850
She had to paddle,

583
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,790
but since she has no experience,

584
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,890
she was just stuck there, unable to find the direction.

585
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,160
- Shall we ride it together?
- Yes.

586
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:30,630
Stay still.

587
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,099
Are you good?

588
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,100
Yes.

589
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,369
(He moved over to her paddleboard.)

590
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,370
It's all right.

591
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,240
Now, let's go!

592
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,240
Let's go.

593
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,709
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

594
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,739
Let's go.

595
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,809
- I feel more relaxed now.
- Okay. Let's go.

596
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,080
It's better than being alone.

597
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,279
Let's go.

598
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,750
It's fun now.

599
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,120
Shall I pick up my courage and turn around?

600
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,920
Slowly.

601
00:30:59,921 --> 00:31:01,089
(Yun Nyeong plucks up her courage and faces Baek Hyun.)

602
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:02,730
- It's okay.
- I did it.

603
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,200
No.

604
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,070
May I hold you?

605
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,000
It's a bit scary.

606
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,100
I'm scared of falling into the water.

607
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:15,970
It's okay.

608
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:19,280
You won't fall into the water.

609
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,940
It just won't happen.

610
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,150
Oh, my.

611
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,720
Please.

612
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,589
- Of course.
- All right.

613
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,929
Of course. It's hard.

614
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,330
Oh, no. My goodness.

615
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,130
- Baek Hyun is flustered too.
- I know.

616
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,540
(They fall into the water as soon as Baek Hyun's words end.)

617
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,880
I hated that moment.

618
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,880
"Maybe I won't get to enjoy water sports with Yun Nyeong again."

619
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,720
"Why did we fall into the water right now?"

620
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:04,619
I assured Yun Nyeong,

621
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,159
"I'm really good at this. You won't fall into the water."

622
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,530
"Trust me." But...

623
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,099
we fell into the water. As soon as we fell in,

624
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,630
I pushed Yun Nyeong up like this.

625
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,200
I saved her first. I didn't care about being in the water.

626
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,300
- I'll go behind you.
- Okay.

627
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,940
I'll go behind you.

628
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:23,870
Hold it.

629
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:26,980
Go up. Three.

630
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,680
(Saving Yun Nyeong desperately)

631
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,680
Go up.

632
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,659
I was so thankful.

633
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,030
I was so thankful then.

634
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:47,399
He gritted his teeth and dived underwater...

635
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,100
to push me up.

636
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,330
He did it from the water.

637
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,240
Are you okay?

638
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:00,510
- It's okay. Balance yourself.
- I'm okay.

639
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,550
- Did you do it? I'll climb up.
- Yes.

640
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,919
- Are you okay? Oh, no.
- I'm okay.

641
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,349
- Are you really okay?
- Are you startled?

642
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,420
Yes, I'm very startled.

643
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,689
All right.

644
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,059
- It's okay.
- Okay.

645
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,460
- It's okay. Come here.
- Okay.

646
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,230
I'll help you with your hair.

647
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,629
It's okay. It can't be helped.

648
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:19,759
- Is it ruined?
- Yes.

649
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,830
- Wait. You have something in there.
- Really?

650
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:24,599
- Come here.
- It's okay. It's really okay.

651
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
I'm not okay with it.

652
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,209
It's cold.

653
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:30,810
- Is it cold? Let's go back.
- Yes, it's cold.

654
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:33,640
Let's go back.

655
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:35,980
Let's go back.

656
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:37,410
Let's go home.

657
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,880
Let's go home.

658
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,720
I couldn't take my hands off of him afterward.

659
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,759
I thought,

660
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,559
"I need to depend on him."

661
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,660
I grabbed him a lot.

662
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,930
Even if I fall into the water, I'll do it alone.

663
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,569
- I'll leave you here.
- No.

664
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,069
I want both of us to stay afloat.

665
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,269
Really? I'm okay with falling into the water.

666
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,269
No, stay by my side.

667
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,310
Okay.

668
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:13,020
- This is...
- It's so scary.

669
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:14,750
Do you want to put your arms around my waist?

670
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:19,920
- What do you think?
- Okay.

671
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,029
- We've become one.
- I feel better now.

672
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,630
We've become one.

673
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,070
Don't be scared. Take a look around.

674
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:39,840
We suddenly became close.

675
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,280
I think...

676
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,780
it made my heart flutter a bit.

677
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:55,030
(Their hearts flutter like the waves of the sea.)

678
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,099
Look at them.

679
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,070
It's a love boat. It's nice.

680
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:06,869
- Physical intimacy became natural.
- It became natural, right?

681
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,409
- They held hands in the car.
- They laced their fingers.

682
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:11,369
They became close very quickly.

683
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:12,580
The two of them look nice.

684
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,949
- I think they're at 99 percent...
- They're at 99 percent.

685
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,879
- for being a couple.
- It's very nice.

686
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,319
The two of them could leave the house early.

687
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,049
- As a couple?
- Yes, as a couple.

688
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,150
They could leave early.

689
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:26,220
(Kamakura House)

690
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,720
Thank you for the food.

691
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,289
(Min Kyung and Seung Yong don't have a date today.)

692
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,360
It looks tasty.

693
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,230
I'll take a photo.

694
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,360
Bam!

695
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,430
Again.

696
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,800
Bam!

697
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,410
It's cute.

698
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,180
What is it? Gosh, it's so nice.

699
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:49,050
- It's nice.
- I needed time like this.

700
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,379
Thank goodness.

701
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,550
- What?
- I'm not alone.

702
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,279
Do you mean that? You don't. Be honest.

703
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,890
I mean that. I'm really glad.

704
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,590
When you first entered the house,

705
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,960
what was your first impression of me? I'm curious.

706
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:06,660
I thought, "She's very cute."

707
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,229
"She's tiny."

708
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,330
Really?

709
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:12,669
Number 1 in terms of 1st impression. Exclude your ex.

710
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,339
Me? Really?

711
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,139
No!

712
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,439
- Who's your number one?
- Mine?

713
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,610
- My number one?
- Yes.

714
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,139
Number 1 in terms of 1st impression?

715
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,980
Yes. Among women.

716
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,379
I didn't have anyone like that.

717
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,079
- In my eyes...
- You could only see your ex.

718
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,750
In my eyes, Hyeon Ji looked the prettiest.

719
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,720
So I didn't think about that.

720
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,360
How sweet.

721
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,130
What's Hyeon Ji's charms?

722
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,500
She's fun.

723
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:43,070
- Is she fun?
- Yes, it's fun to be with her.

724
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,300
Hyeon Ji is a bit eccentric.

725
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,140
When I'm with her,

726
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,369
- it's fun. I'm...
- I see.

727
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:52,280
To be honest, I'm not very energetic.

728
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:55,480
I'm calm, but Hyeon Ji isn't like that.

729
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,880
So it's fun to be with her.

730
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,889
I heard...

731
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:04,020
that Hyeon Ji wasn't the type to express her affection.

732
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,919
But according to Yoo Sik, she has expressed her affection.

733
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,329
To Yoo Sik? Hyeon Ji tends to be...

734
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:10,830
straightforward.

735
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,560
- Really?
- Yes.

736
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,800
She told me that she wasn't good at it.

737
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,769
When she's shy, she can't do it well.

738
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:20,370
But she becomes affectionate when she's determined.

739
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,939
I don't know. There could be the sides of Hyeon Ji...

740
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,010
I don't know about.

741
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,650
Right. I don't know my ex very well although we've dated for nine years.

742
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,810
You'll meet someone new.

743
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,650
- Does she cheat?
- No.

744
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,690
What? You're back already.

745
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,820
You came back early.

746
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:48,160
You're such a steady person.

747
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:05,450
(They're wary of each other, but they can't close the distance.)

748
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,619
We're here.

749
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,319
(Baek Hyun and Yun Nyeong are back as well.)

750
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,320
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

751
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,689
Wasn't it too exhausting for you?

752
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:19,300
- You had to keep rowing.
- I did that.

753
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,059
- It was exhausting, right?
- Yes.

754
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,229
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

755
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,540
Are you okay? Don't you feel pain anywhere?

756
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,570
- Me?
- Yes. Maybe here.

757
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:29,640
- My back.
- Your back?

758
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,979
- How bad is the pain?
- It's from paddling.

759
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,809
I almost forgot. I have a pain relief patch.

760
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,350
- You can use it.
- Really?

761
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:36,910
What is it?

762
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,650
It's very famous. I'll apply it for you.

763
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,879
- Really?
- Yes.

764
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,120
It's for paddling earlier.

765
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,450
It's this side.

766
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,490
- That side? Okay.
- Okay.

767
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,490
All right.

768
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:49,560
Hold on.

769
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,360
- There you go. All set.
- All set?

770
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,430
- Do you feel anywhere else?
- No, I'm fine.

771
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,300
- Do you want to eat this?
- What?

772
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,170
- Isn't it rusk?
- Yes.

773
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,710
I want one.

774
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,680
Give me one. You're so annoying.

775
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:12,880
I got a text.

776
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,549
(Please move to this location right now.)

777
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,660
I thought, "There must be something."

778
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,390
"What could it be?"

779
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,190
I was worried and a bit scared.

780
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,329
(Please move to this location right now.)

781
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,330
What?

782
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:31,629
We must be going somewhere.

783
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,740
There must be something.

784
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:38,069
Did we get a text?

785
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:40,740
(Everyone received a text.)

786
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,980
It felt ominous.

787
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,580
It was our first time going somewhere together.

788
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,520
I wondered what we'd do.

789
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:54,360
I felt a bit nervous.

790
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,270
What?

791
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:04,930
- What?
- Where are you going?

792
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:06,799
I'm going downstairs. Where are you going?

793
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,439
What? I wanted to ask for help with my outfit.

794
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,880
- What about your outfit?
- I need someone to tie it.

795
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,980
Yoo Sik,

796
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:17,210
I'm asking this because I don't understand.

797
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:19,020
Yesterday,

798
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:22,520
- you said that you wouldn't go out.
- Right.

799
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,620
Did you make up your mind?

800
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,690
What are you talking about? What?

801
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:31,029
You said that you wouldn't go out. So why did you make that decision?

802
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,259
You didn't give me your reason.

803
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,260
(Yesterday's talk resumes.)

804
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,370
I just made a decision.

805
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,570
You told me that you wouldn't.

806
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:40,940
So why did you do that?

807
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:43,410
All right. I'm sorry.

808
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,050
- Are you going downstairs?
- I'm going downstairs.

809
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,049
Go ahead.

810
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:56,850
- Would you come here?
- Why?

811
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,620
- You're too far.
- Go ahead.

812
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:02,560
Did you have fun today?

813
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,400
Stop asking me things like that.

814
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,780
I'm sorry.

815
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,620
What?

816
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:31,990
- This is fun.
- What?

817
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,290
- That came out of nowhere.
- This is a real situation.

818
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:35,189
Oh, my. What was that?

819
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:37,459
We're getting so many movie-like scenes.

820
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,460
I know.

821
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,559
I'm sorry.

822
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,800
What is it?

823
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:44,970
What?

824
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:52,280
(She needs a steam iron in Won Kyu and Yoo Sik's room.)

825
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,280
(Won Kyu left a moment ago.)

826
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,709
I'm really sorry,

827
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,979
but I don't think Won Kyu is in the room.

828
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:03,020
- What do you need?
- May I borrow a steam iron?

829
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:05,320
Go ahead.

830
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,260
Won Kyu just went downstairs.

831
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:16,530
(Their conversation isn't over yet.)

832
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:21,300
(Yellow Room: Ji Yeon and Hyeon Ji's room)

833
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:24,510
(She was so busy getting ready that she didn't hear the knock.)

834
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:25,979
I'm going in.

835
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,609
(Min Kyung has come to Hyeon Ji.)

836
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:28,680
I'm going in.

837
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:31,549
- Min Kyung.
- Yes?

838
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,879
- I have a question.
- Okay.

839
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,890
- Come here.
- Okay.

840
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:40,789
Seung Yong wants to get back...

841
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:45,059
- together with me, right?
- Yes.

842
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,899
We broke up after the talk...

843
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,899
- of marriage came up.
- Right.

844
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:54,639
So he goes, "I know that you want to get married."

845
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,469
He tried to change my mind with those words.

846
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:01,540
You told me that you broke up due to realistic reasons.

847
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,279
I can't ask Yoo Sik...

848
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,120
because we aren't that close yet.

849
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,049
So, what were the reasons?

850
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,719
The realistic reasons? With Yoo Sik?

851
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,760
You briefly told me...

852
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:17,029
that you wanted him...

853
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:18,930
to work less.

854
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,700
That's right.

855
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:23,500
When we dated...

856
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:25,869
Perhaps he didn't plan a future together.

857
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:30,910
- Right.
- His values could be like that.

858
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,539
Not much time...

859
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,510
remains for me.

860
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:39,080
To be honest, I need to make up my mind quickly.

861
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:41,350
But I can't have that conversation.

862
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,289
- With Yoo Sik?
- Right.

863
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:44,490
It doesn't seem right.

864
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:50,230
When we were dating,

865
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,560
he never talked about something like that.

866
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,030
- Despite dating for years?
- Yes.

867
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:59,669
He always said,

868
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,400
"I'm not secure in my place yet."

869
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:05,009
"Things aren't perfect yet,"

870
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:06,610
"so I can't make empty promises."

871
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,249
So he couldn't tell you what you wanted to hear.

872
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:12,450
It was like that until the end.

873
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:16,020
But you're young. You aren't in a hurry to get married.

874
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,589
I'm not in a hurry, but...

875
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:20,459
Did you want certainty in the relationship?

876
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,720
No. Yoo Sik is...

877
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,599
(Sighing)

878
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,000
(Celibate)

879
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,369
(Celibate?)

880
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:34,639
I asked him yesterday.

881
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,309
Although he said that...

882
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:40,510
No. I asked, "Did you even imagine a future with me?"

883
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,310
He said that he did.

884
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,880
But it was my first time hearing that yesterday.

885
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:52,160
The relationship of many years tells me that he did.

886
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,290
Right.

887
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:56,559
When I heard Seung Yong's words,

888
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,830
I thought, "He really is a smart man."

889
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,159
I've been talking...

890
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,470
to Seung Yong a lot.

891
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:07,869
Your relationship with Seung Yong...

892
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:09,339
and my relationship with Yoo Sik...

893
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,869
were different.

894
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:12,070
- Really?
- Yes.

895
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:15,679
We did talk about marriage...

896
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,949
- while dating.
- Right.

897
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:20,380
- You guys were at that age.
- So it was on our minds.

898
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,920
But Yoo Sik and I are still young.

899
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:26,460
- Right.
- So...

900
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,759
How do you feel?

901
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,130
I haven't asked you that in a while.

902
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,760
- How do I feel?
- Yes.

903
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,929
When I think about the realistic matters,

904
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:39,940
Seung Yong is right.

905
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,539
Seung Yong did say that he let go of his pride a lot.

906
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:46,880
- He did let go of his pride a lot.
- Really?

907
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:52,279
Yoo Sik has no idea that I'm having these thoughts.

908
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,479
We haven't had this kind of conversation.

909
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,549
And it's too early...

910
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:57,890
- This kind of conversation...
- for that.

911
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:01,959
There's not much time to get to know someone...

912
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,230
in depth here.

913
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:06,160
- True.
- And from what I see,

914
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:08,930
Yoo Sik isn't the type...

915
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:13,140
to openly tell others about his feelings and such.

916
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:15,139
- Right.
- But that...

917
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:17,840
makes me uncertain.

918
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:22,650
- Let me get changed.
- Okay.

919
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,379
(The closer they get to making the decision, )

920
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,320
(the more dilemmas they face.)

921
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:33,490
Let's go.

922
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:36,189
- Which car?
- Get in.

923
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:38,130
- The 4 of us in this car?
- It must be just us 2.

924
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,260
I wonder what we'll do over there.

925
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:43,369
Won't we have dinner?

926
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:46,900
But to go somewhere else just for dinner?

927
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,870
What will we be asked to do?

928
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,140
Every situation is just frightening to me.

929
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:54,010
What do you think will be the most frightening?

930
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,110
Our current situation.

931
00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:00,280
We know nothing, like your feelings.

932
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:03,290
None of us know each other's feelings.

933
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:06,360
The only feelings I know are mine.

934
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,729
I had no idea I was this emotional.

935
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:12,090
Same. There's too much to think about.

936
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,900
You also get really emotional.

937
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:20,740
Can I have a blanket, please?

938
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:22,169
- Here.
- Thanks.

939
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:25,210
(Seung Yong suddenly asked for a blanket.)

940
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,740
- Did you bring it on purpose?
- Yes.

941
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,480
(Impressed)

942
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:35,249
Gosh, I'm nervous.

943
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:36,450
This is nerve-racking.

944
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,590
Seriously.

945
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:42,690
You're not at ease either.

946
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:44,890
- I feel uncomfortable.
- That's only natural.

947
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:48,829
- Seung Yong and I broke up...
- Yes?

948
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:50,569
Even though we had talked about...

949
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:51,669
- marriage.
- I see.

950
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:53,070
Seung Yong told me...

951
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,200
how much he has changed...

952
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:58,370
and how he could take...

953
00:47:58,670 --> 00:47:59,809
responsibility realistically.

954
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,380
That's not something you can ignore.

955
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,710
- I wanted to get married.
- Right.

956
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:06,780
But...

957
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:08,950
But you know,

958
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:12,590
talking about that with my date...

959
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:16,230
- felt wrong.
- I get it.

960
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,500
- It's a heavy topic.
- Exactly.

961
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,030
Your point is that you're wavering right now.

962
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:26,540
I have no idea what to do.

963
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,770
(They fall deeper into confusion.)

964
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:44,290
(The place everyone will gather tonight)

965
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,560
I can't help but get excited.

966
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,330
MOKICHI Kamakura.

967
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:52,230
Have we arrived?

968
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,330
- Get off on the left.
- Okay.

969
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:56,969
MOKICHI Kamakura.

970
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:59,870
(Baek Hyun, Woo Jin, Yoo Sik, and Ji Hyeon have arrived.)

971
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,470
- Shall we enter?
- Yes.

972
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,350
How pretty.

973
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,750
Nice.

974
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,860
It's a table full of feasts.

975
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,530
Unbelievable.

976
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,130
Is that jamon?

977
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:27,330
- Gosh.
- Oh, my. They look delicious.

978
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:38,339
(Won Kyu, Yun Nyeong, and Hyeon Ji have arrived.)

979
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,610
- Really.
- Where are we?

980
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,080
Let's go.

981
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,480
For real? This is a delicious restaurant.

982
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,550
- My gosh, it's an automatic door.
- What?

983
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:51,420
- Hi.
- They're here.

984
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:53,460
- Hi.
- Hey.

985
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,460
How do I get in there?

986
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,060
- Look.
- Relax.

987
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,729
- We prepared it for you guys.
- It looks good.

988
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:00,930
- Right?
- Yes.

989
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,070
What? Are you sitting in front of me?

990
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:05,300
- Hi.
- Hi.

991
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:07,040
What's your name?

992
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:09,740
- It's Park Ji Hyeon. Hi.
- I see.

993
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:13,910
- Us too.
- And your name is?

994
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:19,620
That day,

995
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,589
Hyeon Ji came wearing a nice outfit, so she looked pretty.

996
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:24,320
"Gosh, she looks pretty today."

997
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:29,390
Let's go.

998
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:32,329
(Seung Yong, Jae Hyeong, Min Kyung, and Ji Yeon have arrived.)

999
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:33,800
The others are already here.

1000
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:35,330
- We must be last.
- That surprised me.

1001
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,040
- Hi.
- Hi.

1002
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:45,709
Welcome.

1003
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:46,940
Hi.

1004
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:50,950
So the four of us will be sitting on this sofa.

1005
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:53,449
- Hi.
- Four? Here?

1006
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:54,920
Yes, it seems like it.

1007
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,220
- The food looks good, right?
- The table is for four.

1008
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:01,290
Can I borrow the blanket, Seung Yong?

1009
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:05,489
I had brought a blanket in case...

1010
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:07,899
she came wearing a short skirt or pants...

1011
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,800
to charm her at any chance I could get,

1012
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:13,539
but she was already covering herself up with one.

1013
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:17,209
So I lent the blanket to Min Kyung instead.

1014
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:20,080
(Seung Yong's effort towards Hyeon Ji didn't reach her.)

1015
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:22,850
- Really?
- We had the water ready.

1016
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:25,080
Thank you.

1017
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:26,680
They look good.

1018
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:28,420
- Gosh.
- Let's eat.

1019
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:30,150
Everyone is here.

1020
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,860
- Shall we dig in?
- Yes.

1021
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,219
- Cheers.
- Cheers. Just a little bit.

1022
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:37,129
- Cheers.
- Great job.

1023
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:39,190
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1024
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,669
- Is that alcohol, Won Kyu?
- This? Yes.

1025
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:43,799
(Dinner begins with a light drink.)

1026
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,969
- It's mixed with something.
- It's a mixed drink.

1027
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,070
- Is it mixed?
- Yes.

1028
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:48,800
It's good even when mixed.

1029
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:51,139
- Try it.
- Bon appetit.

1030
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,539
- Bon appetit.
- It's a first.

1031
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:53,610
Enjoy.

1032
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:55,509
I shall try...

1033
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:56,679
- the meat.
- Do you want more?

1034
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,180
- Split it?
- Yes.

1035
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,079
- We've got some.
- Thank you.

1036
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,150
It's good.

1037
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,420
It's good.

1038
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,220
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1039
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:14,030
The meat is good.

1040
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,200
I'm digging in.

1041
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:22,400
It's good.

1042
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,170
- I smell a bit of shrimp.
- Right?

1043
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:32,210
What's that?

1044
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:33,720
Which one?

1045
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,449
- What? That one?
- That delicious-looking dish.

1046
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:37,720
(The dish Won Kyu spotted)

1047
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,359
You must like meat.

1048
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,360
- We only have vegetables.
- True.

1049
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:44,430
Dig in, Kyu.

1050
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:47,630
- You want some, right?
- Yes.

1051
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,430
- Let's split.
- Okay.

1052
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:51,629
- Can I have pizza?
- Sure.

1053
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:52,740
Which one?

1054
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,540
Who wants a piece of pizza?

1055
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:04,779
- I want one.
- Okay.

1056
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:07,579
(Hyeon Ji notices Yun Nyeong's bracelet.)

1057
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:08,720
Sorry, not this one.

1058
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:12,619
The bracelet Baek Hyun wore was one he had on...

1059
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:15,719
even before we dated...

1060
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,490
and really treasured.

1061
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:21,599
(Baek Hyun has been wearing the bracelet...)

1062
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,370
(since the day he moved in.)

1063
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:29,269
(2 bracelets were linked in 1.)

1064
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:32,440
(He gave one to Yun Nyeong.)

1065
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:36,110
(The two are now connected by Baek Hyun's bracelet.)

1066
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,010
But at one point,

1067
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:41,350
I noticed Yun Nyeong wearing it.

1068
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:43,350
"Look at them."

1069
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,720
"Are the two going out for real?"

1070
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:50,260
It may have been jealousy.

1071
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:57,530
(Dinner isn't all that comfortable.)

1072
00:53:58,070 --> 00:53:59,399
- Baek Hyun's bracelet.
- The bracelet.

1073
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,700
She kept it on.

1074
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:01,870
- Really?
- Oh, my.

1075
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,369
- Isn't that...
- If Baek Hyun wore it...

1076
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:04,409
even while dating Hyeon Ji,

1077
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:05,709
- it'd...
- She'd know without a doubt.

1078
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:07,780
- Of course, she would know.
- be obvious to her.

1079
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,950
Give me some bacon, Mr. Won Kyu.

1080
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,120
Why do you keep adding "mister" after the ex reveal?

1081
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,989
- Because it's awkward.
- Wasn't it Mr. Kyu?

1082
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:18,990
- Mr. Kyu.
- Mr. Kyu.

1083
00:54:18,991 --> 00:54:20,060
It's an extension of that.

1084
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:23,259
We used to speak formally...

1085
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,430
- Every now and then.
- quite often.

1086
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,430
That's sweet.

1087
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,070
I was the one who spoke formally.

1088
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,899
I did too at times.

1089
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:32,970
No, I did.

1090
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:35,270
- Are we going to fight again?
- No.

1091
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:37,610
Enough.

1092
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:42,010
Just don't talk to me.

1093
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,050
How about a toast?

1094
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:46,180
- Okay.
- Yoo Sik.

1095
00:54:46,181 --> 00:54:47,250
It's empty.

1096
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:48,620
I guess it's to your taste.

1097
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,550
- I'm all about it.
- Cheers.

1098
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:02,160
(The time passes with a strange atmosphere.)

1099
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:04,430
Baek Hyun, aren't you...

1100
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:06,670
revealing yourself too much?

1101
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,039
- It was a bit...
- Again, Baek Hyun?

1102
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,770
- It's his charming point.
- Another one.

1103
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:12,270
- Is this his charming point?
- Yes.

1104
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:15,379
Last time when I was wiping up the wine that got on the carpet,

1105
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:17,209
- my top was...
- I know.

1106
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:18,280
Were you there?

1107
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:21,020
- Hyeon Ji and Min Kyung saw it.
- Yes.

1108
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:22,450
How funny.

1109
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:23,850
What?

1110
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:25,790
What is it?

1111
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:32,730
(An envelope has arrived.)

1112
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,430
It's suddenly hard to breathe.

1113
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:50,250
"You are to play truth or dare for the final decision."

1114
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:53,050
"One person can ask up to three questions."

1115
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:55,950
"But you can't ask obvious questions regarding the final decision."

1116
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:59,120
"You can refuse to answer only one of the questions..."

1117
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:00,990
"and answer the rest honestly."

1118
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:07,300
I did think we'd play it one day, but really...

1119
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:09,999
I wanted to run away from it.

1120
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,369
(A moment they wanted to avoid)

1121
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:13,540
I didn't want to do it. It's like...

1122
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:16,709
Everyone kind of has an idea about...

1123
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:18,470
the relationships we had.

1124
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:22,010
But actually facing the truth may make things uncomfortable.

1125
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:25,180
I didn't want to play the game.

1126
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:28,220
Since we're near the end,

1127
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:30,490
I was genuinely curious.

1128
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:35,559
Whether Yoo Sik is certain about her or not.

1129
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,929
Whether she's certain about getting back together or not.

1130
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:39,730
I've always wanted to know,

1131
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:41,960
so those were what I wanted to ask.

1132
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,899
My mind was a total mess.

1133
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:48,640
I thought, "We're finally near the end."

1134
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:54,980
(Tonight, everyone's truth will be disclosed.)

1135
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,750
- Truth or dare.
- Nice.

1136
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:00,180
It sounds fun.

1137
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,450
Truth or dare is so much fun.

1138
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,489
Totally.

1139
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:05,249
Catch the perfect timing,

1140
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:07,560
and the situation could change.

1141
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:11,390
- It's hard to decide what to ask.
- Right.

1142
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:14,400
I don't know how honest a question I should ask.

1143
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:16,770
We can't ask direct questions, right?

1144
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:19,029
- Only about the final decision.
- About the final decision.

1145
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:20,369
"Are you going to choose me?"

1146
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:21,939
- Nothing like this.
- Not like that one.

1147
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:23,440
Like, "Who are you going to choose?"

1148
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:24,670
"Who will you choose?"

1149
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:27,579
Who will start us off?

1150
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:28,810
Should we spin the bottle?

1151
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:31,550
- Spin it?
- Maybe.

1152
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:33,179
Is everyone thinking about it?

1153
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:34,180
Yes.

1154
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,250
Does anyone want to go first?

1155
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:38,890
Me.

1156
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:40,260
Me.

1157
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:42,930
My question is to Hyeon Ji.

1158
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:47,930
(The first question is to Hyeon Ji.)

1159
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:54,970
I'd like to know if you've had a change of heart.

1160
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:56,940
A change of heart about what?

1161
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,739
It could be your feelings...

1162
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:02,610
towards the guy you're interested in...

1163
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,710
or the final decision.

1164
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:08,620
While being here?

1165
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:10,320
Right now.

1166
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:11,490
Right now?

1167
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:21,559
I was scared but also curious.

1168
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:24,070
Either way, it's a fact I must accept.

1169
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:25,530
Hence why I asked.

1170
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,580
I'm not sure about the final decision.

1171
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:43,320
But my feelings haven't changed.

1172
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:55,199
It was obvious he asked about my feelings for Yoo Sik.

1173
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,530
I answered that they hadn't changed.

1174
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:02,339
With that, he would've confirmed my feelings for Yoo Sik.

1175
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:04,110
(She let him know about her solid feelings.)

1176
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:13,620
I will ask the guy I went on a date with today.

1177
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,820
(Hyeon Ji asks Yoo Sik.)

1178
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:22,059
Have you ever clearly expressed your feelings...

1179
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:24,130
to the girl you've set your heart on?

1180
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:27,959
I didn't have a clue.

1181
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:31,000
There are too many things I'm uncertain about.

1182
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:35,070
It's come to a point where I'm even thinking about reality.

1183
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:38,210
I'm genuinely interested in Yoo Sik,

1184
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:41,179
but for my feelings to grow drastically, I need assurance.

1185
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:44,080
But Yoo Sik hasn't given me that yet.

1186
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:46,250
So I asked out of curiosity.

1187
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:51,850
No, I haven't.

1188
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,029
- What?
- No?

1189
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:04,600
- He said he hasn't.
- What?

1190
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:06,739
He has never clearly expressed his feelings?

1191
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:08,299
- What about the ring?
- Hold on.

1192
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,709
Wait a minute. My mind is all jumbled up. What?

1193
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:14,310
Hold on. That means he hasn't set his heart on anyone.

1194
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:16,079
No, he has someone in his heart,

1195
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,409
but from his perspective,

1196
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:18,849
- he might've never...
- Expressing...

1197
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:21,019
- clearly expressed those feelings.
- I see.

1198
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:22,149
- By his standards.
- Probably.

1199
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:23,489
- By his standards.
- He was kind and all,

1200
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:25,389
- but Yoo Sik wasn't like, - Right.

1201
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:26,489
- "I like you." - True.

1202
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:27,860
So I get his answer.

1203
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,929
But the answer could've left...

1204
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:31,059
- Hyeon Ji in shock.
- Of course.

1205
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,189
- Exactly.
- Yes.

1206
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:33,999
- Hyeon Ji must be confused.
- Totally.

1207
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,259
The thing about staying single, spotting the bracelet,

1208
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:37,829
and even no assurance now.

1209
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:39,800
- This is bad.
- Everything happened all at once.

1210
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:43,470
Yoo Sik...

1211
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:45,940
neither chose me nor Hyeon Ji...

1212
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:49,740
with that answer.

1213
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:54,780
I still don't get what he's thinking.

1214
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:05,690
Yoo Sik seemed uncertain...

1215
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:07,629
and like he had a lot on his mind.

1216
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:09,230
He was lost in thought.

1217
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:13,740
I gave such an answer...

1218
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:16,240
because I've never mentioned that my feelings...

1219
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,640
were close to the final decision.

1220
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:20,309
Not even once.

1221
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:21,810
So my answer was no.

1222
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:27,950
We have 2 to 3 days before making the final decision,

1223
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:31,420
so it could change anytime.

1224
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:35,560
I didn't want to say anything in advance.

1225
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:45,270
I will ask Hyeon Ji.

1226
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:51,370
(Yoo Sik asks Hyeon Ji.)

1227
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:56,080
If Baek Hyun had tried...

1228
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:05,750
to get back with you from the start, would you have been swayed?

1229
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:14,499
I thought that Hyeon Ji still had feelings...

1230
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:17,770
for Baek Hyun, so that's why I asked that question.

1231
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:23,540
I couldn't help but feel bothered by it.

1232
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:25,910
I was nervous.

1233
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:35,919
I wouldn't have decided to get back with him out of emotions.

1234
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,690
It was important for me to talk to Baek Hyun.

1235
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:48,560
I don't think that my answer was...

1236
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:51,270
very clear.

1237
01:02:51,370 --> 01:02:52,929
I didn't think the answer was...

1238
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:54,870
enough to reassure Yoo Sik.

1239
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:56,610
Did I answer your question?

1240
01:02:57,070 --> 01:02:58,610
- What?
- Did I answer your question?

1241
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:00,840
Yes.

1242
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,510
He didn't look happy.

1243
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:12,390
I didn't particularly like the answer,

1244
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:16,460
but I didn't want to be inquisitive.

1245
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:18,960
So I said okay.

1246
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:22,760
I can understand.

1247
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:26,070
I'll ask Hyeon Ji.

1248
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:29,799
(Min Kyung asks Hyeon Ji.)

1249
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:30,870
Earlier,

1250
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:35,740
you said that you weren't sure about the final decision.

1251
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:39,510
What's stopping you from feeling sure about it?

1252
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:43,450
It seems like you're concerned about something.

1253
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:47,790
"Why is she asking when she knows?"

1254
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:50,489
I told her what I was...

1255
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:51,630
concerned about,

1256
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:56,060
but she asked me again in front of everyone.

1257
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,299
I didn't know how to react.

1258
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:00,740
The subject is...

1259
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:05,740
quite heavy and very personal.

1260
01:04:06,270 --> 01:04:09,580
I supposed that her concern was...

1261
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:13,250
related to marriage.

1262
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:18,350
As she and Yoo Sik have different opinions,

1263
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:22,960
I thought the situation could change completely.

1264
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:28,730
Do I have to make it obvious to everyone?

1265
01:04:30,930 --> 01:04:31,999
Do you have several concerns?

1266
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,740
It's what I told you a moment ago.

1267
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:36,869
- You don't have to answer.
- The problem...

1268
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:37,940
You can refuse to answer.

1269
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:41,310
Here's the problem.

1270
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:45,379
We weren't given enough time here...

1271
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:48,080
to get to know someone.

1272
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:53,860
Making the final decision is important.

1273
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:57,029
I didn't get much chance...

1274
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:58,890
to talk to the one I'm interested in.

1275
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:01,760
That's why I cannot be sure.

1276
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,449
If he and I had talked...

1277
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:25,920
a lot about our relationship,

1278
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:29,360
we would've discussed our values too.

1279
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:32,659
I don't think we talked enough...

1280
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:34,960
before having the serious talk.

1281
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,000
And so,

1282
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:41,670
before picking Yoo Sik,

1283
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:47,279
I don't think it'd be possible...

1284
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:50,509
to talk about marriage.

1285
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:51,809
"Even before having the talk,"

1286
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:55,419
"I might not be able to decide."

1287
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:56,820
That's what I thought.

1288
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:02,819
(The time is drifting in confusion for everyone.)

1289
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:05,289
Depending on the issue of marriage,

1290
01:06:05,290 --> 01:06:08,199
Hyeon Ji can set emotions aside.

1291
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,430
- That's what she's saying.
- Right.

1292
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:13,329
I didn't expect that to affect...

1293
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:14,639
her decision directly.

1294
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:17,040
Will Hyeon Ji and Yoo Sik drift apart like this?

1295
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:20,710
(The truth or dare continues.)

1296
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,280
I'll ask Won Kyu.

1297
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:27,280
(Ji Yeon asks Won Kyu.)

1298
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:31,389
You went on many dates here.

1299
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:32,590
Whoever your date may be.

1300
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:35,320
Which date made your heart flutter the most?

1301
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:38,330
I wanted to ask that question.

1302
01:06:40,090 --> 01:06:41,460
You can ask the same question.

1303
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:48,970
My favorite was...

1304
01:06:49,070 --> 01:06:50,099
The one that made your heart flutter.

1305
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:51,970
- I will tell you both.
- Okay.

1306
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:54,239
Is that two questions?

1307
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,579
- No, he wants to say...
- He has two answers...

1308
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:57,080
- both.
- for one question.

1309
01:06:59,550 --> 01:07:01,049
I thought that he was being...

1310
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:02,580
uselessly specific and honest.

1311
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:09,189
My favorite was...

1312
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:14,060
when we took a walk in Samcheong-dong in the beginning.

1313
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:17,770
The one that made my heart flutter the most was...

1314
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:22,270
when we came to Japan.

1315
01:07:24,170 --> 01:07:26,309
The date when we made pottery.

1316
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:27,480
- Really?
- Yes.

1317
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:29,580
- Among all the dates you had?
- Yes.

1318
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:35,650
I'll ask Ji Yeon.

1319
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:37,320
- Ji Yeon?
- Yes.

1320
01:07:38,990 --> 01:07:42,560
(Won Kyu asks Ji Yeon.)

1321
01:07:45,930 --> 01:07:48,960
Which of our dates made your heart flutter the most?

1322
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,299
(He asked her exactly the same question.)

1323
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:55,239
- My goodness.
- Oh, my.

1324
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:56,269
I'll just drink by myself.

1325
01:07:56,270 --> 01:07:58,270
- Gosh.
- Let's drink together.

1326
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:10,520
When we went to an izakaya in Sinsa-dong.

1327
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:14,790
Is that the day when I came?

1328
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:16,860
- I don't think so.
- Really?

1329
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,790
- Yes.
- An izakaya in Sinsa-dong.

1330
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:21,300
Tteokbokki?

1331
01:08:22,030 --> 01:08:23,200
What tteokbokki?

1332
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,400
Isn't it the place with good tteokbokki?

1333
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:28,570
No, have we been there together?

1334
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:30,140
If not, never mind.

1335
01:08:30,141 --> 01:08:31,370
It's not the tteokbokki place.

1336
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:36,680
I will ask.

1337
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,249
I'll ask Won Kyu.

1338
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:42,450
(Ji Hyeon asks Won Kyu.)

1339
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:51,060
Didn't you give her your t-shirt?

1340
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:53,460
Goodness.

1341
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,599
- She goes over it one more time.
- It never ends.

1342
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:01,640
Let's go.

1343
01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:03,610
Didn't you give her your t-shirt?

1344
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:05,810
Goodness.

1345
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:09,940
Once he said something else.

1346
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:12,549
He said that Ji Yeon had taken it.

1347
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:13,880
He said that I had taken it?

1348
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:15,649
- Won Kyu.
- Listen.

1349
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:18,019
I said that before hearing what you said.

1350
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:19,949
After hearing what you said,

1351
01:09:19,950 --> 01:09:21,690
- I told her that I gave it to you.
- Yun Nyeong.

1352
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:23,160
You said...

1353
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:25,489
- About that...
- I don't feel emotional about it.

1354
01:09:25,490 --> 01:09:27,159
I just want to know what really happened.

1355
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:29,560
Back then, I didn't know what really happened.

1356
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:32,029
You said that Ji Yeon had taken it.

1357
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:33,600
So I asked Ji Yeon about it.

1358
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:35,940
- "Oh, I gave it to her." - Yes, I realized it.

1359
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:37,940
- And so...
- Why did you give it to her?

1360
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:40,479
- I don't remember.
- Okay.

1361
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:41,840
Which t-shirt did you give to her?

1362
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:42,910
All right.

1363
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:44,979
- I had no idea about it.
- You don't know?

1364
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:47,420
No, I don't. I don't know what happened.

1365
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:49,549
Here's what happened.

1366
01:09:49,550 --> 01:09:52,019
Yun Nyeong, could you explain the situation?

1367
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:54,760
- The vibe made it happen.
- Yes, it was the vibe.

1368
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:57,090
Here's what I know.

1369
01:09:57,890 --> 01:10:00,930
Ji Yeon was about to go out.

1370
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:04,029
I saw that she was wearing the same shirt as Won Kyu.

1371
01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:05,429
She was wearing the same shirt?

1372
01:10:05,430 --> 01:10:08,400
So I asked her...

1373
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:10,469
- if it was Won Kyu's.
- You asked her.

1374
01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:13,010
Why did you go out while wearing that?

1375
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:15,480
I can't understand why he let you borrow it either.

1376
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:18,109
I just want to know.

1377
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:20,779
- Woo Jin got angry a little late.
- I see laser beams in your eyes.

1378
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:23,049
- He had no idea.
- I didn't know about it.

1379
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:24,820
I find it hard to understand.

1380
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:27,689
Weren't you wearing it the day after drinking?

1381
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:30,320
I got the t-shirt the day before...

1382
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:32,830
- I got it the day before.
- Okay.

1383
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:37,000
I put it on the next day.

1384
01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:41,869
I wasn't being considerate of Won Kyu's ex...

1385
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:44,210
or my ex.

1386
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,170
I was being careless.

1387
01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:47,639
- No, you weren't.
- Back then...

1388
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,579
- It happens.
- Won Kyu was being careless.

1389
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:50,750
Yes, it was me.

1390
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:52,480
- It happens.
- I was the one.

1391
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:54,650
I have no excuse.

1392
01:10:55,650 --> 01:10:57,390
- Shall we clink glasses?
- Let's do it.

1393
01:10:57,490 --> 01:10:59,419
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1394
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:00,890
- Cheers.
- Let's put it behind us.

1395
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:02,560
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1396
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,660
The air feels so heavy.

1397
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,359
It'd be strange if it were cheerful.

1398
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:09,660
That's true.

1399
01:11:10,030 --> 01:11:11,069
What?

1400
01:11:11,070 --> 01:11:12,430
It'd be strange if the vibe were cheerful.

1401
01:11:18,710 --> 01:11:19,710
I'll ask Ji Hyeon.

1402
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:24,110
(Won Kyu asks Ji Hyeon.)

1403
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:27,350
When did Yoo Sik make your heart flutter the most?

1404
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,319
What did you say?

1405
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,220
What made your heart flutter the most about Yoo Sik?

1406
01:11:32,590 --> 01:11:33,790
- About Yoo Sik?
- Yes.

1407
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:53,070
Throughout my date with Yoo Sik,

1408
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:56,380
he always put the other person before him.

1409
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:59,480
It touched me so much.

1410
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:03,920
I felt that he was such a gentleman.

1411
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:12,190
I thought how nice it would be to be with someone so gentle.

1412
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:21,169
I realized that being with someone like Yoo Sik is...

1413
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,840
what makes her happy.

1414
01:12:24,710 --> 01:12:27,240
If we were to get back together,

1415
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:30,550
in order to make her happy,

1416
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,509
I'd have to work on that.

1417
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:34,980
I realized it once again.

1418
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:43,259
It's a trend in 2026.

1419
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:44,290
A gentleman.

1420
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:47,199
Yes, being gentle.

1421
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,229
Being a gentleman has always been a trend.

1422
01:12:49,230 --> 01:12:51,229
Being a bad boy had also been trendy.

1423
01:12:51,230 --> 01:12:53,269
Even a man who appears cold has a warm side.

1424
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:54,839
- Exactly.
- Right.

1425
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,199
Even if he's a bad boy.

1426
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:57,769
You have to be gentle.

1427
01:12:57,770 --> 01:12:58,770
Of course.

1428
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:00,680
I'll go.

1429
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:03,040
I'll ask Ji Hyeon first.

1430
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:06,249
(Jae Hyeong asks Ji Hyeon.)

1431
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:08,020
Wait, shall we clink glasses?

1432
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:11,419
- Just because...
- Let's drink together.

1433
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:12,590
Let's drink together.

1434
01:13:12,690 --> 01:13:14,090
Whoever wants to drink, let's drink.

1435
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:21,830
Shall I start?

1436
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:24,500
Do you think...

1437
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:27,600
your date today could affect your decision?

1438
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:37,410
I was very flustered. It was expected of Jae Hyeong.

1439
01:13:38,710 --> 01:13:39,850
He's straightforward.

1440
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:42,320
Does Jae Hyeong hope...

1441
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:47,020
to be my final decision?

1442
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:48,820
That's what I thought.

1443
01:13:55,830 --> 01:13:57,570
I think it's possible.

1444
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:03,470
I didn't feel good about it.

1445
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:06,739
They must have felt...

1446
01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:10,180
more connection than I expected.

1447
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:12,880
I felt good.

1448
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:14,680
After her date with me,

1449
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:16,919
I hoped that she'd have...

1450
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:20,420
stronger feelings for me than her ex.

1451
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:22,719
I was clear about being open...

1452
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:24,590
to possibilities until the final decision.

1453
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:28,300
I really enjoyed my second date with Jae Hyeong.

1454
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:30,930
So my answer was that it was possible.

1455
01:14:33,630 --> 01:14:34,740
Can I ask a question?

1456
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:36,600
I'll ask Yun Nyeong.

1457
01:14:37,410 --> 01:14:40,010
(Woo Jin asks Yun Nyeong.)

1458
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:42,210
In my opinion,

1459
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:46,380
you have feelings for only one person.

1460
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:49,020
If that leads to your final decision,

1461
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,620
do you think you'll be...

1462
01:14:52,990 --> 01:14:55,990
able to be with him outside of the show?

1463
01:15:02,430 --> 01:15:03,800
That's my hope.

1464
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:11,439
I didn't care about anyone else.

1465
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,140
I believe that I only showed...

1466
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,210
my true feelings for Baek Hyun.

1467
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:19,480
Does anyone else want to ask a question?

1468
01:15:20,210 --> 01:15:21,520
I'll go.

1469
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,790
My only interest is Baek Hyun.

1470
01:15:25,950 --> 01:15:28,090
(Yun Nyeong asks Baek Hyun.)

1471
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:30,960
If we were given...

1472
01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:33,190
more time...

1473
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:37,429
If we had more time,

1474
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:40,600
and your ex did her best to win your heart...

1475
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:42,270
Okay.

1476
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,070
Would you have been swayed?

1477
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,520
Hyeon Ji was sitting right next to me.

1478
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:02,489
Eight out of ten times,

1479
01:16:02,490 --> 01:16:04,690
Baek Hyun was looking at Hyeon Ji.

1480
01:16:04,890 --> 01:16:06,529
That's when I realized...

1481
01:16:06,530 --> 01:16:09,630
that I should ask him this question.

1482
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:12,830
Hyeon Ji kept catching Baek Hyun's eyes.

1483
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:14,740
Since it was an unconscious act,

1484
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:16,900
I asked him that question.

1485
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:21,339
- Seriously?
- Gosh.

1486
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:22,340
Really?

1487
01:16:22,341 --> 01:16:24,279
- Seriously?
- And she's been witnessing that?

1488
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:26,309
Being drawn to someone can be unconscious.

1489
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:28,179
Baek Hyun probably didn't realize it.

1490
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:30,219
Gosh, Yun Nyeong.

1491
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:31,519
She caught his instinct.

1492
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,550
- That's a great question.
- I agree.

1493
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:40,860
I could have been tempted.

1494
01:16:58,510 --> 01:17:00,849
Actually, I already knew that...

1495
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:04,050
Hyeon Ji held a special place in his heart.

1496
01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:06,650
It wasn't something I could stop.

1497
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:10,719
I told her that I could have been tempted...

1498
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:12,689
because it was the truth.

1499
01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:15,360
When Hyeon Ji told me some things on our last night...

1500
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,130
in Pyeongchang-dong,

1501
01:17:17,930 --> 01:17:19,070
she did stir up my feelings.

1502
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,670
That's why I gave an honest answer.

1503
01:17:24,570 --> 01:17:29,480
(His honest answer will stir up someone's feelings.)

1504
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:37,620
Can I go next?

1505
01:17:38,350 --> 01:17:39,890
- What? Yes. You can.
- Yes.

1506
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:42,820
I'll ask Hyeon Ji.

1507
01:17:49,330 --> 01:17:52,130
It's about the curry I made. Did the flavor change?

1508
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,439
Wait. You cooked curry?

1509
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:57,609
It was you.

1510
01:17:57,610 --> 01:17:59,609
- But I had a feeling it was you.
- Seriously.

1511
01:17:59,610 --> 01:18:00,910
I didn't even get to try it.

1512
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:06,350
- I didn't know.
- The curry...

1513
01:18:13,090 --> 01:18:14,990
It's good. It was delicious.

1514
01:18:16,590 --> 01:18:17,730
It was the best.

1515
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,469
- My gosh. This is what we call...
- Oh, no.

1516
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:31,069
- a complete mess.
- Right. This is...

1517
01:18:31,070 --> 01:18:33,009
- That question...
- Why did he ask her that now?

1518
01:18:33,010 --> 01:18:34,179
Wasn't he asking about love?

1519
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:36,439
- He made it for Hyeon Ji.
- "I used to make curry for you."

1520
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:38,209
"Did the flavor change?" Asking that...

1521
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:39,649
He's basically asking, "Did it make you think about us?"

1522
01:18:39,650 --> 01:18:41,019
- Exactly.
- Why in front of Yun Nyeong?

1523
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:42,020
- Right.
- Exactly.

1524
01:18:42,021 --> 01:18:43,580
To me, it looks like Baek Hyun...

1525
01:18:43,650 --> 01:18:47,149
secretly wants Hyeon Ji to be hung up on him.

1526
01:18:47,150 --> 01:18:49,389
- I think part of him wants that.
- Yes. Part of him...

1527
01:18:49,390 --> 01:18:50,789
- The same goes for the crutches.
- Yes.

1528
01:18:50,790 --> 01:18:52,459
And this question about curry too.

1529
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:53,889
- Right.
- This question is making her...

1530
01:18:53,890 --> 01:18:55,329
- think about their relationship.
- Right.

1531
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:57,929
I guess in the end, she means a lot to him.

1532
01:18:57,930 --> 01:18:59,069
She must have a significant role in his life.

1533
01:18:59,070 --> 01:19:00,299
Asking this kind...

1534
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:02,099
of thoughtless question might disappoint Yun Nyeong.

1535
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:03,900
- Right.
- Exactly.

1536
01:19:06,710 --> 01:19:08,210
Does anyone else want to ask questions?

1537
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:10,480
Does anyone else want to go next?

1538
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,080
I have a question for Yoo Sik.

1539
01:19:14,010 --> 01:19:15,280
Let's say...

1540
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:24,159
I had a stronger desire to get back together with her,

1541
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:25,290
so...

1542
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:31,830
if I were to give my all to try winning her back,

1543
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:36,570
would you have kept trying to the end?

1544
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:45,010
I could see that Baek Hyun was thinking about me.

1545
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:50,989
I wanted to know whether or not he would have felt confident...

1546
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:53,020
pursuing her with me in the picture.

1547
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,920
I was really curious whether or not...

1548
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:59,290
he thought he could beat me...

1549
01:19:59,730 --> 01:20:02,700
while expressing his interest in her.

1550
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,670
If I was serious about my feelings toward her,

1551
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,640
I would've tried without giving up.

1552
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:28,190
He said, "if I was serious about feelings toward her."

1553
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:32,360
His answer confused me again.

1554
01:20:32,730 --> 01:20:36,199
Honestly, when the date for the final decision...

1555
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,700
seemed far off,

1556
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:41,469
I just thought I could talk to him more...

1557
01:20:41,470 --> 01:20:43,039
and get to know him better.

1558
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,670
I thought talking to him more...

1559
01:20:44,870 --> 01:20:47,780
would help me be more certain about my decision.

1560
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:52,479
After hearing a series of confusing answers...

1561
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,580
and facing similar situations repeatedly,

1562
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:57,219
it felt like I was slowly drifting away...

1563
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:59,850
from choosing him in my final decision.

1564
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:05,060
I'll go.

1565
01:21:06,860 --> 01:21:09,299
I have a question for Yoo Sik.

1566
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:10,429
- Me?
- Yes.

1567
01:21:10,430 --> 01:21:12,930
(Min Kyung asks Yoo Sik.)

1568
01:21:13,730 --> 01:21:15,070
Yesterday, you said...

1569
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:19,570
you did imagine a future with me.

1570
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:22,780
Could you tell me about that?

1571
01:21:22,940 --> 01:21:24,580
Tell me the future you thought about.

1572
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,180
I thought that...

1573
01:21:29,150 --> 01:21:30,750
I should do whatever it took...

1574
01:21:31,590 --> 01:21:33,950
to make you happy.

1575
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:39,230
I would've done anything to make that happen.

1576
01:21:39,890 --> 01:21:41,530
That was the future you had in mind?

1577
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:44,570
I wanted to keep making you happy.

1578
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:49,270
You were part of the happy future I imagined.

1579
01:21:51,570 --> 01:21:52,970
I had never...

1580
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:57,540
thought about having anyone else in my future than you.

1581
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:06,420
I had never imagined my life...

1582
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:11,530
without you. Not even for a moment.

1583
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:13,690
That was the future...

1584
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:16,199
I pictured.

1585
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:20,930
(That was the future I pictured.)

1586
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:39,420
It was what I had been waiting...

1587
01:22:42,790 --> 01:22:44,390
to hear from him.

1588
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:51,770
Had he told me these things a little sooner,

1589
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,699
we wouldn't have broken up.

1590
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:56,470
That crossed my mind.

1591
01:22:58,510 --> 01:23:00,140
It really broke my heart.

1592
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:06,080
I got the feeling that he had been thinking about this...

1593
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:09,980
since I asked him about it the day before.

1594
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:14,890
Had we been a bit more honest...

1595
01:23:16,590 --> 01:23:18,790
and able to talk more freely,

1596
01:23:19,330 --> 01:23:21,200
we could've kept dating.

1597
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:26,330
I regret the time that's passed.

1598
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:30,499
- Can I ask a question?
- Sure.

1599
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:31,840
- I have one for Min Kyung.
- Sure.

1600
01:23:33,610 --> 01:23:36,910
I don't know how you feel right now.

1601
01:23:37,610 --> 01:23:38,809
But there must be a result...

1602
01:23:38,810 --> 01:23:40,010
- you want.
- Yes.

1603
01:23:40,850 --> 01:23:43,720
Do you think you can keep trying your best...

1604
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:47,320
to make that happen and to have no regret in the end?

1605
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:54,390
Through this game of truth or dare,

1606
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:57,869
I wanted everyone to know...

1607
01:23:57,870 --> 01:23:59,999
just about how sincere Min Kyung was.

1608
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,770
That's why I asked her that question.

1609
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:11,310
Right now, I feel like I've done everything I could.

1610
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:13,280
But...

1611
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:16,050
whatever happens,

1612
01:24:16,450 --> 01:24:18,389
I think Yoo Sik will regret it.

1613
01:24:18,390 --> 01:24:21,660
(I think Yoo Sik will regret it.)

1614
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:23,889
I was really good to him.

1615
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:26,060
Of course, he tried his best too.

1616
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:28,060
But...

1617
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,930
I gave him every kind of love I had.

1618
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:35,600
He'll regret it for sure.

1619
01:24:36,370 --> 01:24:37,770
I'm certain of that.

1620
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:45,880
If Yoo Sik decides to let go of me,

1621
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:50,120
I'm certain he'll regret it...

1622
01:24:50,350 --> 01:24:51,550
because...

1623
01:24:52,550 --> 01:24:54,120
when we broke up,

1624
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:56,490
it was me who gave up on us,

1625
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:00,490
but I'm regretting that now.

1626
01:25:04,030 --> 01:25:05,400
I didn't want Yoo Sik...

1627
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:10,170
to regret it.

1628
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:13,910
I wanted to tell him...

1629
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:19,049
I didn't want him to regret it since I was regretting my decision.

1630
01:25:19,050 --> 01:25:21,010
That's what I've been telling him.

1631
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:33,090
I didn't think that it would come to this.

1632
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:38,100
But things kept getting worse for us.

1633
01:25:41,740 --> 01:25:45,140
I failed to see that my decision would hurt him.

1634
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:50,780
I regret the moments when I only thought about myself.

1635
01:25:57,720 --> 01:26:00,650
I knew how much Min Kyung wanted to get back together...

1636
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:03,060
and where she stood.

1637
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:05,430
So I don't think...

1638
01:26:05,930 --> 01:26:10,530
I should take this matter lightly.

1639
01:26:12,270 --> 01:26:13,929
I need to be...

1640
01:26:13,930 --> 01:26:16,540
a lot more careful with my decision.

1641
01:26:16,970 --> 01:26:20,270
I should keep thinking about it until the moment...

1642
01:26:21,310 --> 01:26:25,680
I have to make my final decision. That's what I think.

1643
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:41,400
(The time they thought had stopped starts moving again.)

1644
01:26:45,070 --> 01:26:47,330
The game of truth or dare changed a lot of things.

1645
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:50,039
This is so heartbreaking. It's driving me crazy.

1646
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:53,269
The true catfish of this season was the truth or dare.

1647
01:26:53,270 --> 01:26:55,239
- Right. It changed everything.
- It changed everything.

1648
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:57,609
- You're right. It reset everything.
- Right.

1649
01:26:57,610 --> 01:26:58,649
- Everything was reset.
- Right.

1650
01:26:58,650 --> 01:27:00,579
- What a pity.
- It reset everything, seriously.

1651
01:27:00,580 --> 01:27:02,149
- The date with the ex will matter.
- What is this?

1652
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:04,319
Some couples might fight on the date.

1653
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,949
Going on a date with their ex after a reset...

1654
01:27:06,950 --> 01:27:09,860
- might create some momentum. Yes.
- Then... Right.

1655
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:11,590
This will get more complicated.

1656
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:15,900
Let's go.

1657
01:27:16,260 --> 01:27:17,330
It's a spa.

1658
01:27:18,730 --> 01:27:21,000
- Where's Mr. Kyu?
- My gosh.

1659
01:27:25,870 --> 01:27:26,870
Let's keep trying.

1660
01:27:27,370 --> 01:27:30,280
I've gotten everything off my chest, though.

1661
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:33,050
I said Yoo Sik would regret it.

1662
01:27:33,950 --> 01:27:36,580
That's what I wanted to say at the end.

1663
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:38,850
Wasn't that cool?

1664
01:27:39,250 --> 01:27:40,990
- Of course. It was cool.
- Gosh.

1665
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:43,289
- No, I was joking.
- No. It was cool.

1666
01:27:43,290 --> 01:27:45,490
I don't think I can be that direct.

1667
01:27:47,730 --> 01:27:48,730
My gosh.

1668
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:51,570
He'll regret it later.

1669
01:27:51,630 --> 01:27:52,670
Right.

1670
01:27:52,870 --> 01:27:55,040
You can seduce anyone.

1671
01:27:55,340 --> 01:27:58,240
- Totally. I...
- You're drop-dead gorgeous.

1672
01:27:58,510 --> 01:28:01,369
Right? You're in plastic surgery.

1673
01:28:01,370 --> 01:28:03,280
- Of course. Sure.
- Right?

1674
01:28:04,210 --> 01:28:05,710
- I think...
- Yes.

1675
01:28:06,350 --> 01:28:07,410
You're a princess.

1676
01:28:07,810 --> 01:28:08,820
Yes, I am.

1677
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:11,080
You can seduce anyone in this world.

1678
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:13,990
You can totally meet someone better.

1679
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:17,490
- I'm serious, by the way.
- Oaky.

1680
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,629
The more I get to know you, the more charming you get.

1681
01:28:19,630 --> 01:28:21,029
Hey, you're a princess.

1682
01:28:21,030 --> 01:28:22,160
Thank you.

1683
01:28:24,530 --> 01:28:27,070
What's going on? We have a princess and a prince in the back?

1684
01:28:28,070 --> 01:28:30,000
Hey. You don't think you're not a prince?

1685
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:32,640
You're a prince too.

1686
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:37,140
- Come on. We can do this.
- We can do this.

1687
01:28:37,510 --> 01:28:39,250
- You're a princess.
- I'm a princess.

1688
01:28:40,510 --> 01:28:41,750
- Let's get out.
- Okay.

1689
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:44,789
Great job, everyone.

1690
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:47,950
(Everyone comes back to the house after playing truth or dare.)

1691
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:55,360
- Is anyone inside?
- Yes.

1692
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:57,600
- Wait. Is it just you?
- Come on in.

1693
01:28:57,630 --> 01:28:59,199
- Who else is in here?
- I'm here too.

1694
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:00,700
Really? What are you doing?

1695
01:29:00,930 --> 01:29:02,299
- I'm not doing anything much.
- Really?

1696
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:03,500
Yes. Come on in.

1697
01:29:05,270 --> 01:29:07,140
- Why don't you tell her?
- What?

1698
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:09,839
You know, we played truth or dare.

1699
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,380
I wanted to know how you were feeling afterward.

1700
01:29:13,050 --> 01:29:15,050
- I know you're upset.
- What?

1701
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:16,979
I know you're upset.

1702
01:29:16,980 --> 01:29:18,289
Me? Why would I be?

1703
01:29:18,290 --> 01:29:19,419
What upset you?

1704
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:21,020
- Did I look upset?
- Yes.

1705
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:22,320
You seemed to have a lot on your mind.

1706
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:24,060
- Really?
- Yes. What was it?

1707
01:29:24,390 --> 01:29:26,390
Can you tell me when Woo Jin leaves?

1708
01:29:28,660 --> 01:29:30,029
- What?
- I'll leave. Give me a second.

1709
01:29:30,030 --> 01:29:31,230
- Wait.
- Okay.

1710
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,429
I'll go and look for my love too.

1711
01:29:33,430 --> 01:29:34,700
Bye.

1712
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,140
I have to go to her.

1713
01:29:41,740 --> 01:29:45,079
By the way, let me clarify something.

1714
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:47,209
I wasn't upset. It's just stuck in my head.

1715
01:29:47,210 --> 01:29:49,220
- I see. Really? What was it?
- Yes.

1716
01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:54,620
(Yun Nyeong takes off the bracelet Baek Hyun gave her.)

1717
01:29:54,621 --> 01:29:56,920
- Why are you taking it off now?
- I wanted to put it on again.

1718
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:01,360
Don't do that when we're having a serious conversation.

1719
01:30:02,030 --> 01:30:03,759
- You scared me.
- No. This bracelet...

1720
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:05,729
- I wanted to put it over my sleeve.
- Just keep it on.

1721
01:30:05,730 --> 01:30:08,169
- I wanted to put it over my sleeve.
- Okay.

1722
01:30:08,170 --> 01:30:09,370
(He's worried as he's never seen her act this way.)

1723
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:10,700
You know,

1724
01:30:11,470 --> 01:30:13,470
- I kept looking at you.
- Yes.

1725
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:15,780
Something seemed off about you.

1726
01:30:17,140 --> 01:30:18,450
I thought you had a lot on your mind...

1727
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:20,080
or something upset you.

1728
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:21,579
I wondered if my curry question upset you.

1729
01:30:21,580 --> 01:30:23,079
I thought I should clear up...

1730
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:25,020
some things about the curry when we got back.

1731
01:30:25,090 --> 01:30:27,349
"Clear up" is the wrong expression. I wanted to explain the backstory.

1732
01:30:27,350 --> 01:30:28,659
That wasn't the problem.

1733
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:31,159
You used to cook curry for her when you were...

1734
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:32,490
dating Hyeon Ji.

1735
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:35,729
Actually,

1736
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:39,230
that made me think that you were a good boyfriend.

1737
01:30:40,070 --> 01:30:42,669
I didn't mean to observe you this closely.

1738
01:30:42,670 --> 01:30:43,999
But I noticed that...

1739
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,370
you kept looking at Hyeon Ji without realizing it yourself.

1740
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:46,670
So...

1741
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:49,239
you looked at her 8 out of 10 times.

1742
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:50,710
That's why I kept staring at you.

1743
01:30:50,780 --> 01:30:51,910
Really?

1744
01:30:54,010 --> 01:30:56,950
- We started drinking there.
- Yes.

1745
01:30:57,250 --> 01:30:59,789
I thought you might have some unresolved feelings...

1746
01:30:59,790 --> 01:31:02,159
toward Hyeon Ji that you weren't aware of.

1747
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:03,419
It was your subconscious.

1748
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:06,530
You couldn't help yourself but look at her.

1749
01:31:06,730 --> 01:31:08,500
But you did look at her a lot.

1750
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:16,799
- To be completely honest, - Yes.

1751
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,509
- I didn't think it'd bother me.
- Okay.

1752
01:31:18,510 --> 01:31:19,570
- I swear.
- Okay.

1753
01:31:19,970 --> 01:31:21,680
- But once I moved into the house, - Yes.

1754
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:23,880
- it felt really weird.
- I see.

1755
01:31:24,740 --> 01:31:26,050
But...

1756
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:28,779
during the preliminary interviews and so on,

1757
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:31,649
I said I didn't have that many memories about Hyeon Ji.

1758
01:31:31,650 --> 01:31:32,790
- I'm serious.
- Okay.

1759
01:31:33,450 --> 01:31:36,059
I told them I didn't remember much.

1760
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:38,160
- I said that a lot in my interview.
- Okay.

1761
01:31:38,430 --> 01:31:40,260
- But once I saw Hyeon Ji...
- Okay.

1762
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:41,590
Did you remember everything?

1763
01:31:42,930 --> 01:31:44,130
After moving in,

1764
01:31:45,230 --> 01:31:47,570
- I felt conflicted emotionally.
- I see.

1765
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,200
I remembered...

1766
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:52,610
the difficult times I went through while dating Hyeon Ji.

1767
01:31:53,870 --> 01:31:56,180
Those memories suddenly occurred to me.

1768
01:31:56,540 --> 01:31:58,610
Then I read the ex's introduction.

1769
01:32:01,310 --> 01:32:02,619
I thought...

1770
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:04,920
Hyeon Ji would never want to get back with me.

1771
01:32:06,590 --> 01:32:07,820
And I mean it.

1772
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:10,860
But every time...

1773
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:14,289
Hyeon Ji showed that she had regrets,

1774
01:32:14,290 --> 01:32:15,929
I was confused and didn't know what to do.

1775
01:32:15,930 --> 01:32:18,200
"What's she doing? She has no reason to act like this."

1776
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:21,030
So it bothered me, and I was confused.

1777
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:25,969
But I want to get to know you more,

1778
01:32:25,970 --> 01:32:27,410
and I'm interested in you.

1779
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:46,390
"You'll go on a date with your ex tomorrow."

1780
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:50,960
Finally.

1781
01:32:52,670 --> 01:32:54,729
Oh, I got a text.

1782
01:32:54,730 --> 01:32:56,340
Yes. We're going on a date tomorrow.

1783
01:32:58,540 --> 01:33:02,040
I had a great time with my ex when we were dating.

1784
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:06,480
I want to remind her of the good memories we had on our past dates.

1785
01:33:08,450 --> 01:33:09,520
I knew it.

1786
01:33:13,350 --> 01:33:14,489
It felt strange.

1787
01:33:14,490 --> 01:33:17,020
I hadn't even seen her for years.

1788
01:33:17,490 --> 01:33:19,729
And we're going on a date alone...

1789
01:33:19,730 --> 01:33:20,790
after all these years.

1790
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:25,299
It'd be nice to have a good time on our date,

1791
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:27,269
but I was worried...

1792
01:33:27,270 --> 01:33:28,870
if that'd be possible.

1793
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:33,440
After that?

1794
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:35,539
- A date with an ex two.
- Right after that?

1795
01:33:35,540 --> 01:33:36,609
Even though I knew, I'm still getting the chills.

1796
01:33:36,610 --> 01:33:37,839
It must feel really strange...

1797
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:39,649
to go on a date.

1798
01:33:39,650 --> 01:33:41,249
- Right.
- It'd bring back the memories.

1799
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:43,279
- It'll be fatal.
- And...

1800
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:45,489
things look iffy between Baek Hyun and Yun Nyeong, no?

1801
01:33:45,490 --> 01:33:46,789
- Yes.
- After the truth or dare.

1802
01:33:46,790 --> 01:33:50,289
Yun Nyeong shared why she was upset for the first time.

1803
01:33:50,290 --> 01:33:51,759
- Right.
- The look.

1804
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:53,159
- That is...
- His subconsciousness.

1805
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:55,029
Yun Nyeong must've been very disappointed.

1806
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:56,559
Totally.

1807
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,469
Even now, Baek Hyun didn't go talk to her first.

1808
01:33:58,470 --> 01:33:59,769
- Yun Nyeong went to him first...
- Right.

1809
01:33:59,770 --> 01:34:00,899
To hear his excuses.

1810
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:02,139
- Right.
- Yes.

1811
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:03,539
We'll never know until the end.

1812
01:34:03,540 --> 01:34:05,609
I thought it was determined.

1813
01:34:05,610 --> 01:34:07,039
I know. Just a minute ago,

1814
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:08,639
- That's what I mean.
- I expected them to go out.

1815
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:10,809
- We expected them to go out.
- Things are getting complicated.

1816
01:34:10,810 --> 01:34:13,250
The date with an ex will be crucial.

1817
01:34:14,010 --> 01:34:15,049
Sit down.

1818
01:34:15,050 --> 01:34:17,180
(Yellow Room: Ji Hyeon and Hyeon Ji's room)

1819
01:34:17,650 --> 01:34:19,849
I said I wanted to talk to you...

1820
01:34:19,850 --> 01:34:22,989
because I asked you a question...

1821
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:24,560
to sway your heart even for a bit.

1822
01:34:24,660 --> 01:34:25,729
What question?

1823
01:34:25,730 --> 01:34:26,929
- What?
- What question?

1824
01:34:26,930 --> 01:34:29,030
If you had any change of heart.

1825
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:31,869
Anyway, when I asked that question,

1826
01:34:31,870 --> 01:34:34,069
you said there was none.

1827
01:34:34,070 --> 01:34:35,600
This is what I mean.

1828
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:38,469
To see you giving up on your pride...

1829
01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:39,739
to stop me...

1830
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:43,510
and talking about practical issues,

1831
01:34:43,610 --> 01:34:46,909
I'm not emotionally...

1832
01:34:46,910 --> 01:34:48,080
shaken or swayed.

1833
01:34:48,650 --> 01:34:51,020
When I think about it reasonably,

1834
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:56,660
to make a conclusion here,

1835
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:59,089
I wonder...

1836
01:34:59,090 --> 01:35:01,459
if it's a hasty decision.

1837
01:35:01,460 --> 01:35:02,629
After listening to you.

1838
01:35:02,630 --> 01:35:05,529
So in terms of my emotional change,

1839
01:35:05,530 --> 01:35:07,700
it's not like...

1840
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:10,369
my feelings for Yoo Sik...

1841
01:35:10,370 --> 01:35:11,399
suddenly grew or declined.

1842
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:13,540
That's why I said I had no emotional changes.

1843
01:35:14,370 --> 01:35:16,379
But when I think about it reasonably,

1844
01:35:16,380 --> 01:35:18,039
I can't deny that I'm not contemplating.

1845
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:21,449
That's why I said I still wasn't sure...

1846
01:35:21,450 --> 01:35:22,480
about the final decision.

1847
01:35:23,020 --> 01:35:25,079
But from my point of you,

1848
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:27,250
if the other person doesn't make you feel certain,

1849
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:29,719
I expected you...

1850
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:31,089
to be swayed.

1851
01:35:31,090 --> 01:35:32,559
You wanted to sway me.

1852
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:33,629
That makes sense.

1853
01:35:33,630 --> 01:35:37,200
So my final decision will be you.

1854
01:35:38,930 --> 01:35:41,029
And honestly,

1855
01:35:41,030 --> 01:35:43,639
even if you don't choose me,

1856
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:45,840
but choose someone else,

1857
01:35:46,770 --> 01:35:49,479
I'll assume...

1858
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:51,440
that my effort didn't work.

1859
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:55,279
You said you'd make a lot of effort,

1860
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:58,349
and I know that you are making a lot of effort...

1861
01:35:58,350 --> 01:35:59,350
Yes.

1862
01:36:02,460 --> 01:36:05,059
But we won't know until we go out.

1863
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:07,890
True. We won't know until we go out.

1864
01:36:08,660 --> 01:36:11,030
I have a fear of that.

1865
01:36:11,130 --> 01:36:12,829
But what can you do about it?

1866
01:36:12,830 --> 01:36:17,169
As you know, I'll have to make an effort...

1867
01:36:17,170 --> 01:36:18,939
to change.

1868
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:20,139
But it's not just me.

1869
01:36:20,140 --> 01:36:21,639
You need to change too.

1870
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:23,109
That's true. I thought...

1871
01:36:23,110 --> 01:36:26,609
you didn't consider me important.

1872
01:36:26,610 --> 01:36:29,420
So I thought you lost the spark.

1873
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:35,320
Now that you think I'm a stranger,

1874
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:38,829
and to see me with someone else,

1875
01:36:38,830 --> 01:36:42,159
you might have realized what I meant to you.

1876
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:44,300
But when I go out with you again,

1877
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:47,370
I'm afraid...

1878
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:50,269
you might treat me...

1879
01:36:50,270 --> 01:36:51,740
like you used to.

1880
01:36:54,070 --> 01:36:55,539
Are you afraid of the cycle?

1881
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:57,680
(Hyeon Ji is afraid that Seung Yong might change again.)

1882
01:36:58,410 --> 01:37:02,219
You were mean to me...

1883
01:37:02,220 --> 01:37:04,349
- and hurt my feelings.
- Sorry for hurting your feelings.

1884
01:37:04,350 --> 01:37:05,950
Because of that...

1885
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:11,320
You treated me...

1886
01:37:11,420 --> 01:37:12,860
like you were sick of me.

1887
01:37:14,530 --> 01:37:16,499
- Right.
- But I know...

1888
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:19,630
that you can't make an effort forever.

1889
01:37:20,070 --> 01:37:24,169
But I can never guess...

1890
01:37:24,170 --> 01:37:26,370
how much I'll expect from you.

1891
01:37:27,970 --> 01:37:30,310
Right. I need to make an effort too.

1892
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:32,079
We both need to make an effort.

1893
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:33,350
And the situation has changed.

1894
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:35,820
We know the essence of the issue.

1895
01:37:37,150 --> 01:37:38,750
That you want to be loved.

1896
01:37:40,050 --> 01:37:42,319
Yes. So what I'm saying is what took you so long to realize it.

1897
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:43,620
At least, I realized it even now.

1898
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:46,230
Wouldn't it be better to realize it and start over...

1899
01:37:46,430 --> 01:37:48,860
rather than not realizing it for the rest of my life?

1900
01:37:53,470 --> 01:37:54,530
Why are you sighing?

1901
01:37:55,270 --> 01:37:57,299
- Because I have a lot on my mind.
- What?

1902
01:37:57,300 --> 01:38:00,170
- Because I have a lot on my mind.
- Right.

1903
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:02,439
Hyeon Ji must be swayed.

1904
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:03,909
She wasn't thinking about it,

1905
01:38:03,910 --> 01:38:05,779
- but now, - She must be swayed.

1906
01:38:05,780 --> 01:38:06,879
- she's thinking about it?
- Right.

1907
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:08,149
He's so nice to her that she can't help...

1908
01:38:08,150 --> 01:38:09,179
- but feel swayed.
- That's how it goes?

1909
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:11,679
- Seung Yong is eloquent.
- Yes.

1910
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:12,789
- He's eloquent.
- Yes.

1911
01:38:12,790 --> 01:38:15,419
If he continues to make an effort,

1912
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:16,819
they might get back together.

1913
01:38:16,820 --> 01:38:18,689
If he keeps talking about the practical matters...

1914
01:38:18,690 --> 01:38:19,690
- Yes, keep going.
- "The practice matters."

1915
01:38:19,691 --> 01:38:22,099
But if Hyeon Ji never talks...

1916
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:25,699
about the marriage to Yoo Sik,

1917
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:28,630
I wonder if she might choose him...

1918
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:30,469
for the final decision.

1919
01:38:30,470 --> 01:38:32,639
Right. In the truth or dare,

1920
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:34,469
if Yoo Sik had talked...

1921
01:38:34,470 --> 01:38:36,979
as if he was certain about Hyeon Ji,

1922
01:38:36,980 --> 01:38:40,649
she might have thought...

1923
01:38:40,650 --> 01:38:42,149
about talking about it.

1924
01:38:42,150 --> 01:38:44,480
But she has no reason to do that anymore.

1925
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:47,190
Nothing is predictable.

1926
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:55,660
- Yes?
- Whose room is this?

1927
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:57,899
- It's my room.
- Whose room?

1928
01:38:57,900 --> 01:38:59,169
- Jae Hyeong.
- Jae Hyeong?

1929
01:38:59,170 --> 01:39:00,599
- Can I come in?
- What? Yes.

1930
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:02,839
- Do you want me to leave you alone?
- What? No. You don't have to.

1931
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:04,869
- What's going on?
- I wanted to...

1932
01:39:04,870 --> 01:39:06,240
wear matching clothes.

1933
01:39:07,970 --> 01:39:09,609
What are you going to wear?

1934
01:39:09,610 --> 01:39:11,140
I brought a few candidates.

1935
01:39:12,750 --> 01:39:15,680
Here. This with the skirt.

1936
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:20,189
Or... Actually, I want to wear all white.

1937
01:39:20,190 --> 01:39:21,720
How about these two?

1938
01:39:22,690 --> 01:39:24,360
But all white...

1939
01:39:24,460 --> 01:39:25,630
No white clothes?

1940
01:39:26,290 --> 01:39:29,099
- I wore everything except jeans.
- Is this yours?

1941
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:30,360
- Except jeans?
- Yes.

1942
01:39:30,460 --> 01:39:32,130
I already wore my jeans.

1943
01:39:34,670 --> 01:39:36,070
Why did you, you fool?

1944
01:39:36,170 --> 01:39:38,400
I wore them when I wasn't on a date.

1945
01:39:38,470 --> 01:39:40,210
- When was that?
- You should've saved it for a date.

1946
01:39:40,910 --> 01:39:42,809
I never thought I'd get to wear them.

1947
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:44,540
Let me see them. Show me.

1948
01:39:46,450 --> 01:39:47,450
Gosh, my back.

1949
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:50,280
This and this.

1950
01:39:51,620 --> 01:39:52,719
- Really?
- Yes.

1951
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:54,990
Should I match it with white?

1952
01:39:55,050 --> 01:39:56,559
And wear white inside?

1953
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:58,989
You can do that. I'll wear this...

1954
01:39:58,990 --> 01:40:00,359
and wear a denim bag.

1955
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:01,629
Sure. Okay.

1956
01:40:01,630 --> 01:40:03,229
Then I'll wear this,

1957
01:40:03,230 --> 01:40:05,729
and you can wear jeans.

1958
01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:06,929
Do I wear white inside?

1959
01:40:06,930 --> 01:40:08,839
Okay. Wear white inside. Okay.

1960
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:09,870
Okay.

1961
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:12,840
I'll wear white, and you wear jeans.

1962
01:40:12,910 --> 01:40:14,010
Okay.

1963
01:40:14,510 --> 01:40:16,180
- Bye.
- Goodnight.

1964
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:22,319
I saved Yun Nyeong's favorite denim jacket...

1965
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:23,550
for tomorrow.

1966
01:40:24,220 --> 01:40:26,590
You're so sweet.

1967
01:40:27,390 --> 01:40:28,890
I actually like it this way.

1968
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:31,060
- What?
- That she can come see me...

1969
01:40:31,690 --> 01:40:33,230
with a smile.

1970
01:40:33,990 --> 01:40:36,130
That means she doesn't mind me.

1971
01:40:37,260 --> 01:40:39,130
- I'm happy with it.
- Really?

1972
01:40:40,130 --> 01:40:41,200
I should be.

1973
01:40:49,340 --> 01:40:50,910
What's Won Kyu doing on the terrace?

1974
01:40:52,450 --> 01:40:55,479
What? Is he on the terrace alone?

1975
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:56,680
Kyu? Yes, by himself.

1976
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:00,720
Maybe he's thinking.

1977
01:41:01,690 --> 01:41:03,960
On the terrace? Then we have to save him.

1978
01:41:05,060 --> 01:41:07,260
Go see Won Kyu if you want.

1979
01:41:08,030 --> 01:41:10,060
You like Won Kyu so much.

1980
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:21,070
You should go to bed early tonight.

1981
01:41:22,410 --> 01:41:24,080
- So I can get up early tomorrow?
- Yes.

1982
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:29,049
- My goodness.
- What?

1983
01:41:29,050 --> 01:41:30,179
It's Won Kyu.

1984
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:31,650
- Kyu.
- What?

1985
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:33,889
Kyu, when did you get back?

1986
01:41:33,890 --> 01:41:35,490
I'm going to bed now.

1987
01:41:36,460 --> 01:41:37,990
- Wait for me. Let's go in together.
- Okay.

1988
01:41:39,290 --> 01:41:40,690
"Let's go in together?"

1989
01:41:40,890 --> 01:41:42,030
- Kyu?
- With Kyu?

1990
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:44,559
Where? Get in.

1991
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:45,670
Ji Yeon is sleeping.

1992
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:48,940
- She's sleeping.
- She said she was sleeping.

1993
01:41:49,870 --> 01:41:50,970
Do you want to come to my room?

1994
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:53,640
Never mind. Go to bed.

1995
01:41:54,470 --> 01:41:56,139
- It's 3 o'clock.
- Are you worried about me?

1996
01:41:56,140 --> 01:41:57,680
- What?
- Are you worried about me?

1997
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:59,180
What?

1998
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:01,550
Let me walk you.

1999
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:08,150
Don't open your eyes like that. You're scaring me.

2000
01:42:12,330 --> 01:42:14,390
- Are you tired?
- Yes.

2001
01:42:16,430 --> 01:42:18,130
Get inside and think carefully.

2002
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,030
Go to bed.

2003
01:42:28,510 --> 01:42:29,740
Why is there only one?

2004
01:42:31,010 --> 01:42:32,679
It was all in one.

2005
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:33,980
Really?

2006
01:42:36,280 --> 01:42:37,350
Get inside.

2007
01:42:37,580 --> 01:42:39,250
Why do you keep telling me to go?

2008
01:42:41,090 --> 01:42:42,590
I'm not.

2009
01:42:43,260 --> 01:42:45,490
You should go to bed, so we can talk again tomorrow.

2010
01:42:46,690 --> 01:42:48,130
You drank a lot.

2011
01:42:48,830 --> 01:42:50,529
You drank a lot too.

2012
01:42:50,530 --> 01:42:52,230
But I'm fine.

2013
01:42:54,970 --> 01:42:57,270
(Go to bed.)

2014
01:43:03,610 --> 01:43:05,410
- What?
- What?

2015
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:07,510
What?

2016
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:12,320
What?

2017
01:43:20,630 --> 01:43:22,760
You're busier than I am tomorrow.

2018
01:43:23,700 --> 01:43:25,970
I know that.

2019
01:43:27,370 --> 01:43:30,670
So choose what to wear.

2020
01:43:32,300 --> 01:43:33,310
Okay?

2021
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:39,780
You're pouting.

2022
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:45,250
Have a good time tomorrow.

2023
01:43:52,830 --> 01:43:56,930
(Then they hear footsteps approaching.)

2024
01:44:03,070 --> 01:44:05,070
- Where are you going?
- What?

2025
01:44:05,340 --> 01:44:06,810
What are you doing over there?

2026
01:44:07,110 --> 01:44:08,570
We just got up.

2027
01:44:09,310 --> 01:44:10,740
Who's inside?

2028
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:11,840
Ji Yeon.

2029
01:44:11,980 --> 01:44:13,979
I have a question for Ji Yeon.

2030
01:44:13,980 --> 01:44:14,980
She's sleeping.

2031
01:44:16,380 --> 01:44:18,379
Do I look too wide?

2032
01:44:18,380 --> 01:44:20,349
No, I'll wear something wider.

2033
01:44:20,350 --> 01:44:21,389
- Promise?
- Yes.

2034
01:44:21,390 --> 01:44:23,859
Okay. Bye.

2035
01:44:23,860 --> 01:44:24,860
Bye.

2036
01:44:28,460 --> 01:44:29,760
What should I wear tomorrow?

2037
01:44:31,230 --> 01:44:33,900
That's up to you. I'm going in.

2038
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:37,270
Gosh.

2039
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,910
We're not going to wear matching clothes.

2040
01:44:44,340 --> 01:44:45,879
- See you tomorrow.
- What?

2041
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:46,950
See you tomorrow.

2042
01:44:47,450 --> 01:44:49,250
Stop frowning, will you?

2043
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:52,920
Good night.

2044
01:45:01,230 --> 01:45:02,430
What about other people?

2045
01:45:02,860 --> 01:45:04,859
They all scattered.

2046
01:45:04,860 --> 01:45:07,730
They all went to talk to their exes.

2047
01:45:08,830 --> 01:45:10,240
What did Yoo Sik do?

2048
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:13,969
I just went to talk to Jae Hyeong.

2049
01:45:13,970 --> 01:45:15,010
Okay.

2050
01:45:15,140 --> 01:45:17,210
And I saw him with Hyeon Ji.

2051
01:45:19,310 --> 01:45:20,310
Where?

2052
01:45:20,710 --> 01:45:22,050
In front of Hyeon Ji's room.

2053
01:45:22,650 --> 01:45:24,179
Because Ji Yeon was sleeping,

2054
01:45:24,180 --> 01:45:25,720
they were talking outside.

2055
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:28,020
They talked in front of the room?

2056
01:45:28,620 --> 01:45:30,090
Yes, in front of Hyeon Ji's room.

2057
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:32,959
Actually, I was planning to...

2058
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:34,629
to show Jae Hyeong my clothes.

2059
01:45:34,630 --> 01:45:36,329
- But Jae Hyeong was sleeping.
- Okay.

2060
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:39,059
So I decided to ask Ji Yeon,

2061
01:45:39,060 --> 01:45:40,999
and I was going to her room.

2062
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,869
And the moment I turned around the corner,

2063
01:45:43,870 --> 01:45:46,069
I saw Hyeon Ji and Yoo Sik.

2064
01:45:46,070 --> 01:45:49,309
I was like, "What? You were still up?"

2065
01:45:49,310 --> 01:45:53,010
(EXchange 4)

2066
01:45:53,580 --> 01:45:55,149
Isn't it nice here?

2067
01:45:55,150 --> 01:45:57,580
Yes, it's nice. There is nobody.

2068
01:45:58,150 --> 01:46:00,220
(I'm finally on a date with my ex.)

2069
01:46:00,950 --> 01:46:03,059
(Why didn't I come here...)

2070
01:46:03,060 --> 01:46:04,890
(with her before?)

2071
01:46:05,220 --> 01:46:07,330
I regret it.

2072
01:46:07,730 --> 01:46:10,530
- How's my outfit?
- Good. It's nice.

2073
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:13,599
- He treated me...
- What is this?

2074
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:16,000
- like the time we were dating.
- What? I don't know.

2075
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:19,540
It was such a familiar sight.

2076
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:21,910
That was my favorite part.

2077
01:46:23,740 --> 01:46:25,410
It feels strange to hold your hand again after a while.

2078
01:46:26,010 --> 01:46:28,950
If I said I had feelings for you,

2079
01:46:29,620 --> 01:46:32,050
would you have expressed yourself too?

2080
01:46:34,890 --> 01:46:38,060
(I wish we had more time.)

2081
01:46:38,490 --> 01:46:39,860
Turn your wheels to me.

2082
01:46:42,260 --> 01:46:43,959
- Turn your wheels.
- You want me to?

2083
01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:45,660
Yes, turn your wheels.

2084
01:46:46,370 --> 01:46:49,999
Have you made up your mind? It's tomorrow.

2085
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:53,010
My mind? I had all kinds of thoughts.

2086
01:46:53,570 --> 01:46:55,570
Seriously.
