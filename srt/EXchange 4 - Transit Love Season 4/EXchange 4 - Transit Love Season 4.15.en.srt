(EXchange 4)

13
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,920
(Episode 15: Time I Thought I Had Forgotten)

14
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,549
Let me introduce the guest who is with us today.

15
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,849
It's actor Noh Sang Hyun.

16
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:56,990
Hello.

17
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,019
Nice to meet you.

18
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,429
I heard you really like "EXchange."

19
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,390
Yes. I liked the previous episodes...

20
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,429
- and this season as well.
- You're a successful fan.

21
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,499
That's right.

22
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,899
Was there someone whom you really invested in?

23
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,430
Seung Yong. From today on,

24
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,770
- I'll cheer for him.
- Right.

25
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,240
I was so shocked after watching the last episode.

26
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,209
Last week, all the exes that people only assumed...

27
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,149
were revealed.

28
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,209
- It's the beginning now.
- Yes.

29
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,649
I'm curious to know...

30
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,089
if things will go as they want.

31
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,090
I don't think they will.

32
00:01:28,091 --> 00:01:29,689
I want things to turn into a complete mess.

33
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,589
After such a big event,

34
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,489
people always talk to their exes.

35
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,060
- That's right.
- Yes. It can't be helped.

36
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,930
(The first night when everyone's exes were fully revealed)

37
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,739
(Through the unsettled hearts, )

38
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,510
(the night keeps flowing.)

39
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,549
(Yun Nyeong and Jae Hyeong look for a place to talk.)

40
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,320
- Are these the rooms?
- I guess so.

41
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,300
Excuse me.

42
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,170
Anyway,

43
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,669
my real goal here...

44
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,910
Your goal.

45
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,850
Is to cheer for you. Seriously.

46
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,479
I think you'd feel the same way.

47
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,479
I don't think you want to stop me.

48
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,820
- I think you'd really cheer for me.
- I really cheer for you.

49
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,489
If something bothers me,

50
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,360
I can't move on to the next step.

51
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,659
That's why I wanted to do things after talking.

52
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,830
I see.

53
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,100
When I met you here,

54
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,100
there were just three emotions...

55
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,940
I wanted us to work on.

56
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,709
My feelings of regret, gratitude, and resentment.

57
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,710
Yes.

58
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,250
I tried my best...

59
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,349
to cheer for you by leaving out the resentment...

60
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,750
and just delivering the regret and gratitude.

61
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,520
But I couldn't cheer for you as much as I thought.

62
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,690
What do you think I resent?

63
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,430
Tell me.

64
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,360
When you made that choice,

65
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,269
did I not matter to you at all?

66
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,840
Which choice?

67
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,340
Which choice?

68
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,990
When you met my friend.

69
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,600
After breaking up with me,

70
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,570
she dated my friend when I was at the military training camp.

71
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,240
He was almost like my best friend.

72
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,470
She dated him.

73
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,910
Before going to the military, I used to go to the internet cafe a lot.

74
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,810
My friends told me,

75
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,719
"Yun Nyeong is going to meet him."

76
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,050
Even until then,

77
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,450
I thought it was because of our breakup.

78
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,750
They were close as well,

79
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,260
so I thought he was giving her some advice.

80
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,560
But I was told that Yun Nyeong was wearing a skirt.

81
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,830
I thought that was serious.

82
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,799
I tried to push that thought aside,

83
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,300
but I got to know about it at the military training camp.

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,270
We broke up three months before I joined the military.

85
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,340
So she met him after three months.

86
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,709
I was told that he was very angry.

87
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,910
I'm not sure if it's true.

88
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,550
But I thought,

89
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,590
it wasn't like I met someone...

90
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,519
while dating him.

91
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,289
I ended things with him...

92
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,590
and dated someone else after a few months.

93
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,430
That was very painful to me.

94
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,330
I couldn't heal myself in the training camp.

95
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,669
So I wrote a journal.

96
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:06,340
I wrote it as I was sorting out my feelings for my ex.

97
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,850
(He saw the diary from back then in the Ex Room.)

98
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,679
(I think something good happened to Yun Nyeong.)

99
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,849
(Would it be good for me too? I don't think so.)

100
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,149
(I just feel frustrated. I want to check the news...)

101
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,590
(on my phone, but perhaps it's better...)

102
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:28,260
(Am I being selfish for feeling disappointed in her?)

103
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,899
(Would my friend be a clear sky for you?)

104
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,869
(Why couldn't I do that?)

105
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:41,810
(I'm really sorry I couldn't protect you.)

106
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,479
(I want Yun Nyeong to be happy, )

107
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,009
(but I also feel miserable. I guess I'm very selfish.)

108
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,910
We broke up because I wasn't nice to her.

109
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,780
So I thought I was getting punished.

110
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,050
(Inversely proportional)

111
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,920
I mostly wrote words wishing for her happiness.

112
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,459
I wrote in my diary with the thought that the harder things were for me,

113
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,059
the happier she would be.

114
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,800
(Since our happiness would be inversely proportional.)

115
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,200
In some ways, I understand her now.

116
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,069
How can you stop the forming of feelings?

117
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,900
It's not something you can control.

118
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,769
I was young at the time,

119
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,680
so I couldn't accept it.

120
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:24,180
(He hesitantly brought up the story he had buried.)

121
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,250
After I broke up with you,

122
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,560
I had no feelings about you.

123
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,230
So,

124
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,859
I wondered if I really needed to be...

125
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,900
thoughtful toward you.

126
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,639
If it was about being thoughtful...

127
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,140
There was someone who liked me...

128
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:55,010
and who could support me where I was having a hard time.

129
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,780
But just because he was in your social circle...

130
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,290
- I...
- He wasn't just an acquaintance.

131
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,390
He said it was okay,

132
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,830
and it had been more than three months since we broke up.

133
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,199
But you would've developed feelings for each other before that.

134
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,760
That wasn't the case.

135
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,499
- Before I joined the military, - Yes. A few weeks before that.

136
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,470
I knew you were dating.

137
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,539
- It wasn't like I talked to him...
- Actually...

138
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,939
- while dating you.
- I know you didn't do that.

139
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,680
It's not the period that matters.

140
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,480
You're already someone whom I grew distant from.

141
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,720
I'm not blaming you.

142
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,290
I blamed him more, actually.

143
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,790
Honestly,

144
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,660
the feeling I had then...

145
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,930
I heard that you were angry.

146
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,459
This is what I thought then.

147
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,669
I was angry?

148
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,829
- I heard you were angry.
- At him?

149
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,400
No. You were angry at the military training camp.

150
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,900
You were frustrated.

151
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,040
I honestly couldn't understand that.

152
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,039
I couldn't get why you did that. You should have just...

153
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,580
treated me well when I was with you.

154
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,049
- When I had a hard time...
- What does my frustration...

155
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,779
have to do with that?

156
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,290
I thought you were mad at the fact that I was dating someone,

157
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,089
not because I was dating your friend.

158
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,790
That's not it. I didn't know that at first.

159
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,460
At first, people told me...

160
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,859
there was bad news for me...

161
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,560
through the internet.

162
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,869
I realized it then.

163
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,740
"Yun Nyeong is dating someone new."

164
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,710
That part is also in the journal.

165
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,170
"I hope it works out well."

166
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,879
"I cheer for her."

167
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,710
You were someone I let go of,

168
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,350
and I wrote that I wanted things to go well with you.

169
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,749
I got to know the next day or the day after...

170
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,080
that you were dating my friend.

171
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,720
That's when I got mad.

172
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,919
I wasn't mad...

173
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,420
just because you found someone new.

174
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,289
Of course, I may have had a hard time...

175
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,130
because I was in regret at the time.

176
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,130
It wasn't something to be mad about. It gave me a hard time.

177
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,930
I was mad...

178
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,300
because of that.

179
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,400
I think you mistook that.

180
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,169
I thought you were mad...

181
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,910
because I was seeing someone else.

182
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,740
That's not true.

183
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,079
Stop it.

184
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,089
(The doorbell rang again before the confusion died down.)

185
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,350
Seriously.

186
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,719
Seriously. I can't do this.

187
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,790
Help us. It's so...

188
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,960
(Seung Yong works at a dermatology clinic.)

189
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,080
(The first day in Kamakura, a letter arrived.)

190
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,690
Our handsome brother.

191
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,819
Can I read it?

192
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,530
- Yes.
- Read it.

193
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,530
- Can I sit here?
- We need everyone here.

194
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,330
I want to read it quickly.

195
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,429
Only Jae Hyeong...

196
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,500
- Yun Nyeong.
- and Yun Nyeong have to come.

197
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,300
(Yun Nyeong and Jae Hyeong return without ending their talk.)

198
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,280
I'll read the card.

199
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,580
- Yes.
- A card came.

200
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:25,520
There's something I want to say before reading the card.

201
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,289
Baek Hyun and I both knew.

202
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,760
We knew.

203
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,899
There were some misunderstandings...

204
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,730
in the communication.

205
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:38,269
We kept it a secret because we thought we should.

206
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,369
But Baek Hyun...

207
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,939
- I knew.
- I also knew.

208
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,870
- We knew.
- They didn't know who, though.

209
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,880
But we three already knew.

210
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,179
We didn't know what we should keep a secret.

211
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,850
When Jae Hyeong asked me, "Did you know?"

212
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,320
I said, "I didn't know," but then...

213
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,560
That obviously sounds like a lie.

214
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,960
I know him, and I've never heard him talk like that.

215
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:04,230
- I knew.
- I was so flustered.

216
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,500
- Hyeon Ji...
- "He didn't know?"

217
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,900
I knew.

218
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,670
- I'll read it now.
- Okay.

219
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,340
What would it be?

220
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,879
"Male residents,"

221
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,220
"please recommend a date for your exes."

222
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,479
"You can't recommend yourself."

223
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,489
The two of us...

224
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,919
"To make decisions without regret,"

225
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,989
"each ex-couple will split up for a 30-minute meeting..."

226
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,560
"and then come back together."

227
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,499
(Male residents, please recommend a date for your exes.)

228
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,129
(To make decisions without regret, )

229
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,499
(each ex-couple will split up for a 30-minute meeting...)

230
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,830
(and then come back together.)

231
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,339
What does that mean? I don't understand.

232
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,470
Are we supposed to talk it out?

233
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,309
It's going to be the three of us.

234
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,979
Seriously.

235
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,440
We should have cheered earlier.

236
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,850
It's about 11:45pm now.

237
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,380
Let's come back here at 12:15am...

238
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,790
- Shall we?
- and talk.

239
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,890
- Shall we?
- I'm so confused.

240
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,760
Let's go.

241
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,960
Jae Hyeong?

242
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,630
Let's go.

243
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,860
It's the three of us.

244
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,130
- Really?
- Let's go.

245
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,040
Have a seat.

246
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,940
This is crazy.

247
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,080
Hyeon Ji, you should sit in the middle.

248
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,850
Seriously.

249
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,080
Seriously.

250
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,120
This is a mess.

251
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,860
Anyway.

252
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,030
Anyway, I'm sorry for not considering you.

253
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,040
I don't know.

254
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,440
Let's decide this.

255
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,210
Can we talk among ourselves for just ten minutes?

256
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,479
We'll decide together...

257
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,180
- Yes.
- and choose your date.

258
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,649
You two will decide...

259
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,849
- Yes.
- without including me?

260
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,290
- We'll decide.
- We'll discuss...

261
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,690
and then discuss with you.

262
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,490
Who do you want to date? Tell us that.

263
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,659
We can discuss that...

264
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,930
and see if it's the same person.

265
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,060
You want to discuss that?

266
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,329
- What?
- If it's that person,

267
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,629
are you going to pick that person?

268
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,270
- Then why did the couples go?
- Then...

269
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,669
To ask, "Who do you want to date?"

270
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,939
You can just ask me as well. Why aren't you asking me?

271
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,409
- We...
- We can guess the person first...

272
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,579
- and tell you.
- You'll talk first?

273
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,209
Then we'll ask you, "Who do you want to date?"

274
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,380
All right.

275
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,580
Let's go somewhere else.

276
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,790
She shouldn't hear us.

277
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,819
Where are you going?

278
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,189
- Over there.
- Talk here.

279
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,030
No. I have a loud voice. You'll hear me.

280
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,770
This place is nice.

281
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,939
It's really nice.

282
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,540
(They're in front of the room where Yun Nyeong and Jae Hyeong are.)

283
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,879
- How is it?
- What?

284
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,709
Who I want Hyeon Ji to date?

285
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,580
- No, I meant how you feel now.
- How I'm feeling?

286
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,319
I knew it,

287
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,820
so I had been mentally prepared.

288
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,890
But I kind of expected it.

289
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,490
I already knew you from the start.

290
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,030
- Really? Me?
- Yes.

291
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,570
- My existence?
- Yes.

292
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,640
You might feel bad about this.

293
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:36,069
I coincidentally found a letter,

294
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,680
and it was written by you.

295
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,410
I shouldn't have read that,

296
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,009
but I had to.

297
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,849
- I found a letter, - Of course.

298
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,089
So I read it, and it was yours.

299
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,620
I read it, and you wrote really well too.

300
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,789
I could also feel your feelings.

301
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,289
I thought you were a cool person,

302
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,959
so I remembered you.

303
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,960
You were very mature.

304
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,000
I was just scolded by Hyeon Ji...

305
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,769
about not considering her.

306
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,470
She does push people a bit too hard.

307
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,970
It's been a while since I got scolded. I'm still shaken.

308
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,009
So who do you want her to date?

309
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,050
Hyeon Ji? Are we...

310
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:20,349
going to let her date the person she wants to date? Or...

311
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,350
- Me?
- Yes.

312
00:15:21,351 --> 00:15:23,720
I think it's something we should decide.

313
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,319
Should we make her date someone random?

314
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,360
Someone random?

315
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,129
But Baek Hyun...

316
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,830
- Can I talk comfortably?
- Yes.

317
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,730
- Shall we both talk comfortably?
- Okay.

318
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,029
In your opinion, who do you think...

319
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:39,070
is Hyeon Ji's ideal type?

320
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,309
I kept saying this.

321
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,840
- Yoo Sik?
- Me too.

322
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:45,840
Why did you think so?

323
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,249
She just likes funny people,

324
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,980
and Yoo Sik is also thoughtful.

325
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,180
In that aspect.

326
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,490
I think he'd understand her well.

327
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,990
I haven't been able to get close to Yoo Sik so much,

328
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,399
but he's clearly very handsome.

329
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,600
He's outstanding in appearance and...

330
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
He's a handsome guy.

331
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,570
He's tall as well.

332
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,969
So I was...

333
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,070
going to say Yoo Sik.

334
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,679
Hyeon Ji probably wants Yoo Sik as well.

335
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,980
Really?

336
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,350
I see.

337
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,150
If we want her to date someone she wants...

338
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,219
and someone nice,

339
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,420
it's Yoo Sik.

340
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,860
We're thinking about this together.

341
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,670
I know, right?

342
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,799
We talked about this together...

343
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,970
with Jae Hyeong.

344
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,670
You said you supported her.

345
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,480
I don't think I'll be able to even support her.

346
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,039
I don't think I'll be able to cheer for her,

347
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,779
but objectively,

348
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,610
- Yes. This excludes the exes.
- Yoo Sik is the best.

349
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,950
That's what I think.

350
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,920
Honestly,

351
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,320
I don't think I'll support her with applause.

352
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,059
- There are two exes.
- The exes...

353
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,159
- So and so is her ideal type.
- Right.

354
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,929
I think you'll be able to do that...

355
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,659
if you're in that situation.

356
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,259
I think I'll be able to talk like that...

357
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,829
- if I'm in that situation.
- I'll be able to do it.

358
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:15,870
- Just like that?
- Yes.

359
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,670
- Min Kyung.
- Yes?

360
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,840
Where shall we talk?

361
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,770
- Shall we talk here?
- Let's do it here.

362
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,010
Who?

363
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,539
- Why?
- Who?

364
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,540
Why are you talking like that?

365
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,880
Woo Jin?

366
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,150
Come on, seriously.

367
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,650
Who do you want to date the most?

368
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,120
Isn't it Woo Jin?

369
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,460
Is it Woo Jin?

370
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,160
I got it.

371
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,130
Even couples who've dated...

372
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:50,769
for a shorter time than us still have so much to talk about.

373
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,469
- That doesn't matter.
- We have so much to talk about.

374
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,040
We have a lot to talk about. Why aren't we talking about it?

375
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,610
All right. Let's settle this issue first, and then talk.

376
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,549
Can I go to the ladies' room?

377
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,780
Sure, you can.

378
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,920
Don't do that.

379
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,330
What?

380
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,670
Who are you going to date, then?

381
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,140
I don't know.

382
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,370
The exes of female residents will choose the dates for the girls.

383
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:30,580
If you date Hyeon Ji again,

384
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,350
you'll be the only person she's ever dated.

385
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,210
We talked about it earlier.

386
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,250
You talked with Hyeon Ji?

387
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,320
- I told her I was sorry.
- You told her you were sorry?

388
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,989
- Why do you have to be sorry?
- She'll have only dated me.

389
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,190
She knows that you're a nice person.

390
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,260
Hyeon Ji is a nice person, too.

391
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:51,360
But she's dated just me so far, so...

392
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,860
By the way, why is your skin looking so good?

393
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,100
My skin is just...

394
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,199
You haven't had a difficult time. That's why.

395
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,800
Now I have problems with my eyes...

396
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,310
and skin condition.

397
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,939
It's a mess.

398
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,739
I'm going through these situations for the first time in my life.

399
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,139
- Let's get inside.
- Come on.

400
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,849
Why are you doing this?

401
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:09,850
Come on, Yoo Sik.

402
00:19:09,851 --> 00:19:11,650
- Our conversation...
- If you, Yoo Sik...

403
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,980
If you want...

404
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,719
to finish our conversation,

405
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,949
make it clear like this. "Okay. I got it."

406
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,990
"Then we can talk about it again later."

407
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,790
Later.

408
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,959
"Later."

409
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,159
Don't say it that way, Yoo Sik.

410
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,429
I mean, we'll definitely have...

411
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,399
time to talk again later.

412
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,600
I'm not going to work while I'm here,

413
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,440
so we can talk then.

414
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,069
Now we have nothing more to talk about.

415
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,480
Why do you keep doing that?

416
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,910
(Two of them still have trouble communicating.)

417
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,150
(Yun Nyeong and Jae Hyeong began a conversation again.)

418
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,620
How old was I back then? 20 years old?

419
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,460
Back then,

420
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,999
to be honest, I didn't care about anything.

421
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,100
In the first place, I...

422
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,869
didn't even know that you were supporting me.

423
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,800
I only thought you still had lingering feelings for me...

424
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,869
and you had regrets...

425
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,240
that you were trying to keep me.

426
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,980
Of course, I had lingering feelings and I had regrets.

427
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,279
But I thought that was separate...

428
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,950
from supporting you through your choice.

429
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:17,180
I didn't think that was separate.

430
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,920
While I was...

431
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,120
in a relationship with him,

432
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:26,060
honestly, I didn't consider your feelings.

433
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,890
I just focused on my emotions and the fact that I struggled.

434
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,900
I just focused on my happiness.

435
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,739
I'm not blaming you, Yun Nyeong.

436
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,010
I know. Now I'm...

437
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,410
just talking about what happened.

438
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,850
I really had no idea, Jae Hyeong.

439
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,420
Back then, I just thought...

440
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,760
that you were immature.

441
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,290
I just thought,

442
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:06,030
"Why can't he wish me happiness?"

443
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,270
That was what I thought.

444
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,000
I was immature.

445
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:13,400
I was immature, but I wished you happiness.

446
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,510
But I just...

447
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,480
I was also very young at that time, so...

448
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,420
I just focused on my feelings...

449
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,820
I understand, Yun Nyeong.

450
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,560
Yun Nyeong, I understand.

451
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,990
That can happen.

452
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,060
"I'm sorry, and I feel thankful."

453
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,560
"I had a hard time, too."

454
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:43,000
"Honestly, I resented you sometimes." When I said these,

455
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,640
it must have been hard for you.

456
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,640
"Yes, you must have been through a lot. It must have been hard."

457
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,410
If only I had heard that from you,

458
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,980
it would have been enough for me.

459
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,720
Then I would have cheered for you, no matter who you dated.

460
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,159
Even now, I wish you to be with someone good.

461
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,460
I just thought...

462
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,930
that you didn't wish me happiness.

463
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,370
I only thought that you were too selfish all along.

464
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,700
I thought so for six years.

465
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:24,840
However...

466
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,850
I'm sorry that I misunderstood you.

467
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,310
That's okay.

468
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,780
I truly...

469
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,720
supported you for six years.

470
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,490
I supported you with all my heart.

471
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:49,369
I felt I was struggling...

472
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,400
as much as you were happy back then.

473
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,339
When I read the diary in the Ex Room,

474
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,770
I realized again how I was back then.

475
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,540
I realized that I wished you happiness as much as I struggled.

476
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,680
I thought you were happy when I had a hard time.

477
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,580
That's how I consoled myself.

478
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,560
So, being selfish...

479
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,790
That's selfish, too.

480
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,960
I pitied myself back then.

481
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,500
So I thought...

482
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,370
it would be nice if you'd realize that I was struggling at least once.

483
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,940
If I hadn't told you that,

484
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,970
and had only conveyed my apologies and thanks,

485
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,440
and had sent you off while you were happy,

486
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,050
no one would know what I was feeling at that time.

487
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,250
Honestly,

488
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:46,890
we can't see each other again after we leave here.

489
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,400
So, I just...

490
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,570
wanted to talk to you face-to-face just once.

491
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,940
I'm going to let go...

492
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,640
of you and my friend from that time,

493
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,150
so I hope you won't hate me...

494
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,380
from the past too much either.

495
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,730
I wish you the best in finding someone wonderful.

496
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,739
Honestly, even though I said...

497
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,570
I was rooting and clapping for you,

498
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,350
I can't do that.

499
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:43,980
Still,

500
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,890
although I may not be able to pave the way for you,

501
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,960
I won't stand in your way.

502
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,930
I'm really happy that you were my first love.

503
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,430
It was me who made our first love fail.

504
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,900
Thank you for the time we shared.

505
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,669
I'm so sorry that I misunderstood you.

506
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:09,370
I've been carrying a huge misunderstanding until now.

507
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,320
Stop crying.

508
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,520
Yun Nyeong.

509
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,390
If you cry, I can't hold up.

510
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,360
Seriously...

511
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,800
Anyway, I know who you're going to date.

512
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,140
Even if you want to date me, hold back. They say exes aren't allowed.

513
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,010
- You're annoying me.
- Why are you annoyed?

514
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,580
You're annoying me.

515
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:55,420
It's been such a long time since I touched your hair.

516
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,190
I can't touch it anymore after this.

517
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,560
Because of you...

518
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:10,200
I thought I'd be the only person you ever dated.

519
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:13,369
You're seriously annoying me.

520
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,569
That's why it felt so awkward hearing you...

521
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:16,670
call someone else affectionately here.

522
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,440
Had we met now,

523
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:22,380
things would have been different, right?

524
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,419
- It would have been different.
- Are you sure about that?

525
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,479
I'm sure.

526
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,650
- I haven't seen you dating anyone.
- I can bet everything.

527
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,989
- I'd have done better.
- Let me ask you just one thing.

528
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,060
Why did you do that back then?

529
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,230
- I was too young and immature.
- You were too young?

530
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:38,630
I didn't know anything about relationships.

531
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,570
You wrote that I showed you what a relationship is in my introduction.

532
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,870
- That was true.
- I've thought so all the time.

533
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,070
You have never been out of my mind.

534
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,380
Stop crying.

535
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,650
You don't look good when you cry.

536
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,950
I don't want to cry either.

537
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,960
This is insane.

538
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:15,900
Jae Hyeong.

539
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,310
How about a hug, just to say thanks?

540
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,550
Really...

541
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,950
- Thank you.
- This is enough.

542
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,420
- Is it enough?
- It's enough.

543
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,390
It's good.

544
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,600
It's Baek Hyun. Have you decided?

545
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,430
Do as you want.

546
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,200
Come on. It's Baek Hyun.

547
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,470
Jae Hyeong, seriously...

548
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,069
What if...

549
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:57,040
I might choose Seung Yong, all of a sudden.

550
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,640
You can go for a yacht ride again.

551
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,050
(After talking to Yun Nyeong, Jae Hyeong goes out alone.)

552
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,550
(Sighing)

553
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,330
- Why am I tearing up?
- Why?

554
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,099
I guess it was really intense for Jae Hyeong.

555
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,229
It really was his first love.

556
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,170
- It lasts long.
- Why do I feel so sad?

557
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,639
- Why?
- I somehow can feel...

558
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,609
Jae Hyeong's heart aching.

559
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:06,180
I can sense that he's been carrying those feelings for a while.

560
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,849
- It must have been hard.
- I guess so.

561
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:12,250
He talked through the feelings he had kept bottled up...

562
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,220
for a long time, and he came out...

563
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:19,119
and bowed his head. When I saw that,

564
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,520
I suddenly welled up.

565
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:24,159
It was great that they resolved their feelings in this show.

566
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,559
If they hadn't come on this show,

567
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,760
it would have been a lifelong misunderstanding.

568
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,629
The hurtful memories from when they were young would have remained.

569
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:30,829
- I know.
- Exactly.

570
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,169
First of all, the way Jae Hyeong spoke was so thoughtful...

571
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,239
- and kind.
- I know.

572
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,269
He went through that situation when he was so young,

573
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,239
and he still wrote that he rooted for Yun Nyeong...

574
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,339
in a diary that no one else could see.

575
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,149
That was truly his honest and innermost feeling.

576
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,649
- Right.
- Writing that...

577
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:46,619
- shows what kind of person he is.
- Yes.

578
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,989
I think it's right that their first love ends...

579
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,849
in such a healthy and positive manner.

580
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:53,059
It feels like we're watching something titled like,

581
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,089
- "The Girl We Loved Back Then." - Right.

582
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,730
It looks very beautiful.

583
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,460
- I mean, that scene.
- Yes.

584
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:03,200
(Woo Jin and Ji Yeon start a conversation.)

585
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,370
Who are you going to choose for me?

586
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:09,810
You want Won Kyu anyway, don't you?

587
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,639
- If I were to have a date, yes.
- You've dated him many times.

588
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,710
Still, is he the only one you want to date?

589
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,909
Are you simply not interested...

590
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:20,250
in meeting anyone else,

591
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:24,859
or is it that you don't think you'll find the romantic attraction...

592
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,389
or the specific style you're looking for in other people?

593
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:30,059
I've always been like this.

594
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,559
I'm not the type...

595
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,400
- to date around.
- You're not that type.

596
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,699
Actually, as someone who hopes to get back together with you,

597
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,470
it feels absurd that I arrange a date for you...

598
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:45,180
with the person you have feelings for.

599
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,840
But I...

600
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,710
I don't know. I don't want to do that in my mind,

601
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,780
but I wonder if it's right...

602
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,420
to make you date someone you want.

603
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:58,560
It's a date, isn't it?

604
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,659
You date someone you feel...

605
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,130
romantically attractive to.

606
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,860
So I wondered...

607
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,400
what you think.

608
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:11,200
You've dated many times here. I've seen quite a few myself.

609
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,270
I was curious whether you still wanted to date him.

610
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,910
You said you wanted to date him again if you had a chance.

611
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,780
I don't know what I should do.

612
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:25,780
If I have a chance to date, yes.

613
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,390
Definitely?

614
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,220
If I have a chance to date.

615
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,890
- Definitely?
- I want Won Kyu.

616
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:39,900
Since I joined this show, Won Kyu is the only one...

617
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,270
I want to get to know better.

618
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,600
How did you feel? Do you think you're compatible?

619
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,100
It's fun to be with him.

620
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,869
"I am attracted to him and I'm curious about him."

621
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,240
Don't speak in vague terms.

622
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:54,480
Yes, it's just like you said. I'm attracted to and curious about him.

623
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,080
Are you considering a chance...

624
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:59,479
that you'll be in a relationship...

625
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,420
even after the show ends?

626
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:04,520
I'm not sure what answer you're looking for.

627
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:07,790
I need to know how you feel.

628
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:11,729
Then I can decide whether I would do as you want or not.

629
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:15,000
I need to make a decision in my mind.

630
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,699
It wasn't "Talk with your ex and pick the one she wants."

631
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,000
It was "Talk with your ex..."

632
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:23,369
"and the man will choose his ex's dating partner."

633
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:25,079
If you're going to select one for me,

634
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,040
I hope you choose Won Kyu.

635
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,620
What if I choose someone else?

636
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,190
After all this talk,

637
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,760
what if I choose Baek Hyun or Yoo Sik?

638
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,760
Are you going to do that?

639
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,960
I don't know either. It's up to me.

640
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,770
If you're the man I think you are, you wouldn't do that.

641
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,100
I might.

642
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:58,040
Why do I have to endure my pain?

643
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,709
As for me, coming here to Japan...

644
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,880
and your coming here with him irritate me.

645
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,690
It feels like I'm losing.

646
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,889
Why do you feel like you're losing?

647
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,690
It's something I haven't done with you.

648
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,690
And now I have to be the one to let you do it with him.

649
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,660
Today, you two were wearing matching outfits.

650
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,230
We didn't plan to do that.

651
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,769
You chose it without thinking and it just happened?

652
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:23,799
The same black and white clothes?

653
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,339
Yes, that's true.

654
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,999
Don't lie to me. It doesn't make sense.

655
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,640
We didn't match our clothes. I mean it.

656
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,809
Even if you matched them, that's understandable.

657
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,080
I told you we didn't.

658
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,050
I can't believe that.

659
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,949
That's impossible.

660
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,279
We didn't match our clothes.

661
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,280
You didn't?

662
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,020
"We?"

663
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,759
This is crazy. After we revealed our exes, I can honestly say...

664
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,390
how I feel, so it's nice in a way.

665
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,230
However,

666
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,960
it's also uncomfortable.

667
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,729
He doesn't want to believe anything.

668
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,499
Woo Jin wants to deny everything.

669
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,139
- His true feelings are coming out.
- Yes. That's good.

670
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,240
- That's good.
- Yes.

671
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:06,680
(Won Kyu and Ji Hyeon start a conversation, too.)

672
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:10,249
Who do you want to choose for me?

673
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,049
I don't have anyone in mind. Just tell me who you want.

674
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,979
Who do you think I want to date?

675
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,850
- I have no idea.
- You have no idea?

676
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:25,229
I don't know. You're getting along well with every man here.

677
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,230
Just tell me who you want.

678
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,699
Isn't it a good thing to get along well with everyone?

679
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,400
You're right. So tell me.

680
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,280
Even so,

681
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:44,050
you must have a first or second choice.

682
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,750
I...

683
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,190
I don't know what to say.

684
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,390
This is so strange.

685
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,130
I...

686
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:04,370
I don't know. I've decided to put myself at ease.

687
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:05,770
Just say it.

688
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,969
According to what I've heard from the ex reveal video,

689
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:11,110
you hate me.

690
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:13,179
You seem to think...

691
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,250
that our breakup is entirely my fault.

692
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,150
What's my fault?

693
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,020
I'm not nitpicking. I'm just asking.

694
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:26,220
Back then, it was your goal to become an announcer.

695
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:31,190
I hoped that you'd set your mind on one thing.

696
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,299
When I watched you,

697
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,629
I really rooted for you...

698
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,300
and hoped that you'd become incredibly successful.

699
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,900
But I felt nervous too.

700
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,570
Why did you feel nervous?

701
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,480
You studied back then, right?

702
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,580
I understood that it was difficult...

703
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,850
to go back to studying after many years.

704
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,550
But even when you needed to be studying,

705
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,520
your mind was on a trip to Japan.

706
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,860
You suggested going on a trip to Japan, right?

707
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,690
I wanted to go with you.

708
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:08,500
But it wasn't a good idea in your situation, was it?

709
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,800
- Do you mean that?
- I mean that.

710
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,009
"Does she really have..."

711
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:22,050
"the intention to focus on her goal with desperation?"

712
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:23,909
I...

713
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:25,880
Do you think it was wrong?

714
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,949
If there's something you need to do,

715
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,119
if you're serious about...

716
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,120
planning our future,

717
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,630
- having that kind of thought...
- I'll ask you this.

718
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:38,530
So I might've looked empty-headed when I wanted to go on a trip.

719
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,059
But do you think...

720
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,699
I was unserious about my goal?

721
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,869
I didn't say that.

722
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:44,969
You were serious about it.

723
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,870
- You worked hard.
- You think I was serious about it,

724
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:49,909
but you don't think I should've said anything about a trip.

725
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:52,380
- Is that it?
- There were such points.

726
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,850
- Seriously.
- Do you mean that?

727
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,310
Yes.

728
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:04,220
Do you really think that to this day?

729
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:08,289
If you really want something, you need to suppress yourself.

730
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:11,260
I wanted to do nice things with you too.

731
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,870
- But...
- I didn't know when I'd pass.

732
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,569
I didn't know when it'd happen.

733
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,139
That was why I wanted you to hurry up and pass.

734
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,070
I passed after we broke up.

735
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:23,710
I passed as soon as we broke up.

736
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,610
What did you pass? I don't know.

737
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,880
I passed the document screening for the open recruitment.

738
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,320
Then I had the 2nd and 3rd rounds.

739
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,760
That process...

740
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,799
So I should've put my heart and soul into it...

741
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,269
for our future.

742
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:56,269
You seriously think I'm at fault because I couldn't suppress...

743
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:58,909
the urge to go on a trip and brought up the matter...

744
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,909
in front of you.

745
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,409
You asked me...

746
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:04,510
why we couldn't go on a trip together.

747
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:09,689
Is it so wrong to want to go on a trip together?

748
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:10,719
Listen.

749
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,420
I'm not going off on that single incident.

750
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:16,060
- So...
- Your attitude was the problem.

751
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:19,160
So my attitude made you think...

752
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,530
that I was unserious about our future.

753
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:24,899
- There were those aspects.
- So I was at fault.

754
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,140
Because...

755
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,269
- I didn't say you were at fault.
- you couldn't understand that,

756
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:30,539
you had no choice but to break up with me. Is that it?

757
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,910
Those aspects led to it.

758
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:35,510
Gosh, I'm so shocked.

759
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:37,249
You haven't changed at all.

760
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:40,150
I have. There were those aspects back then. Of course, there were.

761
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,719
Exactly. You're saying that your thoughts haven't changed...

762
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,190
since then.

763
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,930
How could I not have such thoughts back then?

764
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,939
They have different tendencies.

765
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,439
They definitely have different tendencies.

766
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,069
By 100 percent, Won Kyu seems to be the sensing and thinking type.

767
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,109
That's right.

768
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,109
Ji Hyeon seems to be the intuitive and feeling type.

769
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,579
She's the type to ask for sympathy.

770
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,510
I think that's the biggest difference.

771
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,619
Won Kyu's future includes...

772
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,679
- Ji Hyeon's dream.
- Yes.

773
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,489
Ji Hyeon's dream is...

774
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:17,989
Won Kyu's future.

775
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:20,489
That's right. Realization of Ji Hyeon's dream is included.

776
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,129
That's right. It's so difficult.

777
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:24,729
If Won Kyu had no intention of marrying Ji Hyeon,

778
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:25,829
he would've been fine with that.

779
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:26,959
He would've gone on a trip with her.

780
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,629
But he became disappointed...

781
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,070
- because she was important to him.
- Yes.

782
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:34,270
Ji Hyeon brought up the trip as a ray of light in her life.

783
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:36,609
So when Won Kyu attacked her for it, she crumbled.

784
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,809
It happened because...

785
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,709
- they were deeply in love.
- Yes.

786
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:43,009
- It's so...
- They also have different styles...

787
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,379
when it comes to work.

788
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:47,749
For example, some people go on a trip...

789
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,719
even if they have work.

790
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,420
Then there are people...

791
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,659
who run toward their goal without doing anything else.

792
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,660
- That's right.
- There are such people.

793
00:39:54,661 --> 00:39:55,960
I think that was another difference.

794
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,059
I'm annoyed. Why am I so annoyed?

795
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,500
Why are you so annoyed?

796
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:04,700
With whom do you want to go on a date?

797
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,640
- You know the answer.
- Who is it?

798
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,340
- Tell me.
- Say it out loud.

799
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,909
- Let's hear it.
- Will you help me go on a date...

800
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:12,939
with someone I want?

801
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,509
- Okay.
- Tell me.

802
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,779
- Yoo Sik.
- Yoo Sik?

803
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,450
- Okay.
- Go on a date with Yoo Sik.

804
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,150
What's this? Why did you say it in such a scary way?

805
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,819
It isn't like that. Go on a date with Yoo Sik.

806
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,949
I don't want to go on a date...

807
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,419
with anyone else.

808
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,560
Okay. Go on a date with Yoo Sik if you want.

809
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:31,060
What did you guys talk about?

810
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:33,330
We don't need to tell you that, do we?

811
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,560
Park Hyeon Ji, you're the best.

812
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,330
For goodness' sake.

813
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:40,700
Was I really not considerate of your position?

814
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,970
No, you weren't. How many times do I need to say it?

815
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,710
I don't think there's anything like that at this point. Really?

816
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:47,840
Is there?

817
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,779
At the terrace, you said,

818
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,419
"That won't happen again."

819
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,520
Then you did it again in front of everyone.

820
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,350
You didn't even think about my position...

821
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:59,290
and acted as you wanted, right?

822
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,890
Okay.

823
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,889
That's right. I asked you...

824
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:06,459
- to be considerate of my position.
- Okay.

825
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,160
- I asked that on the second day.
- Okay.

826
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:11,400
Isn't it too late to be considerate of my position?

827
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,099
Even if it's too late, I should do it.

828
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,110
(Glancing over)

829
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,979
I'll be considerate of your position.

830
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:19,980
Now...

831
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,780
I'll do that.

832
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:27,080
If you do that...

833
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,220
- I'll do that.
- even now,

834
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,220
I'll be thankful.

835
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:33,860
I apologize. I'm sorry.

836
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,330
I'm sorry. I was in the wrong.

837
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,570
During work,

838
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:45,899
having quality time...

839
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,240
- I'm sorry.
- What?

840
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,769
- I kicked you just now.
- It's okay.

841
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:50,309
Hey, put this through the hole.

842
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:52,040
- Where?
- Here.

843
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:53,940
Both?

844
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,109
Just one. I need to tie them into a ribbon.

845
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,150
Hold on.

846
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:00,120
Hold this for me.

847
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:06,620
- From the bottom to the top?
- Shall I do it?

848
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,189
No, I got this.

849
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,230
If you can't do it, move.

850
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,959
- I'll do it.
- I got this.

851
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,700
- I'll do it. What is he doing?
- Shall I tie it?

852
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,629
It doesn't need to be big, right?

853
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,270
What? I'll tie it.

854
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,670
I tied it.

855
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,710
I majored in dance.

856
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,509
You tied them into a ribbon. Good.

857
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,680
I'm also good at sewing.

858
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,380
Are dance majors good at sewing?

859
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:29,279
- Korean dance...
- You love telling everyone...

860
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,609
that you majored in dance.

861
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:31,949
We revealed it just now.

862
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,579
I have nothing else to talk about.

863
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,690
I... I won't say more.

864
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,160
How cute.

865
00:42:40,161 --> 00:42:42,030
Gosh, he's so annoying.

866
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,330
Why aren't people coming?

867
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,870
When will their conversation end?

868
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:55,070
(Jae Hyeong collects himself and comes back.)

869
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:58,370
He's back.

870
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:03,350
Why are they blocking the door?

871
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:05,680
Where have you been?

872
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,080
To the restroom.

873
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,849
- Six years after the breakup?
- Yes.

874
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:13,459
Six years are so...

875
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,889
Meeting after six years...

876
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:16,689
We dated a long time ago.

877
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:17,730
It really was a long time ago.

878
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,870
I tried hard to give you a lot of emotional support...

879
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:30,870
since you were going through a hard time back then.

880
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,009
- Isn't that what a lover does?
- That's what a lover does.

881
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:35,550
But you didn't do that.

882
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:38,380
I didn't give you emotional support?

883
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:42,819
Since you were struggling with making preparations and such,

884
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,150
I listened to you and gave you emotional support.

885
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,989
I didn't do any of those things for you?

886
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:50,890
Did you give it serious thought when I said that I was struggling?

887
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,599
Of course, Won Kyu.

888
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,160
Is that so? Then why did you...

889
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:00,299
"May I get some rest today?"

890
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,340
How did you react when I said something like that?

891
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:04,240
What did I say?

892
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,279
Forget it. Don't you remember?

893
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,650
- Is that why you're asking?
- Say it.

894
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,149
Don't say, "Forget it. Don't you remember?"

895
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:13,249
Say what I said.

896
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,849
You made it clear that you were sullen.

897
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:18,020
Say what I said.

898
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:21,890
"Don't you want to see? Why don't you want to see me?"

899
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:23,189
Was it so wrong to say that?

900
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:24,360
"You've changed."

901
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:26,900
It wasn't like that. You knew that.

902
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:28,800
What was I supposed to do?

903
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,640
I don't understand what you're trying to say.

904
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:39,879
You just wanted me to understand your emotions.

905
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,009
You were self-centered in many cases.

906
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:43,879
When I became sullen about you saying,

907
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,019
"Let's meet some other time since I'm tired,"

908
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,349
was it an inconsiderate behavior?

909
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:48,920
It happened many times, didn't it?

910
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,950
Was it an inconsiderate behavior?

911
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:53,359
How was it a considerate behavior?

912
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,359
When I suggested going on a trip...

913
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,790
and you refused, was it a considerate behavior?

914
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,629
- Sympathizing...
- Why didn't you think that...

915
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:04,169
- I'd want to go?
- I thought that you'd want to go.

916
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:05,739
- Then why are you blaming me now?
- So I...

917
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:06,740
- It was understandable.
- You thought...

918
00:45:06,741 --> 00:45:08,469
- I was strange for wanting that.
- No. It was understandable.

919
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:10,640
That was why I said, "Let's go on a trip later."

920
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:15,510
But it wasn't the right time to bring up the topic of a trip.

921
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:17,649
What are you trying to say?

922
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:19,220
We're talking about different things.

923
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:23,190
We're on different planes.

924
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:25,720
Exactly. We have different temperatures.

925
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:29,430
You had too much time, but I didn't have much time.

926
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:32,089
You weren't understanding at all.

927
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:33,900
It wasn't that I didn't want to see you.

928
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:35,830
You know that, right?

929
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:40,170
And speaking of financial matters...

930
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:41,970
Honestly speaking,

931
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:45,040
I was working more than you.

932
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:47,010
I liked you a lot.

933
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,610
Of course, I could spend more money than you.

934
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:51,680
But...

935
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,519
You talked about needing to save up...

936
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,790
once in a while.

937
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:58,790
Then I said, "Let's save up. Let's do that."

938
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,759
But soon afterward, you said,

939
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,190
"Let's eat this. Let's do this."

940
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:04,730
We could do that.

941
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,299
Whenever I heard those words,

942
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,170
I felt like you didn't actually want to save up.

943
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:11,830
"What will we do when we get married?"

944
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,140
But I couldn't say those things to you.

945
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:17,570
How strange.

946
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,150
You don't understand anything I'm saying?

947
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,050
When you look at me,

948
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:33,920
you see someone who was insincere.

949
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,230
That's your conclusion.

950
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,029
That word came up...

951
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:42,299
because I had to decide on...

952
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,870
- I heard that word three times.
- a keyword.

953
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,070
Seriously.

954
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:55,710
Maybe you shouldn't have broken up with me over text.

955
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,279
We think exactly the same...

956
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,820
as how we did when we broke up.

957
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:07,189
There's no such thing as understanding, acceptance,

958
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:08,220
or growth.

959
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,630
So why do you want us to get back together?

960
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:14,430
What's the point of doing that if nothing has changed?

961
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:18,330
Okay.

962
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,170
Pick Yoo Sik for me.

963
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:33,220
(Their conversation ended this way.)

964
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:46,600
It's hyper-realistic.

965
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,169
It's incredibly honest and realistic,

966
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:50,230
- so I'm going insane.
- I know.

967
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:52,969
When you consider marriage,

968
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:56,270
- such talks become a problem.
- That's right.

969
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:59,040
Both of them need to change a lot.

970
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:02,040
Both of them need to accept...

971
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:03,850
- how the other functions.
- That's right.

972
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:05,879
She asked him to pick Yoo Sik.

973
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,019
- Yes. Yoo Sik.
- You're right.

974
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,119
- The conversation was so intense.
- She really did that.

975
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,519
- It wasn't Seung Yong...
- You're right.

976
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,859
Or Jae Hyeong. It was Yoo Sik.

977
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:14,890
Why wasn't it Seung Yong?

978
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:32,070
- Won Kyu.
- What?

979
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:35,780
Why did you leave first?

980
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:38,680
I waited for you.

981
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,220
Why did you leave the room first and close the door?

982
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,350
Have you no manners?

983
00:48:56,670 --> 00:49:00,370
(The two of them enter without a word.)

984
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,310
Something with a key point.

985
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:05,310
That's what I like.

986
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:15,250
Is everyone here?

987
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:25,999
The male residents will take turns...

988
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,860
and choose their ex's date.

989
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:32,000
Are we choosing the partner right here?

990
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,240
Shall we start from the left or the right?

991
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,310
Let's start with Jae Hyeong.

992
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:40,980
Perhaps it was because I was in an emotional state.

993
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,279
I felt like they'd do well without my help,

994
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,350
so I wasn't particularly inclined to bring their hands together.

995
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:48,950
I considered...

996
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:52,090
choosing someone absurd.

997
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,520
I momentarily had that shallow thought.

998
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:04,370
Come here.

999
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,040
Come here.

1000
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:08,570
Why?

1001
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:10,270
Why?

1002
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:11,670
She'll go on a date with you anyway.

1003
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:13,740
Thanks.

1004
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:22,750
(Yun Nyeong's date is Baek Hyun.)

1005
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:28,120
I was only torn momentarily when I had that mean urge.

1006
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:32,029
I realized that I shouldn't come between them.

1007
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:33,030
I decided not to come between them.

1008
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,300
I decided to do...

1009
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,330
the only thing I could do for her at this point.

1010
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,070
That was why I chose Baek Hyun.

1011
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,240
Jae Hyeong looked cool.

1012
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:46,279
Seriously, in a coolheaded way...

1013
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,080
I'm sure he didn't feel that way at heart.

1014
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:52,580
I was very grateful. I was grateful...

1015
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,350
and a bit worried.

1016
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:57,920
I suddenly felt a bit bad too.

1017
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,920
I felt a variety of emotions.

1018
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:11,100
As for us...

1019
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,339
- Both of us...
- Both of us...

1020
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,670
Seriously.

1021
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,740
We picked Yoo Sik.

1022
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:21,239
Go on a date with Yoo Sik.

1023
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,250
(Hyeon Ji's date is Yoo Sik.)

1024
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,350
I tried not to look at Min Kyung.

1025
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:32,419
She's a younger girl I like.

1026
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:35,590
She was the first resident I became friends with.

1027
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:39,799
If I express my interest in her ex, it might hurt...

1028
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,960
her feelings.

1029
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,570
She didn't look happy.

1030
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:48,640
It was the outcome I had expected.

1031
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:51,940
"They'll go on another date."

1032
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:57,010
"They'll make many good memories in Japan." I had that thought.

1033
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:06,460
- It's a good thing, right?
- Yes.

1034
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:12,230
Is it my turn?

1035
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:18,300
- I'll pick Won Kyu.
- Won Kyu?

1036
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,040
Go on a date with him.

1037
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:23,770
(Ji Yeon's date is Won Kyu.)

1038
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,280
I thought I'd be going with Baek Hyun.

1039
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:28,910
It was a big surprise,

1040
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:30,750
and I was grateful.

1041
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,479
The two came to Japan together early yesterday...

1042
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,880
and stayed until today.

1043
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,189
They must've spent a lot of time together.

1044
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:40,420
But still wanting to go on a date...

1045
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,830
Honestly, I didn't want to choose him.

1046
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:45,530
But that wouldn't change anything.

1047
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,860
Since all of us came all the way here,

1048
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:51,769
I thought, "Go on another date..."

1049
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:53,769
"with the guy you want."

1050
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:55,000
It was upsetting,

1051
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,710
but I still chose Won Kyu for her.

1052
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,380
I'll...

1053
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:08,719
pick Yoo Sik.

1054
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,590
(Ji Hyeon's date is Yoo Sik.)

1055
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:13,160
He's so popular.

1056
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:22,130
To be frank, that result shocked me the most.

1057
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:25,269
Wondering why Ji Hyeon chose Yoo Sik...

1058
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:26,299
made me...

1059
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:28,040
confused.

1060
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:32,439
Even when coming to Japan,

1061
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,810
I knew Ji Hyeon had chosen another guy.

1062
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:38,879
So I couldn't help but wonder...

1063
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,250
why she chose me this time.

1064
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:47,160
I'll pick Woo Jin.

1065
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:48,460
Woo Jin.

1066
00:53:48,461 --> 00:53:52,630
(Min Kyung's date is Woo Jin.)

1067
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:58,300
It overlaps if there are two.

1068
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:00,300
He'll go on two dates.

1069
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:05,140
I'm jealous.

1070
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:06,840
What?

1071
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,850
(Seung Yong and Jae Hyeong are not going on a date.)

1072
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:15,050
Is the date tomorrow?

1073
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,450
Probably.

1074
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:18,920
Can you drive?

1075
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,790
- Of course.
- Great.

1076
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,030
What?

1077
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:32,400
I kicked you for no reason.

1078
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,340
- What?
- I kicked you for no reason.

1079
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,740
Why are your eyes bloodshot?

1080
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:40,980
Your eyes are red, Yun Nyeong.

1081
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,850
- Are your eyes okay?
- Yes, they're fine.

1082
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:49,990
It's automatic.

1083
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:52,090
I'm bad at taking photos.

1084
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:54,920
- Should I just push it?
- Tap on it, and it focuses.

1085
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:56,130
What's with this wound?

1086
00:54:56,890 --> 00:54:58,660
- It chapped.
- Chapped?

1087
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,400
The photos turn out really great.

1088
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,840
What a high resolution.

1089
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,310
I love the camera.

1090
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:12,610
I have no idea

1091
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:15,640
I have no idea either

1092
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,810
- Are you drunk?
- Yes.

1093
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:20,850
I see. Don't get angry.

1094
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:28,419
(How was your day in Kamakura?)

1095
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:29,659
(Who made your heart flutter today?)

1096
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,029
(Let them know via text.)

1097
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:32,360
(Your text will be delivered with your name.)

1098
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:33,860
With my name?

1099
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:39,670
This is wild, really wild.

1100
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:45,310
(The first night in Kamakura)

1101
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:50,450
(The first message to express their true feelings on the trip)

1102
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,490
(Starting today, the receiver will get the sender's name.)

1103
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:04,060
(Right now, when everyone knows each other's exes, )

1104
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:09,700
(who made your heart flutter?)

1105
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:16,740
(Everyone's true feelings have been sent.)

1106
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:19,309
- It's no longer anonymous.
- Their names?

1107
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:21,379
Does that mean... Choosing the ex...

1108
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:22,950
Right away after the ex date?

1109
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:24,580
- Oh, my gosh.
- Goodness.

1110
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:26,920
This is wild, totally wild.

1111
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,550
That bracelet looks nice.

1112
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:31,250
It suits your pale skin.

1113
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:33,389
- Can I try it on?
- Go ahead.

1114
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:34,560
How do I take it off?

1115
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:36,689
I never wore anything but watches.

1116
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:37,730
Maybe necklaces once in a while.

1117
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,170
- I got the message.
- Nice.

1118
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,580
(Ji Yeon)

1119
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:58,180
(Anyhow, we ended up coming to Japan.)

1120
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:01,720
(Your ex picked you.)

1121
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:06,890
"We couldn't come together."

1122
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:10,960
"But Japan was my first-ever overseas trip."

1123
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:14,330
"Whether we wanted to or not, we came to Japan."

1124
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:18,200
"With that, I will think of it as us coming together."

1125
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:20,069
That was what it meant.

1126
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:21,070
(With that, I will think of it as us coming together.)

1127
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:32,850
(Hyeon Ji)

1128
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,549
(Hyeon Ji, don't be bothered by me. I only wish you happiness.)

1129
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:38,090
(The message is from Cho Yoo Sik.)

1130
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:45,529
"What's this? What is he talking about?"

1131
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:47,000
That was what crossed my mind.

1132
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:49,670
I thought I had kept...

1133
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:53,269
expressing that...

1134
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:56,199
he was my only choice...

1135
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,109
and that I was interested in him.

1136
00:57:58,110 --> 00:58:00,009
But out of the blue, I felt like he was trying to...

1137
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:01,980
get a message across regardless of my decision...

1138
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:07,180
right before the final decision.

1139
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:09,719
And so I thought, "We'd better talk."

1140
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,920
"What does this mean?"

1141
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,560
It's not like nothing bothered me.

1142
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:18,290
But if she were being self-conscious...

1143
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,700
and holding back,

1144
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:24,270
I would've been more disappointed about that.

1145
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:30,840
(Yoo Sik)

1146
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:33,479
(Today was fun. Will tomorrow be okay?)

1147
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:37,080
(The message is from Park Hyeon Ji.)

1148
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:42,219
Today's date was fun for me.

1149
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:45,090
It was fun, but my exes were revealed later on.

1150
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:47,920
That was why I sent, "Will it be okay?"

1151
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:54,330
(Your ex picked Park Hyeon Ji.)

1152
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:06,609
I thought it was Hyeon Ji...

1153
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:07,940
as expected.

1154
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:12,609
It did make me wonder how Yoo Sik behaved...

1155
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:15,119
in front of Hyeon Ji for both of them...

1156
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,250
to keep picking each other.

1157
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:19,489
They keep picking each other,

1158
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:21,190
which tells me how deep their feelings are.

1159
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:26,660
So you also get such a message.

1160
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,229
- Now...
- It's turning out like that.

1161
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:29,230
Now...

1162
00:59:29,231 --> 00:59:31,129
Picking each other...

1163
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:32,829
- will only make her think...
- Yes.

1164
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:34,170
The two have made their final decision.

1165
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:39,170
(Your ex picked Cho Yoo Sik.)

1166
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,180
This is the new message we get?

1167
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:52,020
I kind of guessed Hyeon Ji's ideal type...

1168
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:54,190
was Yoo Sik.

1169
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:55,660
It felt like...

1170
00:59:56,790 --> 00:59:58,590
informing that to me.

1171
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:01,760
It gave me a tough time emotionally.

1172
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,730
Of course, I'm quite upset.

1173
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:08,769
But making her behave while being self-conscious of me...

1174
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:11,010
feels a lot more wrong.

1175
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,670
It was upsetting,

1176
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:16,240
but I believe I should just accept it.

1177
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:19,210
(Baek Hyun)

1178
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:21,449
(I hope your first Japan trip leaves a good memory.)

1179
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:24,090
(The message is from Choi Yun Nyeong.)

1180
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:27,519
Even when it was anonymous,

1181
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,860
I made sure it was obvious that I had sent it.

1182
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:34,730
That was why it didn't feel all that different to me.

1183
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:37,000
When the exes were revealed,

1184
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,270
he looked quite uneasy.

1185
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:45,739
Worried that he'd end the day feeling bad...

1186
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:47,280
with bad memories of the day,

1187
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:50,109
I sent it hoping the trip would leave a good memory.

1188
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:52,150
(I sent it hoping the trip would leave a good memory.)

1189
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,690
(Yun Nyeong)

1190
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:58,749
(Today was very fun and full of happiness!)

1191
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:01,490
(The message is from Sung Baek Hyun.)

1192
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,990
(The two sent each other text messages even today.)

1193
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:09,700
(Jae Hyeong)

1194
01:01:10,330 --> 01:01:13,600
(Your ex picked Sung Baek Hyun.)

1195
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:23,580
(Hyeon Ji)

1196
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:25,550
(I'll give you your clothes.)

1197
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:26,550
(Let's go on a walk to cool our heads off.)

1198
01:01:26,551 --> 01:01:28,780
(The message is from Lee Jae Hyeong.)

1199
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:32,919
When Hyeon Ji was packing, she didn't have room in her luggage.

1200
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,160
So I packed hers in mine.

1201
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:36,760
I can't deal with this luggage.

1202
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:38,889
Do you want me to pack yours?

1203
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:41,399
I have enough space for 1 or 2 workout clothes.

1204
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,500
Hold on.

1205
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:45,629
I brought some workout clothes with me.

1206
01:01:45,630 --> 01:01:48,240
"I'll give it to you, so let's talk." That was what I sent.

1207
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:51,039
Either way, I've been wanting to talk to Hyeon Ji.

1208
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,240
I want to get to know her,

1209
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:54,610
hence I sent that message.

1210
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:57,350
He's the type to say things bluntly...

1211
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:00,480
without beating around the bush.

1212
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,980
I felt grateful.

1213
01:02:04,450 --> 01:02:07,690
(Jae Hyeong is getting to know Hyeon Ji at his own pace.)

1214
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:11,290
(Your ex picked Park Hyeon Ji.)

1215
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:14,430
- Why are you laughing?
- No reason.

1216
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,670
"So he has feelings for Hyeon Ji."

1217
01:02:19,630 --> 01:02:20,740
But at the same time,

1218
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:24,240
Baek Hyun's ex is Hyeon Ji,

1219
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:25,969
and my ex is Jae Hyeong.

1220
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:27,880
To think that we'd cross paths like this...

1221
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,810
All I could think of was how cruel it was.

1222
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:40,090
So today isn't anonymous.

1223
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:45,530
(Woo Jin)

1224
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,129
(Thanks for taking care of me!)

1225
01:02:48,130 --> 01:02:50,700
(The message is from Kwak Min Kyung.)

1226
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,129
I felt how much...

1227
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:55,839
Woo Jin took care of me the whole day.

1228
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:59,540
So I sent him a thank-you message.

1229
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:08,980
(Min Kyung)

1230
01:03:09,850 --> 01:03:12,819
Actually, I thought...

1231
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:15,689
I'd get a message from Woo Jin today.

1232
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:18,229
But I didn't get one from him,

1233
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:19,959
which made me think that...

1234
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:22,429
he has lingering feelings for his ex...

1235
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:24,200
much more than I imagined.

1236
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,810
(Seung Yong)

1237
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,439
(It was nice seeing you smile.)

1238
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:33,440
(I hope your memories in Kamakura are pleasant.)

1239
01:03:33,441 --> 01:03:35,340
(The message is from Park Ji Hyeon.)

1240
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:41,879
He smiles really brightly,

1241
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,420
and his eyes look lively...

1242
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,889
when he's focused on our date.

1243
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:47,990
That looks nicer, doesn't it?

1244
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,960
Since Seung Yong said...

1245
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:54,560
being with me made him happy and joyful,

1246
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:56,900
I hope that continues...

1247
01:03:57,070 --> 01:04:00,400
and that I can see him smile often.

1248
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,710
(Ji Hyeon)

1249
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,409
(I'm grateful that we could fall in Tokyo like a strong current.)

1250
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:10,410
(Welcoming while kneeling)

1251
01:04:10,411 --> 01:04:13,820
(The message is from Shin Seung Yong.)

1252
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:18,220
The title of the book was "Strong Current."

1253
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:20,560
A famous line in it is...

1254
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:24,129
"Why do people say they fall in love?"

1255
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:27,260
It's something along that line.

1256
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:31,929
Connecting it with what happened during our date,

1257
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:35,800
the message I sent was, "We fell in Tokyo together..."

1258
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,069
"like a strong current."

1259
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:40,840
"Thank you so much for today."

1260
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:45,580
"Love is not falling in love, but doing love."

1261
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:48,319
But using "falling" implies that...

1262
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:49,550
love is...

1263
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:53,120
sudden and passionate.

1264
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:54,690
It was fun.

1265
01:04:55,660 --> 01:04:56,790
I think I smiled.

1266
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,300
(Your ex picked Hong Ji Yeon.)

1267
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:06,169
Sending the message to the very person...

1268
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:08,070
who was the source of our fight...

1269
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:11,309
made me think he was toying with me.

1270
01:05:11,310 --> 01:05:13,610
It really riled me up back then.

1271
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:14,940
I...

1272
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:18,250
would've actually liked it if I didn't know.

1273
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:22,220
I can't keep a straight face at all.

1274
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:29,420
(Ji Yeon)

1275
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:31,759
(You made my day relaxing. Thanks. Let's get along more tomorrow.)

1276
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:34,060
(The message is from Jung Won Kyu.)

1277
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:36,160
It made me happy.

1278
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,699
My feelings for her...

1279
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:41,240
grew stronger than before as we spent the day together.

1280
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,410
Ji Yeon made...

1281
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:45,770
my heart flutter all day.

1282
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:48,510
I looked forward to the date...

1283
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:50,680
with Ji Yeon tomorrow.

1284
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,989
(I'm also bummed out that we couldn't come together.)

1285
01:06:04,990 --> 01:06:08,130
(Your ex picked you.)

1286
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:10,729
What? Sorry?

1287
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:12,499
(Ji Yeon sent Woo Jin a message for the first time.)

1288
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:15,069
- Why?
- Hold on. Why?

1289
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:16,139
Why him, not Won Kyu?

1290
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:18,409
- Things have cleared up...
- What...

1291
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:19,869
- after the ramyeon incident.
- Because of that?

1292
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:21,109
- For real.
- She had a blast...

1293
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:22,379
during the zoo date in Japan.

1294
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:24,879
The trip must mean a lot to the two.

1295
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,849
Either way, she was bothered by him...

1296
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:28,319
- That'll cause a misunderstanding.
- for the first time.

1297
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:32,119
Ji Yeon is the type to be clear about her feelings.

1298
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,619
- Exactly.
- She gives no chances.

1299
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:34,759
But to have sent that means...

1300
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,719
- her feelings have changed, right?
- Yes.

1301
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,389
- Her message could be...
- Yes?

1302
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:40,060
An apology to her ex...

1303
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:43,199
and a way to make Won Kyu...

1304
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,869
- A warning?
- put his guard up...

1305
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:46,839
- at the same time.
- That might've been her goal.

1306
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,969
It's a dangerous move to send it on the 11th day.

1307
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:49,970
- Yes, right now...
- True.

1308
01:06:49,971 --> 01:06:52,339
- Sending it when Woo Jin...
- Yes.

1309
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:53,739
Is having a tough time...

1310
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:56,139
In Won Kyu's shoes, they went on a whole-day date,

1311
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:58,249
and the exes have been revealed,

1312
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:00,180
but he didn't get a message.

1313
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,219
That could definitely cause a misunderstanding.

1314
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:03,849
- Yes.
- It's the timing.

1315
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:05,090
(Won Kyu might misunderstand.)

1316
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:08,390
(I'm also bummed out that we couldn't come together.)

1317
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:11,460
(Your ex picked you.)

1318
01:07:12,190 --> 01:07:13,900
I wasn't sure after reading the message.

1319
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:16,660
"It's for me?"

1320
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,570
It was a message I thought I would never get.

1321
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:24,469
It felt like reward for what I went through...

1322
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:25,910
the last 3 to 4 days.

1323
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:30,210
I made one-sided expressions to change her feelings,

1324
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:32,650
which weren't directed towards me.

1325
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:36,450
It was as if she were acknowledging them.

1326
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:40,920
I felt all sorts of feelings.

1327
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,059
For the first time,

1328
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:50,430
I sent a message to someone other than Won Kyu.

1329
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,570
I really struggled with it.

1330
01:07:53,970 --> 01:07:56,269
I couldn't decide who to send it to.

1331
01:07:56,270 --> 01:07:59,039
The time I spent with Won Kyu was amazing,

1332
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:02,539
so I wanted to tell Won Kyu that...

1333
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:04,080
he made my day today.

1334
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:10,389
Woo Jin was really upset that...

1335
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:12,090
we couldn't come together.

1336
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:15,290
That just didn't leave my mind and made me feel guilty.

1337
01:08:15,790 --> 01:08:18,830
I wanted to let Woo Jin know that...

1338
01:08:18,990 --> 01:08:22,030
I also felt upset that we couldn't come together,

1339
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:23,430
so I sent it.

1340
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:32,640
(Won Kyu)

1341
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:37,610
I didn't get any.

1342
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:40,719
I could tell that Ji Yeon was thinking...

1343
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,180
about her ex more...

1344
01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:45,950
and that she was anxious and wavering.

1345
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:48,620
I kind of expected that might happen.

1346
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:50,330
But...

1347
01:08:51,690 --> 01:08:55,360
sending the message to him today was a surprise.

1348
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:58,100
After all, we spent a lot of time together.

1349
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:05,540
(Their feelings are starting to change again.)

1350
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:15,920
(Your ex picked Shin Seung Yong.)

1351
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:20,250
I had a guess who my ex might pick.

1352
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:23,889
But such a guess could fill your head with more thoughts.

1353
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:26,430
Seeing who she chose was for the better.

1354
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:30,670
(Your ex picked Choi Yun Nyeong.)

1355
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:34,170
(Your ex picked Park Ji Hyeon.)

1356
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:36,900
I don't really care.

1357
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:45,510
(The new rising wind causes a stir in their hearts.)

1358
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,659
(Room 101, Purple Room: Min Kyung, Yun Nyeong...)

1359
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:00,229
(Room 102, Red Room: Baek Hyun, Woo Jin...)

1360
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:01,700
Our rooms have been assigned.

1361
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,669
Our rooms have been assigned?

1362
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:04,829
(Room 202, Blue Room: Won Kyu, Yoo Sik)

1363
01:10:04,830 --> 01:10:07,140
Everyone, please check the text message.

1364
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,839
(Room assignment divided into 1st and 2nd floor)

1365
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,509
It's the same for the boys.

1366
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:13,680
- Is it the same? All right!
- Yes.

1367
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,680
The boys have the same roommate.

1368
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,009
You're right. There's a change only for the girls.

1369
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:20,010
Yes.

1370
01:10:20,110 --> 01:10:22,380
Room 101? Is that on the 1st floor?

1371
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:24,550
Let's go, Seung Yong.

1372
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:28,420
Min Kyung.

1373
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:31,089
- Yes?
- Wait for me.

1374
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:32,189
Let's go together.

1375
01:10:32,190 --> 01:10:33,530
(On their first night in Japan, they move to their own room.)

1376
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:36,859
- Where should we go?
- We have to go this way.

1377
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:38,600
- Yes, it's okay.
- Let's go.

1378
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:40,599
- Bye.
- Ours is this way.

1379
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,939
I can't distinguish between boys and girls' room.

1380
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:45,809
(Room 203 Green Room, 202 Blue Room, 102 Red Room, 101 Purple Room)

1381
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:47,580
The girls' rooms must be over there.

1382
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:50,010
I like the first floor.

1383
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:55,249
(When you follow the scent of the purple flowers...)

1384
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:56,250
We're here.

1385
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:59,020
(Located on the right...)

1386
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:02,789
Isn't it really nice?

1387
01:11:02,790 --> 01:11:04,030
Gosh, it's nice.

1388
01:11:04,930 --> 01:11:07,630
(Room 101, Purple Room, Min Kyung and Yun Nyeong's room)

1389
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:10,430
- It's beautiful and nice.
- Right?

1390
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,230
(Room 101, Purple Room is filled with cozy purple color.)

1391
01:11:13,970 --> 01:11:16,269
- Do we go in this way?
- This must be our room.

1392
01:11:16,270 --> 01:11:18,140
- Gosh, it's nice.
- Yes.

1393
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:19,840
- Woo Jin.
- Is that your room?

1394
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:23,750
- My gosh.
- We're in this room.

1395
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:25,679
- Are we roommates again?
- Because of the rain...

1396
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:26,809
(Seung Yong and Jae Hyeong's room is above Baek Hyun and Woo Jin's.)

1397
01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:27,820
I like it.

1398
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,949
What? Isn't this a room for newlyweds?

1399
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:31,990
What?

1400
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:36,520
(Room 102, Red Room, Baek Hyun and Woo Jin's room)

1401
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:38,759
I'm surprised that there's a place like this in Japan.

1402
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:41,199
(Lovely as a room for newlyweds)

1403
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:44,830
(Red Room is colored in red.)

1404
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:47,770
- It's 200...
- It's Room 202.

1405
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:50,170
- Is that right?
- Yes.

1406
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:55,539
(The boys' rooms on the right side of the hallway)

1407
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:58,480
Isn't Seung Yong in Room 203?

1408
01:11:59,210 --> 01:12:01,450
- Do you have the key?
- Here it is.

1409
01:12:03,850 --> 01:12:06,620
- This is...
- Gosh, this is it.

1410
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:11,230
- This is it, Won Kyu.
- This is it.

1411
01:12:13,190 --> 01:12:14,959
We have a view of the outside.

1412
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:17,230
(Room 202, Blue Room with the view of the blue ocean)

1413
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:21,899
(Small and cute blue items...)

1414
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:24,910
(and a light, refreshing breeze)

1415
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:30,950
(Room 202, Blue Room, Won Kyu and Yoo Sik's room)

1416
01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:34,680
This is it.

1417
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:39,090
(A dazzling moment to enjoy with the morning sunlight)

1418
01:12:39,690 --> 01:12:43,930
(Room 203, Green Room, Seung Yong and Jae Hyeong's room)

1419
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:48,400
(Room 204, Orange Room, Ji Hyeon's room)

1420
01:12:49,230 --> 01:12:52,670
(Room 205, Yellow Room, Ji Yeon and Hyeon Ji's room)

1421
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:54,539
(Room 205 Yellow Room, Room 204 Orange Room, )

1422
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:56,339
(Room 203 Green Room, Room 202 Blue Room, )

1423
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:58,040
(Room 102 Red Room, Room 101 Purple Room)

1424
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,810
(Communal space and terrace)

1425
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:13,149
(In beautiful nature)

1426
01:13:13,150 --> 01:13:16,660
(This is Kamakura where radiant memories will be made.)

1427
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:18,629
That's really amazing.

1428
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:20,529
- It has a view of the ocean?
- It's beautiful.

1429
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:21,600
It looks very nice.

1430
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:24,929
What's nice is that they can bump into each other easily.

1431
01:13:24,930 --> 01:13:26,269
- Right.
- The 1st and 2nd floor.

1432
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:27,469
Someone from the second floor can call someone...

1433
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:28,799
- on the first floor.
- Right.

1434
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:32,009
Only the female residents' roommates changed.

1435
01:13:32,010 --> 01:13:33,469
The boys have the same roommates from Pyeongchang-dong House.

1436
01:13:33,470 --> 01:13:34,509
Right.

1437
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:36,740
Could you walk me up to there?

1438
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,410
Where? Okay.

1439
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:44,820
Is that the entrance?

1440
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,750
That's my room.

1441
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:48,520
By the way...

1442
01:13:49,990 --> 01:13:52,760
The atmosphere has gotten tense.

1443
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:01,370
I'm very embarrassed.

1444
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:03,470
- What?
- I'm embarrassed.

1445
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:04,810
Why?

1446
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:07,409
(I didn't get any votes.)

1447
01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:08,980
- What?
- I didn't get any votes.

1448
01:14:10,610 --> 01:14:11,780
I didn't get any votes.

1449
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:14,950
You mean, the text?

1450
01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:17,849
(0 votes)

1451
01:14:17,850 --> 01:14:19,820
See? It's not the same for you.

1452
01:14:20,150 --> 01:14:21,460
I always...

1453
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:23,690
- What?
- I always get nothing.

1454
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:25,030
- Who?
- Me.

1455
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:26,560
It's only starting now.

1456
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:30,000
About Woo Jin...

1457
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:33,129
When I talked to him,

1458
01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:35,199
I realized that he broke up very recently.

1459
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:36,899
- He seems very attached to his ex.
- What?

1460
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:38,509
He still seems very attached to his ex.

1461
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:40,170
You should still keep talking to him.

1462
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:43,340
- I don't want to be imposing.
- But his ex isn't attached...

1463
01:14:43,710 --> 01:14:45,080
to Woo Jin anymore.

1464
01:14:46,210 --> 01:14:48,149
I'm not sure...

1465
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:50,819
if Woo Jin expressed his feelings for me.

1466
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:53,250
You can't know that yet. You have to go on a date first.

1467
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:54,490
At what time is it tomorrow?

1468
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:56,660
- At 4:30pm.
- At 4:30pm?

1469
01:14:57,730 --> 01:14:58,959
- At what time is yours?
- I have to wake up at 10am.

1470
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,490
It must be nice to be so popular.

1471
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:01,899
(He can't deny being flattered.)

1472
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:03,429
I knew this would happen.

1473
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:05,730
- What?
- Yes, you're handsome.

1474
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:07,399
- All right.
- You're handsome.

1475
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:08,469
Goodness.

1476
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:09,599
- Is it here?
- Yes.

1477
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:10,670
Go inside.

1478
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:13,739
Gosh, I'm also popular outside of here.

1479
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:16,039
- Okay. Tomorrow...
- You ruined my reputation.

1480
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:17,210
How did I ruin it?

1481
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:18,949
- Tomorrow evening...
- Because I cry everyday.

1482
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:20,079
I cry?

1483
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:21,720
- No, I cry.
- See you tomorrow evening.

1484
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:24,089
Enjoy your two dates.

1485
01:15:24,090 --> 01:15:25,190
Okay.

1486
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:28,619
Everyone likes you because you're so friendly.

1487
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:29,620
Okay.

1488
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:36,029
- Everyone can hear her.
- That's cute.

1489
01:15:36,030 --> 01:15:38,269
The energy between them has changed, hasn't it?

1490
01:15:38,270 --> 01:15:39,899
- You're right.
- It feels like...

1491
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:42,069
- What could it be?
- She let go of something.

1492
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:43,339
I like this vibe the most.

1493
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:45,370
- It's perfect. I find it very cute.
- Right.

1494
01:15:52,610 --> 01:15:53,980
- Seung Yong.
- Yes?

1495
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:56,550
The introduction from your ex is here.

1496
01:15:57,390 --> 01:15:58,449
(Shin Seung Yong)

1497
01:15:58,450 --> 01:16:00,319
(The farewell package and the introduction from his ex...)

1498
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:02,119
(arrived at their door.)

1499
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:03,720
(Lee Jae Hyeong)

1500
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:07,800
The introduction from your ex is here.

1501
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,300
What? Could you say it again?

1502
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,400
- What?
- The intro from your ex is here.

1503
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,070
What is that box?

1504
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:17,440
We also received it.

1505
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:20,439
Should I open it in private?

1506
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:23,080
(A farewell arrived at his door.)

1507
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:35,060
(He opens the introduction written by Hyeon Ji first.)

1508
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:41,629
(My ex is a hard-working romantic. When you date him, )

1509
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:43,159
(you might feel that he's not very detailed.)

1510
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:44,899
(However, the effort he makes...)

1511
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,529
(for the other person is beautiful.)

1512
01:16:46,530 --> 01:16:48,240
(And I'm grateful for it.)

1513
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:49,939
(My ex takes a long time to open up himself.)

1514
01:16:49,940 --> 01:16:51,539
(When I fall in love with someone, I'm the type to totally open up...)

1515
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:53,009
(If he gets to meet someone here, I hope that it will be someone...)

1516
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:54,940
(who is able to wait for him and love him without getting anxious.)

1517
01:16:56,210 --> 01:16:59,349
"Hard-working romantic" was what caught my eyes.

1518
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:00,919
(My ex is a hard-working romantic.)

1519
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:02,880
(When you date him, you might feel that he's not very detailed...)

1520
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:04,489
To be honest,

1521
01:17:04,490 --> 01:17:07,490
I'm not someone who's very affectionate.

1522
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:09,959
That's why we argued a lot.

1523
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:12,430
I often made her disappointed,

1524
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:14,800
so I worked hard on it.

1525
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:17,830
Hyeon Ji recognized that I made an effort.

1526
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,229
So that must be why...

1527
01:17:20,230 --> 01:17:22,900
she described me as a hard-working romantic.

1528
01:17:25,570 --> 01:17:26,910
I was very thankful for that.

1529
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:40,720
(He opens the farewell package from Hyeon Ji.)

1530
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:55,670
(She returned a necklace that Seung Yong gave her.)

1531
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:59,069
I bought a necklace...

1532
01:17:59,070 --> 01:18:01,240
for her birthday once.

1533
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:05,209
I wouldn't mind even if she wore it after our breakup.

1534
01:18:05,210 --> 01:18:06,780
Actually, I want her to wear it.

1535
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:09,680
The fact that she returned it to me...

1536
01:18:10,650 --> 01:18:12,620
shows that our relationship is over.

1537
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:16,260
"Is she ready to meet someone else?"

1538
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,230
That's the thought that came to my mind.

1539
01:18:19,830 --> 01:18:24,100
Now that I know whom my ex is texting,

1540
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:27,230
I think that I have less chance of getting back with her.

1541
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:31,470
I felt like I was falling off a cliff.

1542
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:37,280
(Sighing)

1543
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:43,050
(His roommate, Jae Hyeong returned.)

1544
01:18:43,450 --> 01:18:44,750
- Seung Yong.
- You startled me.

1545
01:18:44,950 --> 01:18:46,619
- Did you sleep?
- Yes.

1546
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:49,360
(Jae Hyeong also found a farewell bundle.)

1547
01:18:53,790 --> 01:18:56,900
(He takes a look at the farewell package from Yun Nyeong.)

1548
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:00,430
What's this?

1549
01:19:03,270 --> 01:19:04,310
What is it?

1550
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:12,080
(The farewell package for Jae Hyeong is empty.)

1551
01:19:13,310 --> 01:19:14,319
What?

1552
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,550
(He looks everywhere inside, but there's nothing.)

1553
01:19:17,050 --> 01:19:19,320
When I opened it, there was nothing.

1554
01:19:20,150 --> 01:19:23,190
It must mean that nothing of our relationship remains in her heart.

1555
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,330
(He reads the introduction written by Yun Nyeong.)

1556
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:37,240
(Laughing)

1557
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,279
(My ex is an extrovert with positive energy.)

1558
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,739
(He cherishes people who are close to him.)

1559
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:44,180
(That's why everyone liked my ex and it looked charming to me.)

1560
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:45,309
(Now that we're grown up, )

1561
01:19:45,310 --> 01:19:46,449
(both my ex and I are more flexible than before.)

1562
01:19:46,450 --> 01:19:47,749
(Our past will be in my memory.)

1563
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:49,419
(I sincerely hope that my ex will have a good time here.)

1564
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:50,950
(Also, he's a good dancer.)

1565
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:54,960
It felt like she wrote it more casually than I expected.

1566
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:57,790
So it was a little funny.

1567
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:01,760
At the end, she wrote that her ex likes to dance.

1568
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:04,970
She hoped that someone would make him dance.

1569
01:20:06,530 --> 01:20:09,900
I thought, "Is she out of her mind?"

1570
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:11,810
I'm glad that no one found out.

1571
01:20:12,610 --> 01:20:15,910
If I had to read this letter out loud in front of everyone,

1572
01:20:16,010 --> 01:20:17,750
people would've told me to dance.

1573
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:20,810
I would have resented Yun Nyeong.

1574
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,279
I wouldn't have read it out loud if that was in the letter.

1575
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:24,889
If it said that I was good at vocal mimicry...

1576
01:20:24,890 --> 01:20:26,490
and they should ask me to show it, I wouldn't have read it.

1577
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:30,119
If you opened the box, there was nothing.

1578
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,959
Or a birthday present that you gave was returned.

1579
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:33,659
Which one would make you feel worse?

1580
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:35,659
I'd feel worse to see the return of a present.

1581
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:36,829
To see a present?

1582
01:20:36,830 --> 01:20:39,469
- The fact that she returned it.
- An empty box?

1583
01:20:39,470 --> 01:20:40,869
- Wait, an empty box?
- An empty box?

1584
01:20:40,870 --> 01:20:43,639
I'd think that an empty box means...

1585
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:45,039
something.

1586
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:46,809
- If the box were empty, - When there's nothing...

1587
01:20:46,810 --> 01:20:48,939
I'd think that my ex is keeping everything that I gave her.

1588
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:51,709
- It could mean that.
- I could accept it positively.

1589
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:54,210
What do you think it means that she returned the necklace?

1590
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,079
- It must mean that she wants...
- Right?

1591
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,349
- to get over the relationship.
- That's what I think too.

1592
01:20:57,350 --> 01:21:00,990
Her ex-boyfriend might want her to wear it even after the breakup.

1593
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:04,019
- That might be okay for shoes...
- I can understand.

1594
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:05,889
Or clothes.

1595
01:21:05,890 --> 01:21:08,099
But when it's a necklace...

1596
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:09,359
- or a ring, - A ring.

1597
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,070
- it's not easy to keep wearing it.
- Right.

1598
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:15,740
(Yellow Room, Ji Yeon and Hyeon Ji's room)

1599
01:21:15,970 --> 01:21:16,970
Even though I'm aware...

1600
01:21:17,710 --> 01:21:18,710
Yes?

1601
01:21:18,711 --> 01:21:22,540
(Someone came to Ji Yeon and Hyeon Ji's room.)

1602
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:27,179
- Hyeon Ji.
- Yes?

1603
01:21:27,180 --> 01:21:28,180
When should I return your clothes to you?

1604
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:30,950
My clothes? When will be good?

1605
01:21:31,550 --> 01:21:33,050
Can you come downstairs in ten minutes?

1606
01:21:33,350 --> 01:21:35,059
- When?
- After ten minutes.

1607
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:36,260
Okay.

1608
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:40,590
(Red Room, Baek Hyun and Woo Jin's room)

1609
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:45,170
(Exhaling heavily)

1610
01:21:46,530 --> 01:21:47,530
What are you doing?

1611
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:49,700
I'm very tired.

1612
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:51,470
My brain is freezing.

1613
01:21:52,270 --> 01:21:53,570
You must not have slept much.

1614
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:56,040
I couldn't sleep well.

1615
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,309
(He feels very tired on the first day of the trip.)

1616
01:21:58,310 --> 01:21:59,380
What's this?

1617
01:21:59,950 --> 01:22:01,250
- A steam iron?
- It's a steam iron.

1618
01:22:04,220 --> 01:22:06,750
(Woo Jin takes out something from his suitcase.)

1619
01:22:07,790 --> 01:22:10,290
(On the last day in Seoul)

1620
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:16,760
(He takes out the introduction from his ex in the closet.)

1621
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:30,780
I felt quite complicated.

1622
01:22:32,650 --> 01:22:34,480
I thought, "We loved each other very much."

1623
01:22:37,150 --> 01:22:40,650
(He packs the introduction on one side of his suitcase.)

1624
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:55,240
(He also packs the doll that was in the farewell package.)

1625
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:03,540
I'm going out for a minute.

1626
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:11,650
I think I created this situation by using being sensitive as an excuse.

1627
01:23:12,490 --> 01:23:14,319
I must do everything that I can...

1628
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:15,520
and talk to her a lot.

1629
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:23,160
Yes?

1630
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:24,800
Who is it?

1631
01:23:26,630 --> 01:23:27,630
Who is it?

1632
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:30,300
It's me. I think it belongs to Jae Hyeong.

1633
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:31,940
Give it to Jae Hyeong.

1634
01:23:31,941 --> 01:23:33,210
Why did you bring his stuff here?

1635
01:23:33,610 --> 01:23:35,079
He's on the sofa downstairs.

1636
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:36,340
Okay.

1637
01:23:37,010 --> 01:23:38,480
Should I take that key?

1638
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:40,609
Why would you take the key?

1639
01:23:40,610 --> 01:23:43,319
- I'll keep the key in the front.
- We should keep it in the doorknob.

1640
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,890
Okay, I'm sorry. I can't think straight right now.

1641
01:23:47,050 --> 01:23:48,090
Have a good conversation.

1642
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:52,490
- You too.
- Okay.

1643
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,060
Which one is your bed?

1644
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:58,599
- The one inside.
- Which side is that?

1645
01:23:58,600 --> 01:23:59,769
Next to the hanger.

1646
01:23:59,770 --> 01:24:02,300
- On the right?
- Yes, on the right.

1647
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:05,369
- Yes, that one.
- This one?

1648
01:24:05,370 --> 01:24:07,210
- Yes, that one.
- This one?

1649
01:24:07,370 --> 01:24:08,380
It's nice.

1650
01:24:09,810 --> 01:24:11,080
How is your room?

1651
01:24:11,850 --> 01:24:13,079
- My room?
- Yes.

1652
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:14,620
My room is also nice.

1653
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:23,920
Go to your bed.

1654
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:25,830
- This is my bed.
- Go to your bed.

1655
01:24:30,730 --> 01:24:32,129
- Isn't it cute?
- I returned it to you.

1656
01:24:32,130 --> 01:24:33,470
Why are you giving it back to me?

1657
01:24:33,870 --> 01:24:36,139
I returned it to you.

1658
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:40,070
You need to cuddle with it when you need to calm down.

1659
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:42,710
Gosh.

1660
01:24:43,910 --> 01:24:47,410
I really thought that you'd match me with Baek Hyun.

1661
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:51,050
I wonder what's on your mind.

1662
01:24:58,390 --> 01:24:59,390
This...

1663
01:25:01,030 --> 01:25:02,430
What's on your bag?

1664
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,729
- What?
- What is this on your bag?

1665
01:25:04,730 --> 01:25:06,969
- What do you mean?
- It looks like a key ring.

1666
01:25:06,970 --> 01:25:08,140
Yes, it's a key ring.

1667
01:25:09,940 --> 01:25:11,710
- Did Won Kyu buy it for you?
- Yes.

1668
01:25:14,170 --> 01:25:15,980
And you hang it on your bag?

1669
01:25:17,610 --> 01:25:18,650
Yes.

1670
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:23,619
When I bought one for you,

1671
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:25,150
you kept it for a short time.

1672
01:25:26,850 --> 01:25:28,860
But you keep it on your bag here.

1673
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:31,890
I put it on for the first time today.

1674
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:38,070
What do you want me to say?

1675
01:25:38,370 --> 01:25:40,230
Why would I want to hear something from you?

1676
01:25:41,230 --> 01:25:43,900
I don't think I asked for a particular response.

1677
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,470
- Okay.
- I just asked.

1678
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:52,450
(Unlike what he said, he has a lot on his mind.)

1679
01:26:13,730 --> 01:26:15,000
I felt disappointed.

1680
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:17,770
If I was really on her mind,

1681
01:26:18,610 --> 01:26:20,070
she could've taken it off after the date.

1682
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:23,540
On the other hand,

1683
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:27,810
I keep telling Ji Yeon...

1684
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:30,750
that I want to get back with her.

1685
01:26:32,350 --> 01:26:34,519
I don't know if it's right...

1686
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:36,860
to keep telling her how disappointed I am.

1687
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:40,230
I wonder if it's the right thing to do.

1688
01:26:47,230 --> 01:26:48,900
I think I cleaned up almost everything.

1689
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:10,190
You're also going on a date tomorrow.

1690
01:27:11,290 --> 01:27:12,660
- Right.
- Yes.

1691
01:27:14,590 --> 01:27:16,000
Well...

1692
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,530
I'm saying this to make sure you don't get the wrong idea.

1693
01:27:24,070 --> 01:27:27,069
I told you that I came here with Min Kyung and Jae Hyeong.

1694
01:27:27,070 --> 01:27:28,110
Yes.

1695
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:31,079
I went on a date with Min Kyung...

1696
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:32,210
- the most on the show.
- Yes.

1697
01:27:33,650 --> 01:27:38,019
Out of everyone, Min Kyung was the one whom I felt that...

1698
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:40,320
I could develop romantic attraction to.

1699
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:41,390
Okay.

1700
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:47,230
(Ji Yeon hears about his romantic interest for the first time.)

1701
01:27:48,660 --> 01:27:51,569
I texted you on the third day...

1702
01:27:51,570 --> 01:27:53,700
and the fourth day too.

1703
01:27:53,970 --> 01:27:58,210
I was leaning toward getting back together with you.

1704
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:00,569
- Anyway, I...
- But until then...

1705
01:28:00,570 --> 01:28:02,510
- I'm sorry I interrupted you.
- Okay.

1706
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:05,409
If you weren't certain...

1707
01:28:05,410 --> 01:28:08,049
and you were interested in someone,

1708
01:28:08,050 --> 01:28:11,320
then why did you tell me...

1709
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:14,890
you wanted to get back together?

1710
01:28:15,890 --> 01:28:17,619
Because I was leaning toward getting back together.

1711
01:28:17,620 --> 01:28:20,230
But I went on a date with someone while having those feelings.

1712
01:28:20,330 --> 01:28:22,759
And it is true that I focused on my date with her.

1713
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:24,799
So you were also interested in her.

1714
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,069
Here's what I said.

1715
01:28:26,070 --> 01:28:28,139
Min Kyung was the only one I saw myself...

1716
01:28:28,140 --> 01:28:29,440
developing romantic attraction to.

1717
01:28:32,170 --> 01:28:33,909
How should I explain this?

1718
01:28:33,910 --> 01:28:35,040
When it comes to romantic attraction...

1719
01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:36,539
I want to talk inside.

1720
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:38,580
There are so many bugs here. I hate them.

1721
01:28:45,150 --> 01:28:48,390
I wanted to express that I was certain about what I wanted.

1722
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:53,330
So I thought that I should tell her the whole truth.

1723
01:28:54,730 --> 01:28:58,230
To explain my feelings and the experience I had here,

1724
01:28:59,470 --> 01:29:01,699
I wanted to tell her about the dates I went on...

1725
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:03,400
and the people I connected with.

1726
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:05,040
But Ji Yeon...

1727
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:09,010
didn't seem to understand that.

1728
01:29:17,850 --> 01:29:19,489
- Go on.
- Remember what I told you?

1729
01:29:19,490 --> 01:29:23,090
When you told me that you were attracted to Won Kyu,

1730
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:25,059
I said to you,

1731
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:27,860
"How could you be attracted to him when you just met him?"

1732
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,299
- Remember?
- Yes.

1733
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:33,070
Here's how I view romantic attraction.

1734
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:37,770
It doesn't mean I'm falling for someone.

1735
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:40,910
But I think it's the step before reaching that point.

1736
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:44,950
When I went on dates with Min Kyung,

1737
01:29:46,710 --> 01:29:48,419
I wouldn't say I was attracted to her.

1738
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:49,920
But I enjoyed my time with her.

1739
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:53,820
I thought if I went on a few more dates and talked with her,

1740
01:29:54,050 --> 01:29:56,359
I might be able to be romantically attracted to her.

1741
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:57,890
Woo Jin, that's already romantic attraction.

1742
01:29:58,460 --> 01:29:59,690
How is that romantic attraction?

1743
01:30:00,090 --> 01:30:02,559
You want to talk to her more and get to know her better.

1744
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:03,830
That's romantic attraction.

1745
01:30:05,230 --> 01:30:07,129
Honestly, I liked her company on the dates.

1746
01:30:07,130 --> 01:30:08,340
I focused on my dates too.

1747
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:11,299
I'm sure there were romantic moments too.

1748
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:13,670
I had fun on the dates as well.

1749
01:30:14,210 --> 01:30:17,210
But here's what I wanted to tell you.

1750
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,810
I didn't think Min Kyung was interested in me.

1751
01:30:20,210 --> 01:30:23,220
I told you that I came here with Min Kyung and Jae Hyeong.

1752
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:25,449
Three of us were together, and once Jae Hyeong went to the restroom,

1753
01:30:25,450 --> 01:30:26,750
here's what she said.

1754
01:30:28,050 --> 01:30:30,619
She talked to her ex, and she sorted out her feelings.

1755
01:30:30,620 --> 01:30:32,129
What else did she say?

1756
01:30:32,130 --> 01:30:34,590
She said she could be clear with her interest now.

1757
01:30:34,930 --> 01:30:37,429
She said she wanted to get to know someone new.

1758
01:30:37,430 --> 01:30:40,270
She alluded that she would like to pick me...

1759
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,840
if there was a chance to go on a date in Japan.

1760
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:44,939
There was something I wanted to tell her.

1761
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:46,570
If Min Kyung...

1762
01:30:48,380 --> 01:30:50,880
were to have romantic attraction toward me and ask me out on a date,

1763
01:30:51,010 --> 01:30:53,779
I was prepared to tell her how I felt.

1764
01:30:53,780 --> 01:30:55,079
Think about it. There are other people here.

1765
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:56,219
I can't exactly pull her out...

1766
01:30:56,220 --> 01:30:57,350
and have a private conversation about that.

1767
01:30:58,790 --> 01:31:01,490
You wanted to go on a date with her, so you could talk to her?

1768
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:02,989
That's not about the date.

1769
01:31:02,990 --> 01:31:04,619
If I were...

1770
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:07,029
The fact that you're making an effort...

1771
01:31:07,030 --> 01:31:09,430
to go out with her to talk to her...

1772
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:11,300
is making me feel...

1773
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,730
- uncertain about your intention.
- I need to respect her too.

1774
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:16,540
I'm telling you where I'm coming from.

1775
01:31:17,770 --> 01:31:19,309
I need to respect her.

1776
01:31:19,310 --> 01:31:20,839
What's your top priority now?

1777
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:22,209
- It's you.
- Is it how she feels?

1778
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:23,539
Then how could you think that?

1779
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:26,080
I'm not saying that I'm going to choose her.

1780
01:31:26,610 --> 01:31:29,279
- She chose me...
- Anyway, I'll end up...

1781
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:31,720
watching you go on a date with her, won't I?

1782
01:31:31,950 --> 01:31:33,549
Did you not think that I'd get the wrong idea...

1783
01:31:33,550 --> 01:31:35,920
- about that?
- So I'm telling you in advance.

1784
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:40,759
I'm telling you what I'm going to do on the date, so you can trust me.

1785
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:43,029
- It's not about earning my trust.
- I'm still thinking about you.

1786
01:31:43,030 --> 01:31:44,799
This has nothing to do with earning my trust.

1787
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:47,029
If you truly want us to get back together,

1788
01:31:47,030 --> 01:31:49,500
I want to be the only person consuming your thoughts.

1789
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:55,409
I want you to think only about us getting back together.

1790
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:57,139
And that needs to be reflected in your action.

1791
01:31:57,140 --> 01:32:00,409
That way, I can consider getting back together with you.

1792
01:32:00,410 --> 01:32:01,849
That's my only focus.

1793
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:04,319
But how could you think about going on a date with her...

1794
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:07,020
and discussing these things with her?

1795
01:32:07,090 --> 01:32:09,519
If I were truly your top priority, you couldn't think like that.

1796
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:10,520
If I were you, I couldn't do that.

1797
01:32:10,521 --> 01:32:13,729
It's the opposite for me.

1798
01:32:13,730 --> 01:32:16,029
I'm not saying this because...

1799
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:17,460
(A disappointed sigh)

1800
01:32:19,030 --> 01:32:20,070
I don't know.

1801
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:23,740
Why did you sigh like that, Ji Yeon?

1802
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:25,970
- You...
- Are you smirking at me?

1803
01:32:26,710 --> 01:32:29,709
You were attracted to another girl only a day before.

1804
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:31,079
- And you're here...
- Then...

1805
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:32,349
telling me that you're sure?

1806
01:32:32,350 --> 01:32:35,179
You and I have a different idea of romantic attraction.

1807
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:36,549
Your heart fluttered for her.

1808
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:38,990
We went on a date, so of course, that happened.

1809
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:45,929
If I were you, I would think that...

1810
01:32:45,930 --> 01:32:47,560
you would have stronger feelings for me.

1811
01:32:48,530 --> 01:32:50,059
I could have gotten to know...

1812
01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:53,570
That's not the kind of trust I want.

1813
01:32:53,770 --> 01:32:55,439
- But I can't lie.
- I...

1814
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:57,340
You know what? Just lie to me then.

1815
01:32:58,910 --> 01:33:00,469
How could I lie to you?

1816
01:33:00,470 --> 01:33:02,810
When it comes to things like this, you should just lie.

1817
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:05,649
Tell me... "I went on a date with Min Kyung the day before."

1818
01:33:05,650 --> 01:33:07,309
"But I didn't feel anything toward her."

1819
01:33:07,310 --> 01:33:10,620
"I could only think about you." Tell me like that.

1820
01:33:12,950 --> 01:33:15,189
But you said, "I went on a date with Min Kyung the day before."

1821
01:33:15,190 --> 01:33:16,920
"There were moments when my heart fluttered."

1822
01:33:18,630 --> 01:33:19,860
Not that.

1823
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:23,530
Only then it makes sense to me.

1824
01:33:24,230 --> 01:33:25,799
- Okay.
- You'll focus on your date again.

1825
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:27,499
Then your heart will flutter again.

1826
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:29,040
- I told you I'd tell her.
- When you focus...

1827
01:33:29,170 --> 01:33:31,099
- I told you I'd tell her.
- your date, your heart flutters.

1828
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:32,869
It's not about that. I told her I'd tell her tomorrow.

1829
01:33:32,870 --> 01:33:34,339
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

1830
01:33:34,340 --> 01:33:36,340
I didn't want you to misunderstand it.

1831
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:37,979
Min Kyung was the one who chose me for tomorrow's date.

1832
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:39,409
I didn't want you to get the wrong idea.

1833
01:33:39,410 --> 01:33:41,079
This was my plan, and I wanted to share it with you.

1834
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:42,680
This is what I'm trying to tell you.

1835
01:33:43,850 --> 01:33:44,850
Okay.

1836
01:33:47,620 --> 01:33:49,760
Did you pick the keyword for the date knowing it was hers?

1837
01:33:50,220 --> 01:33:51,959
Min Kyung was the only one I wanted for my date.

1838
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,190
I didn't want to go on a date with anyone else.

1839
01:33:53,530 --> 01:33:55,160
Min Kyung was the only one you wanted?

1840
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:56,960
I thought it was her keyword.

1841
01:33:58,670 --> 01:33:59,700
I see.

1842
01:34:04,270 --> 01:34:05,370
Where are you going?

1843
01:34:12,510 --> 01:34:13,610
I really have no idea.

1844
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:25,460
(A misunderstanding deepens as their feelings don't align.)

1845
01:34:25,730 --> 01:34:27,429
I can understand what Woo Jin's trying to say.

1846
01:34:27,430 --> 01:34:29,199
Despite the romantic attraction he felt on the dates,

1847
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:31,399
he's choosing Ji Yeon at the end.

1848
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:32,770
That was the point he wanted to make.

1849
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:34,670
- That was the point.
- Yes.

1850
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:36,269
- Not mentioning romantic...
- Right.

1851
01:34:36,270 --> 01:34:38,039
- attraction could've been better.
- Right.

1852
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:39,509
- "I went on a date with Min Kyung." - Yes.

1853
01:34:39,510 --> 01:34:40,569
"But I thought of you instead."

1854
01:34:40,570 --> 01:34:41,609
- "I like you more." - Right.

1855
01:34:41,610 --> 01:34:42,639
- He should've said that instead.
- Totally.

1856
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:44,279
If he wanted to get back with her, he should've kept it neat.

1857
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:46,149
- "I could only think about you." - Right.

1858
01:34:46,150 --> 01:34:48,379
- He didn't need to say that.
- He was too honest.

1859
01:34:48,380 --> 01:34:49,449
He was way too honest.

1860
01:34:49,450 --> 01:34:51,989
- Honesty isn't needed all the time.
- Right.

1861
01:34:51,990 --> 01:34:54,190
But I didn't expect this from Ji Yeon.

1862
01:34:54,250 --> 01:34:55,859
- Right.
- Same here.

1863
01:34:55,860 --> 01:34:58,159
- It was unexpected.
- I was surprised by her more.

1864
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:00,759
I thought she had zero interest in getting back together with him.

1865
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:02,160
But after watching this...

1866
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:04,729
"Only have feelings for me. Have eyes only for me."

1867
01:35:04,730 --> 01:35:07,269
"Give me more love. I want more from you."

1868
01:35:07,270 --> 01:35:08,739
That's what she was saying.

1869
01:35:08,740 --> 01:35:12,470
- I thought it was unexpected.
- I was quite surprised too.

1870
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:14,839
- So I'm a bit shocked.
- Really?

1871
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:16,679
Did you think that she wanted to get back together with him?

1872
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:19,310
Yes. I mean, she likes Won Kyu.

1873
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:21,850
But I think she keeps pushing away Woo Jin...

1874
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:23,949
- Yes.
- because she still has feelings.

1875
01:35:23,950 --> 01:35:25,019
- So it means the opposite?
- Yes.

1876
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:26,089
- A strong denial means...
- Yes.

1877
01:35:26,090 --> 01:35:29,520
- an affirmation.
- That's how I saw it.

1878
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,759
- This is beautiful.
- Yes.

1879
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:35,060
(Jae Hyeong and Hyeon Ji are sitting out on the terrace.)

1880
01:35:36,060 --> 01:35:37,400
How do you feel now?

1881
01:35:38,030 --> 01:35:39,300
Should I not address you like that?

1882
01:35:39,670 --> 01:35:41,529
No. That's fine. Why do you ask?

1883
01:35:41,530 --> 01:35:42,570
Nothing.

1884
01:35:43,870 --> 01:35:45,970
- I wanted to talk to you once more.
- Really?

1885
01:35:47,140 --> 01:35:49,640
So you're already interested in someone, right?

1886
01:35:51,910 --> 01:35:53,149
I can openly say who it is now, right?

1887
01:35:53,150 --> 01:35:54,780
- It's Yoo Sik.
- Yes.

1888
01:35:55,850 --> 01:35:57,520
Can I ask you where your feelings are at?

1889
01:35:59,850 --> 01:36:02,620
I went on a lot of dates with Yoo Sik.

1890
01:36:03,260 --> 01:36:06,060
I learned that he was such a good person.

1891
01:36:06,230 --> 01:36:09,959
My feelings have grown compared to before.

1892
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:12,330
But I don't know how he feels.

1893
01:36:13,070 --> 01:36:15,600
But the thing about me is...

1894
01:36:16,370 --> 01:36:18,040
I'm sure you already know how I am.

1895
01:36:18,470 --> 01:36:20,070
- That you're a passive person?
- Yes.

1896
01:36:21,070 --> 01:36:22,840
Then you must've often developed romantic feelings...

1897
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,179
for someone you weren't interested in before...

1898
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:26,110
once they expressed their feelings.

1899
01:36:26,250 --> 01:36:27,609
That actually happened before.

1900
01:36:27,610 --> 01:36:30,580
- But that takes a long time for me.
- That's not easy.

1901
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:33,489
When you have problems or need...

1902
01:36:33,490 --> 01:36:34,650
- someone to talk to, - Yes.

1903
01:36:35,260 --> 01:36:37,059
- come find me. We can talk.
- Okay.

1904
01:36:37,060 --> 01:36:38,990
- It goes both ways.
- Sure.

1905
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:45,159
Whether or not I was interested in other people,

1906
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:47,370
I still wanted to talk to her.

1907
01:36:47,530 --> 01:36:48,969
I thought it was important to go on a date with her...

1908
01:36:48,970 --> 01:36:50,400
as soon as possible.

1909
01:36:53,010 --> 01:36:55,210
(Won Kyu and Yoo Sik came down to the 1st floor.)

1910
01:36:57,310 --> 01:36:58,980
I should ask them if we could join them.

1911
01:37:00,180 --> 01:37:01,380
They might say no.

1912
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:02,580
Sure.

1913
01:37:02,620 --> 01:37:04,220
If they say no, let's eat it in the living room.

1914
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:05,350
Okay.

1915
01:37:07,050 --> 01:37:08,220
Well...

1916
01:37:09,390 --> 01:37:12,389
Could we join you? If not, we'll go somewhere else.

1917
01:37:12,390 --> 01:37:14,160
- I want to talk to her in private.
- Okay.

1918
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:16,630
- What?
- He told us to go somewhere else.

1919
01:37:18,730 --> 01:37:20,930
(At that time, Baek Hyun came out to the terrace.)

1920
01:37:21,370 --> 01:37:22,470
Where were you?

1921
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:23,970
- I took a shower.
- Really?

1922
01:37:25,470 --> 01:37:27,040
What's going on with them? Why are they fighting?

1923
01:37:27,070 --> 01:37:28,470
I don't think they're fighting.

1924
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:31,879
Maybe, he's expressing his interest. To get to know her better.

1925
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:33,710
That's possible.

1926
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:37,050
When I asked him,

1927
01:37:37,780 --> 01:37:39,520
- he told me to give them privacy.
- He told you not to come?

1928
01:37:40,250 --> 01:37:41,320
Let's go.

1929
01:37:42,620 --> 01:37:45,220
I wanted to talk to her too, but Jae Hyeong got to her first.

1930
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:47,060
You can talk to her later.

1931
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:52,700
I have a personal question. Are you attracted to her?

1932
01:37:53,330 --> 01:37:54,569
- What do you mean?
- To Hyeon Ji...

1933
01:37:54,570 --> 01:37:56,500
Are there moments she makes your heart flutter?

1934
01:37:57,140 --> 01:37:58,810
Does she make your heart flutter when you go on a date?

1935
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:02,439
- Me?
- That's why this happened, right?

1936
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:03,610
What are you talking about?

1937
01:38:04,310 --> 01:38:06,079
Would there be? I shouldn't have asked, right?

1938
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:07,850
- What?
- I shouldn't have asked, right?

1939
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:11,480
I'm really rooting for you. I mean it.

1940
01:38:12,290 --> 01:38:13,990
Gosh, having two exes...

1941
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:17,359
I mean, she seemed so uneasy...

1942
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:19,230
when we were coming here.

1943
01:38:19,990 --> 01:38:21,489
- "Can we not go?" - She said that?

1944
01:38:21,490 --> 01:38:23,199
- Yes.
- She must've felt uncomfortable.

1945
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:24,529
- What?
- She must've felt uncomfortable.

1946
01:38:24,530 --> 01:38:26,570
Everyone was going to find out she had two exes here.

1947
01:38:27,670 --> 01:38:28,700
But...

1948
01:38:30,370 --> 01:38:32,810
- we didn't have a serious talk.
- You and Hyeon Ji?

1949
01:38:32,910 --> 01:38:35,680
I don't mean a serious conversation about us.

1950
01:38:35,740 --> 01:38:37,909
We didn't have a serious conversation...

1951
01:38:37,910 --> 01:38:39,309
- about our exes.
- You and Hyeon Ji?

1952
01:38:39,310 --> 01:38:41,710
- I didn't ask her on purpose.
- Really?

1953
01:38:41,810 --> 01:38:43,249
But she must like you.

1954
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:44,650
She keeps expressing her interest in you.

1955
01:38:47,350 --> 01:38:48,989
Just follow your heart.

1956
01:38:48,990 --> 01:38:51,060
Ask me if you have any questions. The secret is out.

1957
01:38:51,390 --> 01:38:54,230
- Right. Do that with my ex too.
- Everyone knows.

1958
01:38:54,330 --> 01:38:56,530
- Don't walk on eggshells.
- I...

1959
01:38:56,730 --> 01:38:57,829
Ask us if you have any questions.

1960
01:38:57,830 --> 01:38:59,199
- When we were coming here...
- Yes.

1961
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:00,669
But Jae Hyeong stole her from me.

1962
01:39:00,670 --> 01:39:04,740
Let me go talk to Jae Hyeong. "Hey, read the room. Go away."

1963
01:39:05,070 --> 01:39:06,509
- So...
- They're still talking.

1964
01:39:06,510 --> 01:39:08,469
What's going on? What are they talking about?

1965
01:39:08,470 --> 01:39:09,939
I guess Jae Hyeong also likes her.

1966
01:39:09,940 --> 01:39:10,940
Really?

1967
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:13,249
Just tell me this.

1968
01:39:13,250 --> 01:39:14,780
- What?
- Did you pick me for her?

1969
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:15,950
I see.

1970
01:39:17,380 --> 01:39:19,650
I didn't think it'd be me.

1971
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:21,520
- What do you mean?
- When he said my name.

1972
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:23,420
- Oh, right.
- So...

1973
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:26,429
I just asked her right away.

1974
01:39:26,430 --> 01:39:28,130
As soon as we went inside,

1975
01:39:29,030 --> 01:39:32,930
I asked her whom she wanted for her date.

1976
01:39:33,330 --> 01:39:35,940
After that, we were talking about our relationship.

1977
01:39:36,340 --> 01:39:38,600
But our talk didn't go so well.

1978
01:39:39,370 --> 01:39:42,940
Toward the end, I asked her whom she wanted for her date.

1979
01:39:43,710 --> 01:39:45,409
She said your name.

1980
01:39:45,410 --> 01:39:47,080
So I said I would pick you.

1981
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:50,720
So you're going on two dates?

1982
01:39:50,980 --> 01:39:52,420
- Probably.
- Probably.

1983
01:39:52,990 --> 01:39:54,750
- You're busy.
- I should go to sleep early.

1984
01:39:56,120 --> 01:39:57,219
I should keep you up.

1985
01:39:57,220 --> 01:39:58,560
- Me?
- Yes.

1986
01:39:59,490 --> 01:40:03,059
How many people must I be careful around with?

1987
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:04,230
You...

1988
01:40:04,530 --> 01:40:06,230
Be careful around me first.

1989
01:40:08,230 --> 01:40:09,339
- But...
- You must be careful...

1990
01:40:09,340 --> 01:40:10,369
around men and women.

1991
01:40:10,370 --> 01:40:12,810
Yes. To be honest,

1992
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:14,839
I was a bit worried about him too.

1993
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:18,479
Before Hyeon Ji joined, I went on a date with his ex.

1994
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:20,480
- Wait. So...
- Just go on a date with them.

1995
01:40:20,780 --> 01:40:22,549
Well, things could change.

1996
01:40:22,550 --> 01:40:25,379
Between Hyeon Ji and Ji Hyeon,

1997
01:40:25,380 --> 01:40:26,790
whom are you more attracted to?

1998
01:40:27,350 --> 01:40:28,520
If you don't want to answer, don't.

1999
01:40:29,790 --> 01:40:31,420
- Seriously.
- I think it's Hyeon Ji.

2000
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:34,130
- I have no idea.
- It's Hyeon Ji, come on.

2001
01:40:38,030 --> 01:40:40,070
Well, I did want to ask you.

2002
01:40:40,370 --> 01:40:42,669
(Ji Hyeon came for Won Kyu.)

2003
01:40:42,670 --> 01:40:44,840
I'm going to borrow him for a moment.

2004
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:55,109
She always shows up at the craziest timing.

2005
01:40:55,110 --> 01:40:57,150
Her timing is crazy. That was insane.

2006
01:40:57,180 --> 01:40:59,719
Yes. This is what I like after the ex reveal.

2007
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:01,349
- They can openly talk now.
- Just like that. Yes.

2008
01:41:01,350 --> 01:41:03,059
They can get their ex and talk.

2009
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:04,959
- "Let me borrow him." - That hit the spot.

2010
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:06,060
- I like this.
- Yes.

2011
01:41:08,260 --> 01:41:09,500
Did Hyeon Ji go upstairs?

2012
01:41:09,830 --> 01:41:11,400
- Hyeon Ji? I don't know.
- Yes.

2013
01:41:13,330 --> 01:41:14,770
Yes. You can ask her questions.

2014
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:17,399
- But...
- Can you tell me too?

2015
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:18,400
Tell you what?

2016
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:22,110
How she feels. I'm not sure.

2017
01:41:22,310 --> 01:41:25,040
I thought I clearly heard what she wanted.

2018
01:41:25,410 --> 01:41:27,210
That she wasn't interested in getting back together.

2019
01:41:27,650 --> 01:41:30,279
But she made it sound like that wasn't true.

2020
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:31,720
So I'm going to ask her.

2021
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:33,249
- I'm confused too.
- Yes.

2022
01:41:33,250 --> 01:41:34,690
- I want to ask her about that.
- By the way...

2023
01:41:37,490 --> 01:41:38,889
- You were there.
- What?

2024
01:41:38,890 --> 01:41:40,890
- You were there.
- When?

2025
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:44,000
(In Hyeon Ji's Talking Room)

2026
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:45,230
Yes, I was.

2027
01:41:45,570 --> 01:41:47,900
She said she wasn't interested in getting back with her ex.

2028
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:49,469
Yes, that's what she said.

2029
01:41:49,470 --> 01:41:50,969
- She did, right?
- She said that.

2030
01:41:50,970 --> 01:41:52,309
- That's what she said.
- So...

2031
01:41:52,310 --> 01:41:54,139
I was really angry back then.

2032
01:41:54,140 --> 01:41:55,409
- She said she didn't want that.
- Yes.

2033
01:41:55,410 --> 01:41:58,080
But she couldn't be sure if her ex expressed his interest.

2034
01:41:58,340 --> 01:41:59,380
That's what she said precisely.

2035
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:00,880
(Yoo Sik and Baek Hyun came into Hyeon Ji's Talking Room.)

2036
01:42:00,881 --> 01:42:04,720
If your ex were to say he wanted to get back together,

2037
01:42:05,180 --> 01:42:06,450
how would you feel?

2038
01:42:06,950 --> 01:42:11,560
I don't think expressing his interest once would do anything.

2039
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:17,900
(I think how he behaves would affect my feelings for now.)

2040
01:42:18,930 --> 01:42:21,430
Because of what she said, I've been meaning...

2041
01:42:21,900 --> 01:42:23,240
to ask her.

2042
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:25,609
- So when we were talking...
- Yes.

2043
01:42:25,610 --> 01:42:27,570
- in her Talking Room, - Yes.

2044
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:30,079
She did say that if her ex said he wanted...

2045
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:32,140
to get back together, she couldn't be sure.

2046
01:42:32,780 --> 01:42:34,349
So after hearing that,

2047
01:42:34,350 --> 01:42:37,120
she and I talked at the entrance...

2048
01:42:37,650 --> 01:42:39,390
at that night.

2049
01:42:39,690 --> 01:42:43,559
She confused me by behaving vaguely at the entrance.

2050
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:46,590
So I already heard what she said in the room.

2051
01:42:47,130 --> 01:42:48,130
That night,

2052
01:42:48,930 --> 01:42:51,430
she made it sound like she wanted to get back together.

2053
01:42:52,330 --> 01:42:54,570
I said, "You're two-faced."

2054
01:42:54,670 --> 01:42:56,240
She said, "Why am I two-faced?"

2055
01:42:56,440 --> 01:42:57,770
I couldn't tell her why.

2056
01:42:58,340 --> 01:43:00,669
- You...
- I asked if she wanted to get back.

2057
01:43:00,670 --> 01:43:02,810
- Don't talk about her like that.
- Don't?

2058
01:43:04,410 --> 01:43:06,949
I don't want to be biased about her.

2059
01:43:06,950 --> 01:43:08,479
- Right.
- I don't want that.

2060
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:10,819
I think she wants something from me.

2061
01:43:10,820 --> 01:43:13,320
I don't know what it is. I don't know if she remembers it.

2062
01:43:17,790 --> 01:43:20,759
- So...
- You should ask her.

2063
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:23,899
I don't want to have an answer before asking her.

2064
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:25,460
- So I don't want to get into that.
- Right.

2065
01:43:26,570 --> 01:43:30,140
(Yoo Sik decides to stop listening to Baek Hyun.)

2066
01:43:32,170 --> 01:43:35,110
If I keep on listening to Baek Hyun,

2067
01:43:36,010 --> 01:43:37,979
I was afraid I might have a biased view about her.

2068
01:43:37,980 --> 01:43:40,579
I tried my best to avoid seeing his facial expression.

2069
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:44,450
I told him not to tell me about what happened between them.

2070
01:43:45,050 --> 01:43:46,819
(Did the conversation with Baek Hyun bother you?)

2071
01:43:46,820 --> 01:43:49,189
It didn't affect how I felt about her.

2072
01:43:49,190 --> 01:43:52,789
I just wanted to have an honest conversation with her about it.

2073
01:43:52,790 --> 01:43:54,130
(He's curious about Hyeon Ji's feelings.)

2074
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:55,589
The conversation from the Talking Room...

2075
01:43:55,590 --> 01:43:56,829
is still affecting them in Japan.

2076
01:43:56,830 --> 01:43:59,230
By the way, Yoo Sik was so wise about it.

2077
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:01,229
- Right.
- He should hear it from her.

2078
01:44:01,230 --> 01:44:02,870
Hearing from her will be the clearest.

2079
01:44:02,970 --> 01:44:04,999
But why does Baek Hyun...

2080
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,639
still have questions about that conversation?

2081
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:09,879
Let's say Hyeon Ji is leaning more toward getting back together.

2082
01:44:09,880 --> 01:44:11,709
Will he start pursuing her then?

2083
01:44:11,710 --> 01:44:14,009
- Well...
- I think he might consider that.

2084
01:44:14,010 --> 01:44:16,149
He says he's firm about not getting back together.

2085
01:44:16,150 --> 01:44:18,349
But looking at how he tried to comfort her...

2086
01:44:18,350 --> 01:44:19,690
and the way he behaved around her,

2087
01:44:19,790 --> 01:44:21,590
it's always been confusing.

2088
01:44:21,690 --> 01:44:24,389
Even to Yoo Sik, "Ask. Ask for me."

2089
01:44:24,390 --> 01:44:27,159
- Right.
- I think saying it...

2090
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:30,400
has a meaning to it.

2091
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:32,469
When Yoo Sik hears it,

2092
01:44:32,470 --> 01:44:34,329
how could he not have a change of heart?

2093
01:44:34,330 --> 01:44:36,969
- Right.
- He did a good job of cutting it.

2094
01:44:36,970 --> 01:44:37,999
Yoo Sik made a right choice.

2095
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,310
- Right. Yoo Sik did a good job...
- That'll create a misunderstanding.

2096
01:44:42,980 --> 01:44:47,010
(Yoo Sik walks to Hyeon Ji's room.)

2097
01:44:50,020 --> 01:44:51,950
- Who is it?
- Hi.

2098
01:44:56,220 --> 01:44:57,220
Did you shower?

2099
01:44:59,130 --> 01:45:01,060
- Anyone in your room?
- No.

2100
01:45:02,290 --> 01:45:04,100
I'll meet you there.

2101
01:45:04,930 --> 01:45:06,330
Aren't you going to take this inside?

2102
01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:09,000
Oh, please. Wait.

2103
01:45:10,970 --> 01:45:12,070
You have two.

2104
01:45:13,510 --> 01:45:14,510
Seriously.

2105
01:45:22,620 --> 01:45:24,150
You can just come in.

2106
01:45:26,650 --> 01:45:28,090
Why is it so cold in here?

2107
01:45:28,450 --> 01:45:29,460
Is it cold?

2108
01:45:30,460 --> 01:45:31,920
(On eggshells)

2109
01:45:36,860 --> 01:45:38,299
What's so funny?

2110
01:45:38,300 --> 01:45:40,070
(The aftermath of revealing the ex is still huge.)

2111
01:45:40,770 --> 01:45:41,930
Oh, that's why...

2112
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:49,480
Do you see why I was disturbed today?

2113
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:50,680
Yes.

2114
01:45:51,010 --> 01:45:52,340
Gosh.

2115
01:46:02,690 --> 01:46:04,760
Did you talk to both of them?

2116
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:07,830
Baek Hyun and Seung Yong?

2117
01:46:08,990 --> 01:46:10,959
- About choosing the date?
- Yes.

2118
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:14,600
Baek Hyun asked me who I wanted to go with.

2119
01:46:14,700 --> 01:46:15,730
So I told him,

2120
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:16,999
"Don't you already know?"

2121
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:20,770
"There's only one person I'm interested in."

2122
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:23,709
"Okay. I'll choose Yoo Sik."

2123
01:46:23,710 --> 01:46:25,710
That's what happened.

2124
01:46:29,950 --> 01:46:32,120
Seung Yong probably had his opinion too.

2125
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:37,660
- I...
- Oh, seriously.

2126
01:46:38,990 --> 01:46:41,030
What is this? A drama?

2127
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:43,800
I...

2128
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:48,800
What was I going to say? Everything is so crazy.

2129
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:56,440
I...

2130
01:46:58,040 --> 01:46:59,850
I just wanted to ask.

2131
01:47:01,310 --> 01:47:02,310
Ask what?

2132
01:47:02,410 --> 01:47:05,450
In the end, there are two.

2133
01:47:07,490 --> 01:47:11,260
I expected there to be regrets.

2134
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:13,259
- Me?
- Yes.

2135
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:15,960
At least toward one of them.

2136
01:47:16,860 --> 01:47:21,570
Because I noticed you were worried since this morning.

2137
01:47:22,070 --> 01:47:23,770
When I heard you were going home.

2138
01:47:24,770 --> 01:47:28,039
I was worried because...

2139
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:29,540
of you.

2140
01:47:33,050 --> 01:47:35,280
Because if you found out,

2141
01:47:36,220 --> 01:47:39,050
you'd never ever...

2142
01:47:39,290 --> 01:47:42,320
express your feelings anymore.

2143
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:43,720
That's what I said.

2144
01:47:44,360 --> 01:47:46,860
But what stops me from doing that after finding out?

2145
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:50,960
But...

2146
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:53,400
before coming here,

2147
01:47:54,570 --> 01:47:59,140
my highest priority was Baek Hyun.

2148
01:48:01,340 --> 01:48:03,610
Is it a quirk of fate between me and Baek Hyun?

2149
01:48:05,710 --> 01:48:07,879
Before coming here,

2150
01:48:07,880 --> 01:48:10,280
aside from reuniting,

2151
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:13,389
Baek Hyun was...

2152
01:48:13,390 --> 01:48:15,190
- my highest priority.
- Okay.

2153
01:48:16,460 --> 01:48:19,560
So I had my priorities.

2154
01:48:20,430 --> 01:48:23,130
But now you're my highest priority.

2155
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:35,709
- He's excited.
- He's embarrassed.

2156
01:48:35,710 --> 01:48:38,439
Yoo Sik, say it's crazy. It's time to say it.

2157
01:48:38,440 --> 01:48:39,810
- "It's crazy." - "This is crazy."

2158
01:48:40,210 --> 01:48:41,449
It's driving me crazy.

2159
01:48:41,450 --> 01:48:44,379
- She's coming clean.
- Yes.

2160
01:48:44,380 --> 01:48:45,750
That's good.

2161
01:48:47,090 --> 01:48:49,990
So I had my priorities.

2162
01:48:51,090 --> 01:48:53,660
But now you're my highest priority.

2163
01:49:00,330 --> 01:49:03,770
Am I giving you pressure?

2164
01:49:05,300 --> 01:49:06,839
Is this pressuring?

2165
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:08,170
Why would it be?

2166
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:10,410
Anyway, that's how I feel.

2167
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:14,410
After seeing you today,

2168
01:49:14,510 --> 01:49:16,550
my emotions have settled.

2169
01:49:17,450 --> 01:49:20,419
He probably knows because when I was choosing a date,

2170
01:49:20,420 --> 01:49:23,290
I firmly said your name.

2171
01:49:25,460 --> 01:49:26,930
- I...
- To Baek Hyun?

2172
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:28,590
No, to both of them.

2173
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:31,230
- Gosh.
- There's no one else...

2174
01:49:31,430 --> 01:49:32,970
I want to get to know.

2175
01:49:33,070 --> 01:49:35,170
I was like, "You know it's Yoo Sik."

2176
01:49:37,100 --> 01:49:39,770
"You know it's Yoo Sik."

2177
01:49:40,710 --> 01:49:42,070
I actually felt relieved.

2178
01:49:42,510 --> 01:49:45,540
After coming here, I realized...

2179
01:49:46,010 --> 01:49:47,979
I shouldn't be so proud...

2180
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:50,080
when it comes to expressing my feelings,

2181
01:49:50,180 --> 01:49:53,050
and I should express myself.

2182
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:56,889
Until now, I couldn't make up my mind...

2183
01:49:56,890 --> 01:50:00,030
and didn't realize what I wanted.

2184
01:50:00,390 --> 01:50:02,159
To be honest, throughout my whole life,

2185
01:50:02,160 --> 01:50:04,459
I didn't realize what I wanted.

2186
01:50:04,460 --> 01:50:08,169
I wasn't honest about my feelings.

2187
01:50:08,170 --> 01:50:12,199
But now, I want to focus...

2188
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:13,770
on the person I'm interested in.

2189
01:50:14,740 --> 01:50:16,110
Are you okay?

2190
01:50:16,740 --> 01:50:18,140
- What about me?
- Well...

2191
01:50:19,680 --> 01:50:21,950
How do you feel about Ji Hyeon?

2192
01:50:22,550 --> 01:50:23,580
Ji Hyeon?

2193
01:50:25,420 --> 01:50:27,650
Actually, I've talked to...

2194
01:50:27,850 --> 01:50:30,060
Ji Hyeon before.

2195
01:50:31,020 --> 01:50:33,089
In a way, Won Kyu and Ji Hyeon...

2196
01:50:33,090 --> 01:50:35,290
discussed today...

2197
01:50:35,690 --> 01:50:38,899
and picked me.

2198
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:41,130
That's what Won Kyu said.

2199
01:50:42,770 --> 01:50:45,870
But I haven't talked to her about it.

2200
01:50:47,240 --> 01:50:48,970
Why she chose you?

2201
01:50:50,740 --> 01:50:52,410
I don't know the reason.

2202
01:50:54,010 --> 01:50:55,649
I meant to ask her.

2203
01:50:55,650 --> 01:50:57,680
(Yoo Sik's curious about her reason.)

2204
01:50:58,450 --> 01:51:00,550
Ji Hyeon requested a date first.

2205
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:04,060
Didn't you go on a date twice with Ji Hyeon?

2206
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:07,060
Two or three times.

2207
01:51:07,860 --> 01:51:08,860
That's a lot.

2208
01:51:10,260 --> 01:51:12,660
This is crazy. Maybe I shouldn't say anything.

2209
01:51:14,900 --> 01:51:16,640
You didn't...

2210
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:19,710
text me a lot.

2211
01:51:19,810 --> 01:51:21,670
You sent it to Ji Hyeon.

2212
01:51:23,540 --> 01:51:26,350
No wonder. In the room, Min Kyung and I...

2213
01:51:26,610 --> 01:51:31,019
I was like, "Who's getting the most texts?"

2214
01:51:31,020 --> 01:51:32,920
Ji Hyeon didn't say anything.

2215
01:51:38,260 --> 01:51:41,459
- He's... He's twisting his body.
- He's embarrassed.

2216
01:51:41,460 --> 01:51:43,329
Neither of them is looking at each other.

2217
01:51:43,330 --> 01:51:45,499
I don't know. I just want to get in there and remove the cushions.

2218
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:47,929
Remove those cushions. Why do they keep covering their faces?

2219
01:51:47,930 --> 01:51:49,839
Why are they covering their faces? That's what we have to see.

2220
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:51,439
- That's...
- The embarrassed look on faces.

2221
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:54,310
- Anyway, the vibe is different.
- It's evident.

2222
01:51:54,410 --> 01:51:55,439
When one is embarrassed...

2223
01:51:55,440 --> 01:51:57,739
and likes someone so much,

2224
01:51:57,740 --> 01:51:59,649
- one starts to twist his body.
- They're both doing that.

2225
01:51:59,650 --> 01:52:01,379
They're both twisting.

2226
01:52:01,380 --> 01:52:03,119
- They're covering their faces.
- Up to here.

2227
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:04,179
It's crazy.

2228
01:52:04,180 --> 01:52:07,250
And she said, "You're my highest priority."

2229
01:52:07,890 --> 01:52:09,959
You'd get nervous to hear it...

2230
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:11,260
from the person you like. It's exciting.

2231
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:13,889
Oh, there it is.

2232
01:52:13,890 --> 01:52:14,930
(Won Kyu and Ji Hyeon are sitting on the outside bench.)

2233
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:16,400
Why did you cry so much?

2234
01:52:17,200 --> 01:52:19,630
Because of the way you talk.

2235
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:22,070
It didn't make sense to you?

2236
01:52:22,970 --> 01:52:24,500
Of course, it didn't.

2237
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:26,570
Do you not get it even a little?

2238
01:52:28,740 --> 01:52:30,240
- No.
- Really?

2239
01:52:32,710 --> 01:52:35,180
I'm sorry, but what you said in my room earlier...

2240
01:52:35,550 --> 01:52:38,150
didn't make sense at all.

2241
01:52:39,790 --> 01:52:42,220
It sounded like nothing but a criticism toward me.

2242
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:44,960
"You're at fault for the reason we broke up."

2243
01:52:46,230 --> 01:52:48,259
- No.
- "You kept saying..."

2244
01:52:48,260 --> 01:52:50,130
"you'd go on a trip and made things unstable."

2245
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:52,970
"You're at fault..."

2246
01:52:53,370 --> 01:52:54,730
"for not understanding my emotions."

2247
01:52:54,830 --> 01:52:56,699
Honestly, I don't get why...

2248
01:52:56,700 --> 01:52:58,140
you brought up what happened in the past.

2249
01:52:58,440 --> 01:52:59,909
You also brought up what happened in the past...

2250
01:52:59,910 --> 01:53:02,240
and said my love was not sincere.

2251
01:53:02,370 --> 01:53:03,580
What's that supposed to mean?

2252
01:53:03,980 --> 01:53:05,579
You're talking like...

2253
01:53:05,580 --> 01:53:07,449
I didn't love you at all.

2254
01:53:07,450 --> 01:53:08,949
Why are you angry...

2255
01:53:08,950 --> 01:53:10,620
about how I felt?

2256
01:53:11,020 --> 01:53:12,349
Okay. I get it.

2257
01:53:12,350 --> 01:53:14,950
Then why don't you understand how I felt?

2258
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:19,389
- I...
- I'm saying you have no right...

2259
01:53:19,390 --> 01:53:20,890
- to say that I was wrong.
- No right?

2260
01:53:21,630 --> 01:53:22,889
Have I ever said,

2261
01:53:22,890 --> 01:53:25,599
"You treated me like you didn't love me sincerely."

2262
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:28,700
"So you need to apologize?"

2263
01:53:29,430 --> 01:53:30,539
I chose a keyword,

2264
01:53:30,540 --> 01:53:33,039
and that appeared in front of your eyes a few times.

2265
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:34,940
I wasn't telling you to apologize to me.

2266
01:53:35,240 --> 01:53:37,309
That's just how I felt.

2267
01:53:37,310 --> 01:53:39,710
- Just by saying that...
- Then why did you say that to me?

2268
01:53:39,980 --> 01:53:42,880
This situation is already...

2269
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:45,379
too much to handle.

2270
01:53:45,380 --> 01:53:47,750
You think I can handle this? What are you saying?

2271
01:53:48,520 --> 01:53:51,959
I know this is too much to handle for both of us.

2272
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:54,089
But you have no right...

2273
01:53:54,090 --> 01:53:56,529
to nitpick at me that I called you insincere over...

2274
01:53:56,530 --> 01:53:58,830
what we said when we broke up.

2275
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:01,070
We broke up already.

2276
01:54:01,770 --> 01:54:02,770
I didn't tell you to break up with me.

2277
01:54:02,771 --> 01:54:05,540
If I ended it and said your love was insincere, I'd be ridiculous.

2278
01:54:06,170 --> 01:54:07,610
Then...

2279
01:54:08,710 --> 01:54:10,339
If we're talking about...

2280
01:54:10,340 --> 01:54:11,979
how we broke up,

2281
01:54:11,980 --> 01:54:14,409
- are you...
- Wait.

2282
01:54:14,410 --> 01:54:16,280
Sorry about cutting you off.

2283
01:54:18,250 --> 01:54:20,290
Let's stop talking about our breakup.

2284
01:54:21,450 --> 01:54:23,160
Then what do you want to talk about?

2285
01:54:23,220 --> 01:54:25,219
I brought it up because I thought...

2286
01:54:25,220 --> 01:54:27,429
- we should talk about it.
- Why should we?

2287
01:54:27,430 --> 01:54:28,860
Okay. Then what do you want to talk about?

2288
01:54:32,300 --> 01:54:33,929
So you don't...

2289
01:54:33,930 --> 01:54:35,829
plan to get back with me...

2290
01:54:35,830 --> 01:54:37,070
No. Listen.

2291
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:38,900
Listen to me.

2292
01:54:39,810 --> 01:54:40,870
Tell me.

2293
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:43,080
You just cut me off too.

2294
01:54:43,340 --> 01:54:44,380
Tell me.

2295
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:48,080
Do you remember the last thing I said in the room?

2296
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:51,320
I expected you to change.

2297
01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:54,250
But I confirmed...

2298
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:57,459
that you haven't changed at all...

2299
01:54:57,460 --> 01:55:00,060
in terms of why we broke up.

2300
01:55:01,160 --> 01:55:02,930
Only back then.

2301
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:06,729
- You said you still think that way.
- If I go back to that time now,

2302
01:55:06,730 --> 01:55:08,070
I'd still think the same way.

2303
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:12,670
Exactly. So I thought you hadn't changed.

2304
01:55:13,110 --> 01:55:16,239
- If I hadn't changed...
- From what I've seen,

2305
01:55:16,240 --> 01:55:17,440
you have no backbone.

2306
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:19,680
Seriously?

2307
01:55:20,110 --> 01:55:22,510
- That's unbelievable.
- You texted Ji Yeon.

2308
01:55:22,910 --> 01:55:25,320
- You think that has no backbone?
- Yes.

2309
01:55:25,880 --> 01:55:27,550
Can you tell me why that has no backbone?

2310
01:55:28,650 --> 01:55:32,419
Even though you went on a date to buy clothes with Ji Yeon,

2311
01:55:32,420 --> 01:55:33,459
- you thought about me, - I did.

2312
01:55:33,460 --> 01:55:34,929
- so you texted me.
- Yes.

2313
01:55:34,930 --> 01:55:38,030
And today, after coming to Japan, you texted her again.

2314
01:55:38,260 --> 01:55:41,070
And now you come to my room and say,

2315
01:55:42,570 --> 01:55:45,239
"You're also at fault for our breakup."

2316
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:48,169
"Because you had to study, when we had to move toward our future,"

2317
01:55:48,170 --> 01:55:50,139
"you wanted to go on a trip."

2318
01:55:50,140 --> 01:55:51,409
"When I got an acting offer,"

2319
01:55:51,410 --> 01:55:53,649
"I was anxious to see you wobbling."

2320
01:55:53,650 --> 01:55:54,680
What is that...

2321
01:55:56,550 --> 01:55:59,350
- Still... No.
- Do you not understand that at all?

2322
01:55:59,680 --> 01:56:02,820
That can never be a reason to break up.

2323
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:06,160
- I think you...
- That's your side.

2324
01:56:06,390 --> 01:56:08,360
- made one mistake.
- What's that?

2325
01:56:09,590 --> 01:56:11,200
That you wanted to break up.

2326
01:56:12,100 --> 01:56:15,369
Because I said I wanted to break up,

2327
01:56:15,370 --> 01:56:18,399
did my love feel like it meant nothing?

2328
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:20,540
At the time,

2329
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:23,070
I started over...

2330
01:56:24,110 --> 01:56:26,380
from the thought why you dated me in the first place.

2331
01:56:27,650 --> 01:56:30,150
You probably know how much I cherished you.

2332
01:56:31,350 --> 01:56:33,819
That's not the point. We broke up.

2333
01:56:33,820 --> 01:56:37,590
Why does it matter that you cherished me?

2334
01:56:37,990 --> 01:56:40,329
You used me when you needed me. And when you didn't need me anymore,

2335
01:56:40,330 --> 01:56:43,430
you left me because I was an eyesore.

2336
01:56:45,400 --> 01:56:47,570
Don't you understand why I feel this way?

2337
01:56:48,770 --> 01:56:50,870
That's who you are.

2338
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:54,140
If I'm not useful...

2339
01:56:55,540 --> 01:56:57,479
or socially recognized...

2340
01:56:57,480 --> 01:56:58,710
You're unbelievable.

2341
01:57:00,110 --> 01:57:02,180
Isn't that what you always said?

2342
01:57:02,410 --> 01:57:04,250
I never said that before.

2343
01:57:04,420 --> 01:57:06,020
You made me feel that way.

2344
01:57:06,690 --> 01:57:08,750
It's just in your head.

2345
01:57:08,820 --> 01:57:12,320
Am I deluded for feeling this way?

2346
01:57:13,060 --> 01:57:15,189
Am I overreacting...

2347
01:57:15,190 --> 01:57:16,899
- Even when I was sincere...
- Even though you knew...

2348
01:57:16,900 --> 01:57:19,700
I put a meaning into every word you say,

2349
01:57:20,070 --> 01:57:21,200
can you say like that?

2350
01:57:21,800 --> 01:57:22,929
"Kids doing PE."

2351
01:57:22,930 --> 01:57:25,140
"You're too old to just pursue your dream, Ji Hyeon."

2352
01:57:25,370 --> 01:57:27,769
"It's better for women..."

2353
01:57:27,770 --> 01:57:29,069
"to graduate from a university in Seoul."

2354
01:57:29,070 --> 01:57:30,779
- I said that?
- Yes.

2355
01:57:30,780 --> 01:57:31,910
- I did?
- Yes.

2356
01:57:32,510 --> 01:57:34,579
- You're just confused.
- In...

2357
01:57:34,580 --> 01:57:35,950
In a year,

2358
01:57:36,850 --> 01:57:39,050
you said I had to become an anchor.

2359
01:57:39,180 --> 01:57:41,189
You said you would.

2360
01:57:41,190 --> 01:57:43,150
You always said you would.

2361
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:45,819
- You said I had to.
- What is wrong with you?

2362
01:57:45,820 --> 01:57:46,959
Stop putting words into my mouth.

2363
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:49,390
When did I say that you had to graduate from a university in Seoul?

2364
01:57:50,130 --> 01:57:51,800
I never said that for once.

2365
01:57:57,340 --> 01:58:00,840
You just had that thought to yourself.

2366
01:58:01,740 --> 01:58:03,509
Why did I give you the clothes?

2367
01:58:03,510 --> 01:58:06,039
I only gave them to you because I support you whatever you do.

2368
01:58:06,040 --> 01:58:08,949
I don't know whether you're doing well or not.

2369
01:58:08,950 --> 01:58:10,220
Why are you supporting me?

2370
01:58:10,650 --> 01:58:12,580
Who are you to support me?

2371
01:58:13,790 --> 01:58:16,789
Why would you support me after hurting me?

2372
01:58:16,790 --> 01:58:19,090
Right. If you say that, I have nothing to say.

2373
01:58:22,260 --> 01:58:24,160
You gave another woman clothes.

2374
01:58:25,460 --> 01:58:28,629
Then you came to me and said you'd want to get back with me.

2375
01:58:28,630 --> 01:58:29,970
The way you act...

2376
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:33,070
doesn't make any sense.

2377
01:58:34,810 --> 01:58:36,270
"I've settled everything."

2378
01:58:36,710 --> 01:58:38,209
"I'll express my heart to you."

2379
01:58:38,210 --> 01:58:41,309
"I'll not make you misunderstand." That's what you said.

2380
01:58:41,310 --> 01:58:42,909
Right. It's okay to come to Japan with her...

2381
01:58:42,910 --> 01:58:44,820
since she chose you.

2382
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:48,690
Then you texted her again.

2383
01:58:49,190 --> 01:58:50,860
I don't know what you're doing...

2384
01:58:51,460 --> 01:58:53,460
when I'm right in front.

2385
01:58:54,030 --> 01:58:56,660
First of all, I had to...

2386
01:58:56,700 --> 01:58:57,930
show manners to the person I came here with.

2387
01:58:59,060 --> 01:59:00,100
And...

2388
01:59:00,830 --> 01:59:03,670
But why would you have those manners in front of me?

2389
01:59:04,040 --> 01:59:06,769
If you want to show manners that much, just see her.

2390
01:59:06,770 --> 01:59:09,670
I sent that after we talked.

2391
01:59:10,710 --> 01:59:12,340
I thought you really didn't...

2392
01:59:13,210 --> 01:59:14,550
think about me.

2393
01:59:16,410 --> 01:59:18,750
What am I supposed to think about you?

2394
01:59:20,350 --> 01:59:21,589
We broke up.

2395
01:59:21,590 --> 01:59:24,259
- But why did you...
- What do you think about me?

2396
01:59:24,260 --> 01:59:26,159
How were you thinking about me...

2397
01:59:26,160 --> 01:59:27,590
when you gave her the T-shirt?

2398
01:59:28,130 --> 01:59:32,559
Why did you let Ji Yeon say that the T-shirt was meaningful...

2399
01:59:32,560 --> 01:59:38,139
in front of everyone including me?

2400
01:59:38,140 --> 01:59:41,410
Honestly, that was my fault. I admit it.

2401
01:59:41,940 --> 01:59:44,210
- So I...
- Ji Yeon didn't take it, did she?

2402
01:59:45,410 --> 01:59:48,209
Ji Yeon asked for something, so I said...

2403
01:59:48,210 --> 01:59:49,410
Whatever.

2404
01:59:51,750 --> 01:59:53,490
You're changing your word again.

2405
01:59:53,990 --> 01:59:56,350
You said Ji Yeon took it.

2406
01:59:56,960 --> 01:59:59,759
- It's not that she took it.
- But...

2407
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:00,760
I said it looked good on her.

2408
02:00:02,060 --> 02:00:03,930
That wasn't what happened.

2409
02:00:05,130 --> 02:00:07,300
Park Ji Hyeon. Hey.

2410
02:00:10,170 --> 02:00:11,640
Don't just leave like that.

2411
02:00:12,240 --> 02:00:14,069
I don't plan to get back with you.

2412
02:00:14,070 --> 02:00:15,470
I'm serious.

2413
02:00:16,610 --> 02:00:18,039
Don't talk to me from now on.

2414
02:00:18,040 --> 02:00:19,210
- That's...
- Stop it.

2415
02:00:19,480 --> 02:00:21,179
That's not it.

2416
02:00:21,180 --> 02:00:22,309
- Wait...
- I said stop it.

2417
02:00:22,310 --> 02:00:24,780
Let's not end it like this at least.

2418
02:00:25,780 --> 02:00:28,220
- Whatever.
- Park Ji Hyeon.

2419
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:30,760
Don't touch me.

2420
02:00:32,290 --> 02:00:33,290
Ji Hyeon.

2421
02:00:33,890 --> 02:00:35,260
That's not what happened.

2422
02:00:40,070 --> 02:00:42,000
- Stop.
- Are you serious?

2423
02:00:42,200 --> 02:00:43,230
I'm serious.

2424
02:00:44,170 --> 02:00:45,200
Park Ji Hyeon.

2425
02:00:45,800 --> 02:00:47,870
(EXchange 4)

2426
02:00:48,110 --> 02:00:49,870
- Do you want me to tie it?
- Tie it, please.

2427
02:00:50,410 --> 02:00:52,379
(I felt comfortable.)

2428
02:00:52,380 --> 02:00:56,919
I want to go on more dates in Japan,

2429
02:00:56,920 --> 02:00:57,949
so...

2430
02:00:57,950 --> 02:01:01,920
(It'd be time to check your feelings.)

2431
02:01:03,590 --> 02:01:04,860
Aren't you going on a date?

2432
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:06,860
Later.

2433
02:01:07,360 --> 02:01:08,830
The weather is so nice.

2434
02:01:09,060 --> 02:01:10,060
Bye.

2435
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:12,130
(I felt uncomfortable.)

2436
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:15,930
At the time, she said she had feelings for me.

2437
02:01:17,070 --> 02:01:18,769
- That she liked me.
- You?

2438
02:01:18,770 --> 02:01:20,710
