1
00:00:15,917 --> 00:00:19,349
Together with us today is Singer Roy Kim.

2
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,820
Welcome.

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,120
Thank you for inviting me.

4
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,230
Nice to meet you.

5
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,929
I heard Roy is a fan of EXchange.

6
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,429
I sang the soundtrack as well.

7
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,430
- Yes.
- He sang the soundtrack.

8
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:31,299
I was wondering if I'd get invited someday.

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,399
- It's time the true feelings...
- That's right.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,400
come out.

11
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:35,670
I'm so thankful you called me at such a time.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,209
If you leak this and get caught, you'll go back to the navy.

13
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,880
I'd never do that in that case.

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,280
- I'd never do it. Don't worry.
- Okay.

15
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,180
Is Min Kyung sleeping as well?

16
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,180
Min Kyung isn't here.

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,690
She's not here?

18
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,320
But all the men are here.

19
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,359
That's possible.

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,800
(It's late at night, and Min Kyung isn't back yet.)

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,340
(Wait!)

22
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,470
Why?

23
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,080
(A strange tension fills the living room.)

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,679
Everything is beautiful.

25
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,150
- Around here, right?
- Yes.

26
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,380
- Is it this one?
- Yes. I'll open the door.

27
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,520
- Goodness.
- Are you nervous?

28
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,289
I'm a little nervous.

29
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,360
- What is this?
- How are the endless steps?

30
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,959
It's not easy.

31
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,960
(It's a step one must go through to enter the house.)

32
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:33,430
The house is nice.

33
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,829
Are people normally gathered at this hour?

34
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:36,870
Yes.

35
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,299
- They're coming together?
- They're coming together?

36
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,239
- They normally enter separately.
- Right.

37
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,639
- They enter separately after dates.
- Right.

38
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,809
It's hard to predict anything.

39
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,540
What is this? They're entering together?

40
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,950
We have to be quiet.

41
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,750
(Let's go!)

42
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,290
(Min Kyung enters first.)

43
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,830
(People in the living room can only see Min Kyung now.)

44
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,130
- She's here.
- She's here.

45
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,100
Hello.

46
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,300
Hello.

47
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,200
It's true.

48
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,340
I'm shocked.

49
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,009
- Hello.
- Hello.

50
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,180
- Hello.
- Hello.

51
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,449
- Hello.
- Hello.

52
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,810
- Hello.
- Hello.

53
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,749
Nice to meet you.

54
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,120
You're all gathered here.

55
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,890
He looked very nice.

56
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,889
What's your name?

57
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,160
I'm Lee Jae Hyeong.

58
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,030
His first impression as well...

59
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,700
He said one word,

60
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,600
and I could tell he's very confident.

61
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,440
He would win people over.

62
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,480
That's what I thought.

63
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:58,950
You can sit down.

64
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,749
He seemed very manly...

65
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,820
and bold.

66
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,859
In any case, he was joining late,

67
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,459
so he could have felt very nervous,

68
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,590
but he came in very confidently. So I thought...

69
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,560
he was a very bold person.

70
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,130
I think there was some tension.

71
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,129
Then I'll bring her from upstairs.

72
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,400
Yes.

73
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,039
I'll be back.

74
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,240
What were you doing?

75
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,270
(Ji Hyeon can't take her eyes off the living room.)

76
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,740
- Can we sit?
- Sure.

77
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,519
- Sit in the middle.
- Right.

78
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,250
- Right. Sit in the middle.
- Should I?

79
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,720
I should take off my cap.

80
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,400
(Yoo Sik came to the room on the 1st floor.)

81
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,380
(He starts washing his hair.)

82
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,549
- What's that?
- He's suddenly washing his hair?

83
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,850
Is he suddenly washing his hair?

84
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,949
- Goodness.
- Normally, men...

85
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,689
don't do anything much in that situation.

86
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,119
- Right.
- Women might reapply lipstick...

87
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,129
- or makeup.
- Yes.

88
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,429
But there's not much that men can do.

89
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,459
- Right.
- Woo Jin applied lip balm earlier.

90
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,699
They could move their chest muscles at most.

91
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,429
- Right. Flexing muscles.
- That's all they can do.

92
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,739
Push-ups at most. That would be all.

93
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,140
If he's washing his hair, that means he really cares.

94
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,840
It's possible that he didn't wash his hair.

95
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,709
- But the timing.
- But why wash it suddenly?

96
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,239
He's washing his hair as soon as Jae Hyeong appears.

97
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,549
- He felt dirty.
- Right.

98
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,749
He was conscious of someone.

99
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,920
- Min Kyung or someone else.
- Totally.

100
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,520
- To the point of washing his hair?
- Right.

101
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,890
- Did you eat?
- Yes. I ate.

102
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,159
We ate pasta.

103
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,319
- Really?
- Yes.

104
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,059
Can I ask where you ate from?

105
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,129
- From Itaewon.
- Really?

106
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,130
Yes.

107
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,500
There were many people,

108
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,000
and they were people he was meeting for the first time.

109
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,710
So he was a bit calmer...

110
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,880
than when it was just the two of us.

111
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,809
But still, he confidently talked...

112
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,949
about himself.

113
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,020
That seemed nice.

114
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,419
How many of you are here?

115
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,620
We're ten.

116
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,220
Who's not here now?

117
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,430
- Hyeon Ji and Yoo Sik.
- Yoo Sik.

118
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,929
You're here.

119
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,400
(Hyeon Ji comes to the living room as soon as they say that.)

120
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,870
(Hyeon Ji hasn't noticed Jae Hyeong.)

121
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,940
Why?

122
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,380
Why are you laughing?

123
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,510
Well...

124
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,350
Take a look at everyone.

125
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,420
- Hello.
- Hello.

126
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,980
Hello.

127
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,990
- You didn't know.
- I thought he was Yoo Sik.

128
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,489
I'll tell Yoo Sik to hurry.

129
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,860
What's Yoo Sik doing?

130
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,700
(In search of Yoo Sik who doesn't come)

131
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,429
Did the two of you...

132
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,099
Yes. We went on a date.

133
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,200
I'm curious.

134
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,809
Did you get a bit close?

135
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,949
We got a bit close. We also speak casually.

136
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:20,950
Really?

137
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,149
You didn't do that with us.

138
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,350
- No.
- We thought about it but we didn't.

139
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,120
Together...

140
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,330
When do you normally sleep?

141
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,490
It's always different.

142
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,760
If we stay up late, we hang out until 6am.

143
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,699
But people disappear one by one. People who get tired.

144
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,600
The earliest I slept was at 4am.

145
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,499
Right.

146
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,369
I sleep at around 1 or 2am.

147
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,740
People who can go on stay here.

148
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,240
Do you sleep early?

149
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:52,180
I sleep at around 1am, but I can hang out more.

150
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,020
- Goodness.
- What?

151
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,490
They're taking a long time.

152
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,789
- What's taking them so long?
- Seriously.

153
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,059
He's been waiting.

154
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,060
It's okay.

155
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:10,400
I think Won Kyu was sucked in as well.

156
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,300
- Yoo Sik.
- Yes?

157
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,070
- Can I come in?
- Yes.

158
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,669
I was wondering why you weren't coming.

159
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,110
- Is everyone there?
- Yes.

160
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,210
- Are they talking?
- Yes.

161
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,279
- How is he?
- I think he'll adjust very well.

162
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,319
- Yes.
- He seems active.

163
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,550
Right. He seems different from the men I've talked to here.

164
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,020
I think he's going to shake things up here.

165
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,489
Should I go out with my hair slicked back in a wet look?

166
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,490
- A power move?
- A power move.

167
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,130
- You know, - What?

168
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,829
there's another room.

169
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,100
- Where?
- Right above this.

170
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,899
There's a room there?

171
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,539
It's like a wall was broken.

172
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,610
- Really?
- There was a secret room.

173
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,380
It's shocking.

174
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,610
This is interesting. EXchange is interesting.

175
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,780
Hold on.

176
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,720
I should change this too.

177
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:06,890
Shall we go?

178
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,159
What is this?

179
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,829
- Is it that much?
- Is it that much?

180
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,189
- Why...
- Is his presence that strong?

181
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,599
Why are they so nervous?

182
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,229
He said he was going to do...

183
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,299
a wet hair look that he's never done before.

184
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,499
- Right.
- Men normally aren't like that.

185
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,769
They aren't like that.

186
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,869
I think it could be possible when you're in there.

187
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,870
- Could it?
- Somehow,

188
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:26,609
they'd want the attention on themselves.

189
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,509
- People's attention is taken.
- That's right.

190
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,809
Their guards are way up.

191
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,449
- Right.
- They can't lose.

192
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,449
The charisma of Jae Hyeong...

193
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,149
- that makes the men move.
- He's charismatic.

194
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,150
Right.

195
00:08:36,151 --> 00:08:38,949
I don't think they would have done that...

196
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,219
- if Jae Hyeong wasn't so proactive.
- Right.

197
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,119
As soon as he came, he said, "Can I sit here?"

198
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,959
"What were you doing?" It was like he was leading things.

199
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,730
I think that would make them more nervous.

200
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,499
It's like he would get what he wants.

201
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,769
- He's that style.
- Something like that.

202
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,129
- He makes you be on guard.
- He makes you be on guard.

203
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,639
- He's someone like that.
- He's that type.

204
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,640
Right.

205
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,370
- Up here.
- Here? Where?

206
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,840
- Here?
- Yes.

207
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,910
(For 5 days, there was a wall here.)

208
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,250
(A room was hidden.)

209
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:16,659
(2nd floor, men's room)

210
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,060
It was hidden perfectly.

211
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,430
That was Jae Hyeong's room, but it was hidden all along.

212
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,499
He's back.

213
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,199
Your hair looks nice.

214
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,510
I didn't think it was polite to wear a cap.

215
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,540
Which seat is empty?

216
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,339
You can sit here.

217
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,579
We're all here.

218
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,080
(Finally, all 10 of them are gathered in the living room.)

219
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,710
Should I say my name first?

220
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,890
My name is Lee Jae Hyeong.

221
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,150
Welcome.

222
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,660
Nice to meet you.

223
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,759
Nice to meet you.

224
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,390
Can we say our professions?

225
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,860
I work at a cafe.

226
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,500
I'm studying to become a barista to make my own brand.

227
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,769
I studied robotics...

228
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,470
to get a stable job,

229
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,740
but now I'm working as a barista with a new dream.

230
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,379
Sometimes it's scary to dream of something else...

231
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,780
unrelated to what I studied so far,

232
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,649
but I wanted to make a coffee brand with my taste,

233
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,220
so I'm doing my best.

234
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,560
(Lee Jae Hyeong, Barista)

235
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,360
- Sung Baek Hyun?
- That's right.

236
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,630
Yun Nyeong.

237
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,759
Amazing. Yes.

238
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,099
Kim Woo Jin.

239
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,369
Awesome.

240
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,000
Park Ji Hyeon.

241
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,740
Hong Ji Yeon.

242
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,810
Seo Yoo Sik?

243
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,639
- Cho Yoo Sik.
- That's right.

244
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,349
- Nice.
- Won Kyu?

245
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,549
That's right.

246
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,579
- Jung.
- Jung Won Kyu.

247
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,680
- Park Hyeon Ji.
- That's right.

248
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,750
- He memorizes really quickly.
- He really does.

249
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,089
But I think I'll soon forget them.

250
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,620
He'll ask again after five minutes.

251
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,659
- Is it a quiz?
- Keep asking.

252
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,760
This is funny.

253
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,330
He looked really cool.

254
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:02,330
He talked well, and he memorized names well.

255
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,599
He was proactive.

256
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,570
That was very charming.

257
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,209
He had the most different character...

258
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,270
among all the male residents so far.

259
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,340
He seemed he would be the most active one.

260
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,109
He talked in a very straightforward manner.

261
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,720
I thought he was cool.

262
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,690
Did you two drink a little as well?

263
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,119
We had a glass.

264
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,490
A glass of wine.

265
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,960
Would you like to drink some more?

266
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,330
- Drinks?
- Yes.

267
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,660
If everyone drinks.

268
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,630
You said you weren't going to drink today.

269
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,299
I won't drink,

270
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,299
but he came. I thought he would feel awkward.

271
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,910
We could get closer if we drink.

272
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,509
That would be nice.

273
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,910
- Right?
- Yes.

274
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,410
- We probably have Choeumchoreom.
- Chamiseul.

275
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,610
Let's go.

276
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,719
No, please sit down. We'll get it.

277
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,919
- I'll go and see what's there.
- Okay.

278
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,620
Should I tell you something really interesting?

279
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,419
- What is it?
- There's another room downstairs.

280
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,359
- You're lying.
- There's another room.

281
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,930
Will he use that room?

282
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,229
- Really?
- In front of the living room.

283
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,729
In front of the living room?

284
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,200
- Really?
- In front of the living room?

285
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,730
- It's totally blue.
- What?

286
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,039
(The room's owner doesn't know about the room yet.)

287
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,899
I want to drink Cheongha now that I see it.

288
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,039
Drink Cheongha.

289
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,270
Should I?

290
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,779
I think you'll be using a room alone.

291
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,979
- Really?
- Yes.

292
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,010
That's fine. I'll visit if I get bored.

293
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,320
Come visit.

294
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,150
- You don't know this, right?
- What?

295
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,249
There's a new room there.

296
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,460
- Really?
- Yes.

297
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,759
- Can we take a look?
- There's a new room.

298
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,229
- Shall we take a look?
- Where?

299
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,260
When you go downstairs...

300
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,300
Then...

301
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,500
(Min Kyung leaves the room tour and goes somewhere.)

302
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,140
Jae Hyeong.

303
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,940
Let's go downstairs together.

304
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,969
- We're going now?
- They wanted to take a look.

305
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,880
You'll be using the room, so I think you should look.

306
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,149
Why are we the only ones...

307
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,280
Aren't you curious?

308
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,549
I'll go later.

309
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,780
I don't think it would matter.

310
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,250
Are they all downstairs?

311
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,650
- Are you wearing my bracelet?
- Yes.

312
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,820
I was going to give it to you.

313
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,130
- I think people would find out.
- Take it.

314
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,130
That's why I was hiding it here. I was going to remove it like this.

315
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,659
You can drink this coffee.

316
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,400
You're thoughtful.

317
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,440
(They head to find the new room.)

318
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,210
What?

319
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,839
How does a room suddenly appear?

320
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,380
When?

321
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,810
There was something like this?

322
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,749
- He'll use it alone.
- Is it a single room?

323
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,249
- This is amazing.
- It's amazing.

324
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,779
I guess it was always here, but it was hidden.

325
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,079
- Amazing.
- It was hidden.

326
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,649
- What is this house?
- I guess they hid this.

327
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,049
This room is really nice.

328
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,459
How was this hidden all along?

329
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,059
- This used to be...
- Wasn't this a storage room?

330
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,659
- It was blocked.
- It was covered.

331
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,259
- A fake wall.
- Really?

332
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,629
- It's amazing.
- Really.

333
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,330
It's here.

334
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,970
This is the communal living room.

335
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,570
- Which floor is this?
- This...

336
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,099
- The 2nd floor...
- You're using the 2nd floor.

337
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,210
We call people here the Downstairs Residents.

338
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,170
- Starting from the second floor?
- Yes.

339
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,840
It's nice.

340
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,439
Will I use this alone?

341
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,710
- I think so.
- It's really nice.

342
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,680
There's a full-length mirror as well.

343
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,880
- I like it.
- It's so nice.

344
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,649
There are no slippers.

345
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:14,920
Wear one of these.

346
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,430
- Wear it.
- Okay.

347
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,989
We're going to drink.

348
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,200
(They prepare a new drinking session for Jae Hyeong.)

349
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,530
I recently joined as well.

350
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,829
Really? Did you join yesterday?

351
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,140
(Nodding)

352
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,040
- We're comrades.
- That's right.

353
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:42,780
(Kwak Min Kyung and Cho Yoo Sik)

354
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,350
(Park Hyeon Ji and Sung Baek Hyun)

355
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:50,290
(Hong Ji Yeon and Kim Woo Jin)

356
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:54,060
(Park Ji Hyeon and Jung Won Kyu)

357
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,930
(Lee Jae Hyeong)

358
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,730
(Choi Yun Nyeong)

359
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,980
(EXchange 4)

360
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,880
(Episode 8: Insincere Love)

361
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,689
- Cheers. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

362
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:19,690
Cheers.

363
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,059
The men talk casually among themselves.

364
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,390
Yes. We talk casually. You can talk comfortably.

365
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,830
- You can talk comfortably.
- Okay.

366
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,330
As soon as he got here.

367
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,270
- As soon as he got here.
- Can I talk comfortably?

368
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,800
Can I speak comfortably?

369
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,999
You can speak comfortably.

370
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,570
- You can.
- Okay.

371
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,180
- We should speak comfortably first.
- Yes.

372
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,239
How do you feel?

373
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,780
Are you a bit nervous?

374
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,950
I'm excited too.

375
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,920
I might be seeing different things here.

376
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,629
Nice.

377
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,729
Jae Hyeong...

378
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,230
Why is he so active?

379
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,300
He's bold.

380
00:16:03,301 --> 00:16:04,399
- Very bold.
- That's how a catfish should be.

381
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,899
That's true. I guess there's something like that.

382
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,869
He seems the most masculine there.

383
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,270
Yes. He's a tough guy.

384
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,540
Your ears are...

385
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,739
- very round.
- They're protruding out.

386
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,439
Yes, but those are pretty ears.

387
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,349
- Is that so?
- That's right.

388
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,679
I don't understand.

389
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,349
I always wanted to push them in.

390
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,120
Could you try pushing them in?

391
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,619
This looks good too.

392
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,850
Really?

393
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,960
Is my face red?

394
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,560
- Yes. A bit. It's like...
- A bit.

395
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,100
a woman blushing after saying something wrong.

396
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,399
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry.

397
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,799
- I'm sorry.
- I'm all right.

398
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,370
- Did you spill it?
- It's okay.

399
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,570
- Did it get on your clothes?
- No. It's okay.

400
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,810
I can have it washed if it got on my clothes.

401
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,379
It's wine,

402
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,309
so we should wipe it.

403
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,410
Hold on.

404
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,650
Here. The dry cleaner is here.

405
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,649
(He came back with a dish towel smeared with dish soap.)

406
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,790
I'll start cleaning.

407
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,590
Do you have a dryer?

408
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,530
(He focuses on wiping the carpet with his shirt unbuttoned.)

409
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,700
It's too revealing right now.

410
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,910
Your chest...

411
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,680
I was hoping someone would cover that.

412
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,949
It was too...

413
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,220
Did you make eye contact?

414
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,989
- My gosh.
- Both of us.

415
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,360
You'd have felt uncomfortable.

416
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,720
I thought you were going for it.

417
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,029
- Flirting?
- On purpose.

418
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,760
Flirting. Showing his charms.

419
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,299
This much is...

420
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,469
It's done. Thank you.

421
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,440
We can all spill some later.

422
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:01,180
(The time to choose has come again today.)

423
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,249
(Who made your heart flutter today? Let them know via text.)

424
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,420
(Your text will be delivered anonymously.)

425
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,289
(The one person...)

426
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:12,260
(who made my heart flutter today)

427
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,800
(Where are their hearts headed?)

428
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,540
(Twitching)

429
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,210
(Staring)

430
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,140
He really doesn't look away.

431
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,039
- Baek Hyun?
- He maintains eye contact well.

432
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,379
He doesn't look away so much.

433
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,850
His ideal type is someone with large eyes.

434
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,449
How large do they have to be?

435
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:33,580
The eyes?

436
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,680
Taking up half of the face?

437
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,990
- That big?
- No lens can fit those eyes.

438
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,389
No one here has small eyes, though.

439
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,590
- Everyone has big eyes.
- All of us do.

440
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,460
All the guys have big eyes too.

441
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,730
- Why?
- What?

442
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,470
Don't listen. I don't want you to get hurt.

443
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,140
Don't do that. Calm down.

444
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,150
(Baek Hyun)

445
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,620
(When do you want to go tufting?)

446
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,560
(Yun Nyeong, his date today, sent him a text.)

447
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,860
It implied I'll ask him for a date again.

448
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,830
It felt great. I was happy.

449
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,870
(Yun Nyeong)

450
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:31,870
(Communal living room, 1am, cutting board)

451
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,940
(Baek Hyun and Yun Nyeon clicked again today.)

452
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,010
Anyone could tell it was Baek Hyun.

453
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,350
It was funny.

454
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,749
I don't know. Why do I find him funny?

455
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,890
Why is he so funny?

456
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,690
(Your ex did not pick you.)

457
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,960
Yoo Sik fell asleep.

458
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,700
I didn't.

459
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,370
- Don't.
- Think I'll sleep at this hour?

460
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,200
I never go to bed at this hour.

461
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,900
You need to get some sleep.

462
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,670
Why are you saying that to me?

463
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,109
You must be so tired.

464
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,010
Right. You should go to bed.

465
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,910
(Zoned out)

466
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:18,350
(Yoo Sik)

467
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,259
(You must have had a busy day.)

468
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,290
(Thank you soo much for the coffee and the Greek yogurt.)

469
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,690
The previous day, he asked me what I wanted to eat.

470
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:31,230
I said, "Iced Americano. And Greek yogurt too."

471
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,700
He brought them for me.

472
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,970
So I texted, "Thank you soo much."

473
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,840
It sounds cuter than "Thank you so much."

474
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,680
(Yoo Sik)

475
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,680
(Thank you for the beverage!)

476
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,650
I think Ji Hyeon sent one.

477
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:54,220
The other could be from Ji Yeon or Hyeon Ji.

478
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,860
It just said, "Thank you for the beverage."

479
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,130
I have no idea.

480
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:03,330
The feeling I had when I saw the chamomile tea.

481
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,500
I wanted to express that.

482
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,799
But if I expressed it directly,

483
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,100
he might have noticed.

484
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,740
So I texted, "the beverage."

485
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,580
I'm embarrassed.

486
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,850
(Hyeon Ji sent a text to Yoo Sik again today.)

487
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:29,020
(Hyeon Ji)

488
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,590
(Your ex did not pick you.)

489
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,360
I didn't receive a text.

490
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,199
I guess Yoo Sik.

491
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,100
I thought it would be nice if he sent me a text.

492
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,470
I think we had no point of contact that day.

493
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:49,780
(Today, Yoo Sik's heart wasn't drawn to Hyeon Ji.)

494
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,979
All of that?

495
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,320
(Ji Hyeon)

496
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,420
(To Ji Hyeon)

497
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,660
Why are you looking at me?

498
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,930
(Today, Yoo Sik's heart was drawn to Ji Hyeon.)

499
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,809
On the note, my name...

500
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:21,980
was written in a unique way.

501
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,640
So I sent her the same one.

502
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:27,010
It meant I wanted to have a date with her on Friday.

503
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,480
Isn't it so cute that he sent a text like that?

504
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,150
My heart fluttered the most back then.

505
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:38,360
I thought that we clicked.

506
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,439
He used initials. Right.

507
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,909
That's witty.

508
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,840
- She's happy.
- I knew it.

509
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,209
He's more into Ji Hyeon.

510
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,439
- I think that's why he sent that.
- Of course.

511
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,649
I think Ji Hyeon would feel better.

512
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:00,919
She said, "cute." Enough said.

513
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,920
Her anxiety must have disappeared.

514
00:23:01,921 --> 00:23:03,880
She couldn't hide her feelings and beamed.

515
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,249
This is good. Thanks.

516
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,489
I brought it for you.

517
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,260
(Baek Hyun eats tiramisu with a spoon for rice.)

518
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,529
- Haven't you had dinner?
- I had a light meal.

519
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,199
- A light meal?
- Yes.

520
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,500
You must be hungry, then.

521
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,540
(Taking something out from his pocket)

522
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,540
What's that? A handkerchief?

523
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,710
- Do you always carry it with you?
- Yes.

524
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:37,750
(Ji Yeon)

525
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:42,490
(Thank you for cooking with me.)

526
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,430
(Won Kyu sent his text to Ji Yeon today, again.)

527
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,600
(Won Kyu)

528
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:58,070
(We cooked stir-fried spicy pork so nicely today, didn't we?)

529
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,410
(Their hearts were drawn to each other again today.)

530
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:10,150
I want to send my text to Won Kyu only.

531
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,920
I can't stop thinking about him.

532
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:18,529
(Min Kyung)

533
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:19,690
Because it's predictable?

534
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,199
- You're saying it yourself?
- I know.

535
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,399
- Wait a minute.
- That's why.

536
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,769
There should have been a motive.

537
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:29,200
I enjoyed the conversation with Min Kyung.

538
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,940
I sent her the text thinking I wanted to talk more with her.

539
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,680
(Jae Hyeon)

540
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,710
(You have a beautiful smile.)

541
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,050
When we talked,

542
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,960
he kept smiling.

543
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,389
I remembered his dimples,

544
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:53,290
so I texted him, "You have a beautiful smile."

545
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:56,800
Min Kyung kept saying she likes guys with a beautiful smile.

546
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,330
She also told me that I had a beautiful smile.

547
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,670
So I guess it was Min Kyung.

548
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,340
It felt good.

549
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,840
(Today, Jae Hyeong and Min Kyung clicked.)

550
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,779
- Yes, nice!
- Good.

551
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,449
I wish Min Kyung would become happy.

552
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,879
I hope things work out between Min Kyung and Jae Hyeong.

553
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,519
It seems that everyone's heart is drawn to someone new.

554
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,719
- Yes, they're all into someone new.
- I know.

555
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,750
Their hearts are moving.

556
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:21,290
Are you all right?

557
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,059
Are the guys just like what you imagined?

558
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,060
Yes.

559
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:26,630
They all look good?

560
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:34,030
(Your ex did not pick you.)

561
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,040
My ex looks like she's been doing well for five days.

562
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:41,980
Things are going as I imagined.

563
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:46,710
It actually helps me keep myself together.

564
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,320
(Ji Yeon)

565
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:56,420
(Sorry.)

566
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,090
(Your ex picked you.)

567
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:07,400
(Today, Woo Jin sent his text to his ex for the first time.)

568
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,939
It's Woo Jin!

569
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,570
That's Woo Jin!

570
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,309
Oh, my. Woo Jin.

571
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:18,179
That word really hits you hard.

572
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,209
- "Sorry." - Right.

573
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,479
It feels there's a lot behind that word.

574
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,420
That's nice of Woo Jin to send the text like that.

575
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:29,860
(Sorry.)

576
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,530
(Your ex picked you.)

577
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,910
I sent one word, "Sorry."

578
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,780
When we had a talk,

579
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,409
I told her what I was upset about.

580
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,980
But I felt that I made her so lonely.

581
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,490
That's why I texted "Sorry."

582
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,320
It was only one word, "Sorry."

583
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,130
I read it while everyone was there.

584
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:10,460
I tried to hold back, but I teared up.

585
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:14,000
It broke my heart to read the text.

586
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:18,910
I'm thankful and glad that I heard that word now,

587
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,510
but we broke up already,

588
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:23,680
and he said that now.

589
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,180
Even if he says that to me now,

590
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,820
it doesn't mean that I want to get back together.

591
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,529
(Woo Jin)

592
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,300
I know. I enjoyed eating it so much.

593
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,940
(Your ex did not pick you.)

594
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,059
- Let's go upstairs.
- I'm glad that you like it.

595
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,660
We're going to eat it again later.

596
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:49,400
Seriously. So annoying.

597
00:28:55,770 --> 00:29:01,240
(She burst into tears reading the text from Woo Jin.)

598
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:11,950
This is irritating.

599
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,270
- She cried.
- Goodness.

600
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,669
That's understandable.

601
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:32,369
- The word "sorry" hits you hard.
- It really does.

602
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,039
She must be annoyed. Why is he acting like that now?

603
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,209
He should have said, "Sorry" when they were together.

604
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,179
I know. Why does he irritate her now...

605
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,250
when she's just about to meet someone new?

606
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,019
It definitely is about timing.

607
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,349
Assuming that he has feelings for her,

608
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,250
- it's a nice timing for him.
- Right.

609
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,619
- Where are you going?
- To the room.

610
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,660
- Why?
- What?

611
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,860
I want to get changed.

612
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,529
- Are you tired?
- Can't I go to bed now?

613
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,660
- What?
- I can't go to bed?

614
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,100
Come on.

615
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,370
The night is just beginning.

616
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,600
Baek Hyun, did you leave your phone?

617
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,540
I'll go get it.

618
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,590
(Wrapping the cutting board he made with Yun Nyeong with a blanket.)

619
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,800
(He shakes it too.)

620
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,910
Does it erase well?

621
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,639
No, it doesn't. I erased everything.

622
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,349
Really? Give it to me. I'll try.

623
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,480
It won't go away easily.

624
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,480
Baek Hyun, here are your slippers.

625
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,720
- My slippers?
- Yes. Come here for a second.

626
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,760
- I'll bring it to the second floor.
- Okay.

627
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,000
Ji Yeon is downstairs, though.

628
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,140
Then, go like this.

629
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,810
- Bring it naturally like this.
- I'll do that.

630
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,109
Hold it this way.

631
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,940
Great. You're the best.

632
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,580
By the way, why were you looking at me earlier?

633
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,879
- Excuse me?
- Why did you keep looking at me?

634
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,349
- When?
- When the catfish entered.

635
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:25,050
- What?
- It's nothing.

636
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,729
(Baek Hyun came to Yun Nyeong's room.)

637
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,730
Come in.

638
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,739
(Why did you come here?)

639
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,270
- Are you sleeping?
- No.

640
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,469
(Putting the cutting board in the closet quickly)

641
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,970
- Are you all right now?
- Yes.

642
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:50,110
Ji Yeon, I heard you'd take some rest...

643
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,050
- and then join us.
- Yes.

644
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,150
All right.

645
00:31:55,151 --> 00:31:56,720
Why did you just barge into our room?

646
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,220
- I'm sorry.
- What?

647
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,950
- You should apologize.
- I apologize.

648
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:06,490
I was afraid we might get noticed.

649
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,090
I didn't want to get noticed.

650
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,230
That's why I called you.

651
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,800
You can't take a hint at all.

652
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,070
What?

653
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,440
You were doing something else.

654
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,280
Gosh, I'm tired. Shall I write it again?

655
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,490
Please take this over there.

656
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,790
Where are Min Kyung and Hyeon Ji?

657
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,830
- They're sleeping.
- Are they sleeping?

658
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,560
I don't care. I'm barging in.

659
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,060
You're barging in?

660
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,240
You're going there?

661
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,509
- Hi. Can't I come in?
- You can.

662
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,510
- May I come in?
- It's okay. What is it?

663
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,050
It's not a fan. It's a vacuum cleaner.

664
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,250
Are you feeling happy today?

665
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,960
- Why do you ask that?
- You look happy.

666
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,020
I'm always happy.

667
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:16,130
Is Woo Jin inside?

668
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,810
You must have had a good time today.

669
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,480
I really have.

670
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,110
Then...

671
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,449
- Let's talk for a moment.
- What is it?

672
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:33,879
How about the date we had?

673
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,079
- Yes.
- Did you not like it?

674
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,979
- I liked it.
- Really?

675
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:38,990
Totally.

676
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,350
Did you?

677
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,860
Okay. Here, "Menu."

678
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,059
Okay, good. I'm great at keeping things straight.

679
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,129
Come on. Don't lie to me.

680
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,330
I mean it.

681
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,159
Stop lying.

682
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,160
- You look good.
- You're the only one...

683
00:33:51,161 --> 00:33:53,170
who says I look good, aren't you?

684
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,399
- Am I?
- I'll treat you to something good.

685
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,040
- Yes, please.
- All right.

686
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,810
What do you feel like eating?

687
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,270
I'm not picky with food.

688
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,110
It feels he doesn't care about me at all.

689
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:11,150
He enters our room when he doesn't really need to talk.

690
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:15,059
And he talks with Min Kyung and leaves...

691
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,290
while I'm there.

692
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,960
It made me upset.

693
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,129
I'll buy you something delicious.

694
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,130
(Glancing)

695
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,830
- Okay. I got it.
- Here are your slippers.

696
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,540
I need to use the bathroom.

697
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,929
(What?)

698
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:54,960
(What is it?)

699
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:57,760
(What is it?)

700
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:31,100
(Hyeon Ji bursts into tears after holding them back.)

701
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,470
Seriously.

702
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,140
I'm so irritated.

703
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,480
What is it?

704
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,120
I want to leave this place.

705
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,810
Are you having fun?

706
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,880
You look comfortable like this is your place.

707
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,520
You can just take it easy.

708
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:33,960
It might not be easy, but don't take things too seriously.

709
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,330
You should talk to others too.

710
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,130
You don't need to care about me.

711
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,369
What?

712
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:42,099
Does my presence bother you?

713
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,140
It's not that your presence bothers me. It's...

714
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:48,010
You don't like seeing me comfortable here, then?

715
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:52,180
It's not that I care about you.

716
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,880
You're the one making me bothered.

717
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,250
I'm doing nothing special.

718
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,850
What? You talk the most here.

719
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:03,620
With Yoo Sik?

720
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,660
With just everyone here.

721
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:08,700
You went on a date, right?

722
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,160
Hold on.

723
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,279
Baek Hyun.

724
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,480
(Yoo Sik has come to find Baek Hyun.)

725
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,750
It's Yoo Sik.

726
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,120
- Where?
- He came upstairs.

727
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,119
Did he come upstairs?

728
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,830
Yes. Why did he come upstairs?

729
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:41,760
This is driving me crazy.

730
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,610
- Didn't he come to find you?
- Be quiet.

731
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,149
- He's so...
- Why is he doing that?

732
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,919
- Usually...
- He must be absorbed.

733
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,449
- I know. Seriously.
- Seriously.

734
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:04,879
I guess he really doesn't want to get caught.

735
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,050
- He really adheres to the rules.
- He really adheres to the rules.

736
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:09,520
- Didn't he come to find you?
- Be quiet.

737
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:15,230
Don't sit there. Come here.

738
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:20,470
(He's checking the women's room to find Baek Hyun.)

739
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,470
(He gives up in the end and goes downstairs.)

740
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,480
Do whatever you want. I don't care.

741
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,680
I'm doing whatever I want.

742
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:41,150
(Yoo Sik comes back upstairs and enters the terrace.)

743
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:48,190
- Let me spend some time alone.
- Okay.

744
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,900
It's Yoo Sik. Stick to the wall.

745
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,639
Anyone can see that it's yours.

746
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,870
(Hyeon Ji's cup is on the table.)

747
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,540
Do you think he saw it?

748
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,140
Totally.

749
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:08,880
We're ruined.

750
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,789
The lock should be here.

751
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:15,620
Why is it outside?

752
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:17,790
This is driving me crazy.

753
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,760
Come to the entrance next time you want to talk.

754
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,060
But you...

755
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,530
Nevermind. Forget it.

756
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,400
- Ask me. I'm curious.
- What?

757
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,540
It's just that... You won't tell me anyway.

758
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,840
I'll tell you what I can.

759
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,680
Did you throw it away yesterday?

760
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:39,249
Did you throw away your introduction from your ex?

761
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,310
I have it.

762
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:43,149
Then why did you do that yesterday?

763
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,520
Why did you say that you threw it away?

764
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,590
Did you say that on purpose?

765
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:51,060
Did you want other people to think that you had no regrets?

766
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,760
That was one reason. I just want...

767
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,900
both of us to be free.

768
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,510
I thought, "I was wrong."

769
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,380
I realized that what I had said was a mistake,

770
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,010
so I corrected myself. I didn't throw it away.

771
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:16,750
This is the beginning, so make yourself comfortable.

772
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,650
Talk to other people.

773
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,420
I can't do it.

774
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:23,720
I just don't know.

775
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,360
I thought you were doing a good job...

776
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:29,030
of finding someone new.

777
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,800
Me?

778
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,270
(Sighing)

779
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,500
I want you to be comfortable.

780
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:38,940
I just don't want to do anything.

781
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,969
- Don't you want to do anything?
- No.

782
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:42,310
Then don't do anything.

783
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:49,620
I hate you so much.

784
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,020
- Do you hate me?
- Yes.

785
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,950
Leave first.

786
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,390
Don't cry.

787
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,060
Do you want to meet at the entrance?

788
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,560
Come out later.

789
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,299
Come out around 2:30am or 3am.

790
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,370
Will you fall asleep?

791
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,929
What time works for you?

792
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:07,970
I can do 2:30am.

793
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,299
Make it 3am.

794
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,670
Meet me at the entrance at 3am.

795
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,840
Okay.

796
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:15,540
(They promise to meet at 3am and end the conversation.)

797
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:22,850
Run inside.

798
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:27,350
Hey.

799
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:29,890
(It's 3am.)

800
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,700
(People gather around downstairs today as well.)

801
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,200
- Shall we go inside a bit later?
- Okay.

802
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,129
Min Kyung, you were going to sleep.

803
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,730
I'm just going to fold the laundry.

804
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,669
- That's so funny.
- Here comes the spicy ramyeon.

805
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,869
One, two, three.

806
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,239
(Spicy Ramyeon Ji Yeon comes downstairs.)

807
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,909
How does she eat spicy ramyeon upon waking up?

808
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:49,940
Seriously.

809
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,810
I want a bite.

810
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,609
Go ahead and have a bite.

811
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:54,950
I don't mind.

812
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,850
- It looks so tasty.
- It looks tasty.

813
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,390
She had spicy ramyeon yesterday as well.

814
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,320
She had two packets yesterday.

815
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,260
The carbonara one and...

816
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,330
Didn't you say that people lose weight here?

817
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,429
- But...
- It doesn't apply to us.

818
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:11,760
How should I put it? Even if you eat, you lose weight.

819
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,029
It's because your mind is...

820
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,900
- on other people.
- You get stressed out.

821
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,909
I thought men didn't care about other people.

822
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:21,969
I cry every day.

823
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:23,610
- Really?
- He cries every day.

824
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,709
- I...
- You're eating spicy ramyeon too.

825
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,980
I couldn't help myself.

826
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,950
It looks so tasty.

827
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:34,050
How does everyone feel about being here?

828
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,220
Is it complicated?

829
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:38,760
I knew that I'd feel uncomfortable.

830
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,730
- And I feel uncomfortable.
- It's just as you've imagined.

831
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,730
I felt very uncomfortable before entering the house.

832
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,670
I had a lot of thoughts before entering the house.

833
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:54,370
But now that I'm here, I've become...

834
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:57,040
a bit certain.

835
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,410
I'm pretty comfortable.

836
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,320
How about you, Woo Jin?

837
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,359
Woo Jin looks uncomfortable.

838
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,160
- What are you talking about?
- Even his posture isn't upright.

839
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,100
As for me...

840
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:21,270
I didn't feel uncomfortable at first.

841
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,940
But there are so many situations I can't help but notice.

842
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,809
- When your ex goes on a date...
- Yes.

843
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:29,209
That's one thing. It's just that I keep seeing my ex.

844
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:30,709
- That's right.
- So,

845
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:33,310
to be honest, I don't feel comfortable.

846
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:35,749
How about you, Ji Yeon?

847
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,380
I don't feel uncomfortable at all.

848
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,649
- The way you ate ramyeon...
- You don't feel uncomfortable...

849
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:39,889
- because you eat spicy ramyeon.
- Come on.

850
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:40,989
You don't look uncomfortable.

851
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:42,759
I ate it because I wanted to.

852
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,359
I don't care about my ex.

853
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,630
I won't care about him. Not at all.

854
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:49,959
- I see.
- Not at all.

855
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,300
Do you want your ex to do the same?

856
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,900
Yes.

857
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:57,239
I hope my ex won't care about me.

858
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,600
- Are you leaving?
- Yes.

859
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,570
- Are you going to bed?
- Yes. Good night.

860
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:02,980
- I'll join you soon.
- Good night.

861
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,850
I won't care about my ex.

862
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:10,719
So I hope he won't care about me at all.

863
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,850
- I hope he'll just ignore me.
- You're cool.

864
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:15,820
- It's not that I'm cool.
- Why? It's upsetting.

865
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,260
You should wish for his happiness.

866
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:21,859
Yes. That's why I want my ex...

867
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:24,460
to receive a lot of love here.

868
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,370
Totally.

869
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:28,629
Oh, no.

870
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:32,839
Since Woo Jin has heard that at dinner,

871
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,239
- he needs to give up.
- I know.

872
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,039
He texted her, "I'm sorry,"

873
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,639
and cried.

874
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,709
- But she's firm.
- Then...

875
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,349
- Then he should let her go.
- Stop.

876
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:43,549
That's right. She's determined.

877
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:45,179
- Ji Yeon is too determined.
- She's too determined.

878
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,219
She likes Won Kyu.

879
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,749
Even if that's the resolution in her head,

880
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:49,660
- the heart is a different matter.
- It won't be easy.

881
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:08,010
(Hyeon Ji comes outside at the promised time.)

882
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:17,920
(Baek Hyun hasn't come outside yet.)

883
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:24,460
(They were supposed to meet at 3am.)

884
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:38,440
(Baek Hyun doesn't come out for 20 minutes.)

885
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:45,410
(After waiting for a while, she heads back inside.)

886
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,619
(She looks around just in case,)

887
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:57,460
(but Baek Hyun is nowhere to be seen.)

888
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:05,100
What?

889
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,199
- Are you serious?
- Are you serious?

890
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,639
She should've gone to find him. I would've dragged him out.

891
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,839
She should go to Baek Hyun's room.

892
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,639
Why? Did he fall asleep?

893
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,839
Is he drinking?

894
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,739
There's no way he did it on purpose.

895
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:16,809
He didn't come outside?

896
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:20,209
What do you think? Is this the atmosphere you had in mind?

897
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,250
It's becoming a bit of a thriller.

898
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,279
- A thriller!
- I love it.

899
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,889
I hope it'd keep going in that direction.

900
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:27,350
- As a viewer, - Okay.

901
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:28,719
I want things to get messy.

902
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:29,790
Seriously.

903
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,190
How annoying.

904
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:37,900
Did something happen?

905
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,600
Well...

906
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:49,680
I was supposed to meet up with my ex for a talk at 3am over there, but...

907
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,039
Go ahead. I'll draw the curtains.

908
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,650
I was there, but he didn't show up.

909
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,380
Why didn't he show up?

910
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,150
- Really?
- Yes.

911
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,420
Why didn't he show up?

912
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:02,760
This is driving me crazy. Why is he doing this?

913
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:06,430
Is he trying to upset me?

914
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,390
Maybe he forgot.

915
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:09,700
Who'd forget something like this?

916
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,699
- If he forgot...
- He shouldn't have forgotten.

917
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:14,530
Forgetting something like this...

918
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:24,210
Then go and knock on his door.

919
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,220
- I don't know.
- Confront him tomorrow.

920
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:34,020
- Is he crazy?
- Say it. "Are you crazy?"

921
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,959
I really don't understand.

922
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,460
I'd be so upset.

923
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:45,360
We made a promise. Why didn't he keep it?

924
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,869
I wasn't the one who asked him to meet up at 3am.

925
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:50,070
- Really?
- Yes.

926
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,940
I hear people chatting.

927
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:57,510
- Shall we go together?
- Shall we go together?

928
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:00,679
Let's go.

929
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,650
(They go to check who is where.)

930
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:06,349
- Firstly, the terrace.
- Hold on.

931
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:08,420
- Let's open the door.
- Will you knock on the door?

932
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:10,160
Will you open the door?

933
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,490
- I don't want to do that.
- The terrace.

934
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,830
(No one is on the terrace.)

935
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:23,140
Knock on the door.

936
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,810
(I think there are two people.)

937
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:35,450
(I think there are many people.)

938
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,579
- What am I going to do?
- That's how it is.

939
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:40,490
(Baek Hyun and many others are in men's room on the 4th floor.)

940
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,560
What am I going to do?

941
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:47,930
(It's Yoo Sik!)

942
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,560
(Jae Hyeong?)

943
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:55,970
(It's Yoo Sik.)

944
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:59,410
(Let's go downstairs without listening further.)

945
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:03,280
Shall we go downstairs?

946
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,920
Is anyone there?

947
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,889
(Men's oom on the 1st floor is empty as well.)

948
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:14,020
Are they here?

949
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,689
(Baek Hyun and others come out of the room.)

950
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:17,690
Why is it here?

951
00:49:17,691 --> 00:49:19,789
I put it there since it ripped earlier.

952
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:20,889
- Really?
- Yes.

953
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:22,330
Did you get a new one?

954
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:23,899
I don't use these slippers.

955
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,360
- Good night.
- Okay.

956
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,999
Are the others awake? Are they sleeping?

957
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,969
- I think they're sleeping.
- Hurry up and go to bed.

958
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:30,370
Okay. I'm going to do that.

959
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:37,610
Seriously.

960
00:49:37,611 --> 00:49:39,549
We came downstairs instead of going to bed.

961
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:40,709
(Men gather around on the 2nd floor.)

962
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:41,750
What?

963
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:45,520
(The two of them come up as they listen to the sound.)

964
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:50,620
- Are you okay?
- He drank quite a lot.

965
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:53,230
- You guys weren't sleeping.
- What?

966
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,430
- Are you okay?
- He drank quite a lot.

967
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,200
- You guys weren't sleeping.
- What?

968
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:03,300
- What?
- Aren't you guys going to sleep?

969
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,610
- Weren't you guys sleeping?
- We just came downstairs.

970
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:08,639
- Without the two of us, - I know.

971
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,739
- they rested and came back down.
- Weren't you guys sleeping?

972
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:14,080
(Baek Hyun sits with his back to Hyeon Ji.)

973
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:15,850
My goodness.

974
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,880
Why are they here?

975
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,450
What did everyone do without sleeping?

976
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:20,990
I washed up.

977
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,059
I had no idea.

978
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,089
Seriously.

979
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:25,960
I was going to go outside,

980
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:30,060
but Yoo Sik, Min Kyung, and Won Kyu came to my room.

981
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,659
So I missed my chance to go outside.

982
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:35,500
I looked at the clock and thought, "I need to go outside."

983
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,939
I couldn't go outside in the end.

984
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,970
Hyeon Ji waited because of me.

985
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:45,779
- Shall we go upstairs?
- Yes.

986
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,579
- Let's go upstairs.
- Good night.

987
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,080
(Baek Hyun couldn't keep his promise with Hyeon Ji.)

988
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,149
It's the first time only men are gathering around.

989
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:53,590
I know. It's the first time.

990
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,689
Why does he worry about other people so much?

991
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:58,659
What? It's too much.

992
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,089
I get it.

993
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:01,889
- But he should've gone outside.
- He should've gone outside.

994
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:03,059
- A promise comes first.
- Seriously.

995
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,269
Other people sneak out to go on a date.

996
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:08,969
- Is that really necessary?
- He's the only one who does that.

997
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:10,739
- Why is he so absorbed?
- It isn't a national secret.

998
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:13,869
He just needed to step outside for a moment.

999
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:14,909
- What was so hard about that?
- He could've said...

1000
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:17,080
- that he was using the bathroom.
- Seriously.

1001
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:20,149
But we should be glad that he was aware of it.

1002
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:22,549
- That's right. He didn't forget.
- He didn't forget.

1003
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:23,979
I'm more annoyed that he didn't forget.

1004
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,149
- I agree.
- Right?

1005
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:27,819
He didn't know what was more important.

1006
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:29,959
- He's inflexible.
- It seems that way.

1007
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:32,089
Right? His priority must be,

1008
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:34,059
"No one must know who my ex is."

1009
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:35,159
- It's engraved in his head.
- It's the biggest priority.

1010
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,260
- He keeps thinking about that.
- Yes.

1011
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,360
Let's go to bed.

1012
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:40,130
I don't know what to do.

1013
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,070
What is it?

1014
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,770
I'm just...

1015
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,540
I was so angry.

1016
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:50,480
I wasn't sullen.

1017
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:56,120
I thought, "Was he so disrespectful of me?"

1018
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,920
I was disappointed about that.

1019
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:11,499
I didn't know why my ex was behaving that way.

1020
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,400
I couldn't adjust to the house.

1021
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:19,000
I felt like the situation was getting worse.

1022
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:21,570
It's a bit hard for me.

1023
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,809
(1st floor, Yoo Sik and Won Kyu's room)

1024
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,380
I hate it now.

1025
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,380
What?

1026
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,519
I feel like it's crashing down.

1027
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,890
You feel like something will happen.

1028
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:38,960
To be honest,

1029
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:43,100
- I don't feel entirely comfortable.
- Of course not.

1030
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:47,330
It's not about whether or not my ex is here.

1031
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:53,110
The time is too short for me to like someone.

1032
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:54,510
You're right.

1033
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:58,380
So I need to get to know everyone, right?

1034
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:01,949
But there is...

1035
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:04,920
- not enough time to do that.
- You're right.

1036
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:07,550
I don't know. Everything is...

1037
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,790
a bit frustrating.

1038
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:15,330
I don't know.

1039
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:17,260
How to act?

1040
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,600
I came here with a bit of hope even though there was...

1041
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,200
no possibility.

1042
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:26,840
I don't know.

1043
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:34,410
(No one knows what the heart wants.)

1044
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:39,150
(Morning comes again.)

1045
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,150
(8:09am, Min Kyung wakes up.)

1046
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,030
(Pounding)

1047
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,930
(Min Kyung's back hurts.)

1048
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,950
(She's done stretching.)

1049
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:22,830
(Min Kyung comes to the kitchen.)

1050
00:54:34,970 --> 00:54:37,910
(She makes breakfast by herself.)

1051
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:46,150
Who is it?

1052
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:49,759
- Hello.
- Hello.

1053
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:50,889
- Hello.
- What are you doing?

1054
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:52,590
I'm bored.

1055
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:53,930
You're drunk?

1056
00:54:53,931 --> 00:54:55,830
I'm bored, so I'm going to cook.

1057
00:54:55,930 --> 00:54:56,960
What are you going to make?

1058
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,300
Omelet rice. Do you want it?

1059
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:00,570
Yes.

1060
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:02,300
Do you cook?

1061
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:03,739
Not really.

1062
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:05,000
Me neither.

1063
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:07,809
But it's coming along nicely.

1064
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:08,840
Really?

1065
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:11,640
There's too much.

1066
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:13,410
Help me.

1067
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:16,010
I'll try it.

1068
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:20,650
It looks tasty.

1069
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,120
Oh, no. Go in there.

1070
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,559
- What's that sauce?
- Oyster sauce.

1071
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,560
Oyster sauce.

1072
00:55:26,561 --> 00:55:28,060
It'll be funny if it's a steak sauce.

1073
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,000
One spoonful.

1074
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:33,870
Shall I add 2 or 3 spoonfuls?

1075
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:37,870
- Two.
- You already added three spoonfuls.

1076
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,440
Is that so?

1077
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,270
Then I'll stop. This will do.

1078
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:45,040
(The omelet rice is complete.)

1079
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:46,949
How did you know I liked omelet rice?

1080
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:48,210
- For real?
- Yes.

1081
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:51,850
- I was starving.
- I'm also hungry in the morning.

1082
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,860
Those who joined late must be having it hard.

1083
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:01,860
Are there no benefits?

1084
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,399
The benefit was our date yesterday.

1085
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,560
Probably.

1086
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:09,400
But how do I put it?

1087
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:11,640
None of us has really adjusted well.

1088
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:13,139
After talking to everyone,

1089
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,740
they're just acting like they have.

1090
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:19,209
I realized yesterday that the guys...

1091
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:22,149
- are acting more cheerful, - Right.

1092
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:23,680
- so it won't be obvious.
- I see.

1093
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:27,089
What I think everyone thinks might actually be different.

1094
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:29,250
After all, I can't read people's minds.

1095
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:34,360
But if I let that bother me, I wouldn't be able to do anything.

1096
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,429
- True.
- That's why...

1097
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:40,000
my feelings and I are fighting each other,

1098
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:42,830
making it impossible to sleep.

1099
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,399
Even if everyone came with determination,

1100
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,439
actually moving in...

1101
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,910
- Different. Yes.
- must have felt different.

1102
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:54,850
(10:49am, Baek Hyun and Woo Jin wake up.)

1103
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,120
(10:53am, Yoo Sik wakes up.)

1104
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:03,360
(Won Kyu is also up.)

1105
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:07,759
I slept really well.

1106
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,760
(11:07am, Yun Nyeong and Ji Yeon wake up.)

1107
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:34,690
Do you have a vacuum cleaner in your room?

1108
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:36,789
- No.
- No?

1109
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:38,220
Hold on.

1110
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:47,270
(At that moment, Ji Hyeon comes inside.)

1111
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:49,940
Later on...

1112
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:52,939
(Sighing)

1113
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:55,510
He's so annoying.

1114
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:58,910
- Have you had breakfast?
- Not yet. I just got ready.

1115
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,550
She's about to lose it.

1116
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,879
She's losing it.

1117
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,080
That scene just now is driving me crazy.

1118
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:08,650
- Min Kyung.
- Yes?

1119
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,560
- Are you okay?
- What?

1120
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:14,130
- Are you okay?
- Of course, I'm fine.

1121
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,830
You know I'm a light sleeper, right?

1122
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,529
Did I do something? Did I swear in my sleep or something?

1123
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:24,270
- You were sleep-talking.
- What did I say?

1124
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:27,039
"How frustrating," is what I heard.

1125
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,610
Seriously? Oh no.

1126
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,510
(Last night)

1127
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:40,820
How frustrating.

1128
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:44,420
(Min Kyung couldn't sleep in peace.)

1129
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:49,029
But you were just as frustrated when you woke up.

1130
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:51,860
Really? That's bad.

1131
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:54,030
Oh, dear. Don't.

1132
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,200
Did I actually talk in my sleep?

1133
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:03,540
I said I was frustrated?

1134
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:05,580
What if I'm blurting out his name every day?

1135
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,110
No? Really? What do I do?

1136
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:13,720
(Min Kyung's time is running backward.)

1137
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:18,090
(Meanwhile, Yoo Sik is...)

1138
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:27,430
(The farewell package he had left in a corner)

1139
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:35,270
(He opens it on the 6th day after moving in.)

1140
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:38,340
I felt the need...

1141
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:41,450
to open it right then.

1142
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:45,050
I needed to find out what was inside.

1143
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:51,160
To settle my own feelings,

1144
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:55,560
I needed to know how Min Kyung had felt.

1145
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:12,980
(Inside the box was a pair of shoes.)

1146
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:20,450
Out of all the birthday gifts I gave Min Kyung,

1147
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:24,790
it was the one she loved the most.

1148
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:31,760
(The gift his ex had loved the most)

1149
01:00:33,470 --> 01:00:35,970
Little did I imagine she'd return...

1150
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:38,400
those shoes.

1151
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:42,370
That pair contained the happiest moment.

1152
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:46,510
It felt like she was giving back that happiest moment.

1153
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:48,250
She is...

1154
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,449
constantly reaffirming the feelings...

1155
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:55,050
I've had all along.

1156
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:58,090
In short, those feelings were right.

1157
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:01,530
Did I have...

1158
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:05,600
my hopes up all by myself?

1159
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:08,870
We're strangers now.

1160
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:20,980
(He's covering up the happiest moment with Min Kyung again.)

1161
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:28,189
I didn't want her to feel bad...

1162
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:30,660
or get hurt again.

1163
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:36,129
The things I've been worried about regarding her...

1164
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:38,860
are settling down one by one.

1165
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:45,040
If I find someone interesting,

1166
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:47,610
I'll actually start getting...

1167
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:49,840
to know them better.

1168
01:01:55,980 --> 01:02:00,150
(Yoo Sik's time flows differently from Min Kyung's.)

1169
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,089
Yoo Sik still has lingering feelings...

1170
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:05,219
- for Min Kyung.
- No, he's not over her yet.

1171
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:07,030
- I doubt he'll be able to move on.
- No.

1172
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:09,429
Isn't Min Kyung also having a hard time letting go?

1173
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:13,469
Yoo Sik has no idea how tough things are for Min Kyung.

1174
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:15,270
I want the two of them to talk soon.

1175
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,640
(1st floor, Yun Nyeong and Ji Yeon's room)

1176
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:37,560
I can't finish this. Something urgent came up.

1177
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,260
- A text message?
- What is it?

1178
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:41,789
Something that's urgent?

1179
01:02:41,790 --> 01:02:43,190
- At that hour?
- A text during the day?

1180
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:47,929
(A curious resident wants to talk to you.)

1181
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,130
(Go to the Talking Room.)

1182
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:54,210
I swear I had no clue what it was about.

1183
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:57,540
Is there really someone curious about me?

1184
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:00,880
I need to leave too.

1185
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:03,780
My heart fluttered. Who could it be?

1186
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:06,550
I suddenly got nervous.

1187
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:10,290
(Last night)

1188
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:18,400
(Only the males received a text message.)

1189
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,429
(You can anonymously talk to anyone you want.)

1190
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:24,770
(Text back the name of that person.)

1191
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:30,910
We can finally have a proper chat.

1192
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:36,310
- Did you send it?
- I did, as soon as I read it.

1193
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:37,580
Right away?

1194
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:39,150
I've always been curious.

1195
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:42,390
I thought long and hard about who I should talk to.

1196
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,320
Am I excited?

1197
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:47,960
I'm more nervous.

1198
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:54,829
(A Group Talking Room has been opened at the request...)

1199
01:03:54,830 --> 01:03:56,870
(of the male residents.)

1200
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:05,140
(Breaking the morning peace,)

1201
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:09,080
(a space full of secrets has opened.)

1202
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:19,319
(Talking Room)

1203
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:20,789
(Group Talking Room)

1204
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,259
- What?
- For real?

1205
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:24,459
- Talking on the phone?
- Why so many phones?

1206
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:25,930
- What's going on?
- What?

1207
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:29,800
(Group Talking Room)

1208
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,140
(Among the many phones, they will hide their identities.)

1209
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:35,970
Are you interested...

1210
01:04:36,270 --> 01:04:39,280
in someone other than your ex?

1211
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,780
(The male residents can ask questions...)

1212
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:47,250
(to only up to two female residents.)

1213
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:51,590
(In a separate room,)

1214
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:56,800
(the males' voices are modified on the phone.)

1215
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:02,030
(Hiding their identities among the numerous phones,)

1216
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:09,140
(a Group Talking Room has been opened.)

1217
01:05:09,370 --> 01:05:13,039
Wait. That means more than one guy can use the Talking Room.

1218
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:15,049
- That Talking Room?
- Yes, that Talking Room.

1219
01:05:15,050 --> 01:05:16,449
If the guys call the same person,

1220
01:05:16,450 --> 01:05:18,119
they'll be on the phone at the same time.

1221
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:20,320
That's why there are so many phones.

1222
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:21,720
This is interesting.

1223
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,230
(First respondent: Yun Nyeong)

1224
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:35,999
Who could it be? I'm really curious.

1225
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,500
It must be Baek Hyun, right?

1226
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,540
I want him to be curious about me.

1227
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:42,540
That's what I thought.

1228
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:49,350
(The phone is ringing.)

1229
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:52,650
Hi.

1230
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:55,520
- Hi.
- How are you today?

1231
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,390
I'm fine.

1232
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,360
You are? That's great.

1233
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:04,799
Do you have questions for me?

1234
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,159
- I do.
- I see.

1235
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:07,230
First off,

1236
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:10,500
why did you break up with your ex?

1237
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:13,040
Why I broke up with my ex?

1238
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:15,240
Let's see.

1239
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:25,720
(One man is curious about Yun Nyeong's last relationship.)

1240
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:32,620
Let's see.

1241
01:06:34,430 --> 01:06:36,830
Our values were too different.

1242
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:39,560
Is that so?

1243
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:45,870
Actually, we went through a lot.

1244
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:48,240
It hurt me a bunch.

1245
01:06:48,810 --> 01:06:52,110
But I gave him a simple answer. "Our values were too different."

1246
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:54,280
It was a hard question to answer.

1247
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,479
Has your determination changed...

1248
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,850
since you moved into the house?

1249
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:04,790
I joined to meet someone new,

1250
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:07,460
and that hasn't changed.

1251
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,530
That means you're over him, right?

1252
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:11,199
No comment.

1253
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,630
No, you must answer it.

1254
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:14,530
What about you?

1255
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:17,269
You can't ask questions.

1256
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:18,870
Why not? There's no such rule.

1257
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:20,710
You can't ask.

1258
01:07:23,810 --> 01:07:25,380
Are there two callers?

1259
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:28,680
For real?

1260
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:31,120
Two, not one?

1261
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:33,319
Who are they?

1262
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:34,420
My guess was that...

1263
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:39,020
one was Baek Hyun...

1264
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,030
and the other was Yoo Sik.

1265
01:07:43,130 --> 01:07:45,029
(As Yun Nyeong guessed,)

1266
01:07:45,030 --> 01:07:48,830
(are the callers Baek Hyun and Yoo Sik?)

1267
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:02,250
(Jae Hyeong chose Yun Nyeong's Talking Room.)

1268
01:08:02,510 --> 01:08:04,850
I asked to call Yun Nyeong.

1269
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:07,719
I wanted to get to know her...

1270
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:09,420
and thought it was a great chance.

1271
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:15,929
(The other person who chose her Talking Room...)

1272
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:17,860
(is Won Kyu.)

1273
01:08:18,130 --> 01:08:20,130
She seemed like a really nice person,

1274
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,900
which made me curious.

1275
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:23,940
And I wanted...

1276
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:26,570
to find out whether she had...

1277
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:29,240
any interest in me.

1278
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:31,380
She came across as a very caring person.

1279
01:08:34,450 --> 01:08:37,780
(The two guys entered Yun Nyeong's Talking Room with curiosity.)

1280
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:42,120
(Yun Nyeong's guesses are wrong.)

1281
01:08:42,150 --> 01:08:43,589
- Seriously?
- What?

1282
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:44,789
It's Won Kyu?

1283
01:08:44,790 --> 01:08:46,319
- He was...
- Baek Hyun isn't there.

1284
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:49,059
- Won Kyu is a surprise.
- Nice.

1285
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:51,330
Baek Hyun didn't choose her?

1286
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:54,229
- Is there one thing...
- Yes?

1287
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:56,670
you can't accept in a partner?

1288
01:08:57,540 --> 01:09:00,200
I find it hard when we have different ways...

1289
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:02,110
of solving problems.

1290
01:09:02,310 --> 01:09:05,780
I also like drinking,

1291
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:08,750
so it'd be tough if my partner couldn't drink at all.

1292
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:10,779
I'm fine if he can only have one glass.

1293
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:13,250
I just want us to enjoy it together.

1294
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:16,890
Is there no one you're interested in?

1295
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:19,560
Who I'm interested in?

1296
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:21,260
No, I do.

1297
01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:27,570
Have you expressed it to him?

1298
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,440
Let's see.

1299
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:32,139
Slightly,

1300
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:34,440
but I'm not sure if the other person noticed.

1301
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:38,110
I'm guessing you're not the proactive type.

1302
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:41,210
No, I usually am like that.

1303
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:46,520
It's just that it's hard not to be careful in here.

1304
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:51,960
You don't have to be careful.

1305
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:55,230
I don't have to be careful?

1306
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:58,930
- Yes.
- Really? Thanks.

1307
01:09:59,230 --> 01:10:00,930
I'll give it my all now.

1308
01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:03,800
I don't know who it was,

1309
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:05,969
but he gave me the courage.

1310
01:10:05,970 --> 01:10:08,040
Whether it was Baek Hyun or not.

1311
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:11,080
It'd be nice if it were Baek Hyun.

1312
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:13,780
I hope it was Baek Hyun.

1313
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:17,319
I really enjoyed our talk.

1314
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:18,349
(Yun Nyeong was encouraged by Jae Hyeong.)

1315
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:19,550
I had fun too.

1316
01:10:19,950 --> 01:10:20,950
Good.

1317
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:24,790
(Choi Yun Nyeong's Talking Room has ended.)

1318
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,530
Nice.

1319
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:30,899
- Gosh, Jae Hyeong.
- "You don't have to be careful."

1320
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:31,959
Don't be.

1321
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:33,099
That was cool.

1322
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:35,699
To me, Won Kyu choosing Yun Nyeong was...

1323
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:37,099
- Why?
- That was new.

1324
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:41,239
Everyone must want to talk to someone they haven't yet.

1325
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:43,539
Yun Nyeong gave Won Kyu an ointment.

1326
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:45,309
- Is that why?
- Yes.

1327
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:48,579
We wondered whether they were exes.

1328
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:49,749
- Exactly.
- We did.

1329
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:51,379
- They really suit each other.
- Yes.

1330
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:53,379
By the way, Baek Hyun didn't choose her.

1331
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:55,849
Why? Because they already talked a lot?

1332
01:10:55,850 --> 01:10:57,390
Maybe because they're already close.

1333
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:05,330
(Baek Hyun has entered someone's Talking Room.)

1334
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:08,570
We'll be having a keyword date.

1335
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:12,070
I already know Yun Nyeong well.

1336
01:11:12,570 --> 01:11:15,810
I was confident I'd find her even without the phone call.

1337
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:21,410
(Who did Baek Hyun choose instead of Yun Nyeong?)

1338
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:28,590
Hello.

1339
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:33,090
The weather was great earlier.

1340
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:34,490
Did you see it?

1341
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:38,360
Is that so?

1342
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:41,500
Really?

1343
01:11:42,470 --> 01:11:44,000
You haven't eaten, right?

1344
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:48,010
Yes.

1345
01:11:49,310 --> 01:11:52,139
It's okay. If you have any questions, just ask.

1346
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:54,850
(The person Baek Hyun wants to know)

1347
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:59,580
Why did you choose me?

1348
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:02,750
Why did you choose me?

1349
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:04,559
- Ji Yeon?
- It's Ji Yeon.

1350
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:05,920
For real?

1351
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:08,660
But they had no points of contact.

1352
01:12:09,430 --> 01:12:12,130
(The person Baek Hyun chose was Ji Yeon.)

1353
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:15,000
I don't know. I was filled with worries.

1354
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:17,870
Worries about me?

1355
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,600
I see.

1356
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:23,510
She doesn't talk much.

1357
01:12:23,670 --> 01:12:27,750
I rarely saw her talking with others.

1358
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:30,749
"Are things emotionally difficult here?"

1359
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:32,320
I wondered.

1360
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:34,090
How do you feel today?

1361
01:12:35,490 --> 01:12:39,420
Because of the nice weather, I'm really happy today.

1362
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:42,429
- Really?
- Yes.

1363
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:44,400
(He didn't expect such an answer.)

1364
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:47,830
Out of 1 to 10, what's the score?

1365
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:50,100
Eight.

1366
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:52,339
- Eight?
- Yes.

1367
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:53,400
Really?

1368
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:55,610
That's good.

1369
01:12:56,370 --> 01:12:57,439
(Baek Hyun got it all wrong.)

1370
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:00,010
It's just that...

1371
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:02,610
everyone gets together quite often.

1372
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:06,450
But you often go to your room...

1373
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:09,450
and spend time alone.

1374
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,260
That has me worried.

1375
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:13,160
- I see.
- Yes.

1376
01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:16,360
You look exhausted too.

1377
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:21,500
Rather than being emotionally tired,

1378
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:24,240
I sleep...

1379
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,840
when I get drunk.

1380
01:13:27,370 --> 01:13:29,039
- Really?
- Yes.

1381
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,510
So that's why you went to bed early last night.

1382
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:36,150
That's right. I drank since dinner last night.

1383
01:13:36,310 --> 01:13:37,550
Really?

1384
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:39,650
Yes.

1385
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:42,890
You use "really?" a lot.

1386
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:45,760
- I do?
- Yes.

1387
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:50,590
(He's about to get busted.)

1388
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,230
I got flustered and couldn't say a thing.

1389
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:57,230
"I'd better stop saying 'really' during this call..."

1390
01:13:57,340 --> 01:14:00,139
"and even afterward."

1391
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:01,640
That was all I could think about.

1392
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:08,650
(He's at a loss for words.)

1393
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:11,420
Do you think that we've talked a lot?

1394
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:14,050
I can't say that we haven't talked,

1395
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,990
but we haven't talked a lot.

1396
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:20,389
When I talk to the other person in private,

1397
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:23,160
it's easier for me to get close to him.

1398
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:25,830
- In that case, - Yes.

1399
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:29,130
I'll come to talk to you.

1400
01:14:29,670 --> 01:14:31,370
- Okay.
- Okay.

1401
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:33,500
- See you back in the house.
- Bye.

1402
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:38,840
(Hong Ji Yeon's Talking Room has ended.)

1403
01:14:44,150 --> 01:14:48,050
(Yoo Sik entered the Talking Room.)

1404
01:14:51,090 --> 01:14:53,890
There are many questions that I couldn't normally ask.

1405
01:14:54,530 --> 01:14:57,700
She might have things that she couldn't say.

1406
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:03,930
I was curious about how she felt.

1407
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:10,710
(Who is the person that Yoo Sik is curious about?)

1408
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:16,080
Hello.

1409
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,080
Hello.

1410
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:22,720
Hello.

1411
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:26,860
(Yoo Sik picked Ji Hyeon.)

1412
01:15:30,330 --> 01:15:31,600
Were you waiting for a long time?

1413
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:34,430
Were you waiting for a long time?

1414
01:15:36,970 --> 01:15:38,800
- A little.
- A little?

1415
01:15:39,470 --> 01:15:40,470
Yes.

1416
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:42,510
I felt very grateful.

1417
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:44,580
Who could it be?

1418
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:48,150
Someone I want to talk to? It's Yoo Sik.

1419
01:15:51,050 --> 01:15:55,220
(The two of them are curious about each other.)

1420
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:57,290
Ask me any questions you have.

1421
01:15:58,690 --> 01:16:00,589
What do you want to do the most...

1422
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:03,030
on a date with someone you're interested in?

1423
01:16:04,130 --> 01:16:05,929
I want to go...

1424
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:08,530
on a date that isn't typical.

1425
01:16:13,170 --> 01:16:16,110
Hello, can I drop the honorifics?

1426
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:19,580
(She heard another voice.)

1427
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:23,150
I heard a thin voice at the same time.

1428
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:24,380
Who could it be?

1429
01:16:29,090 --> 01:16:31,260
(Jae Hyeong also picked Ji Hyeon.)

1430
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:34,660
Based on my first impression of her, I was the most curious about her.

1431
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:37,390
I wanted to talk to her.

1432
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:45,299
I thought,

1433
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:47,770
"Did my call get mixed up with another call?"

1434
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:50,410
Then I realized that there were others on the line.

1435
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,610
It made me very nervous.

1436
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:58,149
(Two men...)

1437
01:16:58,150 --> 01:17:00,950
(who are curious about Ji Hyeon)

1438
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:03,150
What's your ideal type of men?

1439
01:17:03,650 --> 01:17:07,089
It's someone who's fun, sincere, witty,

1440
01:17:07,090 --> 01:17:10,559
sweet, and sophisticated.

1441
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,560
It's difficult, isn't it?

1442
01:17:11,561 --> 01:17:13,199
(The 5 virtues of an ideal boyfriend)

1443
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,430
So he has to be perfect in every way?

1444
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:17,300
No, he doesn't have to be perfect.

1445
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:20,469
Even if he has flaws, I'm okay with them...

1446
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:23,240
as long as I find them cute.

1447
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,750
What's your ideal type physically?

1448
01:17:28,650 --> 01:17:30,750
Someone with good proportions.

1449
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:34,079
(He is...)

1450
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,390
(well-proportioned.)

1451
01:17:35,490 --> 01:17:36,890
Someone with a beautiful smile.

1452
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,459
(He has a beautiful smile.)

1453
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:43,660
When I start a relationship with someone,

1454
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:47,030
it has to be someone I trust.

1455
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:49,670
That's what reassures me.

1456
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:55,540
Is there your ideal type among the men here?

1457
01:17:56,010 --> 01:17:57,640
There's someone who's close to it.

1458
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:00,080
Not your ex?

1459
01:18:02,410 --> 01:18:03,950
No, not my ex.

1460
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:12,820
Was your ex close to your ideal type?

1461
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:19,000
My ex is a little different...

1462
01:18:20,130 --> 01:18:21,500
from my ideal type.

1463
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:25,840
"Is Yoo Sik asking me questions?"

1464
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:28,110
"Is he wary of my ex?"

1465
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:30,110
When I thought that,

1466
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:32,780
it made me feel good.

1467
01:18:34,850 --> 01:18:36,450
It must sound contradictory.

1468
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:49,660
My ideal type is just something ideal.

1469
01:18:56,300 --> 01:19:02,170
(There's another person in the Talking Room.)

1470
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:08,479
(Won Kyu also came into Ji Hyeon's Talking Room.)

1471
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:09,650
Gosh, he's listening.

1472
01:19:10,950 --> 01:19:13,019
- My goodness.
- Is he listening quietly?

1473
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:15,619
Isn't this a thriller?

1474
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:16,989
He wasn't saying anything on purpose.

1475
01:19:16,990 --> 01:19:18,759
- I guess you can do that.
- Right.

1476
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:21,389
You can just listen without asking questions.

1477
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:23,629
By listening to other people's conversation,

1478
01:19:23,630 --> 01:19:27,669
you can find out how your ex feels about you.

1479
01:19:27,670 --> 01:19:28,929
This is unbelievable.

1480
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:29,930
- Right.
- Oh, my.

1481
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:31,739
It's better for the ex not to say anything.

1482
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:33,339
Staying quiet is strategic.

1483
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:34,739
- That's nice.
- Unbelievable.

1484
01:19:34,740 --> 01:19:37,340
That's a way to make use of it.

1485
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:42,149
(Won Kyu also came into Ji Hyeon's Talking Room.)

1486
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:44,080
As long as he's attractive...

1487
01:19:44,450 --> 01:19:48,520
and I like spending time with him...

1488
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:51,990
As long as we get along, and he's a good person,

1489
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:53,660
I'd be happy with him.

1490
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:04,900
Do you still have feelings for your ex?

1491
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:12,280
We've already broken up.

1492
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:17,279
Do you feel different from how you felt...

1493
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,380
when you moved in?

1494
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:20,879
I think so.

1495
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:21,950
How so?

1496
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:24,460
When I moved in,

1497
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:29,460
I was open to the possibility of getting back with my ex.

1498
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:32,830
But now, I am...

1499
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:38,770
less open.

1500
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:48,450
Why did you break up with your ex?

1501
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:55,690
There were some practical issues.

1502
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:07,970
I didn't feel like he truly loved me.

1503
01:21:37,730 --> 01:21:42,400
(Ji Hyeon and Won Kyu's story will be revealed.)

1504
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:44,939
- Gosh, so it's finally here.
- This is...

1505
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:46,699
- Thank you so much.
- I knew it was about to happen.

1506
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:48,439
- I agree.
- I knew it was coming.

1507
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:50,109
- This is what we need to hear.
- Let's go.

1508
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:52,509
- This is crazy.
- Thank you so much.

1509
01:21:52,510 --> 01:21:55,650
- I've been so curious about them.
- I got goosebumps.

1510
01:21:56,010 --> 01:22:00,620
(Ji Hyeon and Won Kyu's story will be revealed.)

1511
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:07,490
(A week ago in Seongsu-dong)

1512
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:16,500
(Won Kyu hasn't arrived yet.)

1513
01:22:42,230 --> 01:22:43,290
Hello.

1514
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:53,500
Hello.

1515
01:22:55,570 --> 01:22:56,710
How have you been?

1516
01:22:59,610 --> 01:23:01,310
What do you think?

1517
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:05,020
You told me that you were teaching at the school...

1518
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:07,250
where you went to.

1519
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:08,950
You remember that?

1520
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:10,090
I do.

1521
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:14,289
You look better than before.

1522
01:23:14,290 --> 01:23:15,330
- Really?
- Yes.

1523
01:23:17,630 --> 01:23:18,830
It's you who looks better.

1524
01:23:18,930 --> 01:23:20,430
You look much better than me.

1525
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:22,599
It seems like you're doing very well.

1526
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,130
I have a hard time sleeping.

1527
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:27,670
Why are you so nervous?

1528
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:29,439
It's nerve-racking.

1529
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:30,940
I haven't seen you in a while.

1530
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:33,610
I don't know how you feel also.

1531
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:41,750
Last time, you told me that you erased me from your memory.

1532
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:44,220
I erased you completely.

1533
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:48,260
Do you still remember me now?

1534
01:23:51,630 --> 01:23:53,400
- Do you want to know?
- Yes.

1535
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:55,770
It's a secret.

1536
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:57,800
What about you?

1537
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,970
- What about me?
- What is it like for you?

1538
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:05,110
What do you mean? I never erased you from my memory.

1539
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:07,010
I see.

1540
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:17,420
(The memories of us erased from our mind)

1541
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:21,890
From August 2023...

1542
01:24:22,330 --> 01:24:25,099
Up to between spring and summer of 2024.

1543
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:26,400
We were in a relationship during that time.

1544
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:28,870
This is how we met.

1545
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:30,830
I was introduced to her.

1546
01:24:31,670 --> 01:24:34,070
When we were deciding where to meet,

1547
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:35,910
we hit it off right away.

1548
01:24:36,670 --> 01:24:38,810
I thought that he'd be very similar to me...

1549
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,709
and that his MBTI would be similar to mine.

1550
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:43,010
When I went out to meet him,

1551
01:24:43,810 --> 01:24:46,120
he was wearing flip-flops.

1552
01:24:49,650 --> 01:24:50,650
"Look at this guy."

1553
01:24:52,090 --> 01:24:55,260
I thought that it'd be awkward to dress up...

1554
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:57,430
just to meet someone.

1555
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:00,430
Plus, it was hot that day.

1556
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:03,570
A white t-shirt, jeans, and flip-flops.

1557
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:07,839
He doesn't care at all about...

1558
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:08,940
what others think of him.

1559
01:25:09,070 --> 01:25:11,280
I didn't like him at first.

1560
01:25:11,610 --> 01:25:14,779
I thought that she was very pretty.

1561
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:17,150
She didn't seem superficial.

1562
01:25:17,310 --> 01:25:19,820
I thought that I should definitely go out with her.

1563
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:23,819
At first, we just had a meal and went to a cafe.

1564
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:25,460
Things were a bit awkward between us.

1565
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:28,489
We didn't see each other for quite a while after our second meeting.

1566
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:29,789
I don't remember clearly.

1567
01:25:29,790 --> 01:25:32,860
On Kakaotalk messenger, he sounded very disappointed.

1568
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:36,830
He asked me to have a drink with him on our third meeting.

1569
01:25:37,130 --> 01:25:38,969
I agreed to it.

1570
01:25:38,970 --> 01:25:40,670
When we went out for drinks,

1571
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,340
it was so much fun talking to him.

1572
01:25:44,070 --> 01:25:46,009
We drank quite a lot together.

1573
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:49,079
We had about 2 to 3 bottles each.

1574
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:51,480
I wanted to see her more often and get closer to her.

1575
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,050
"When will you drop the honorifics? Hurry and do it."

1576
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:55,150
I said okay.

1577
01:25:55,220 --> 01:25:56,849
As we were drinking,

1578
01:25:56,850 --> 01:25:58,790
we started having a real conversation.

1579
01:25:59,090 --> 01:26:01,929
That cold and aloof image he had...

1580
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:04,800
as if he looked down on people...

1581
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:06,530
faded away.

1582
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:10,070
He talked to me about his family including his younger sibling.

1583
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:12,600
I realized that he was more affectionate than I'd thought.

1584
01:26:12,770 --> 01:26:15,970
I thought that he'd be good to those who are close to him.

1585
01:26:16,310 --> 01:26:18,910
That's when I got interested in him much more.

1586
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:22,850
What I remember the most isn't our conversation.

1587
01:26:23,010 --> 01:26:25,450
While I was taking her back home,

1588
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:29,150
we held hands for the first time.

1589
01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:33,259
I don't think it was me who grabbed her hand.

1590
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:35,660
He strongly denies it,

1591
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:37,060
but he grabbed my hand.

1592
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:38,760
My ex did.

1593
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:43,529
(After several more meetings, their relationship started.)

1594
01:26:43,530 --> 01:26:45,439
When I confess my feelings for her,

1595
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:48,070
she wanted me to give her flowers and a letter.

1596
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:51,879
He said that he's never written a letter...

1597
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:53,380
or given flowers to a girl.

1598
01:26:53,710 --> 01:26:56,449
Originally, I asked him to write me a poem in the letter.

1599
01:26:56,450 --> 01:27:00,550
He couldn't write a poem, so he wrote me a letter instead.

1600
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,449
"Let me tell you the reasons why I like you."

1601
01:27:03,450 --> 01:27:06,760
"First, second, third..."

1602
01:27:06,820 --> 01:27:08,629
Just like his personality,

1603
01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:10,930
his letter was simple and straightforward.

1604
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:13,830
That's how it started.

1605
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:18,200
We decided to call it our first day.

1606
01:27:20,070 --> 01:27:21,870
I had never met anyone in his line work.

1607
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:23,839
His MBTI was the complete opposite of mine.

1608
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:25,809
We come from very different backgrounds.

1609
01:27:25,810 --> 01:27:29,950
My doubts about our relationship completely disappeared.

1610
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:34,250
Our relationship was amazing and childlike.

1611
01:27:40,620 --> 01:27:42,390
He often acted very funny.

1612
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:47,760
This is hard.

1613
01:27:48,470 --> 01:27:50,470
You're so cute.

1614
01:27:51,570 --> 01:27:54,000
There were so many places that my ex wanted to visit.

1615
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,740
Places that you'd never go alone.

1616
01:27:56,870 --> 01:27:59,040
Let's do things that we've never done before.

1617
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:02,149
We went to an elementary school...

1618
01:28:02,150 --> 01:28:03,950
and hung from a pull-up bar.

1619
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:07,980
A suspicious-looking billiard hall.

1620
01:28:08,650 --> 01:28:09,820
"Why don't we go there?"

1621
01:28:10,220 --> 01:28:12,260
It made her very happy.

1622
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:15,190
I wanted to take her to places that she might like.

1623
01:28:16,390 --> 01:28:19,699
(They laughed whenever they were together.)

1624
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:27,069
(Their childlike relationship)

1625
01:28:27,070 --> 01:28:30,509
"Yes, love is being silly with someone."

1626
01:28:30,510 --> 01:28:32,140
That's what I thought.

1627
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,110
When we were together,

1628
01:28:35,410 --> 01:28:38,580
it felt like we could do anything.

1629
01:28:38,850 --> 01:28:40,379
(I am happy these days. Thank you, Won Kyu.)

1630
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:42,950
I was very happy that I felt overwhelmed.

1631
01:28:43,290 --> 01:28:45,259
I was very grateful.

1632
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:46,689
(Let's continue to grow together...)

1633
01:28:46,690 --> 01:28:48,360
(and be a good influence to each other.)

1634
01:28:48,430 --> 01:28:49,889
They were a cute and cheerful couple...

1635
01:28:49,890 --> 01:28:50,959
- based on their story.
- I agree.

1636
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,529
I bet they're very playful.

1637
01:28:52,530 --> 01:28:53,959
- Right.
- They're cute.

1638
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:55,769
I didn't expect them to be a couple,

1639
01:28:55,770 --> 01:28:57,530
- but they make a good match.
- It seems that way.

1640
01:28:57,970 --> 01:29:01,770
Here's what I think.

1641
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:05,680
She was in a situation where she had a lot to think about.

1642
01:29:06,710 --> 01:29:08,310
When I was in middle school,

1643
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:10,750
my father passed away due to cancer.

1644
01:29:10,910 --> 01:29:13,350
I became very serious at a young age.

1645
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:16,590
Since I'm an only child, I was sitting at the funeral with my mom.

1646
01:29:17,090 --> 01:29:18,560
People at the funeral said,

1647
01:29:18,890 --> 01:29:20,220
"Oh, no."

1648
01:29:21,090 --> 01:29:23,430
"I feel so bad for you."

1649
01:29:24,430 --> 01:29:26,130
Despite being young, I had a sense of pride.

1650
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:29,100
I thought, "Why should I be pitied..."

1651
01:29:29,630 --> 01:29:30,930
"just because my dad died?"

1652
01:29:31,530 --> 01:29:33,870
I felt indignant about it.

1653
01:29:34,270 --> 01:29:36,470
That's when I started having a lot of worries.

1654
01:29:37,470 --> 01:29:39,239
"How should I live from now on?"

1655
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:42,850
(How should I live from now on?)

1656
01:29:43,350 --> 01:29:46,279
While being determined to prove myself,

1657
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:48,690
I entered an arts high school.

1658
01:29:49,090 --> 01:29:51,089
While participating in many activities,

1659
01:29:51,090 --> 01:29:53,689
I tried to prove myself to people.

1660
01:29:53,690 --> 01:29:56,890
I did my best to be recognized and be praised.

1661
01:29:57,390 --> 01:29:59,859
She moved to Seoul by herself at a young age.

1662
01:29:59,860 --> 01:30:01,929
She stayed out of trouble...

1663
01:30:01,930 --> 01:30:05,700
and even got into a reputable university for acting.

1664
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:08,040
I was very impressed by that.

1665
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:11,679
She wanted to stay on the right track.

1666
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:12,780
That's what I found...

1667
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:14,680
amazing about her.

1668
01:30:16,150 --> 01:30:18,779
"People with some kind of deficiency aren't compatible with me."

1669
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:20,979
"I'd rather be with someone who grew up being loved."

1670
01:30:20,980 --> 01:30:23,050
That's what many people want.

1671
01:30:23,550 --> 01:30:25,520
However, my ex didn't have...

1672
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:29,030
any prejudice or feelings against my background.

1673
01:30:29,490 --> 01:30:30,660
He said, "You went through a lot."

1674
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:34,800
"You're amazing. You did well."

1675
01:30:35,070 --> 01:30:38,440
That's what made me open up to him even more.

1676
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:44,739
(Won Kyu understood Ji Hyeon as she was.)

1677
01:30:44,740 --> 01:30:49,150
(Won Kyu understood Ji Hyeon as she was.)

1678
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:52,480
I felt like he understood me and accepted me completely...

1679
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:55,650
during our conversations.

1680
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:57,120
I felt very grateful.

1681
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:01,060
I'd be able to marry someone like him.

1682
01:31:04,630 --> 01:31:06,300
- I'll use it during our wedding.
- Happy birthday to me.

1683
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,670
Happy birthday to you.

1684
01:31:10,530 --> 01:31:11,800
I'm filming Jung Won Kyu.

1685
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:15,270
I'll use it later.

1686
01:31:18,610 --> 01:31:20,510
We hadn't started preparing for the wedding,

1687
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:22,710
but we had it in mind.

1688
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,550
We started to discuss it.

1689
01:31:25,050 --> 01:31:26,980
I told my mom about it.

1690
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:30,350
She came to Seoul to meet him.

1691
01:31:30,890 --> 01:31:32,490
We had a meal together.

1692
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:35,160
You know those meetings where you announce your wedding?

1693
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:36,760
He introduced me as someone...

1694
01:31:37,830 --> 01:31:39,200
whom he was going to marry.

1695
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:44,970
(Little by little, they were dreaming of getting married.)

1696
01:31:45,140 --> 01:31:47,539
They were planning to get married.

1697
01:31:47,540 --> 01:31:49,139
Their love seems more mature.

1698
01:31:49,140 --> 01:31:50,209
You're right.

1699
01:31:50,210 --> 01:31:52,939
They thought about getting married during their ten-month relationship.

1700
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:55,779
- Right.
- Compared to any long relationship,

1701
01:31:55,780 --> 01:31:57,679
- On top of that...
- it must've been quite serious.

1702
01:31:57,680 --> 01:32:00,449
Then why did she feel that his love wasn't sincere?

1703
01:32:00,450 --> 01:32:02,349
- I know.
- What happened between them?

1704
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:04,889
She said that she erased him completely from her memory.

1705
01:32:04,890 --> 01:32:06,020
That's what I want to know.

1706
01:32:10,990 --> 01:32:12,800
This feels awkward.

1707
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,929
Is your mother doing well?

1708
01:32:16,930 --> 01:32:19,600
My mom? She's doing well.

1709
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:24,340
(She asks after his family after a long time.)

1710
01:32:24,570 --> 01:32:28,240
Is there anything you want to know about me?

1711
01:32:32,950 --> 01:32:33,950
I guess not.

1712
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:37,520
There were good times,

1713
01:32:37,820 --> 01:32:40,959
but there were also times when we felt...

1714
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:43,260
that we were two completely different people.

1715
01:32:43,430 --> 01:32:45,799
When I was dating him,

1716
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:49,329
I had mustered up my courage to quit acting.

1717
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:52,400
Instead, I wanted to study journalism a little more.

1718
01:32:52,570 --> 01:32:54,139
I knew it was a little late in my life,

1719
01:32:54,140 --> 01:32:55,910
but I wanted to try out a new career path.

1720
01:32:56,110 --> 01:32:59,210
Then I became unemployed.

1721
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:01,879
She was preparing to become an announcer.

1722
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:06,450
She told me by when she was aiming to become an announcer.

1723
01:33:06,620 --> 01:33:09,149
But we couldn't be certain when that would be.

1724
01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:11,690
So we both felt a little insecure about the future.

1725
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:15,290
We both started to think that talking about our future...

1726
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:17,690
seemed a little far-fetched.

1727
01:33:18,090 --> 01:33:19,859
I might tear up.

1728
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:22,599
It's not something serious. It just makes me sad. That's all.

1729
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:25,170
Anyway, he has a specialized career. So he has friends...

1730
01:33:27,370 --> 01:33:29,339
who married...

1731
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:31,240
quite well.

1732
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:34,010
He was casually telling me about his friends.

1733
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:36,679
"My friend is marrying this girl."

1734
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:38,550
"Her family opened a clinic for him."

1735
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:43,090
I asked him if he was expecting me to do the same.

1736
01:33:43,890 --> 01:33:46,560
He told me that he didn't.

1737
01:33:46,860 --> 01:33:48,860
He doesn't have a twisted mind.

1738
01:33:49,130 --> 01:33:53,160
He was simply telling me what he heard about his friend.

1739
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:55,269
But I'm both an N and F type.

1740
01:33:55,270 --> 01:33:57,970
So I snowballed it in my head.

1741
01:33:58,470 --> 01:34:00,140
I kept telling him that I was sorry.

1742
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:02,710
After experiencing this,

1743
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:04,809
I wondered if it was better...

1744
01:34:04,810 --> 01:34:08,440
for him to date a woman who could open a clinic for him.

1745
01:34:09,350 --> 01:34:11,350
I wondered if that was better for his sake.

1746
01:34:14,420 --> 01:34:16,589
(Ji Hyeon's situation made it hard for her to accept what he said...)

1747
01:34:16,590 --> 01:34:19,690
(without feeling insecure.)

1748
01:34:20,590 --> 01:34:22,630
I might be thinking like a teacher.

1749
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:25,860
But when she decided to change her career path,

1750
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:29,470
I wanted her to give her all to become an announcer.

1751
01:34:29,630 --> 01:34:34,270
I wanted her to focus on nothing but that.

1752
01:34:35,510 --> 01:34:37,670
While preparing to become an announcer,

1753
01:34:38,270 --> 01:34:40,479
there were other things she had to take care of.

1754
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:44,110
It seemed that she was trying to make every option available.

1755
01:34:44,150 --> 01:34:47,450
It came across to me that she wasn't giving her all to it.

1756
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:49,220
That was how I felt then.

1757
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:54,160
Even if it doesn't bear fruit immediately,

1758
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:56,660
as long as I know it would help me in the long run,

1759
01:34:56,830 --> 01:34:58,559
I don't hesitate to go for it.

1760
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:02,130
I guess you could say I'm a go-getter.

1761
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:04,899
But my ex valued stability.

1762
01:35:04,900 --> 01:35:08,810
Personality-wise, it seemed she sought after changes.

1763
01:35:09,710 --> 01:35:12,340
Anyway, I couldn't help but feel our relationship...

1764
01:35:12,710 --> 01:35:16,810
would be difficult to develop into something marriage-worthy.

1765
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:18,350
When I realized that,

1766
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:21,620
I started...

1767
01:35:23,390 --> 01:35:24,950
to think that...

1768
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:28,690
there could be someone who was a better match for me.

1769
01:35:31,330 --> 01:35:36,800
(The two of them faced the harsh reality of marriage.)

1770
01:35:36,970 --> 01:35:40,300
Because of that, our personality differences stood out more.

1771
01:35:40,540 --> 01:35:42,610
Then we got into a fight.

1772
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:46,010
Back then, we were going through a few things.

1773
01:35:46,310 --> 01:35:49,250
"You said that. That's what you said."

1774
01:35:49,380 --> 01:35:50,979
"This is who I've always been."

1775
01:35:50,980 --> 01:35:52,749
"I was trying to understand you."

1776
01:35:52,750 --> 01:35:56,520
I remember yelling and having a huge fight over the phone.

1777
01:35:56,750 --> 01:35:58,320
Then I got a long text message.

1778
01:35:59,890 --> 01:36:01,320
"At first,"

1779
01:36:02,130 --> 01:36:04,930
"I was drawn by your bright and positive personality..."

1780
01:36:05,630 --> 01:36:08,030
"and the sense of resilience of how you braved through hard times."

1781
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:10,300
"So I thought you were cool..."

1782
01:36:11,170 --> 01:36:12,939
"and fell in love with you."

1783
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:16,410
"But lately, you've only been whining..."

1784
01:36:17,310 --> 01:36:18,640
"and become a negative person."

1785
01:36:20,140 --> 01:36:22,210
"I don't know how to accept..."

1786
01:36:24,710 --> 01:36:27,050
"the way you've changed."

1787
01:36:27,620 --> 01:36:30,850
"I'm not sure if we should stay together."

1788
01:36:31,990 --> 01:36:34,490
I wrote, "It sounds like you want to break up."

1789
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,430
That's what I wrote back.

1790
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:42,300
"Yes. Let's break up." He texted me that immediately.

1791
01:36:48,070 --> 01:36:49,670
I thought...

1792
01:36:50,970 --> 01:36:53,940
our relationship was stronger than this.

1793
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:56,050
But he told me so easily he wanted to break up.

1794
01:36:57,350 --> 01:36:59,650
I dreamed of...

1795
01:37:01,420 --> 01:37:04,050
building a future and spending my life with him.

1796
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:05,760
I wondered...

1797
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:10,060
if I was fooling myself or being greedy.

1798
01:37:11,430 --> 01:37:12,660
So I accepted it.

1799
01:37:15,430 --> 01:37:21,140
(Just like that, their time together came to an end.)

1800
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:22,669
My gosh.

1801
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:23,909
That's bitter.

1802
01:37:23,910 --> 01:37:25,679
- Marriage was in the picture.
- Right.

1803
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:27,709
But they broke up over a long text?

1804
01:37:27,710 --> 01:37:29,279
A personality match is important.

1805
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:31,279
But facing practical problems...

1806
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:32,649
- Right.
- damages the relationship more.

1807
01:37:32,650 --> 01:37:34,119
- Practical problems... Right.
- Things didn't align.

1808
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:36,349
Personally, this kind of breakup affects...

1809
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:38,519
more deeply than a breakup of a long-term relationship.

1810
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:40,389
I'm not trying to pick a side.

1811
01:37:40,390 --> 01:37:41,789
- I can understand both of them.
- Right.

1812
01:37:41,790 --> 01:37:43,359
- Right. Totally.
- I can understand both sides.

1813
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:44,829
- Right.
- That wasn't the only problem.

1814
01:37:44,830 --> 01:37:46,129
- Right.
- Their personalities...

1815
01:37:46,130 --> 01:37:47,259
were also very different.

1816
01:37:47,260 --> 01:37:50,069
But on top of that, they faced practical problems.

1817
01:37:50,070 --> 01:37:52,199
They were happy together, but they might not have been...

1818
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:53,769
each other's best match.

1819
01:37:53,770 --> 01:37:55,039
- Right.
- He kept thinking...

1820
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:56,669
about that possibility.

1821
01:37:56,670 --> 01:37:57,769
- This is a practical problem...
- Right.

1822
01:37:57,770 --> 01:37:59,309
- couples face. Right.
- It really is.

1823
01:37:59,310 --> 01:38:00,540
Nothing can be done.

1824
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:08,890
I think it's hard for me...

1825
01:38:09,390 --> 01:38:11,290
to be content with what I have.

1826
01:38:11,590 --> 01:38:13,760
You think through things more than anyone I know.

1827
01:38:14,060 --> 01:38:15,559
- It sounds like criticism.
- No.

1828
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:17,690
You think about your future more than anyone I know.

1829
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:20,630
Right.

1830
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:24,599
There are so many things I want to do. And I'm still young.

1831
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:25,670
I see.

1832
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:28,470
How do you think it will be? Do you think it will be fun?

1833
01:38:29,940 --> 01:38:31,739
I think it will be fun.

1834
01:38:31,740 --> 01:38:33,210
I think you'll manage well...

1835
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:35,450
when we move in.

1836
01:38:36,780 --> 01:38:38,250
You will too.

1837
01:38:38,710 --> 01:38:40,949
I have a hard time getting along with people at first.

1838
01:38:40,950 --> 01:38:42,050
No.

1839
01:38:42,450 --> 01:38:44,390
You only say that, but you'll get along with everyone.

1840
01:38:45,820 --> 01:38:47,060
I hope that's the case.

1841
01:38:50,330 --> 01:38:52,530
You do get along well with people. You have many friends.

1842
01:38:53,630 --> 01:38:55,130
You have no problems hanging out with girls.

1843
01:38:58,030 --> 01:38:59,369
When did I do that?

1844
01:38:59,370 --> 01:39:00,570
But you do hang out with them.

1845
01:39:02,370 --> 01:39:05,580
You have a nice personality, so you have a lot of female friends.

1846
01:39:15,690 --> 01:39:17,090
I'll be happy there.

1847
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:20,120
- I hope you will be too.
- Okay.

1848
01:39:26,130 --> 01:39:31,970
(Before moving in, they had to reveal their true feelings.)

1849
01:39:37,540 --> 01:39:41,679
I've been thinking about what kind of person...

1850
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:43,410
I'm drawn to these days.

1851
01:39:43,550 --> 01:39:46,819
"No one can be perfect and match everything I look for in women."

1852
01:39:46,820 --> 01:39:48,850
I've been coming to that conclusion little by little.

1853
01:39:48,990 --> 01:39:51,849
So I realized that my ex...

1854
01:39:51,850 --> 01:39:55,590
was a good match for me.

1855
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:03,200
(Won Kyu is leaning more toward to getting back with her.)

1856
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:06,340
I must think about this a bit more while I observe the situation.

1857
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:08,799
- Really?
- Really?

1858
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:10,909
- That's why he was in there.
- Yes.

1859
01:40:10,910 --> 01:40:11,969
- That's why he was...
- He had that in mind.

1860
01:40:11,970 --> 01:40:13,339
- He was listening.
- listening.

1861
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:14,580
He was curious.

1862
01:40:16,850 --> 01:40:19,880
I really don't know how to describe this feeling.

1863
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:22,890
But we had a good relationship.

1864
01:40:23,090 --> 01:40:25,190
It's not like I can't stand the sight of him.

1865
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:30,460
But I just hate him.

1866
01:40:30,690 --> 01:40:32,760
There's a sense of hatred.

1867
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:36,630
(Won Kyu's heart is at 5 o'clock. Ji Hyeon's heart is at 8 o'clock.)

1868
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:38,799
(Won Kyu is more interested in reuniting with her,)

1869
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:41,500
(whereas Ji Hyeon is more interested in meeting someone new.)

1870
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:42,970
Despite everything,

1871
01:40:43,970 --> 01:40:46,740
we've known each other much longer. Is there someone...

1872
01:40:47,010 --> 01:40:48,580
who interests you more than me?

1873
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:52,580
There's a sense of excitement with someone new.

1874
01:40:55,420 --> 01:40:57,420
There are people...

1875
01:40:58,490 --> 01:41:00,360
who are very different from you.

1876
01:41:00,590 --> 01:41:02,090
So that made me a bit sad.

1877
01:41:02,190 --> 01:41:05,030
"Everyone except for me had such loving relationships?"

1878
01:41:07,130 --> 01:41:11,970
(Ji Hyeon and Won Kyu, from August 2023 to June 2024)

1879
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:16,509
(And...)

1880
01:41:16,510 --> 01:41:18,939
(it's been 1 year since their breakup.)

1881
01:41:18,940 --> 01:41:20,210
Hello.

1882
01:41:21,680 --> 01:41:23,580
The first person I locked eyes with...

1883
01:41:24,210 --> 01:41:25,980
was my ex.

1884
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:28,319
- Hello.
- "Wait. He's here."

1885
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:30,620
- I thought he wouldn't be there.
- Hello.

1886
01:41:31,450 --> 01:41:33,019
- It just felt weird.
- Hello.

1887
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:34,660
When we met in the house,

1888
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:38,330
we had to introduce ourselves as if we didn't know each other.

1889
01:41:38,430 --> 01:41:40,200
It's not something we ever had to.

1890
01:41:40,330 --> 01:41:42,470
- It was awkward.
- You can take a seat.

1891
01:41:44,370 --> 01:41:47,099
Honestly, I thought that he wouldn't be here from the start.

1892
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:48,270
But he was there.

1893
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:51,210
I thought, "I would have to think about a lot of things."

1894
01:41:52,340 --> 01:41:56,110
(On their first night, he read his introduction from her.)

1895
01:41:57,410 --> 01:42:01,320
(Lastly, my ex has lived his life so diligently and fiercely.)

1896
01:42:02,050 --> 01:42:07,220
(I hope he can meet someone better and more mature than me.)

1897
01:42:15,460 --> 01:42:21,140
(He broke into tears.)

1898
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:36,020
All of a sudden, he burst into tears.

1899
01:42:36,950 --> 01:42:38,049
It was really tough...

1900
01:42:38,050 --> 01:42:40,120
trying to hold back my tears when I saw that.

1901
01:42:41,590 --> 01:42:43,930
"Why did he cry when he read what I wrote?"

1902
01:42:51,470 --> 01:42:55,440
If she had to give something back to me,

1903
01:42:56,610 --> 01:42:59,480
I did think that she would pick the hoodie.

1904
01:43:04,150 --> 01:43:06,049
If we weren't getting back together,

1905
01:43:06,050 --> 01:43:08,250
just looking at the hoodie...

1906
01:43:09,090 --> 01:43:10,589
would make me very sad.

1907
01:43:10,590 --> 01:43:12,960
It would feel like a loose end of my relationship.

1908
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:15,089
It would just make me feel uncomfortable.

1909
01:43:15,090 --> 01:43:16,829
There wasn't anything I wanted to return to her.

1910
01:43:16,830 --> 01:43:17,989
So it was an empty box.

1911
01:43:17,990 --> 01:43:19,260
(Won Kyu sent her an empty box.)

1912
01:43:19,830 --> 01:43:24,100
It was a reminder of what we had exchanged.

1913
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:25,900
It really felt awful.

1914
01:43:27,570 --> 01:43:29,370
The fact that I didn't give her anything...

1915
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:32,880
might make her think that I didn't want to get back with her.

1916
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:37,079
Why did he send her an empty box? What was he thinking?

1917
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:39,419
Did it mean that he didn't want to give anything back...

1918
01:43:39,420 --> 01:43:41,219
and he wanted to keep everything instead?

1919
01:43:41,220 --> 01:43:42,220
- Is that so?
- Was it...

1920
01:43:42,221 --> 01:43:44,719
a signal that he was open to reuniting?

1921
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:45,859
- "I'll keep everything..." - Is that what he meant?

1922
01:43:45,860 --> 01:43:46,959
"that has any memories..."

1923
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:48,690
- "of us together." - He might've wanted to reunite.

1924
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:51,460
(After receiving the packages each carrying its own meaning...)

1925
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:55,560
(Sit next to someone of an opposite gender.)

1926
01:43:56,730 --> 01:44:00,200
(Then I'll sit here.)

1927
01:44:04,410 --> 01:44:07,510
Actually, I just can't stand watching things like that.

1928
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:12,150
She seemed closer to another guy than me.

1929
01:44:12,650 --> 01:44:14,550
But something else she did hit me harder.

1930
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:16,950
One of her cards said...

1931
01:44:17,450 --> 01:44:22,160
she had to whisper something to a guy.

1932
01:44:22,930 --> 01:44:24,930
She chose Yoo Sik.

1933
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:26,400
I did it.

1934
01:44:30,330 --> 01:44:32,770
It felt weird watching that.

1935
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:34,740
I was jealous.

1936
01:44:36,410 --> 01:44:37,970
To be honest, it made me uncomfortable.

1937
01:44:38,870 --> 01:44:42,280
Well, it's important for me to find a new love.

1938
01:44:43,380 --> 01:44:47,150
(A new excitement stirs Ji Hyeon's heart.)

1939
01:44:49,990 --> 01:44:50,990
It made my heart flutter.

1940
01:44:52,690 --> 01:44:56,430
(Ji Yeon also approached Won Kyu.)

1941
01:44:57,190 --> 01:44:58,629
(Hang out with me.)

1942
01:44:58,630 --> 01:44:59,630
(You want to?)

1943
01:44:59,630 --> 01:45:00,630
(Yes!)

1944
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,870
The last time my heart fluttered?

1945
01:45:03,230 --> 01:45:06,139
Excluding my ex, Ji Yeon was the first person...

1946
01:45:06,140 --> 01:45:07,470
who made my heart flutter.

1947
01:45:08,140 --> 01:45:11,570
(Ji Yeon was good at making the sauce.)

1948
01:45:11,970 --> 01:45:13,639
(She just followed her gut.)

1949
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:14,780
- I...
- Really?

1950
01:45:16,810 --> 01:45:18,310
"I see how you feel."

1951
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:22,050
"There's a man I'm also interested in."

1952
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:25,050
"Let's use this opportunity..."

1953
01:45:25,750 --> 01:45:27,560
"to wish each other happiness."

1954
01:45:27,990 --> 01:45:30,759
Of course, it's not like, "Ji Yeon is the one."

1955
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:33,459
"I love her. And I'm going to pick her."

1956
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:37,070
That's why I'd like to talk to my ex as soon as possible...

1957
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:39,840
to make a decision. I wanted to make a move then.

1958
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:41,440
So...

1959
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:46,709
I thought I would finally have a chance to talk to her.

1960
01:45:46,710 --> 01:45:47,940
(He chose Ji Hyeon's Talking Room to talk to her.)

1961
01:45:52,550 --> 01:45:55,050
(Won Kyu grabs the telephone again.)

1962
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:59,390
I had no idea, so I was a bit surprised.

1963
01:45:59,820 --> 01:46:01,489
When I heard that she felt like...

1964
01:46:01,490 --> 01:46:04,130
I didn't truly love her, it was like getting hit in the head.

1965
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:07,360
I felt bad, sad,

1966
01:46:07,960 --> 01:46:10,500
and curious about what made her think so.

1967
01:46:12,530 --> 01:46:13,770
It was upsetting.

1968
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:17,710
If you were to end up with another man,

1969
01:46:18,110 --> 01:46:19,880
do you think your ex would be supportive?

1970
01:46:23,010 --> 01:46:24,010
I'm not sure.

1971
01:46:24,450 --> 01:46:25,610
What about you then?

1972
01:46:32,050 --> 01:46:34,190
I'm not confident yet.

1973
01:46:37,090 --> 01:46:38,860
But I'll try to be supportive.

1974
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:42,930
I think...

1975
01:46:44,670 --> 01:46:46,640
one of the ladies in the house...

1976
01:46:52,470 --> 01:46:55,080
I think there's a type...

1977
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:57,380
who's a better match to him than me.

1978
01:46:57,750 --> 01:46:59,110
I thought that...

1979
01:47:02,150 --> 01:47:04,150
he would be much happier with her...

1980
01:47:05,190 --> 01:47:07,720
than he was with me.

1981
01:47:10,490 --> 01:47:16,830
(Someone else could make him happier than she could.)

1982
01:47:21,340 --> 01:47:23,940
Is there a guy you're interested in now?

1983
01:47:24,540 --> 01:47:25,570
There is.

1984
01:47:26,010 --> 01:47:28,040
Have you expressed your interest to him?

1985
01:47:29,180 --> 01:47:30,210
Yes.

1986
01:47:30,550 --> 01:47:32,680
Has there been a time when you two exchanged texts?

1987
01:47:36,220 --> 01:47:37,490
Yes, there has.

1988
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:57,170
(Park Ji Hyeon's Talking Room has ended.)

1989
01:47:57,470 --> 01:47:59,339
- Gosh, this one...
- Goodness. This Talking Room...

1990
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:00,340
That was super blunt.

1991
01:48:00,341 --> 01:48:02,440
This must've been so hard for Won Kyu to listen to this.

1992
01:48:03,210 --> 01:48:05,949
It's crazy that he just stood there and listened to everything.

1993
01:48:05,950 --> 01:48:08,579
He must be pretty shaken up now.

1994
01:48:08,580 --> 01:48:10,150
- He had nothing to say.
- Right.

1995
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:14,119
Do you think Won Kyu will pay more attention to other people?

1996
01:48:14,120 --> 01:48:17,729
This could be a turning point for him.

1997
01:48:17,730 --> 01:48:18,859
He said he wanted to talk to her...

1998
01:48:18,860 --> 01:48:20,499
- and make a decision.
- Right.

1999
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:22,299
- He was considering doing that.
- Yes.

2000
01:48:22,300 --> 01:48:24,469
- This one was pretty strong.
- Right.

2001
01:48:24,470 --> 01:48:25,599
It's emotionally draining.

2002
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:27,039
"Emotionally draining?"

2003
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:28,369
Some episodes are especially so.

2004
01:48:28,370 --> 01:48:30,639
- It's not easy to stay focused.
- My brain is about to break.

2005
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:31,970
I'm not even sure what's right or wrong.

2006
01:48:37,350 --> 01:48:39,580
(Min Kyung is the fourth recipient.)

2007
01:48:41,020 --> 01:48:42,889
I thought I would be talking to a woman...

2008
01:48:42,890 --> 01:48:45,250
who was interested in my ex.

2009
01:48:45,690 --> 01:48:48,859
"Gosh, this again."

2010
01:48:48,860 --> 01:48:51,730
That's what I assumed, so I sighed.

2011
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:06,340
Hello.

2012
01:49:07,980 --> 01:49:08,980
Hello.

2013
01:49:09,850 --> 01:49:12,350
(She hears an altered voice of a man.)

2014
01:49:12,780 --> 01:49:14,150
Can I speak casually?

2015
01:49:14,550 --> 01:49:16,090
Sure. Go ahead.

2016
01:49:16,990 --> 01:49:20,289
Then I heard a man's voice,

2017
01:49:20,290 --> 01:49:22,090
not a woman's voice over the phone.

2018
01:49:23,060 --> 01:49:26,430
"Wait, so a guy is interested in me?"

2019
01:49:26,930 --> 01:49:29,330
I couldn't figure out who it was.

2020
01:49:30,830 --> 01:49:31,900
Hello.

2021
01:49:33,100 --> 01:49:34,100
Hello.

2022
01:49:34,670 --> 01:49:37,970
(Woo Jin chose Min Kyung.)

2023
01:49:38,140 --> 01:49:40,539
I had a good time when we went on a date.

2024
01:49:40,540 --> 01:49:41,840
I felt comfortable around her.

2025
01:49:41,940 --> 01:49:45,110
I could see this developing into something romantic.

2026
01:49:45,550 --> 01:49:47,350
So I picked her.

2027
01:49:51,250 --> 01:49:54,720
I'm a bit hesitant to ask you about this.

2028
01:49:55,290 --> 01:49:57,930
Can I ask you why you broke up with your ex?

2029
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,800
From the way I saw it,

2030
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:07,740
I didn't believe that...

2031
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:10,270
the direction of our future aligned.

2032
01:50:11,210 --> 01:50:12,940
So I think that's why we broke up.

2033
01:50:15,640 --> 01:50:16,710
That must've been tough.

2034
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:19,880
Right.

2035
01:50:20,950 --> 01:50:21,950
When I think about it,

2036
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:26,590
it still makes me sad.

2037
01:50:28,860 --> 01:50:30,260
Are you open to getting back with him?

2038
01:50:30,690 --> 01:50:32,690
At first, I wasn't open to it at all.

2039
01:50:33,500 --> 01:50:36,300
But now, I'm a bit confused.

2040
01:50:40,570 --> 01:50:41,699
Are you more open...

2041
01:50:41,700 --> 01:50:43,440
to getting back with him than to meet someone new?

2042
01:50:44,570 --> 01:50:48,140
(He asks a question that puts her in a tight spot.)

2043
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:51,110
I'm more open to meeting someone new.

2044
01:50:57,520 --> 01:50:59,450
What's the quality you look for the most in men?

2045
01:50:59,890 --> 01:51:02,159
I would be happy to be in a relationship...

2046
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:04,990
where we can learn from each other.

2047
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,470
Is there a guy you haven't been on a date yet?

2048
01:51:11,330 --> 01:51:13,770
I think I went on a date with everyone.

2049
01:51:16,440 --> 01:51:17,840
You're popular.

2050
01:51:18,110 --> 01:51:21,609
So if anyone among them...

2051
01:51:21,610 --> 01:51:23,850
shows interest,

2052
01:51:24,180 --> 01:51:26,680
I want to go on more dates with him.

2053
01:51:30,220 --> 01:51:33,490
(Kwak Min Kyung's Talking Room has ended.)

2054
01:51:36,190 --> 01:51:40,560
(Baek Hyun enters the Talking Room.)

2055
01:51:48,900 --> 01:51:51,769
Hyeon Ji said something ambiguous...

2056
01:51:51,770 --> 01:51:54,180
and acted ambiguously on the terrace.

2057
01:51:54,740 --> 01:51:56,510
That gave me...

2058
01:51:57,410 --> 01:51:59,280
a lot of thoughts.

2059
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:02,820
(Last night)

2060
01:52:05,020 --> 01:52:09,320
(The two had the time alone for the first time.)

2061
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:19,370
I want to leave this place.

2062
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:28,910
(He saw Hyeon Ji struggling.)

2063
01:52:33,380 --> 01:52:35,720
I was curious if she had feelings left for me.

2064
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:42,490
(Baek Hyun chose Hyeon Ji.)

2065
01:52:45,290 --> 01:52:47,630
Hyeon Ji...

2066
01:52:48,330 --> 01:52:51,830
meant so much in my life.

2067
01:52:52,370 --> 01:52:55,400
I thought, "What if I'm swayed?"

2068
01:52:57,010 --> 01:53:00,040
I thought we were getting it off our chests in the Talking Room.

2069
01:53:00,280 --> 01:53:01,610
And I was curious.

2070
01:53:10,020 --> 01:53:12,450
Hello. Park Hyeon Ji speaking.

2071
01:53:12,820 --> 01:53:14,420
- Hi.
- Hello.

2072
01:53:14,890 --> 01:53:16,120
Hello.

2073
01:53:17,190 --> 01:53:18,889
I'm going to ask you a few questions.

2074
01:53:18,890 --> 01:53:20,400
Do you mind if I speak casually?

2075
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:23,500
Well, no.

2076
01:53:24,530 --> 01:53:26,439
Is there anyone you're interested in...

2077
01:53:26,440 --> 01:53:28,240
among the male residents?

2078
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:35,780
There is someone I'm interested in.

2079
01:53:44,690 --> 01:53:49,290
Then have you expressed your feelings...

2080
01:53:50,590 --> 01:53:52,390
to the person you're interested in?

2081
01:53:53,730 --> 01:53:54,730
Yes.

2082
01:53:56,230 --> 01:53:59,230
Has he expressed his feelings to you too?

2083
01:54:00,570 --> 01:54:01,600
Yes.

2084
01:54:12,450 --> 01:54:14,520
So my ex has someone she's interested in.

2085
01:54:21,860 --> 01:54:24,430
It felt very strange.

2086
01:54:25,330 --> 01:54:26,560
I thought it'd be Yoo Sik.

2087
01:54:28,700 --> 01:54:31,530
(Baek Hyun's guessing that it's Yoo Sik.)

2088
01:54:36,240 --> 01:54:39,270
(Yoo Sik enters the Talking Room.)

2089
01:54:42,780 --> 01:54:46,620
(His premonition is never wrong.)

2090
01:54:47,250 --> 01:54:50,189
(Someone else in Hyeon Ji's Talking Room)

2091
01:54:50,190 --> 01:54:52,389
When you're on a date,

2092
01:54:52,390 --> 01:54:55,960
do you like having a wine while eating?

2093
01:54:56,020 --> 01:54:57,960
I'm okay with everything.

2094
01:54:58,130 --> 01:54:59,860
Which wine do you prefer?

2095
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:02,330
I like red wine.

2096
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:11,070
This might be a sensitive question,

2097
01:55:12,440 --> 01:55:15,280
but can I ask you why you broke up with your ex?

2098
01:55:16,780 --> 01:55:20,750
There is no certain reason.

2099
01:55:21,350 --> 01:55:25,190
We kept getting upset,

2100
01:55:25,850 --> 01:55:29,019
so we thought it was best to end it.

2101
01:55:29,020 --> 01:55:30,530
That's how we broke up.

2102
01:55:32,190 --> 01:55:35,960
(Hearing why they broke up from his ex)

2103
01:55:38,830 --> 01:55:41,140
Have you cried after joining belatedly?

2104
01:55:43,970 --> 01:55:45,040
Yes.

2105
01:55:46,740 --> 01:55:47,840
Why?

2106
01:55:49,140 --> 01:55:52,210
I don't know why exactly.

2107
01:55:52,380 --> 01:55:55,250
I'm just having a hard time.

2108
01:55:57,190 --> 01:55:59,390
I hope it's not too much for you.

2109
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:01,790
Thank you.

2110
01:56:03,890 --> 01:56:05,660
What kind of date do you want to go on...

2111
01:56:06,130 --> 01:56:08,030
with the person you're interested in?

2112
01:56:08,330 --> 01:56:10,769
I like crafts.

2113
01:56:10,770 --> 01:56:12,630
So I want to try that.

2114
01:56:13,970 --> 01:56:15,570
What's your favorite food?

2115
01:56:16,270 --> 01:56:19,210
I like everything. I'm not picky.

2116
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:23,140
Do you prefer your partner to express his feelings a lot?

2117
01:56:23,810 --> 01:56:25,510
Yes, that's for sure.

2118
01:56:30,790 --> 01:56:33,890
Yoo Sik does have feelings for my ex.

2119
01:56:38,260 --> 01:56:39,789
It felt really strange.

2120
01:56:39,790 --> 01:56:43,400
(It felt really strange.)

2121
01:56:47,700 --> 01:56:51,840
If your ex wants to get back with you,

2122
01:56:52,140 --> 01:56:53,540
how would you feel?

2123
01:56:56,550 --> 01:57:01,220
Just saying that once wouldn't change my mind.

2124
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:04,119
If your ex doesn't say it,

2125
01:57:04,120 --> 01:57:06,320
you have no intention of getting back with him?

2126
01:57:07,690 --> 01:57:12,290
So far, it depends on him.

2127
01:57:13,660 --> 01:57:16,000
Do you want to get back with your ex?

2128
01:57:22,570 --> 01:57:26,680
Before coming here, I didn't.

2129
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:30,910
But now, I don't know about getting back with him,

2130
01:57:31,950 --> 01:57:34,820
but I'm kind of having a hard time.

2131
01:57:35,420 --> 01:57:38,550
So I need some time to realize...

2132
01:57:39,120 --> 01:57:42,490
whether it's about getting back with him or not.

2133
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:47,900
(She's not certain if she wants to get back with him.)

2134
01:57:49,430 --> 01:57:50,930
She's not coherent.

2135
01:57:51,770 --> 01:57:53,130
When she was in the Talking Room,

2136
01:57:54,940 --> 01:57:57,070
she firmly said she had no intention of getting back with me...

2137
01:57:57,610 --> 01:57:59,240
and she has someone in her mind.

2138
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:03,210
(Hyeon Ji said she's not certain yet.)

2139
01:58:06,310 --> 01:58:09,950
(Baek Hyun misunderstood Hyeon Ji.)

2140
01:58:12,090 --> 01:58:15,820
I had a lot of thoughts and contemplated...

2141
01:58:17,230 --> 01:58:18,759
after hearing what she said the day before.

2142
01:58:18,760 --> 01:58:22,500
But when I heard that in the Talking Room,

2143
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:27,700
I regretted wasting my time on contemplating.

2144
01:58:28,100 --> 01:58:30,869
I should've spent that time...

2145
01:58:30,870 --> 01:58:32,210
on the person I was interested in.

2146
01:58:32,740 --> 01:58:34,480
Why does she always...

2147
01:58:41,550 --> 01:58:43,080
make me have a lot of thoughts?

2148
01:58:43,420 --> 01:58:44,990
That's what I was thinking.

2149
01:58:45,950 --> 01:58:47,460
I was angry about that.

2150
01:58:49,420 --> 01:58:51,890
It felt like she was playing with my heart.

2151
01:58:53,130 --> 01:58:54,400
It was upsetting.

2152
01:58:56,560 --> 01:59:00,640
(Hyeon Ji's Talking Room resulted in a big misunderstanding.)

2153
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:13,349
(EXchange 4)

2154
01:59:13,350 --> 01:59:15,379
(A letter disturbs the silence in the house.)

2155
01:59:15,380 --> 01:59:17,350
Tomorrow, you'll have a keyword date.

2156
01:59:18,220 --> 01:59:21,420
The female residents' keywords were determined after the Talking Room.

2157
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:24,660
(For the keyword date, the male residents will choose.)

2158
01:59:25,230 --> 01:59:26,960
I was excited and looking forward to it.

2159
01:59:27,860 --> 01:59:30,800
I did want to get to know her.

2160
01:59:31,030 --> 01:59:33,170
Actually, I contemplated so much.

2161
01:59:33,870 --> 01:59:37,710
(I hope Won Kyu chooses me.)

2162
01:59:39,270 --> 01:59:41,640
It seems people upstairs are all struggling.

2163
01:59:42,440 --> 01:59:44,880
Who isn't aside from me?

2164
01:59:46,150 --> 01:59:48,650
My ex implied that he wanted to talk.

2165
01:59:49,850 --> 01:59:51,419
(Someone's waiting on the terrace.)

2166
01:59:51,420 --> 01:59:52,519
(Min Kyung's waiting on the terrace.)

2167
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:55,120
(If not today, we won't have a chance to talk.)

2168
01:59:57,830 --> 02:00:00,499
Why are you trying to teach me?

2169
02:00:00,500 --> 02:00:02,929
You keep showing that I'm your ex...

2170
02:00:02,930 --> 02:00:05,269
You're not hiding who you're interested in.

2171
02:00:05,270 --> 02:00:06,740
Who am I interested in?
