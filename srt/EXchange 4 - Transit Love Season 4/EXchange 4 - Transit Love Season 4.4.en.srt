1
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:15,215
Just like last week,

2
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:17,086
Sung Ho and Jae Hyun of BOYNEXTDOOR will join us.

3
00:00:18,326 --> 00:00:19,796
You guys are so good. I mean it.

4
00:00:20,096 --> 00:00:21,655
- They're so good at analyzing.
- You're excellent analysts.

5
00:00:21,656 --> 00:00:23,095
- They're good analysts.
- Seriously.

6
00:00:23,096 --> 00:00:24,495
- They're such big thinkers.
- They're great analysts...

7
00:00:24,496 --> 00:00:25,895
and keep an objective perspective.

8
00:00:25,896 --> 00:00:28,465
There were a few lines I wanted to steal from them.

9
00:00:28,466 --> 00:00:29,805
- Right.
- Exactly.

10
00:00:29,806 --> 00:00:32,635
Actually, people say that I can't read the room.

11
00:00:32,636 --> 00:00:34,775
- What?
- So I can't pick up on social cues.

12
00:00:34,776 --> 00:00:36,905
- I don't buy it.
- I don't know what people want.

13
00:00:36,906 --> 00:00:39,005
That's why I gave my full attention to the clips...

14
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:41,176
- not to miss anything.
- I see.

15
00:00:41,346 --> 00:00:43,515
You two had a different perspective.

16
00:00:43,516 --> 00:00:44,885
- Your perspective was different.
- Right.

17
00:00:44,886 --> 00:00:48,015
You guys shared different opinions based on different perspectives.

18
00:00:48,016 --> 00:00:49,016
That was really interesting.

19
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,425
- You were so good.
- I was so grateful.

20
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:54,955
You guys are great at analyzing people and situations...

21
00:00:54,956 --> 00:00:56,495
and can keep an objective mind.

22
00:00:56,496 --> 00:00:58,666
- So this is their second night.
- Yes.

23
00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:00,035
The mood is turning heavy here.

24
00:01:00,036 --> 00:01:01,436
What do you expect to see in this episode?

25
00:01:01,496 --> 00:01:04,835
The most shocking part from the last episode was...

26
00:01:04,836 --> 00:01:08,635
Min Kyung not getting any messages.

27
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:10,545
The look on her face at the end really got me.

28
00:01:10,546 --> 00:01:12,045
The ending of Episode Two...

29
00:01:12,046 --> 00:01:15,016
- Right.
- left an impression on me too.

30
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:16,785
Then Episode Three left an impression on me again.

31
00:01:16,786 --> 00:01:18,486
I wonder if the ending of today's episode...

32
00:01:18,586 --> 00:01:20,185
would be about her again...

33
00:01:20,186 --> 00:01:22,285
or if there would be something different for us to see.

34
00:01:22,286 --> 00:01:23,755
- I'm curious about that.
- Min Kyung might...

35
00:01:23,756 --> 00:01:24,925
secretly call Yoo Sik out...

36
00:01:24,926 --> 00:01:27,095
and express a bit of disappointment.

37
00:01:27,096 --> 00:01:28,655
- I get the feeling we'll see that.
- I agree.

38
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:29,695
- I agree.
- I agree.

39
00:01:29,696 --> 00:01:31,566
- We might see that. Right?
- I agree too. Yes.

40
00:01:32,696 --> 00:01:34,435
(The second night after moving in)

41
00:01:34,436 --> 00:01:36,506
- DFO.
- DFO.

42
00:01:38,406 --> 00:01:40,776
Did you get any snacks today?

43
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,206
- Snacks?
- You said you bought groceries.

44
00:01:43,576 --> 00:01:45,606
- Right. Snacks...
- We have snacks.

45
00:01:46,246 --> 00:01:48,245
- What do we have?
- Spicy shrimp chips.

46
00:01:48,246 --> 00:01:49,745
- What? Really?
- Yes.

47
00:01:49,746 --> 00:01:51,186
I thought you ate them last night.

48
00:01:51,646 --> 00:01:53,286
- No. We didn't.
- Really?

49
00:01:53,686 --> 00:01:55,016
- Should I get them?
- Let's...

50
00:01:56,156 --> 00:01:57,256
She's a snack lover.

51
00:01:57,756 --> 00:01:59,125
- Right.
- Do we have more snacks?

52
00:01:59,126 --> 00:02:00,255
- They are tasty.
- Two people are getting them.

53
00:02:00,256 --> 00:02:01,296
(Yoo Sik runs out the fastest.)

54
00:02:01,596 --> 00:02:03,766
- Waiting for them...
- That's why...

55
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:10,935
I bet they're tasty.

56
00:02:10,936 --> 00:02:12,706
- Thank you.
- Spicy shrimp chips.

57
00:02:19,676 --> 00:02:20,816
- Are they good?
- Yes.

58
00:02:22,446 --> 00:02:23,486
Should we play a game?

59
00:02:24,486 --> 00:02:25,686
- A game?
- A game?

60
00:02:26,556 --> 00:02:28,116
- Jenga.
- Jenga?

61
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,186
Some stuff was written on the pieces.

62
00:02:31,356 --> 00:02:33,456
- Right.
- What does it say?

63
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:35,995
- Questions we have to answer.
- "Any habits you develop..."

64
00:02:35,996 --> 00:02:37,795
"while dating?" Questions like this.

65
00:02:37,796 --> 00:02:39,996
- Gosh, that sounds fun.
- That's going to be fun.

66
00:02:41,866 --> 00:02:44,936
(They will get to know each other better through Jenga.)

67
00:02:47,236 --> 00:02:49,605
Hearing their exes' answers will be more fun than answering them.

68
00:02:49,606 --> 00:02:50,675
- Right.
- I'm envious of them...

69
00:02:50,676 --> 00:02:51,745
for having such a fun night.

70
00:02:51,746 --> 00:02:53,645
- And I miss those times too.
- I miss them too.

71
00:02:53,646 --> 00:02:54,675
When have I ever done that?

72
00:02:54,676 --> 00:02:56,485
If I could be reborn, I'd be a participant on our show.

73
00:02:56,486 --> 00:02:57,486
Exactly.

74
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:00,685
- I sometimes think about that now.
- Right?

75
00:03:00,686 --> 00:03:02,085
Now, I think about how it would look...

76
00:03:02,086 --> 00:03:03,555
- if I were to be one of them.
- I'm so curious.

77
00:03:03,556 --> 00:03:05,025
- It makes me wonder about that.
- I don't want to play...

78
00:03:05,026 --> 00:03:06,426
foot volleyball with guys in Gapyeong anymore.

79
00:03:07,856 --> 00:03:08,896
Right.

80
00:03:09,096 --> 00:03:10,426
- I'll go first.
- Yes.

81
00:03:20,276 --> 00:03:21,736
- This is nice.
- You've got to be kidding me.

82
00:03:23,146 --> 00:03:24,406
This makes no sense.

83
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:30,286
Gosh, this is...

84
00:03:30,786 --> 00:03:32,716
- Wait. How about giving it away?
- Could you read it?

85
00:03:32,816 --> 00:03:33,885
- Give it away?
- What do you think?

86
00:03:33,886 --> 00:03:34,985
- That will be fun.
- It will be more fun.

87
00:03:34,986 --> 00:03:36,285
- That sounds like fun.
- I'll give it to someone then.

88
00:03:36,286 --> 00:03:37,325
To someone of the opposite gender?

89
00:03:37,326 --> 00:03:38,386
- To make it fun?
- Should I?

90
00:03:38,486 --> 00:03:39,486
To someone of the opposite gender.

91
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:42,696
To whom should I give it?

92
00:03:54,976 --> 00:03:56,176
- Min Kyung.
- Okay.

93
00:03:56,806 --> 00:03:58,006
- Min Kyung.
- Okay.

94
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:00,546
What's this?

95
00:04:01,846 --> 00:04:03,486
Does she have to answer that now?

96
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:04,986
Yes.

97
00:04:06,686 --> 00:04:07,716
What is it?

98
00:04:08,256 --> 00:04:10,026
- What if I can't answer it?
- Read it for us.

99
00:04:10,186 --> 00:04:11,955
- Can you read it? I'm curious.
- Okay.

100
00:04:11,956 --> 00:04:13,555
"Pick someone you want."

101
00:04:13,556 --> 00:04:15,956
"Then wake them up and cook breakfast tomorrow."

102
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:17,296
- I see.
- Really?

103
00:04:21,296 --> 00:04:23,765
- What?
- That's way too daring.

104
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:26,306
- I like it.
- He could give it...

105
00:04:26,436 --> 00:04:27,605
to whoever he wanted.

106
00:04:27,606 --> 00:04:28,975
- Yoo Sik gave it to Min Kyung.
- Yes.

107
00:04:28,976 --> 00:04:30,775
- Why did he give it to her?
- She has to pick a guy...

108
00:04:30,776 --> 00:04:31,975
she wants then.

109
00:04:31,976 --> 00:04:33,875
Is he trying...

110
00:04:33,876 --> 00:04:36,375
to make a clear decision through this?

111
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,615
If she still has feelings for him?

112
00:04:37,616 --> 00:04:38,915
Maybe, he'll use the result...

113
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:39,916
- to decide on his direction.
- Right.

114
00:04:39,917 --> 00:04:40,955
That might be what he wants.

115
00:04:40,956 --> 00:04:42,055
Of course, he could check that...

116
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:43,156
- through this game.
- Right.

117
00:04:43,486 --> 00:04:45,225
"Pick someone you want."

118
00:04:45,226 --> 00:04:47,556
"Then wake them up and cook breakfast tomorrow."

119
00:04:47,856 --> 00:04:48,896
Really?

120
00:04:49,996 --> 00:04:51,665
- That's way too daring.
- If that's too hard to answer...

121
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,896
- You can just take a shot.
- Take a shot.

122
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:55,336
Let's see.

123
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:10,616
If it's too much to answer, take a shot.

124
00:05:11,046 --> 00:05:12,546
If it's too much to answer, take a shot.

125
00:05:14,016 --> 00:05:15,156
I'm sorry.

126
00:05:16,356 --> 00:05:18,756
Cooking breakfast might be too much.

127
00:05:19,226 --> 00:05:20,356
- Cooking breakfast?
- Right.

128
00:05:20,856 --> 00:05:22,755
- Cereal could be breakfast, though.
- Yes.

129
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,165
- Or cook eggs to keep it simple.
- It could be something simple.

130
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,666
- You can fry up an egg.
- Right.

131
00:05:28,636 --> 00:05:29,866
I'll drink it.

132
00:05:32,236 --> 00:05:34,835
- Okay.
- Then naturally,

133
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:36,005
- it's her turn.
- It's her turn.

134
00:05:36,006 --> 00:05:37,106
- Okay.
- Nice.

135
00:05:45,286 --> 00:05:46,386
I have to give it to someone, right?

136
00:05:46,586 --> 00:05:47,686
- To a guy.
- After you read it.

137
00:05:48,016 --> 00:05:49,056
- After I read it?
- Yes.

138
00:05:51,026 --> 00:05:52,256
I'll give it to you.

139
00:05:54,156 --> 00:05:55,656
"What do you look for in your lover?"

140
00:05:57,096 --> 00:05:58,366
What do I look for in my lover?

141
00:05:59,396 --> 00:06:01,436
- It's already getting interesting.
- Already?

142
00:06:01,566 --> 00:06:03,236
This is already getting interesting.

143
00:06:04,636 --> 00:06:06,266
- We'll give you ten seconds.
- What do I look for?

144
00:06:07,106 --> 00:06:10,346
I want a relationship where we respect each other.

145
00:06:10,906 --> 00:06:13,206
Whether it's about spending time with each other...

146
00:06:13,476 --> 00:06:14,676
or staying in touch,

147
00:06:14,776 --> 00:06:18,245
I want us to show respect to each other.

148
00:06:18,246 --> 00:06:20,055
I have a question. If you can't reach her for 12 hours,

149
00:06:20,056 --> 00:06:21,056
would you be able to understand that?

150
00:06:22,056 --> 00:06:23,556
Twelve hours? Isn't that crossing the line?

151
00:06:24,756 --> 00:06:25,985
Can anyone not check their phone...

152
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:27,426
- for 12 hours?
- What if she sleeps a lot?

153
00:06:27,526 --> 00:06:28,626
That doesn't matter then.

154
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:30,826
It's okay as long as it's about work.

155
00:06:31,326 --> 00:06:32,326
- Okay.
- Let's say she's meeting a friend,

156
00:06:32,327 --> 00:06:33,995
and I can't reach her for 12 hours.

157
00:06:33,996 --> 00:06:36,836
- That's just crossing the line.
- Right.

158
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:39,105
That would be my answer.

159
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:40,276
That's...

160
00:06:43,876 --> 00:06:45,046
That came out well.

161
00:06:56,386 --> 00:06:57,556
Okay.

162
00:06:59,526 --> 00:07:00,556
Won Kyu.

163
00:07:05,266 --> 00:07:06,296
I'm curious.

164
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,036
Gosh, this is about...

165
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:12,666
"Be the youngest in the group for three minutes."

166
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,476
- Be the youngest for 3 minutes.
- Be the youngest for 3 minutes?

167
00:07:19,276 --> 00:07:20,645
- That's good.
- How did she pull that one?

168
00:07:20,646 --> 00:07:22,945
It became a fact that he's the oldest in the group.

169
00:07:22,946 --> 00:07:23,985
Doesn't this imply that...

170
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:25,685
- he looks the oldest?
- Right.

171
00:07:25,686 --> 00:07:27,785
- It means he looks the oldest.
- That's right.

172
00:07:27,786 --> 00:07:29,886
- They think he's older than them.
- It's Reverse the Honorifics Game.

173
00:07:30,186 --> 00:07:31,755
So we can drop the honorifics for three minutes?

174
00:07:31,756 --> 00:07:33,526
- Only to Won Kyu.
- Yes.

175
00:07:33,626 --> 00:07:34,795
- I'm the only one...
- Only to him.

176
00:07:34,796 --> 00:07:35,796
who must use the honorifics.

177
00:07:35,796 --> 00:07:36,796
Sounds good.

178
00:07:37,896 --> 00:07:39,196
- Get ready. Go.
- Okay.

179
00:07:40,366 --> 00:07:41,995
- Come on, Won Kyu. Go ahead.
- What should I do, sir?

180
00:07:41,996 --> 00:07:43,095
Do it now.

181
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:44,166
- Do what?
- It's your turn.

182
00:07:46,506 --> 00:07:47,575
- Oh, my.
- He's so good.

183
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:48,935
- He's so good.
- Do it now.

184
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:50,046
- Won Kyu.
- Yes.

185
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:52,876
(Staggering)

186
00:07:53,246 --> 00:07:54,345
- Won Kyu.
- Wait.

187
00:07:54,346 --> 00:07:55,516
- I can't see clearly.
- Hold on.

188
00:08:07,556 --> 00:08:08,656
I have to pick a woman.

189
00:08:15,136 --> 00:08:16,196
Here.

190
00:08:20,736 --> 00:08:22,406
What? "Name the most fashionable participant."

191
00:08:25,646 --> 00:08:27,845
- I can just pick someone?
- You're good at flirting, Won Kyu.

192
00:08:27,846 --> 00:08:29,916
- That's not what I was doing.
- You're good at flirting.

193
00:08:30,546 --> 00:08:31,846
Gosh, this is hard.

194
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:35,186
Then does it mean I can just name someone?

195
00:08:35,286 --> 00:08:37,886
I would pick Baek Hyun.

196
00:08:39,556 --> 00:08:41,226
- I think you dress well.
- Thank you.

197
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:50,406
- It's my turn now.
- Time is up.

198
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:52,065
(Won Kyu's 3 minutes are up.)

199
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:53,166
Sir.

200
00:08:55,776 --> 00:08:57,605
- Gosh.
- Have you been well?

201
00:08:57,606 --> 00:08:59,145
- That's funny.
- Yes.

202
00:08:59,146 --> 00:09:00,175
I'm so curious...

203
00:09:00,176 --> 00:09:01,575
- about everyone's age.
- Our age?

204
00:09:01,576 --> 00:09:04,286
- I'm dying to find out. Seriously.
- I'm so curious.

205
00:09:04,686 --> 00:09:06,646
I'll go next.

206
00:09:12,456 --> 00:09:14,526
(Surprised)

207
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:44,086
What is it?

208
00:09:44,956 --> 00:09:46,026
What is it?

209
00:09:47,826 --> 00:09:49,656
Come on. This is so mean.

210
00:09:49,826 --> 00:09:52,896
You were the quietest, so I gave it to you.

211
00:09:54,496 --> 00:09:57,966
"Sit next to someone of the opposite gender right now."

212
00:10:02,606 --> 00:10:04,246
- For real?
- Really?

213
00:10:04,306 --> 00:10:05,945
I really want him to do it.

214
00:10:05,946 --> 00:10:07,446
- Just do it.
- Please. Do it.

215
00:10:07,946 --> 00:10:11,416
"Sit next to someone of the opposite gender right now."

216
00:10:26,936 --> 00:10:29,165
- This will be fun.
- Yes. We can watch him.

217
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,606
He must sit next to a woman then?

218
00:10:32,306 --> 00:10:33,336
This is crazy.

219
00:10:44,746 --> 00:10:45,786
This is crazy.

220
00:11:00,366 --> 00:11:02,266
Then I'll sit here.

221
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:11,006
(He sits between Min Kyung and Ji Hyeon.)

222
00:11:13,776 --> 00:11:14,776
- Hold on.
- Gosh.

223
00:11:15,116 --> 00:11:16,615
- My gosh. Seriously.
- Oh, my.

224
00:11:16,616 --> 00:11:18,385
- So...
- Between Min Kyung and Ji Hyeon?

225
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,715
- Right.
- He's sitting between them.

226
00:11:19,716 --> 00:11:21,755
Whom did he intend to sit beside?

227
00:11:21,756 --> 00:11:22,985
- Gosh.
- I think he was going for that.

228
00:11:22,986 --> 00:11:24,325
That was a smart move.

229
00:11:24,326 --> 00:11:25,955
- That was smart.
- This was so smart.

230
00:11:25,956 --> 00:11:27,325
What a smart play by Yoo Sik.

231
00:11:27,326 --> 00:11:29,725
Here's what Yoo Sik is trying to do in my opinion.

232
00:11:29,726 --> 00:11:31,795
He didn't have to do it. He could've taken a shot.

233
00:11:31,796 --> 00:11:34,265
But he sat between them to send a message to both.

234
00:11:34,266 --> 00:11:36,365
- Because he could. It worked.
- He showed his interest to both.

235
00:11:36,366 --> 00:11:37,705
- There was his ex.
- Yes.

236
00:11:37,706 --> 00:11:39,265
- He went on a date with Ji Hyeon.
- It's killing 2 birds with 1 stone.

237
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:40,505
- Nicely played.
- It was smart.

238
00:11:40,506 --> 00:11:41,736
- That was smart.
- Totally.

239
00:11:43,276 --> 00:11:45,176
- Do you want this?
- No, I'm good.

240
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,816
Here you go.

241
00:11:48,176 --> 00:11:50,985
(He turns down the back pillow and fixes Min Kyung's instead.)

242
00:11:50,986 --> 00:11:52,286
What about the rest of you?

243
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:54,415
- Like this.
- Hey.

244
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,916
We can keep playing. You can make someone if you're it.

245
00:11:57,026 --> 00:11:58,086
- Sit down.
- Okay.

246
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:10,836
Min Kyung and I were sitting side by side.

247
00:12:11,036 --> 00:12:12,366
He sat between us.

248
00:12:14,376 --> 00:12:16,836
My heart fluttered. I got the butterflies.

249
00:12:18,176 --> 00:12:20,816
I didn't want him to know how I felt about him.

250
00:12:21,816 --> 00:12:23,886
I was a bit nervous that he might figure it out.

251
00:12:32,556 --> 00:12:36,226
(It's time for Yoo Sik to give a piece to a woman.)

252
00:12:48,036 --> 00:12:49,536
(Surprised)

253
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:07,596
"Whisper a secret to someone of the opposite gender."

254
00:13:09,326 --> 00:13:10,326
My gosh.

255
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:12,266
- What?
- My gosh.

256
00:13:14,766 --> 00:13:17,365
Come on. He moved to the seat next to hers.

257
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:18,735
Right. He's sitting right next to her.

258
00:13:18,736 --> 00:13:20,375
How did he pull out that piece of all?

259
00:13:20,376 --> 00:13:21,775
- He wants her to whisper it to him.
- Now of all times?

260
00:13:21,776 --> 00:13:22,805
What a smart guy.

261
00:13:22,806 --> 00:13:24,975
- That was a smart play.
- They're definitely having fun.

262
00:13:24,976 --> 00:13:26,305
I wish we could make that...

263
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,175
- into our show's merchandise.
- It could be our merchandise.

264
00:13:28,176 --> 00:13:30,845
- I bet it will sell like hotcakes.
- Seriously.

265
00:13:30,846 --> 00:13:33,185
If this gets made into merchandise, we'll go to the pop-up event...

266
00:13:33,186 --> 00:13:34,285
and play it with our members.

267
00:13:34,286 --> 00:13:35,885
- With our members?
- With your members?

268
00:13:35,886 --> 00:13:37,015
- Yes.
- We'll play that?

269
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,525
We'll pick someone to sit next to.

270
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,325
- The six of us...
- Yes. You can cook breakfast too.

271
00:13:40,326 --> 00:13:41,995
- Cooking breakfast.
- You know what?

272
00:13:41,996 --> 00:13:44,265
I like that our participants are taking more initiative now.

273
00:13:44,266 --> 00:13:45,925
- Yes.
- This game...

274
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:48,035
is giving them a chance to talk and do more.

275
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,666
- This is nice.
- The guys are more proactive...

276
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,506
- than they were on their dates.
- They're actually more proactive.

277
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:53,266
- This is giving me goosebumps.
- My gosh.

278
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:54,835
- It's crazy that they are...
- This is driving me crazy.

279
00:13:54,836 --> 00:13:56,335
- sitting next to each other.
- Right.

280
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,376
This is so fun to watch.

281
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:01,346
"Whisper a secret to someone of the opposite gender."

282
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:14,696
I need to think of a secret first.

283
00:14:18,396 --> 00:14:19,466
A secret?

284
00:14:28,436 --> 00:14:29,536
I'm sorry.

285
00:14:34,716 --> 00:14:36,716
I didn't feel good about it.

286
00:14:48,526 --> 00:14:49,556
I did it.

287
00:14:58,206 --> 00:14:59,336
I whispered to him,

288
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:03,676
"Have breakfast with me tomorrow."

289
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,876
It wasn't a secret. But what's important is that...

290
00:15:07,976 --> 00:15:09,076
I whispered it to him.

291
00:15:11,646 --> 00:15:12,816
It made my heart flutter.

292
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,525
- Yun Nyeong.
- I'll pull one out quickly.

293
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:20,496
(It's Yun Nyeong's turn to pull a piece.)

294
00:15:22,896 --> 00:15:23,896
No way.

295
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:28,166
- I'm already so curious.
- This is crazy.

296
00:15:31,866 --> 00:15:33,006
I'll give it to you.

297
00:15:35,076 --> 00:15:36,275
I'll give it to you.

298
00:15:36,276 --> 00:15:37,346
Me?

299
00:15:53,896 --> 00:15:54,896
"Pick someone of the opposite gender..."

300
00:15:54,897 --> 00:15:56,926
"and interlace fingers with theirs for five seconds."

301
00:15:59,496 --> 00:16:00,496
That's crazy.

302
00:16:20,486 --> 00:16:23,586
I'll pick Ji Hyeon.

303
00:16:25,156 --> 00:16:26,326
Hold on.

304
00:16:28,096 --> 00:16:29,256
Hold on.

305
00:16:30,966 --> 00:16:32,595
- Hey! This is...
- Hey.

306
00:16:32,596 --> 00:16:34,336
- Gosh, they are just...
- What...

307
00:16:34,966 --> 00:16:35,995
- He'll do it?
- My gosh.

308
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,035
- What's this?
- People these days...

309
00:16:37,036 --> 00:16:38,505
- Has our world changed this much?
- He's not going to take a shot?

310
00:16:38,506 --> 00:16:40,235
- Has our world changed this much?
- He won't drink?

311
00:16:40,236 --> 00:16:41,275
He'll do it in front of everyone?

312
00:16:41,276 --> 00:16:43,175
He chose Ji Hyeon of everyone?

313
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:46,145
- She whispered to another guy.
- People are this forward nowadays?

314
00:16:46,146 --> 00:16:47,646
- Holding hands after that whisper?
- Interlacing fingers...

315
00:16:47,876 --> 00:16:49,745
- They must interlace their fingers.
- This is really confusing.

316
00:16:49,746 --> 00:16:50,945
- What...
- Did Baek Hyun and Yun Nyeong...

317
00:16:50,946 --> 00:16:53,846
- Is she his ex?
- date each other?

318
00:16:54,156 --> 00:16:56,585
Or did Baek Hyun and Ji Hyeon date each other? It's so confusing.

319
00:16:56,586 --> 00:16:58,326
- He went on a date with Min Kyung.
- Really?

320
00:16:58,656 --> 00:17:01,025
Let's comfort Min Kyung later.

321
00:17:01,026 --> 00:17:02,355
- We need to focus on what happened.
- Yes.

322
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:04,226
- We must take care of this first.
- I'm sorry.

323
00:17:04,396 --> 00:17:06,265
- I'm sorry.
- This is more urgent than that.

324
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:08,165
- Let's console them later.
- Yes.

325
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,666
- We're getting too invested now.
- Let's focus on this for now.

326
00:17:11,436 --> 00:17:12,836
I'll pick Ji Hyeon.

327
00:17:14,306 --> 00:17:15,606
Hold on.

328
00:17:17,276 --> 00:17:18,346
Hold on.

329
00:17:18,676 --> 00:17:21,746
Let me prepare myself. Wait!

330
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:34,996
Hold on.

331
00:17:38,466 --> 00:17:39,526
Five seconds?

332
00:17:41,366 --> 00:17:42,396
Come here.

333
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:45,506
- I see. Like this?
- You must hold her hand completely.

334
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:53,676
This is crazy.

335
00:18:09,926 --> 00:18:11,265
Okay. Thank you.

336
00:18:11,266 --> 00:18:12,465
That's so funny.

337
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,896
- Seriously.
- Totally.

338
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:15,466
- That was witty.
- He's smart.

339
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:22,636
- Two of you...
- It's a penalty.

340
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:24,776
That's understandable.

341
00:18:26,046 --> 00:18:27,816
- Should we clean up?
- Sounds good.

342
00:18:27,946 --> 00:18:30,315
I didn't know Jenga could be as intense as this.

343
00:18:30,316 --> 00:18:32,185
Who knew there was this version of Jenga?

344
00:18:32,186 --> 00:18:33,986
Can I borrow that later?

345
00:18:34,256 --> 00:18:35,516
I want to play that on a trip.

346
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:39,685
I think while they played the game, we were able to see that...

347
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:42,155
Yoo Sik and Ji Hyeon had some feelings...

348
00:18:42,156 --> 00:18:43,925
for each other.

349
00:18:43,926 --> 00:18:45,925
By the way, I think it's about time...

350
00:18:45,926 --> 00:18:47,295
- that it started.
- Right?

351
00:18:47,296 --> 00:18:49,395
- I can see that Min Kyung is...
- She's getting annoyed.

352
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:51,065
- getting upset.
- She's getting mad now.

353
00:18:51,066 --> 00:18:52,865
- She doesn't look happy at all.
- She's so fed up.

354
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:54,175
But I think Yoo Sik...

355
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:55,775
will go back to her right away if she shows...

356
00:18:55,776 --> 00:18:57,036
even the slightest interest.

357
00:18:58,006 --> 00:18:59,575
He was leaning toward Min Kyung.

358
00:18:59,576 --> 00:19:01,216
- Only his eyes turned away.
- Right.

359
00:19:01,746 --> 00:19:03,915
Let's say you were playing the game with them.

360
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,915
Which question would have given you the hardest time?

361
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,715
The one that would have made me think the most...

362
00:19:08,716 --> 00:19:11,256
would be having to move my seat beside a woman.

363
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,825
- That would make me think the most.
- Right.

364
00:19:13,826 --> 00:19:16,926
Actually, I think I can make that look playful, not so serious.

365
00:19:17,126 --> 00:19:19,766
I could say things like, "I thought your seat looked comfy."

366
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:22,465
- Your reaction could be light.
- "I wanted to look that way."

367
00:19:22,466 --> 00:19:24,165
I can find a way to gloss over it.

368
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,935
- But interlacing fingers...
- Right. That's tough.

369
00:19:25,936 --> 00:19:27,635
- Interlacing fingers...
- That's just obvious.

370
00:19:27,636 --> 00:19:29,035
- You have to touch her.
- It's interlacing fingers.

371
00:19:29,036 --> 00:19:30,535
I can't really pivot that.

372
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,375
- That was quite daring.
- Right.

373
00:19:32,376 --> 00:19:34,575
- It's way too obvious.
- It's too obvious.

374
00:19:34,576 --> 00:19:37,175
Taking the shot for both questions wouldn't have been...

375
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,145
- weird at all.
- It wouldn't have mattered. Yes.

376
00:19:39,146 --> 00:19:40,855
- Right. But they both did it.
- Yes.

377
00:19:40,856 --> 00:19:42,285
- The fact that they did it...
- Right.

378
00:19:42,286 --> 00:19:43,585
- means a lot.
- That matters a lot more.

379
00:19:43,586 --> 00:19:44,625
That's why the game was more fun.

380
00:19:44,626 --> 00:19:46,926
It just means that they want to express their interest.

381
00:19:48,426 --> 00:19:50,455
- Should we just put them back?
- We can just put them back.

382
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:51,526
- Really?
- Yes.

383
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,166
My gosh.

384
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:04,106
(This is tough on Baek Hyun.)

385
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,586
- Is there a tray here?
- What?

386
00:20:17,526 --> 00:20:18,526
- A tray.
- A tray?

387
00:20:19,486 --> 00:20:21,096
Are we going to eat this again tomorrow?

388
00:20:21,296 --> 00:20:23,096
- Really?
- I'm asking.

389
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:25,325
- I can't find the container.
- This...

390
00:20:25,326 --> 00:20:27,066
I should put them in the fridge.

391
00:20:27,966 --> 00:20:29,196
Is there a container here?

392
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:32,705
(He stands at the sink as if he's under a spell.)

393
00:20:32,706 --> 00:20:34,476
- Aren't the gloves too small?
- They are too small.

394
00:20:35,076 --> 00:20:36,506
I was going to wash the dishes.

395
00:20:37,506 --> 00:20:39,046
- Do you want to join me?
- Yes.

396
00:20:39,146 --> 00:20:41,176
I want to do it. Give me a job to do.

397
00:20:42,746 --> 00:20:44,885
- Is anyone feeling drunk?
- What?

398
00:20:44,886 --> 00:20:45,945
- Is anyone feeling drunk?
- I'll do that then.

399
00:20:45,946 --> 00:20:47,216
Drunk?

400
00:20:47,656 --> 00:20:49,255
- Is anyone feeling drunk?
- Drunk?

401
00:20:49,256 --> 00:20:51,355
- I'm the only one feeling drunk?
- I'm not lying when I say this.

402
00:20:51,356 --> 00:20:52,356
I'm so drunk.

403
00:20:52,357 --> 00:20:54,625
When I was walking over here, things got hazy for a second.

404
00:20:54,626 --> 00:20:56,125
So I had to put my hand on the wall.

405
00:20:56,126 --> 00:20:58,565
- You should get some sleep then.
- No.

406
00:20:58,566 --> 00:20:59,896
- No.
- It's not that.

407
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,165
No. Please.

408
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,266
Let's do it together.

409
00:21:03,366 --> 00:21:05,065
- I...
- My vision is hazy too.

410
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:06,905
- Really?
- Actually, it's quite clear.

411
00:21:06,906 --> 00:21:08,105
(She's still talking about her vision.)

412
00:21:08,106 --> 00:21:09,876
- My vision is so clear and bright.
- That's funny.

413
00:21:11,176 --> 00:21:13,106
Should I visit the Downstairs Residents?

414
00:21:13,576 --> 00:21:14,646
Oh, this.

415
00:21:14,946 --> 00:21:16,146
Gosh, the Downstairs...

416
00:21:17,346 --> 00:21:18,346
The Downstairs Residents?

417
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:23,086
(Ji Hyeon, the loose cannon, heads downstairs.)

418
00:21:23,656 --> 00:21:25,856
- What? Where have you been?
- I'm downstairs.

419
00:21:26,356 --> 00:21:27,556
I haven't been here in a while.

420
00:21:27,656 --> 00:21:29,096
- Hi, Downstairs Residents.
- I see.

421
00:21:29,326 --> 00:21:30,726
- Gosh.
- Come over.

422
00:21:32,766 --> 00:21:33,966
Our room is...

423
00:21:34,566 --> 00:21:35,836
- quite cozy.
- Yes.

424
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,535
I'm a bit tired today.

425
00:21:38,536 --> 00:21:40,766
You lasted longer today...

426
00:21:40,976 --> 00:21:42,676
- Seriously. Are you okay?
- than yesterday.

427
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:45,306
I'm so tired.

428
00:21:45,376 --> 00:21:48,276
We should check out the Mountain Gym soon.

429
00:21:49,076 --> 00:21:50,616
- Tomorrow...
- The Mountain Gym.

430
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:55,255
She must be in a good mood now.

431
00:21:55,256 --> 00:21:56,415
- She wants to go to the gym now.
- Yes.

432
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:57,785
She doesn't want it to end.

433
00:21:57,786 --> 00:22:01,195
It must feel like she was chosen by the new guy...

434
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:03,595
and her ex. She must feel wanted by both.

435
00:22:03,596 --> 00:22:05,496
- Right.
- That must be why she's happy.

436
00:22:06,766 --> 00:22:09,796
(Yoo Sik comes out after putting away the recyclables.)

437
00:22:13,306 --> 00:22:16,406
(He hears Min Kyung's voice from the next room.)

438
00:22:24,316 --> 00:22:25,816
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

439
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,166
(Glancing)

440
00:22:38,366 --> 00:22:40,825
(Min Kyung comes out just seconds later.)

441
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:42,066
Maybe, I'll give this to them.

442
00:22:42,436 --> 00:22:46,136
(Min Kyung walks past their room after seeing Yoo Sik.)

443
00:22:54,646 --> 00:22:56,376
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

444
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:02,286
(He runs into Ji Hyeon.)

445
00:23:05,656 --> 00:23:07,025
- Are you all right?
- What?

446
00:23:07,026 --> 00:23:08,156
Are you all right?

447
00:23:08,696 --> 00:23:10,126
At what time are we having breakfast?

448
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:11,395
At what time do you want to eat?

449
00:23:11,396 --> 00:23:12,766
- What?
- At what time do you want to eat?

450
00:23:13,326 --> 00:23:14,396
Well...

451
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:19,436
(It feels like she just heard something she shouldn't have.)

452
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:21,035
When should we eat?

453
00:23:21,036 --> 00:23:23,735
(They try to pick a time for their brunch.)

454
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,346
You should get more sleep tomorrow.

455
00:23:25,476 --> 00:23:26,776
- What?
- Get more sleep tomorrow.

456
00:23:29,246 --> 00:23:30,316
Get a good night's sleep.

457
00:23:31,116 --> 00:23:33,046
How about 8am or 9am?

458
00:23:36,786 --> 00:23:41,726
(They now have a secret rendezvous.)

459
00:23:43,096 --> 00:23:44,365
Isn't it 3am now?

460
00:23:44,366 --> 00:23:45,495
- It is.
- Really?

461
00:23:45,496 --> 00:23:46,565
It's 3am?

462
00:23:46,566 --> 00:23:47,666
(Everyone has their own reasons for being kept awake.)

463
00:23:47,796 --> 00:23:49,736
At what time are you going to wake up tomorrow?

464
00:23:51,436 --> 00:23:52,606
When my body wants to wake up?

465
00:23:52,836 --> 00:23:54,066
- Really?
- Yes.

466
00:23:54,806 --> 00:23:56,135
I'll do the dishes.

467
00:23:56,136 --> 00:23:57,235
- Let's just do them together.
- These...

468
00:23:57,236 --> 00:23:58,906
- Could you clean up the rest?
- When are you waking up tomorrow?

469
00:23:59,306 --> 00:24:00,476
- Me?
- Yes.

470
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:02,276
Well, it looks like...

471
00:24:02,746 --> 00:24:05,315
I won't have anything planned for tomorrow.

472
00:24:05,316 --> 00:24:07,085
Wait. Is tomorrow Wednesday? No, it's Tuesday, right?

473
00:24:07,086 --> 00:24:08,755
- Yes. It's Tuesday.
- I see. Okay.

474
00:24:08,756 --> 00:24:09,956
That might be tough.

475
00:24:13,356 --> 00:24:16,055
- Let's have a meal and then...
- We might wake up early.

476
00:24:16,056 --> 00:24:17,626
- Right. Totally.
- I might wake up early.

477
00:24:18,526 --> 00:24:19,625
(Min Kyung stands next to Yoo Sik.)

478
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:21,095
- Do you usually wake up early?
- Right.

479
00:24:21,096 --> 00:24:22,796
- What?
- Do you usually wake up early?

480
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,665
He asked if you usually wake up early.

481
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:26,706
- I wake up really early.
- Really?

482
00:24:32,546 --> 00:24:34,515
Give that to me. I'll wipe it.

483
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:35,775
Okay. No. I'll do it.

484
00:24:35,776 --> 00:24:36,915
Why? Let's just do them together.

485
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:38,416
Could you just throw out the trash?

486
00:24:38,946 --> 00:24:40,386
- Ladies...
- Why?

487
00:24:41,616 --> 00:24:43,186
- Ladies...
- Why?

488
00:24:45,426 --> 00:24:47,126
- Just...
- That's crazy.

489
00:24:47,526 --> 00:24:48,626
That's not easy at all.

490
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,526
That's crazy.

491
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:52,366
I'll take care of the rest.

492
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:53,766
I'll put detergent on them.

493
00:24:55,866 --> 00:24:56,866
Leave them.

494
00:24:58,836 --> 00:25:01,675
- I'll go and wash up.
- Okay. Timing should work.

495
00:25:01,676 --> 00:25:02,676
- Okay.
- Okay.

496
00:25:02,677 --> 00:25:04,546
- I'll grab some water.
- Okay.

497
00:25:05,176 --> 00:25:07,346
- Yun Nyeong.
- Yes?

498
00:25:07,746 --> 00:25:09,176
You're doing everything by yourself.

499
00:25:09,546 --> 00:25:11,845
- Me?
- You keep cleaning.

500
00:25:11,846 --> 00:25:14,486
- No.
- I'll grab one to our room.

501
00:25:18,086 --> 00:25:20,326
It felt like he didn't care about me.

502
00:25:21,196 --> 00:25:24,526
He was giving me the cold shoulder.

503
00:25:24,896 --> 00:25:26,396
He even tried not to look at me.

504
00:25:26,966 --> 00:25:28,895
Overall, it felt like he was trying...

505
00:25:28,896 --> 00:25:30,836
to take care of the others.

506
00:25:31,636 --> 00:25:34,736
It was annoying, and it made me angry a bit.

507
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,176
Thank you.

508
00:25:41,576 --> 00:25:43,646
- Goodnight. Okay.
- See you tomorrow.

509
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:45,916
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

510
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:47,346
(Looking around)

511
00:25:51,226 --> 00:25:53,156
Why are you pretending to be domestic?

512
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,165
- My gosh.
- See? I told you, didn't I?

513
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:02,166
I told you this would happen!

514
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:05,266
- My gosh.
- She's so scary!

515
00:26:06,936 --> 00:26:08,836
- It's scarier than being cursed at.
- That's...

516
00:26:08,976 --> 00:26:10,736
"Why are you pretending to be domestic?"

517
00:26:11,546 --> 00:26:13,075
- Gosh. Why are we standing up?
- "Stop acting."

518
00:26:13,076 --> 00:26:14,146
What is this? A standing concert?

519
00:26:15,346 --> 00:26:17,346
- A standing concert?
- What's happening?

520
00:26:17,516 --> 00:26:19,545
- Gosh, what she said was...
- That was...

521
00:26:19,546 --> 00:26:20,945
- That never crossed my mind.
- I'm getting a headache.

522
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:22,955
- My head hurts.
- "Why are you acting domestic?"

523
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,085
"Whom are you trying to impress?"

524
00:26:24,086 --> 00:26:25,185
- Right.
- That's what it sounds like, right?

525
00:26:25,186 --> 00:26:27,425
- The hair on my body is rising.
- Right.

526
00:26:27,426 --> 00:26:29,495
- I feel like I was just punched.
- The hair on my body...

527
00:26:29,496 --> 00:26:31,765
She couldn't have said that without any precedent, though.

528
00:26:31,766 --> 00:26:33,565
I knew we'd see something like this today.

529
00:26:33,566 --> 00:26:35,266
- Right. It's about time.
- Yes.

530
00:26:36,336 --> 00:26:38,166
Why are you pretending to be domestic?

531
00:26:50,246 --> 00:26:54,586
(Yoo Sik doesn't say anything to Min Kyung's question.)

532
00:26:54,886 --> 00:26:57,286
There were moments when I could tell...

533
00:26:58,356 --> 00:27:01,496
she purposely made certain faces at me...

534
00:27:02,196 --> 00:27:06,866
and spoke in a different tone of voice only to me.

535
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:10,336
I could sense everything.

536
00:27:11,706 --> 00:27:14,006
I was trying to ignore what she was doing.

537
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,406
But I didn't know if I should keep ignoring that...

538
00:27:16,906 --> 00:27:18,946
or talk to her about it.

539
00:27:19,976 --> 00:27:23,276
That thought kept bothering me.

540
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:29,556
(The time between them has stopped.)

541
00:27:34,026 --> 00:27:36,156
We're done washing the dishes.

542
00:27:36,896 --> 00:27:38,995
Let me just wash a cup.

543
00:27:38,996 --> 00:27:40,866
- Okay.
- I'll do it.

544
00:27:41,466 --> 00:27:44,396
- I'll do it. My hands are wet.
- Gosh. Thank you.

545
00:27:44,936 --> 00:27:47,735
Then I'll head downstairs now.

546
00:27:47,736 --> 00:27:49,076
- Okay.
- Okay. See you tomorrow.

547
00:27:49,476 --> 00:27:50,636
Goodnight.

548
00:27:53,646 --> 00:27:56,446
(Min Kyung leaves the dining room too.)

549
00:27:59,246 --> 00:28:00,416
- Goodnight.
- Thanks.

550
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,216
See you tomorrow.

551
00:28:06,186 --> 00:28:08,096
Gosh. So annoying.

552
00:28:11,026 --> 00:28:14,666
Gosh, can you feel what it's like?

553
00:28:14,766 --> 00:28:16,365
They're making me feel uncomfortable.

554
00:28:16,366 --> 00:28:19,305
Yoo Sik didn't say anything.

555
00:28:19,306 --> 00:28:22,836
- Was that wise?
- I think that was the wisest move.

556
00:28:22,936 --> 00:28:24,506
Keeping quiet...

557
00:28:24,876 --> 00:28:27,905
and watching the flow...

558
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:29,916
might be the best for him.

559
00:28:30,016 --> 00:28:32,315
In a way, the fact that the conversation didn't...

560
00:28:32,316 --> 00:28:33,915
go any further was the best for the two.

561
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:36,686
- Yes.
- It'd prevent any misunderstanding.

562
00:28:37,656 --> 00:28:41,326
(Baek Hyun and Yoo Sik in the dining room.)

563
00:28:41,496 --> 00:28:42,996
Finally, we're alone.

564
00:28:47,196 --> 00:28:49,036
- We're...
- Yes?

565
00:28:51,706 --> 00:28:52,766
How should I put this?

566
00:29:01,076 --> 00:29:04,516
I feel like I can trust you for anything.

567
00:29:05,486 --> 00:29:07,416
I agree with you. It's strange.

568
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:12,386
I know we haven't talked much.

569
00:29:13,286 --> 00:29:14,355
So I'm just saying.

570
00:29:14,356 --> 00:29:15,956
I think we have the same values.

571
00:29:18,996 --> 00:29:20,996
Seriously,

572
00:29:22,766 --> 00:29:26,636
if my ex is going to choose anyone,

573
00:29:27,706 --> 00:29:29,406
it'd be you.

574
00:29:33,006 --> 00:29:36,146
I'd see why.

575
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:37,416
Because...

576
00:29:40,586 --> 00:29:44,886
It's so... It's...

577
00:29:47,256 --> 00:29:48,426
So...

578
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:52,826
I can't ask my ex how she feels, can I?

579
00:29:52,926 --> 00:29:53,996
Probably not.

580
00:29:55,066 --> 00:29:57,496
But we should be careful...

581
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:01,406
- because it's only been two days.
- Right.

582
00:30:01,876 --> 00:30:03,435
- Right.
- What if our actions don't...

583
00:30:03,436 --> 00:30:05,005
match our words?

584
00:30:05,006 --> 00:30:06,746
But I'd still understand.

585
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:09,476
Because it's the situation that leads you to do that.

586
00:30:09,946 --> 00:30:13,546
Even if you're interested in someone new,

587
00:30:13,946 --> 00:30:16,786
it's only less than three weeks.

588
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:19,726
We've spent way more time with our exes,

589
00:30:20,126 --> 00:30:23,496
and we built way more memories together.

590
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:28,166
- Right.
- So our feelings...

591
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:33,736
(He goes back to the feelings he's been hiding toward his ex.)

592
00:30:37,806 --> 00:30:39,976
I'd been emotionally drained lately.

593
00:30:47,486 --> 00:30:48,556
I'm worried.

594
00:30:49,986 --> 00:30:51,425
I'd be under a lot of stress.

595
00:30:51,426 --> 00:30:52,786
What if we end up crying together?

596
00:30:55,556 --> 00:30:57,156
- Oh, you're right.
- Right?

597
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:02,266
Right now, I feel...

598
00:31:03,836 --> 00:31:05,565
But if I hear what I want to hear...

599
00:31:05,566 --> 00:31:06,666
Anyone in there?

600
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:14,576
(Someone appears in two men's space.)

601
00:31:15,046 --> 00:31:16,316
Anyone in there?

602
00:31:18,386 --> 00:31:19,485
(Ji Hyeon in natural state appears.)

603
00:31:19,486 --> 00:31:22,186
If yes, please don't come here.

604
00:31:22,986 --> 00:31:25,956
(She heads straight to the living room.)

605
00:31:26,486 --> 00:31:28,256
- What?
- Never mind.

606
00:31:28,496 --> 00:31:32,265
- If anyone's here...
- You can't come here.

607
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:33,495
You'll like it if you join us.

608
00:31:33,496 --> 00:31:35,565
Really? Don't come here.

609
00:31:35,566 --> 00:31:38,205
You can come here.

610
00:31:38,206 --> 00:31:40,206
Really? I have a mask pack on.

611
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:41,775
I can see it.

612
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:43,876
Really? Just see my reflection in the mirror.

613
00:31:45,176 --> 00:31:46,606
- Hi.
- Hi.

614
00:31:47,376 --> 00:31:49,676
It's fun here.

615
00:31:51,446 --> 00:31:54,486
(Checking her reflection in the mirror)

616
00:31:56,316 --> 00:31:57,716
Why are you jumping?

617
00:31:59,856 --> 00:32:00,956
Why did you come down?

618
00:32:06,126 --> 00:32:10,296
(Answering physically instead)

619
00:32:13,966 --> 00:32:15,876
(Stretching)

620
00:32:16,106 --> 00:32:17,376
Stretching?

621
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:20,846
She's exercising.

622
00:32:23,716 --> 00:32:26,946
(Ji Hyeon is exercising in the middle of the night.)

623
00:32:29,316 --> 00:32:30,916
My goodness.

624
00:32:31,626 --> 00:32:33,555
Why is she exercising there instead of her room?

625
00:32:33,556 --> 00:32:35,556
Imagine doing that next to someone sleeping.

626
00:32:35,656 --> 00:32:36,696
But...

627
00:32:36,796 --> 00:32:38,666
Imagine doing that next to the bed.

628
00:32:40,226 --> 00:32:43,466
(What's going on?)

629
00:32:46,936 --> 00:32:49,806
I... Well...

630
00:32:50,276 --> 00:32:52,246
I drank a lot that day.

631
00:32:52,946 --> 00:32:55,316
I acted weird that day against my will.

632
00:32:55,716 --> 00:32:57,846
(Embarrassed)

633
00:32:58,316 --> 00:33:01,346
(Why did you do it in the living room instead of your room?)

634
00:33:01,786 --> 00:33:04,516
Min Kyung said she's a light sleeper.

635
00:33:05,386 --> 00:33:07,856
So when I enter the room late,

636
00:33:08,056 --> 00:33:10,156
she goes, "Who's that?"

637
00:33:10,996 --> 00:33:13,526
(The 1st night)

638
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:16,366
(On eggshells)

639
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:19,406
Who's there?

640
00:33:19,506 --> 00:33:22,376
- Go back to sleep.
- Ji Hyeon?

641
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:26,476
So I knew I could never do it in the room.

642
00:33:26,976 --> 00:33:31,245
I feel like my body becomes stiff if I don't do it.

643
00:33:31,246 --> 00:33:35,286
I didn't feel embarrassed after drinking.

644
00:33:37,186 --> 00:33:38,426
(Exclaiming)

645
00:33:39,386 --> 00:33:42,756
(The refreshing stretching showed how considerate she was.)

646
00:33:43,296 --> 00:33:44,826
(Thorough protection)

647
00:33:46,266 --> 00:33:49,566
(She returns to her room quickly while guarding thoroughly.)

648
00:33:59,576 --> 00:34:03,016
(Stretching in the middle of the night was pretty impactful.)

649
00:34:07,386 --> 00:34:11,086
(Min Kyung who was expected to sleep isn't in the room.)

650
00:34:18,266 --> 00:34:20,896
- Are you up?
- Yes, I brushed my teeth.

651
00:34:24,036 --> 00:34:26,436
- Aren't you tired?
- Let's go to bed.

652
00:34:27,236 --> 00:34:28,705
It's even later than yesterday.

653
00:34:28,706 --> 00:34:30,306
- I know.
- I was expecting to sleep early.

654
00:34:31,976 --> 00:34:34,876
Did you request a date tomorrow?

655
00:34:36,246 --> 00:34:37,246
(Shaking her head)

656
00:34:37,247 --> 00:34:38,286
Right?

657
00:34:39,946 --> 00:34:41,445
- Should I take this chance?
- What?

658
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,156
Should I do it now?

659
00:34:43,356 --> 00:34:44,456
I haven't requested it yet.

660
00:34:45,386 --> 00:34:46,986
I think no one did yet.

661
00:34:48,726 --> 00:34:50,956
Right now,

662
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:54,726
there is someone I'm interested in.

663
00:34:55,736 --> 00:34:57,466
But I'm kind of scared...

664
00:34:59,406 --> 00:35:01,136
because the other person might not feel the same way.

665
00:35:02,376 --> 00:35:04,136
I don't like that.

666
00:35:04,776 --> 00:35:05,846
You need to bring him.

667
00:35:06,446 --> 00:35:07,446
Get him?

668
00:35:07,876 --> 00:35:10,416
- Not like that.
- How do I bring him?

669
00:35:10,516 --> 00:35:12,416
Make him like you.

670
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,886
Approach him?

671
00:35:17,186 --> 00:35:20,485
Yes, if there's something I want...

672
00:35:20,486 --> 00:35:21,486
Do you have to get it?

673
00:35:22,256 --> 00:35:24,625
- I try my best to get it.
- Really?

674
00:35:24,626 --> 00:35:27,996
- That's a good idea.
- For example, things he might like.

675
00:35:28,866 --> 00:35:30,466
The kind of person he likes.

676
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:34,636
Was your date satisfactory today?

677
00:35:34,936 --> 00:35:35,936
It was.

678
00:35:39,746 --> 00:35:41,605
That's interesting.

679
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:43,146
(Min Kyung's guessing Ji Hyeon is Yoo Sik's date.)

680
00:35:43,646 --> 00:35:47,716
Even though we only met yesterday,

681
00:35:49,716 --> 00:35:51,486
I liked it so much.

682
00:35:52,086 --> 00:35:54,556
- What is? Your date today?
- Yes.

683
00:35:55,126 --> 00:35:56,195
- Really?
- Yes.

684
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:57,356
Was he your ideal type?

685
00:35:59,496 --> 00:36:00,666
The counterpunch.

686
00:36:00,766 --> 00:36:03,666
That's too provoking for the ex to hear.

687
00:36:03,766 --> 00:36:06,605
With what's going on between her ex and Ji Hyeon,

688
00:36:06,606 --> 00:36:10,375
she must feel dizzy to hear about getting him.

689
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:13,875
It's only a loss for Min Kyung to keep talking.

690
00:36:13,876 --> 00:36:15,316
- Right. Stop asking.
- Yes.

691
00:36:16,416 --> 00:36:17,575
- Really?
- Yes.

692
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:18,646
Was he your ideal type?

693
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:21,646
- When I talked to him, - Yes?

694
00:36:23,356 --> 00:36:25,085
I found the new side of him.

695
00:36:25,086 --> 00:36:26,726
I even told him that.

696
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:29,126
- Actually...
- The type of person you like?

697
00:36:29,556 --> 00:36:31,356
That I didn't expect that from him.

698
00:36:32,166 --> 00:36:33,725
He was different from my expectations.

699
00:36:33,726 --> 00:36:36,036
I'm curious. Who is it?

700
00:36:36,766 --> 00:36:38,905
It's okay to be curious.

701
00:36:38,906 --> 00:36:41,135
- Yes.
- It's okay to be curious.

702
00:36:41,136 --> 00:36:43,306
- As long as I don't answer you.
- Right.

703
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:47,646
We had a good time,

704
00:36:47,946 --> 00:36:50,745
but I still feel somewhat uncomfortable around him.

705
00:36:50,746 --> 00:36:51,985
- Really?
- Yes.

706
00:36:51,986 --> 00:36:52,986
Right.

707
00:36:53,616 --> 00:36:56,886
That's how it felt.

708
00:36:59,786 --> 00:37:01,526
- What do you mean?
- It's pretty unpleasant.

709
00:37:02,626 --> 00:37:05,266
It's quite unpleasant.

710
00:37:06,366 --> 00:37:07,426
Right.

711
00:37:07,526 --> 00:37:10,166
But it's not that I'm angry...

712
00:37:11,136 --> 00:37:13,066
or jealous.

713
00:37:13,436 --> 00:37:15,706
It just doesn't feel nice.

714
00:37:17,376 --> 00:37:20,375
It's strange.

715
00:37:20,376 --> 00:37:24,245
Strangely enough, my feelings...

716
00:37:24,246 --> 00:37:25,446
(The strange feelings she never experienced before)

717
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,316
It feels like...

718
00:37:32,226 --> 00:37:34,256
I'm handing over my ex to someone else.

719
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:37,656
- That's how it feels.
- From the start?

720
00:37:39,866 --> 00:37:41,126
Including the chat room...

721
00:37:42,196 --> 00:37:43,265
and the introduction from the ex.

722
00:37:43,266 --> 00:37:46,636
I had to write his features and...

723
00:37:46,736 --> 00:37:48,675
- You were talking about him.
- Yes. I wrote everything.

724
00:37:48,676 --> 00:37:49,676
Right.

725
00:37:50,806 --> 00:37:53,675
It's not something I can help you,

726
00:37:53,676 --> 00:37:58,176
but I don't want anyone to be hurt.

727
00:37:59,246 --> 00:38:00,286
Let's sleep.

728
00:38:06,926 --> 00:38:08,356
- Goodnight.
- Night.

729
00:38:08,456 --> 00:38:09,725
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

730
00:38:09,726 --> 00:38:12,096
(They're getting a lot on their minds.)

731
00:38:13,766 --> 00:38:14,996
Oh, my gosh.

732
00:38:15,096 --> 00:38:18,065
Even though there was only one percent left...

733
00:38:18,066 --> 00:38:20,035
She's trying so desperate...

734
00:38:20,036 --> 00:38:21,905
to ask as much as she could.

735
00:38:21,906 --> 00:38:24,235
- But Min Kyung is...
- Min Kyung is...

736
00:38:24,236 --> 00:38:26,845
Is she simply annoyed?

737
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,005
Because he's not looking after her?

738
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:29,975
She doesn't understand her emotion either.

739
00:38:29,976 --> 00:38:31,616
- Right? It's complex.
- Yes.

740
00:38:31,716 --> 00:38:33,485
She didn't seem jealous.

741
00:38:33,486 --> 00:38:34,645
- She's not jealous.
- No.

742
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:37,556
It's not that she's jealous, but her pride is hurt.

743
00:38:37,756 --> 00:38:39,585
- Yes.
- She's here with a determination...

744
00:38:39,586 --> 00:38:41,255
- That's true.
- not to like him.

745
00:38:41,256 --> 00:38:43,695
- She's okay, but...
- It's something everyone says.

746
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:47,095
That the other person is hurting their pride.

747
00:38:47,096 --> 00:38:48,965
- Throughout the show.
- Yes.

748
00:38:48,966 --> 00:38:51,865
I think this is the perfect time to transfer...

749
00:38:51,866 --> 00:38:53,465
for the cast.

750
00:38:53,466 --> 00:38:56,275
- Right.
- That's what Min Kyung's feeling.

751
00:38:56,276 --> 00:38:58,075
- She's the 1st one.
- She's the 1st one to feel it.

752
00:38:58,076 --> 00:38:59,945
Even if she's jealous,

753
00:38:59,946 --> 00:39:01,445
- that'd still hurt her pride.
- Yes.

754
00:39:01,446 --> 00:39:04,075
- She hates to see herself, - Yes.

755
00:39:04,076 --> 00:39:05,175
yet she's annoyed.

756
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,915
That's why she said it felt strange.

757
00:39:06,916 --> 00:39:09,285
That's why she said...

758
00:39:09,286 --> 00:39:10,656
- She's fighting with herself.
- she wasn't jealous.

759
00:39:18,326 --> 00:39:21,935
(Kwak Min Kyung and Cho Yoo Sik)

760
00:39:21,936 --> 00:39:23,935
(Park Ji Hyeon)

761
00:39:23,936 --> 00:39:25,965
(Sung Baek Hyun)

762
00:39:25,966 --> 00:39:27,935
(Choi Yun Nyeong)

763
00:39:27,936 --> 00:39:29,775
(Kim Woo Jin)

764
00:39:29,776 --> 00:39:31,605
(Hong Ji Yeon)

765
00:39:31,606 --> 00:39:33,446
(Jung Won Kyu)

766
00:39:47,126 --> 00:39:50,196
(EXchange 4)

767
00:39:51,196 --> 00:39:54,966
(Episode 4, Passing Carelessly)

768
00:39:57,566 --> 00:40:00,866
(The night passes.)

769
00:40:02,176 --> 00:40:05,476
(Everyone's asleep in the morning.)

770
00:40:09,516 --> 00:40:12,746
(Min Kyung and Ji Hyeon are up first.)

771
00:40:12,886 --> 00:40:14,386
It's too early.

772
00:40:15,386 --> 00:40:17,516
- What?
- It's still too early.

773
00:40:18,986 --> 00:40:19,986
Quarter to.

774
00:40:21,186 --> 00:40:23,326
Let me check downstairs.

775
00:40:23,426 --> 00:40:24,426
Why?

776
00:40:24,956 --> 00:40:26,726
I need to check something.

777
00:40:36,306 --> 00:40:39,106
(Ji Hyeon heads to the living room as soon as she's up.)

778
00:40:51,556 --> 00:40:55,626
(She starts writing a note.)

779
00:40:57,326 --> 00:40:59,465
I told Yoo Sik last night...

780
00:40:59,466 --> 00:41:01,826
to have breakfast together.

781
00:41:02,366 --> 00:41:06,136
I told him we should meet around 8 or 9am.

782
00:41:06,606 --> 00:41:09,376
But we went to bed too late.

783
00:41:09,776 --> 00:41:13,946
Just in case Yoo Sik's waiting,

784
00:41:14,376 --> 00:41:15,876
I left a note.

785
00:41:16,346 --> 00:41:19,086
To get some more rest and have brunch later.

786
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:24,315
(She folds the note...)

787
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:26,786
(and starts moving.)

788
00:41:30,456 --> 00:41:31,796
(Pause)

789
00:41:42,576 --> 00:41:44,576
(Yoo Sik's still sleeping.)

790
00:41:49,446 --> 00:41:51,776
(Her 1st attempt to deliver the note fails.)

791
00:41:52,786 --> 00:41:54,315
Is anyone up?

792
00:41:54,316 --> 00:41:55,416
(Shaking her head)

793
00:41:56,886 --> 00:41:58,726
I guess I'm up first again today.

794
00:41:59,086 --> 00:42:01,886
Really? I'm second unexpectedly.

795
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:08,026
(In the meantime, Yoo Sik and Won Kyu are up.)

796
00:42:08,496 --> 00:42:09,996
Are you going out for a date today?

797
00:42:10,836 --> 00:42:11,896
I should.

798
00:42:12,766 --> 00:42:14,866
I should. We're here to find a date.

799
00:42:16,306 --> 00:42:18,976
But what if he refuses? "No thanks."

800
00:42:19,976 --> 00:42:22,276
- "I don't want to go." - Then...

801
00:42:23,116 --> 00:42:24,776
- find someone else.
- Who?

802
00:42:26,846 --> 00:42:27,916
Find someone else among the three.

803
00:42:28,016 --> 00:42:29,356
Among the other people?

804
00:42:29,556 --> 00:42:31,316
You can talk to your ex...

805
00:42:31,686 --> 00:42:33,926
if it's too hard.

806
00:42:34,286 --> 00:42:35,325
(Groaning)

807
00:42:35,326 --> 00:42:36,826
It's okay to talk to him.

808
00:42:40,396 --> 00:42:41,826
Let me check downstairs.

809
00:42:44,296 --> 00:42:47,236
(She picks up the note she hasn't delivered yet.)

810
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,676
(Peeping)

811
00:43:03,756 --> 00:43:05,655
Not even making the sound of her footsteps?

812
00:43:05,656 --> 00:43:07,126
Is she showing her ninja techniques?

813
00:43:09,956 --> 00:43:12,466
(Quietly)

814
00:43:17,766 --> 00:43:20,636
(Running again)

815
00:43:22,606 --> 00:43:23,836
Why is she doing that?

816
00:43:23,936 --> 00:43:25,576
Maybe she's still drunk.

817
00:43:26,276 --> 00:43:28,075
- Did she not sober up yet?
- She's the same as yesterday.

818
00:43:28,076 --> 00:43:29,315
- Yes.
- That's right.

819
00:43:29,316 --> 00:43:31,445
- She's the same as yesterday.
- She's in a good mood.

820
00:43:31,446 --> 00:43:33,585
That's why she exercised yesterday to do that in the morning.

821
00:43:33,586 --> 00:43:34,645
That's cute.

822
00:43:34,646 --> 00:43:36,185
I think she's enjoying it.

823
00:43:36,186 --> 00:43:39,586
I can see that she likes Yoo Sik so much.

824
00:43:44,096 --> 00:43:47,666
(After hesitating, Ji Hyeon retreats.)

825
00:43:52,606 --> 00:43:55,136
(She puts off the note.)

826
00:43:55,936 --> 00:43:57,435
- Coffee?
- Yes.

827
00:43:57,436 --> 00:44:00,106
- I want a caffe latte.
- But the coffee just...

828
00:44:01,246 --> 00:44:05,416
(In the meantime, Yoo Sik got ready.)

829
00:44:09,956 --> 00:44:11,386
- Morning.
- Morning.

830
00:44:12,256 --> 00:44:13,386
- Morning.
- Morning.

831
00:44:16,956 --> 00:44:18,056
Where are you going?

832
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:19,226
Outside.

833
00:44:19,266 --> 00:44:20,366
The weather is...

834
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28,306
(Yoo Sik heads to the 4th floor.)

835
00:44:30,076 --> 00:44:31,576
(In a rush)

836
00:44:32,846 --> 00:44:34,276
Did you add ice?

837
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:35,816
Yes, there's ice.

838
00:44:47,186 --> 00:44:49,196
(She spots Yoo Sik.)

839
00:44:55,096 --> 00:44:57,996
(She delivers the note in a unique way.)

840
00:44:58,136 --> 00:44:59,465
Oh, good job.

841
00:44:59,466 --> 00:45:01,136
Nice.

842
00:45:01,836 --> 00:45:03,006
Amazing.

843
00:45:03,106 --> 00:45:04,536
- She's like a bull.
- Yes.

844
00:45:04,676 --> 00:45:05,875
- She's like a bull.
- Yes. A bull.

845
00:45:05,876 --> 00:45:07,005
A rhino.

846
00:45:07,006 --> 00:45:08,406
She was born to be in love.

847
00:45:09,776 --> 00:45:13,186
(She delivers the note in a unique way.)

848
00:45:16,516 --> 00:45:17,586
What?

849
00:45:19,956 --> 00:45:20,956
Nothing. I was grabbing something.

850
00:45:26,866 --> 00:45:30,766
(Yoo Sik reads the note in the quiet terrace.)

851
00:45:40,046 --> 00:45:43,546
(He heads back to the dining room.)

852
00:45:44,216 --> 00:45:45,715
Yoo Sik, you should go back to sleep.

853
00:45:45,716 --> 00:45:46,785
- Me?
- You must be tired.

854
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:48,645
Yoo Sik, you should go back to sleep.

855
00:45:48,646 --> 00:45:49,655
- Me?
- You must be tired.

856
00:45:49,656 --> 00:45:50,656
You should go back to sleep.

857
00:45:51,486 --> 00:45:53,225
No, I'm up.

858
00:45:53,226 --> 00:45:54,256
Really?

859
00:46:07,966 --> 00:46:09,735
- Are you making coffee again?
- Yes.

860
00:46:09,736 --> 00:46:11,276
The beans weren't ground.

861
00:46:13,046 --> 00:46:14,546
(Glancing)

862
00:46:22,556 --> 00:46:24,955
- How could he stand there?
- What's he doing?

863
00:46:24,956 --> 00:46:27,485
They need to have brunch, but Min Kyung's there.

864
00:46:27,486 --> 00:46:28,885
It's not like he could bring it up.

865
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:31,025
- Min Kyung kind of noticed it.
- Yes.

866
00:46:31,026 --> 00:46:32,595
It's the hunch from dating nine years.

867
00:46:32,596 --> 00:46:33,996
Yes. They went out for nine years.

868
00:46:34,026 --> 00:46:36,835
- And Ji Hyeon looks so excited.
- Yes.

869
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:38,795
She's a woman in love.

870
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:39,936
- You think so?
- It's obvious.

871
00:46:42,376 --> 00:46:44,236
(On eggshells)

872
00:46:47,146 --> 00:46:49,046
Milk? Milk is...

873
00:46:52,076 --> 00:46:54,386
Less than half left.

874
00:46:56,956 --> 00:46:58,415
Let's try it first.

875
00:46:58,416 --> 00:47:00,525
Yes. Maybe three glasses?

876
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:03,425
(Yoo Sik stares at Min Kyung and leaves.)

877
00:47:03,426 --> 00:47:04,656
I shouldn't pour too much.

878
00:47:07,426 --> 00:47:09,566
(Sighing)

879
00:47:17,236 --> 00:47:21,206
My ex was with Ji Hyeon.

880
00:47:22,416 --> 00:47:25,846
I wasn't sure if I had to give the answer to the note right away.

881
00:47:27,016 --> 00:47:29,585
I don't know. She got on my nerves.

882
00:47:29,586 --> 00:47:31,216
I couldn't stop minding her.

883
00:47:34,156 --> 00:47:38,456
(Yoo Sik who has a lot on his mind goes outside.)

884
00:47:39,366 --> 00:47:40,726
Can you pass that to me?

885
00:47:41,566 --> 00:47:42,566
Thank you.

886
00:47:42,567 --> 00:47:44,335
I'll go wash up.

887
00:47:44,336 --> 00:47:45,396
Sure.

888
00:47:50,236 --> 00:47:51,636
Did you have coffee?

889
00:47:51,776 --> 00:47:53,146
- No.
- Not yet?

890
00:47:54,646 --> 00:47:56,275
Thank you for the vitamin.

891
00:47:56,276 --> 00:47:57,276
Right.

892
00:47:57,676 --> 00:48:00,216
The one I gave you yesterday.

893
00:48:01,286 --> 00:48:04,355
I don't know if you'd like it, but I still put it by your bedside.

894
00:48:04,356 --> 00:48:05,885
- Yes.
- It's the oriental medicine.

895
00:48:05,886 --> 00:48:07,086
Right.

896
00:48:07,586 --> 00:48:10,626
Are there only two chairs?

897
00:48:11,026 --> 00:48:12,596
There's more over there.

898
00:48:14,326 --> 00:48:16,295
(Min Kyung is outside when he left to avoid her.)

899
00:48:16,296 --> 00:48:18,396
We're the only ones up.

900
00:48:18,596 --> 00:48:19,836
- Just us?
- Yes.

901
00:48:20,666 --> 00:48:21,806
Maybe...

902
00:48:24,336 --> 00:48:25,576
Thank you.

903
00:48:30,146 --> 00:48:31,216
What were you doing?

904
00:48:31,546 --> 00:48:32,845
The weather is so nice.

905
00:48:32,846 --> 00:48:34,586
We're just sitting here.

906
00:48:36,216 --> 00:48:39,016
I've been getting up early lately.

907
00:48:39,856 --> 00:48:41,126
- On your own?
- Yes.

908
00:48:41,626 --> 00:48:42,696
I...

909
00:48:43,226 --> 00:48:44,996
I think I got up before 8am.

910
00:48:45,826 --> 00:48:46,965
What were you doing?

911
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:49,566
I washed up and watched YouTube.

912
00:48:49,866 --> 00:48:50,936
YouTube?

913
00:48:54,166 --> 00:48:56,235
I think we barely talked.

914
00:48:56,236 --> 00:48:57,636
Right.

915
00:48:57,736 --> 00:49:00,076
- We're also on different floors.
- I know.

916
00:49:00,376 --> 00:49:02,475
You're the one I least talked to.

917
00:49:02,476 --> 00:49:03,516
You're right.

918
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:12,886
Have you seen any big bugs?

919
00:49:13,156 --> 00:49:14,426
- In the room? No.
- Yes.

920
00:49:14,686 --> 00:49:17,196
- Last night...
- Did you find one?

921
00:49:18,096 --> 00:49:20,295
We found a huge centipede.

922
00:49:20,296 --> 00:49:22,736
- I was shocked.
- Oh, my gosh.

923
00:49:23,266 --> 00:49:24,466
He caught it.

924
00:49:25,196 --> 00:49:26,236
Awesome.

925
00:49:26,436 --> 00:49:28,406
I tried not to mind her,

926
00:49:29,236 --> 00:49:31,076
but I felt the chemistry between them.

927
00:49:31,136 --> 00:49:32,875
- The sound of the bird...
- I couldn't stop looking at her.

928
00:49:32,876 --> 00:49:34,676
- became my alarm.
- I couldn't stop minding her.

929
00:49:35,246 --> 00:49:37,276
That's what happened.

930
00:49:38,576 --> 00:49:39,786
Really?

931
00:49:41,016 --> 00:49:42,485
That's the disadvantage.

932
00:49:42,486 --> 00:49:43,985
The restroom door is...

933
00:49:43,986 --> 00:49:45,926
wide open.

934
00:49:47,286 --> 00:49:48,926
Oh, I made tea.

935
00:49:49,496 --> 00:49:50,956
- My tea. Excuse me.
- Sure.

936
00:49:51,326 --> 00:49:52,596
Oh, I made tea.

937
00:49:53,066 --> 00:49:54,426
- My tea. Excuse me.
- Sure.

938
00:49:57,636 --> 00:50:00,636
(Yoo Sik uses the tea as an excuse to leave.)

939
00:50:00,806 --> 00:50:02,806
- "Oh, I made tea." - Right.

940
00:50:03,606 --> 00:50:05,305
- "Oh, I made tea." - So stiff.

941
00:50:05,306 --> 00:50:07,375
Is he giving them room or avoiding them?

942
00:50:07,376 --> 00:50:09,315
- He's avoiding them.
- He's avoiding them, right?

943
00:50:09,316 --> 00:50:11,016
- That's more like it.
- "I made tea."

944
00:50:11,946 --> 00:50:13,545
I was curious.

945
00:50:13,546 --> 00:50:16,055
- Really?
- We barely talked.

946
00:50:16,056 --> 00:50:17,956
We barely had a chance to talk.

947
00:50:19,486 --> 00:50:20,656
And...

948
00:50:21,426 --> 00:50:23,255
I thought you were unique.

949
00:50:23,256 --> 00:50:25,156
Really? How am I unique?

950
00:50:25,826 --> 00:50:28,366
I got the feeling that you might be goofy.

951
00:50:28,996 --> 00:50:30,296
- Have you heard that before?
- Yes.

952
00:50:30,766 --> 00:50:31,836
I'm...

953
00:50:32,736 --> 00:50:33,966
kind of goofy.

954
00:50:35,266 --> 00:50:36,936
- You know it.
- Yes.

955
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:40,846
I think you're just as goofy.

956
00:50:41,146 --> 00:50:42,916
People made me look goofy.

957
00:50:43,676 --> 00:50:45,516
Don't you prefer it that way?

958
00:50:45,646 --> 00:50:47,515
- It's more relaxing that way.
- Yes.

959
00:50:47,516 --> 00:50:50,486
Or I wouldn't say anything.

960
00:50:51,516 --> 00:50:53,556
It's nice because people talk to me.

961
00:50:55,286 --> 00:50:56,426
Are you going out today?

962
00:50:57,426 --> 00:50:58,426
For a date?

963
00:51:00,626 --> 00:51:02,595
Did you already do something?

964
00:51:02,596 --> 00:51:03,965
No, I'm asking.

965
00:51:03,966 --> 00:51:06,636
- No. I have nothing.
- Really?

966
00:51:07,436 --> 00:51:08,765
- Do you want to go?
- Shall we?

967
00:51:08,766 --> 00:51:09,936
- Yes.
- Shall we go on a date?

968
00:51:11,036 --> 00:51:12,076
- Okay.
- It's going to be fun.

969
00:51:12,176 --> 00:51:14,905
- Because we never talked.
- Right.

970
00:51:14,906 --> 00:51:16,316
(After Yoo Sik left, they decided to go on a date.)

971
00:51:18,046 --> 00:51:20,115
That's something we'd also like to see.

972
00:51:20,116 --> 00:51:22,216
- Something might happen from it.
- Yes.

973
00:51:22,286 --> 00:51:24,186
It's a new combination.

974
00:51:24,216 --> 00:51:25,555
That's what always happens.

975
00:51:25,556 --> 00:51:26,755
Jung Won Kyu in the garden...

976
00:51:26,756 --> 00:51:28,356
always gets chosen there.

977
00:51:29,156 --> 00:51:31,056
Something keeps happening to him in the garden.

978
00:51:31,156 --> 00:51:32,795
He should stay in the garden.

979
00:51:32,796 --> 00:51:34,425
Women became enthusiastic...

980
00:51:34,426 --> 00:51:35,825
for requesting a date before.

981
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:37,966
This is getting so intriguing.

982
00:51:38,496 --> 00:51:42,005
I saw my ex having coffee...

983
00:51:42,006 --> 00:51:43,606
with Won Kyu.

984
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:46,145
So I went out...

985
00:51:46,146 --> 00:51:48,645
to talk to them.

986
00:51:48,646 --> 00:51:50,646
And I got the feeling Yoo Sik...

987
00:51:50,846 --> 00:51:54,446
was giving us room.

988
00:51:54,686 --> 00:51:57,485
So I naturally asked Won Kyu...

989
00:51:57,486 --> 00:52:01,456
to go on a date with me.

990
00:52:02,796 --> 00:52:04,226
Min Kyung has...

991
00:52:05,056 --> 00:52:06,426
the drive.

992
00:52:06,896 --> 00:52:08,526
She's willing to get to know people.

993
00:52:09,026 --> 00:52:11,066
I didn't expect that from her.

994
00:52:11,966 --> 00:52:13,736
I appreciated how she brought it up first.

995
00:52:15,106 --> 00:52:16,136
It was nice of her.

996
00:52:18,406 --> 00:52:20,906
Did Yoo Sik leave us alone on purpose?

997
00:52:20,946 --> 00:52:22,945
He said he'd...

998
00:52:22,946 --> 00:52:24,746
come back.

999
00:52:26,246 --> 00:52:27,846
- Maybe he went to ask for a date.
- What?

1000
00:52:28,686 --> 00:52:30,386
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

1001
00:52:32,456 --> 00:52:34,626
(4th floor, Min Kyung and Ji Hyeon's room)

1002
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:38,826
(Ji Hyeon's having brunch with Yoo Sik.)

1003
00:52:47,236 --> 00:52:50,676
(Checking her appearance before leaving)

1004
00:52:51,736 --> 00:52:53,145
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

1005
00:52:53,146 --> 00:52:54,876
(Min Kyung returns after the date request.)

1006
00:52:55,846 --> 00:52:57,576
I don't know what to wear for the accessory.

1007
00:52:57,776 --> 00:52:58,846
Is it too much?

1008
00:52:58,946 --> 00:53:00,616
My makeup is so thick today.

1009
00:53:01,646 --> 00:53:03,386
- No, it's similar to yesterday.
- You think so?

1010
00:53:04,116 --> 00:53:05,955
I don't think this matches my outfit.

1011
00:53:05,956 --> 00:53:07,886
(Everything worries her before brunch.)

1012
00:53:10,126 --> 00:53:11,626
I don't like it, but...

1013
00:53:11,656 --> 00:53:12,966
I'll just go.

1014
00:53:23,106 --> 00:53:24,606
- Hello.
- Hello.

1015
00:53:25,876 --> 00:53:27,505
(Everyone's in the kitchen except for Yoo Sik.)

1016
00:53:27,506 --> 00:53:28,845
- What?
- Did you sleep well?

1017
00:53:28,846 --> 00:53:30,376
- What was that?
- Did you sleep well?

1018
00:53:30,476 --> 00:53:32,546
Yes. I couldn't sleep much.

1019
00:53:34,016 --> 00:53:37,516
(Yoo Sik finally joins the kitchen.)

1020
00:53:39,186 --> 00:53:42,626
(People are already making brunch in the kitchen.)

1021
00:53:43,296 --> 00:53:44,896
(On eggshells)

1022
00:53:45,826 --> 00:53:46,926
What do you want to make?

1023
00:53:47,296 --> 00:53:48,426
What should we do?

1024
00:53:49,126 --> 00:53:50,266
What did we buy?

1025
00:53:50,996 --> 00:53:52,366
I don't remember what we bought.

1026
00:53:54,706 --> 00:53:58,035
They wanted to have brunch alone.

1027
00:53:58,036 --> 00:53:59,806
- With everyone.
- They're having it with everyone.

1028
00:54:00,776 --> 00:54:02,606
Baek Hyun, you look like a chef.

1029
00:54:06,116 --> 00:54:08,116
- No way.
- Your T-shirt yesterday.

1030
00:54:08,516 --> 00:54:10,815
- Really?
- I thought that was your uniform.

1031
00:54:10,816 --> 00:54:12,085
- His own restaurant?
- Yes.

1032
00:54:12,086 --> 00:54:13,256
You should come.

1033
00:54:16,456 --> 00:54:17,526
Okay.

1034
00:54:19,326 --> 00:54:20,326
Thank you.

1035
00:54:21,726 --> 00:54:23,435
- Did you hear it?
- What?

1036
00:54:23,436 --> 00:54:24,596
- Us talking.
- No.

1037
00:54:25,296 --> 00:54:26,766
What? But you said you heard us.

1038
00:54:26,806 --> 00:54:27,936
I couldn't hear you.

1039
00:54:30,436 --> 00:54:32,636
- Yesterday...
- Ji Hyeon.

1040
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:36,715
Are you going to drop the honorifics?

1041
00:54:36,716 --> 00:54:38,216
If you want, just drop it.

1042
00:54:39,416 --> 00:54:41,446
If you're going to use honorifics, use honorifics.

1043
00:54:42,116 --> 00:54:43,885
I like to mix them.

1044
00:54:43,886 --> 00:54:45,016
- Really?
- Yes.

1045
00:54:45,116 --> 00:54:46,455
- Mix them?
- That way,

1046
00:54:46,456 --> 00:54:49,156
it's put a distance.

1047
00:54:49,326 --> 00:54:50,726
I prefer using honorifics.

1048
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,325
- Really?
- Yes.

1049
00:54:52,326 --> 00:54:54,166
Then I'll use honorifics too, Baek Hyun.

1050
00:55:03,276 --> 00:55:04,306
Honorifics?

1051
00:55:04,506 --> 00:55:06,136
No, feel free. I was joking.

1052
00:55:06,946 --> 00:55:09,245
- No.
- But even before I said it,

1053
00:55:09,246 --> 00:55:10,915
you knew what to do.

1054
00:55:10,916 --> 00:55:11,976
- Me?
- Yes.

1055
00:55:12,946 --> 00:55:14,186
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

1056
00:55:14,586 --> 00:55:15,646
I'll behave.

1057
00:55:16,116 --> 00:55:17,186
Behave yourself.

1058
00:55:17,686 --> 00:55:20,285
Baek Hyun would say something like that?

1059
00:55:20,286 --> 00:55:21,685
- A joke like that?
- Everyone's going...

1060
00:55:21,686 --> 00:55:23,256
- But...
- What's he doing?

1061
00:55:23,956 --> 00:55:25,556
- Is he her ex?
- What he's doing...

1062
00:55:25,856 --> 00:55:27,865
He doesn't look like the type who'd do that.

1063
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,696
- Right?
- He's making it so confusing.

1064
00:55:29,766 --> 00:55:31,995
He feels comfortable around Ji Hyeon.

1065
00:55:31,996 --> 00:55:34,605
You know there are people who make you feel that way.

1066
00:55:34,606 --> 00:55:36,576
Including Parmesan yesterday,

1067
00:55:37,006 --> 00:55:38,935
Ji Hyeon is already...

1068
00:55:38,936 --> 00:55:40,605
- well aware of him.
- She knows him very well.

1069
00:55:40,606 --> 00:55:42,775
That's why they have a conversation like that.

1070
00:55:42,776 --> 00:55:45,275
But because it's been too long since they broke up,

1071
00:55:45,276 --> 00:55:47,045
even though Baek Hyun is her ex,

1072
00:55:47,046 --> 00:55:49,485
she has no feelings left for him.

1073
00:55:49,486 --> 00:55:51,455
- Oh, right.
- That might be it?

1074
00:55:51,456 --> 00:55:52,815
- I see.
- Right.

1075
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:54,755
Because they have different emotions.

1076
00:55:54,756 --> 00:55:56,595
- Ji Hyeon's moved on.
- Right.

1077
00:55:56,596 --> 00:55:58,355
- Right.
- Whereas Baek Hyun is...

1078
00:55:58,356 --> 00:55:59,425
- acting prickly.
- That's possible.

1079
00:55:59,426 --> 00:56:00,795
- That's possible.
- Baek Hyun is...

1080
00:56:00,796 --> 00:56:02,565
- acting like a friend.
- Yes.

1081
00:56:02,566 --> 00:56:04,165
Some couples are like that.

1082
00:56:04,166 --> 00:56:05,265
It's not like they'd go,

1083
00:56:05,266 --> 00:56:06,565
- "Hey, man." - Not that much, but...

1084
00:56:06,566 --> 00:56:09,265
It feels like they're being a bit sassy.

1085
00:56:09,266 --> 00:56:10,836
Yes, to each other.

1086
00:56:12,106 --> 00:56:14,176
- Come.
- It looks good.

1087
00:56:14,576 --> 00:56:16,075
You must know many must-eat places.

1088
00:56:16,076 --> 00:56:17,175
- Must-eat places?
- Yes.

1089
00:56:17,176 --> 00:56:18,615
- Thank you for the food.
- Shall I share the list?

1090
00:56:18,616 --> 00:56:19,716
Yes.

1091
00:56:24,716 --> 00:56:25,786
The melon is good.

1092
00:56:26,956 --> 00:56:28,155
Why is the egg so good?

1093
00:56:28,156 --> 00:56:30,156
Yes, this one is good too.

1094
00:56:33,266 --> 00:56:34,396
It's a little spicy.

1095
00:56:34,496 --> 00:56:36,266
I recall you saying you're good with spicy.

1096
00:56:37,396 --> 00:56:38,935
It's good even with dried seaweed.

1097
00:56:38,936 --> 00:56:40,336
- The eggs?
- Yes.

1098
00:56:40,536 --> 00:56:42,006
You wrap eggs with dried seaweed?

1099
00:56:44,306 --> 00:56:45,435
That's a new combination.

1100
00:56:45,436 --> 00:56:47,106
Is that so? I'm quite the weird foodie.

1101
00:56:47,476 --> 00:56:49,106
I eat however I want.

1102
00:56:49,506 --> 00:56:51,975
- She's Professor Foodie.
- "Professor Foodie?"

1103
00:56:51,976 --> 00:56:53,046
Yes.

1104
00:56:54,146 --> 00:56:55,616
She has many doctoral degrees.

1105
00:56:58,286 --> 00:56:59,486
Like Professor Fried Chicken.

1106
00:57:01,526 --> 00:57:03,026
- It's good.
- Is it?

1107
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,865
You have an eyelash stuck around here.

1108
00:57:08,866 --> 00:57:10,266
- Really?
- There are two.

1109
00:57:11,166 --> 00:57:12,236
Thank you.

1110
00:57:19,506 --> 00:57:21,245
I feel like she talks the least.

1111
00:57:21,246 --> 00:57:22,845
- Exactly.
- Why...

1112
00:57:22,846 --> 00:57:24,675
Weren't you an ENFP, Ji Yeon?

1113
00:57:24,676 --> 00:57:26,586
- Change it to an "I." - It's absurd.

1114
00:57:26,816 --> 00:57:29,416
Or are you in deep sorrow or something?

1115
00:57:30,086 --> 00:57:32,855
Things are still unfamiliar.

1116
00:57:32,856 --> 00:57:34,626
- Really?
- Still?

1117
00:57:35,126 --> 00:57:37,626
Without realizing,

1118
00:57:40,066 --> 00:57:43,366
everyone must feel uneasy, no?

1119
00:57:43,636 --> 00:57:46,036
Someone's ex is here with them, right?

1120
00:57:46,666 --> 00:57:48,106
Of course, they might not be here.

1121
00:57:49,506 --> 00:57:51,506
But everyone is hiding it well.

1122
00:57:51,776 --> 00:57:53,476
- Is that so?
- Can you tell?

1123
00:57:53,676 --> 00:57:55,605
I haven't thought about it.

1124
00:57:55,606 --> 00:57:56,815
I don't really care.

1125
00:57:56,816 --> 00:57:58,146
His ex isn't here.

1126
00:58:00,186 --> 00:58:03,086
I feel like Baek Hyun moved in without an ex.

1127
00:58:05,956 --> 00:58:07,285
He gives off that vibe.

1128
00:58:07,286 --> 00:58:09,156
If I'm crying by myself,

1129
00:58:09,426 --> 00:58:11,756
just leave me alone.

1130
00:58:15,066 --> 00:58:17,596
But if I start making guesses,

1131
00:58:18,266 --> 00:58:19,805
it might only start bothering me.

1132
00:58:19,806 --> 00:58:21,365
- True.
- And...

1133
00:58:21,366 --> 00:58:22,406
that's kind of...

1134
00:58:22,436 --> 00:58:25,706
(Getting curious about each other)

1135
00:58:26,606 --> 00:58:29,106
- How about we clean things up?
- Okay.

1136
00:58:30,246 --> 00:58:32,945
We also thought Baek Hyun and Ji Hyeon's exes weren't there.

1137
00:58:32,946 --> 00:58:35,686
I may just be slow-witted.

1138
00:58:35,786 --> 00:58:37,385
- That again?
- How slow are you?

1139
00:58:37,386 --> 00:58:39,655
I found something weird.

1140
00:58:39,656 --> 00:58:40,825
- Like what?
- What is it?

1141
00:58:40,826 --> 00:58:42,125
We need a new perspective.

1142
00:58:42,126 --> 00:58:44,095
Out of the blue, he said, "Professor Fried Chicken,"

1143
00:58:44,096 --> 00:58:45,296
and smiled.

1144
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:47,596
- Right.
- That...

1145
00:58:47,626 --> 00:58:51,766
felt playful, like, "I know what you do for a living,"

1146
00:58:51,936 --> 00:58:53,405
or something like that.

1147
00:58:53,406 --> 00:58:54,605
Yes, it did.

1148
00:58:54,606 --> 00:58:57,105
It didn't feel like he said that without a reason.

1149
00:58:57,106 --> 00:58:58,305
- Maybe a nickname?
- What?

1150
00:58:58,306 --> 00:58:59,335
It could be a nickname.

1151
00:58:59,336 --> 00:59:01,745
- Like a name he used to call her.
- Maybe.

1152
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:02,905
It's a possibility.

1153
00:59:02,906 --> 00:59:04,545
- Professor Fried Chicken.
- He's really sharp.

1154
00:59:04,546 --> 00:59:06,345
- Exactly, you're not slow-witted.
- Right?

1155
00:59:06,346 --> 00:59:08,485
- You're quick-witted.
- None of them might be right.

1156
00:59:08,486 --> 00:59:10,315
No. Rather, your quick-wittedness...

1157
00:59:10,316 --> 00:59:11,816
is getting in the way of the show.

1158
00:59:15,656 --> 00:59:18,256
(11:15am: Ji Yeon leaves.)

1159
00:59:22,826 --> 00:59:25,436
(11:30am: Baek Hyun leaves.)

1160
00:59:27,406 --> 00:59:28,805
(Min Kyung chooses a date outfit.)

1161
00:59:28,806 --> 00:59:30,176
- Are you picking an outfit?
- Yes.

1162
00:59:30,906 --> 00:59:33,575
Yesterday, you wore something with a collar, so this one.

1163
00:59:33,576 --> 00:59:34,646
But...

1164
00:59:34,906 --> 00:59:37,546
I'm thinking a tone-and-tone outfit might be nice.

1165
00:59:39,276 --> 00:59:40,546
- Tone-and-tone?
- I meant...

1166
00:59:41,746 --> 00:59:42,786
- With the partner?
- With the partner.

1167
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:45,386
But if it's too similar, the others might take a hint.

1168
00:59:46,756 --> 00:59:48,526
Did you already pick your date?

1169
00:59:50,156 --> 00:59:51,426
- As expected.
- You didn't?

1170
00:59:52,026 --> 00:59:53,326
- Not yet.
- I thought you did.

1171
00:59:53,396 --> 00:59:54,466
I didn't.

1172
00:59:54,726 --> 00:59:56,365
Maybe I was too quick again.

1173
00:59:56,366 --> 00:59:57,436
No.

1174
00:59:57,896 --> 00:59:59,566
I thought everyone had picked their date.

1175
01:00:01,036 --> 01:00:02,436
Really? Hold on.

1176
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:03,976
I can't sit still and do nothing.

1177
01:00:04,036 --> 01:00:05,876
Give me a second. Let me do my hair.

1178
01:00:10,676 --> 01:00:12,716
(Her hair is done.)

1179
01:00:13,216 --> 01:00:15,115
- When are you leaving?
- Soon.

1180
01:00:15,116 --> 01:00:16,415
Really?

1181
01:00:16,416 --> 01:00:18,016
My hair isn't being cooperative today.

1182
01:00:20,386 --> 01:00:22,926
- You're leaving already?
- I know, right?

1183
01:00:25,056 --> 01:00:26,996
Did I somehow end up being first?

1184
01:00:32,296 --> 01:00:33,365
Good job.

1185
01:00:33,366 --> 01:00:37,176
(Ji Hyeon suddenly wears sunglasses.)

1186
01:00:38,776 --> 01:00:41,676
(And then she brushes her hair.)

1187
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:48,086
But still... Where are you going?

1188
01:00:48,716 --> 01:00:50,386
- To look for a date.
- Okay.

1189
01:00:51,516 --> 01:00:53,755
- Hold on.
- Why are the two whispering?

1190
01:00:53,756 --> 01:00:54,986
What are the two doing?

1191
01:00:55,486 --> 01:00:57,195
Even though they were that close.

1192
01:00:57,196 --> 01:00:58,595
- "To look for a date." - "To look for a date."

1193
01:00:58,596 --> 01:01:01,425
Because she wore sunglasses, I thought she was heading outside.

1194
01:01:01,426 --> 01:01:02,966
I thought she was going to work out.

1195
01:01:03,096 --> 01:01:05,266
Is she going to Pyeongchang-dong to find her date?

1196
01:01:06,066 --> 01:01:07,505
Where is she going?

1197
01:01:07,506 --> 01:01:08,766
- The neighborhood.
- Right?

1198
01:01:09,066 --> 01:01:10,876
That means she's going outside.

1199
01:01:11,036 --> 01:01:12,236
"To look for a date."

1200
01:01:14,176 --> 01:01:17,016
(Determined footsteps to find her date)

1201
01:01:17,076 --> 01:01:19,516
(Being loud)

1202
01:01:26,656 --> 01:01:29,856
(She's going outside?)

1203
01:01:37,636 --> 01:01:40,106
(Ji Hyeon heads to the yard.)

1204
01:01:40,366 --> 01:01:42,506
Right? Maybe another one would've been nice.

1205
01:01:43,706 --> 01:01:44,806
Is she a celebrity?

1206
01:01:45,476 --> 01:01:46,506
It would've been nice.

1207
01:01:47,546 --> 01:01:48,676
Is she a celebrity?

1208
01:01:50,776 --> 01:01:52,216
The sun is shining just in time.

1209
01:01:57,686 --> 01:01:59,386
(Glancing)

1210
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:03,126
(She heads to the living room again.)

1211
01:02:03,696 --> 01:02:04,955
Don't you have any predictions?

1212
01:02:04,956 --> 01:02:07,165
(Passing by)

1213
01:02:07,166 --> 01:02:08,366
He gives off PE teacher vibes.

1214
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:12,535
- Hold on.
- Did she just pass by three times?

1215
01:02:12,536 --> 01:02:14,266
- I can't.
- Is she just passing by?

1216
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:16,336
She's making good use of the spaces.

1217
01:02:16,636 --> 01:02:19,106
- The route...
- Her route is no joke.

1218
01:02:19,136 --> 01:02:21,575
- Listen, she visited every place.
- A wide route.

1219
01:02:21,576 --> 01:02:24,076
Does she want the others to notice her?

1220
01:02:24,276 --> 01:02:26,015
Mentioning it again doesn't feel right.

1221
01:02:26,016 --> 01:02:28,116
- Exactly.
- Did she think he'd join her?

1222
01:02:28,186 --> 01:02:30,156
- How charming.
- She's adorable.

1223
01:02:31,616 --> 01:02:32,916
A well-built PE major.

1224
01:02:33,016 --> 01:02:35,685
(Passing by again)

1225
01:02:35,686 --> 01:02:36,696
Why is it...

1226
01:02:39,556 --> 01:02:43,696
(Taking a seat where the living room is visible)

1227
01:02:44,666 --> 01:02:47,066
(Why were you walking outside?)

1228
01:02:47,836 --> 01:02:49,866
You could say I was waiting.

1229
01:02:50,776 --> 01:02:53,406
Waiting for Yoo Sik to request a date,

1230
01:02:54,076 --> 01:02:55,506
but he didn't say anything.

1231
01:02:56,076 --> 01:02:57,576
Do I do a lot of strange things?

1232
01:03:00,416 --> 01:03:04,486
(She kept waiting for Yoo Sik.)

1233
01:03:06,386 --> 01:03:08,886
Badminton is a no-go if it's windy.

1234
01:03:08,986 --> 01:03:09,986
Exactly.

1235
01:03:15,796 --> 01:03:19,196
(Noticing Ji Hyeon approaching the living room)

1236
01:03:20,506 --> 01:03:21,565
What are you doing?

1237
01:03:21,566 --> 01:03:23,236
(Min Kyung comes out to the living room.)

1238
01:03:23,906 --> 01:03:25,535
- Take one for me too.
- Shall I?

1239
01:03:25,536 --> 01:03:27,175
- Yes.
- Nice.

1240
01:03:27,176 --> 01:03:28,375
Can I go in from here?

1241
01:03:28,376 --> 01:03:29,476
I don't see why not?

1242
01:03:29,746 --> 01:03:30,876
- Really?
- Yes.

1243
01:03:31,046 --> 01:03:32,416
Do we need to shoot from so far?

1244
01:03:33,746 --> 01:03:34,985
- Up close?
- Yes.

1245
01:03:34,986 --> 01:03:37,056
- Take a seat.
- Take one from up close.

1246
01:03:37,316 --> 01:03:38,585
- I'll take one for you.
- Okay.

1247
01:03:38,586 --> 01:03:41,026
(Ji Hyeon returns without much profit.)

1248
01:03:47,066 --> 01:03:48,266
Isn't it weird?

1249
01:03:48,766 --> 01:03:49,965
Cancel.

1250
01:03:49,966 --> 01:03:54,366
(Yoo Sik keeps his eyes away from Min Kyung.)

1251
01:04:01,106 --> 01:04:02,476
Are we eating lunch?

1252
01:04:03,076 --> 01:04:05,675
Someone mentioned cooking something.

1253
01:04:05,676 --> 01:04:06,886
If we get hungry...

1254
01:04:07,086 --> 01:04:09,616
- Is it a no?
- How about next time? Not today.

1255
01:04:09,716 --> 01:04:10,716
Got it.

1256
01:04:10,717 --> 01:04:11,855
(Min Kyung doesn't respond to Yoo Sik.)

1257
01:04:11,856 --> 01:04:12,916
Should I take one for you?

1258
01:04:13,826 --> 01:04:15,156
But I'm going to look awkward.

1259
01:04:18,126 --> 01:04:19,726
I could feel she had...

1260
01:04:21,826 --> 01:04:22,826
no feelings for me.

1261
01:04:24,066 --> 01:04:26,036
I've noticed it.

1262
01:04:29,506 --> 01:04:32,035
I suddenly want to go bowling.

1263
01:04:32,036 --> 01:04:33,406
- It sounds fun.
- How about tonight?

1264
01:04:33,646 --> 01:04:36,676
- Let's get into teams.
- Nice.

1265
01:04:36,746 --> 01:04:38,545
- We can make a bet.
- Yes. We can be a team.

1266
01:04:38,546 --> 01:04:39,945
She's very competitive.

1267
01:04:39,946 --> 01:04:41,545
- Yes, earlier...
- Me too,

1268
01:04:41,546 --> 01:04:42,685
- Min Kyung.
- Really?

1269
01:04:42,686 --> 01:04:44,715
- We should compete each other.
- For real.

1270
01:04:44,716 --> 01:04:46,585
Do you know how to do bowling?

1271
01:04:46,586 --> 01:04:48,425
- Bowling?
- Or pool.

1272
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:49,756
I do, but I'm not good at it.

1273
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:50,995
It sounds really fun.

1274
01:04:50,996 --> 01:04:53,356
(A bowling party has been formed.)

1275
01:04:56,866 --> 01:05:00,136
(12am: Won Kyu leaves.)

1276
01:05:01,566 --> 01:05:02,906
I need to use the restroom.

1277
01:05:04,536 --> 01:05:08,846
(After saying that, Min Kyung takes her bag and leaves as well.)

1278
01:05:10,346 --> 01:05:13,716
(Min Kyung and Won Kyu's casual date)

1279
01:05:14,516 --> 01:05:19,656
(Matches Seongsu)

1280
01:05:23,126 --> 01:05:25,125
- It's here.
- Here's your order.

1281
01:05:25,126 --> 01:05:27,425
This is mutton green curry...

1282
01:05:27,426 --> 01:05:28,795
and aglio e olio.

1283
01:05:28,796 --> 01:05:30,666
- Nice.
- They look good.

1284
01:05:32,496 --> 01:05:33,666
- How about a toast?
- Okay.

1285
01:05:41,046 --> 01:05:42,706
We're having drinks in broad daylight.

1286
01:05:43,076 --> 01:05:45,546
It's been ages since I last drank during the day.

1287
01:05:46,046 --> 01:05:47,316
It's been so long.

1288
01:05:47,746 --> 01:05:50,186
(Enjoying daytime drinking after a while)

1289
01:05:54,956 --> 01:05:55,956
It's really good.

1290
01:06:03,996 --> 01:06:05,635
It's the best food I have had recently.

1291
01:06:05,636 --> 01:06:07,606
Same here. It's the most delicious food I've had recently.

1292
01:06:09,706 --> 01:06:11,636
Min Kyung,

1293
01:06:12,676 --> 01:06:16,605
do you mind telling me more about...

1294
01:06:16,606 --> 01:06:17,816
your ideal boyfriend?

1295
01:06:18,716 --> 01:06:19,746
I hope...

1296
01:06:20,886 --> 01:06:23,916
there's a lot to learn from my boyfriend.

1297
01:06:24,586 --> 01:06:25,986
You know,

1298
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:27,885
if your partner lives life to the fullest,

1299
01:06:27,886 --> 01:06:29,086
- you also...
- Right.

1300
01:06:29,256 --> 01:06:31,396
You also end up giving it your all.

1301
01:06:32,956 --> 01:06:35,266
And it'd be nice if we could think of the future together.

1302
01:06:38,166 --> 01:06:39,565
I'm totally like that.

1303
01:06:39,566 --> 01:06:40,766
- Really?
- Yes.

1304
01:06:40,866 --> 01:06:44,076
- Cool.
- Those are really important to me.

1305
01:06:44,506 --> 01:06:48,276
She must be cool by my standards.

1306
01:06:49,676 --> 01:06:52,176
Giving everything her best.

1307
01:06:53,986 --> 01:06:57,016
I dated my ex...

1308
01:06:57,286 --> 01:06:58,816
because he had such a side to him.

1309
01:06:59,156 --> 01:07:01,186
- Then...
- He was someone I could learn from.

1310
01:07:01,956 --> 01:07:04,595
That's why I want my future boyfriend...

1311
01:07:04,596 --> 01:07:06,626
- Someone like that.
- to be like that.

1312
01:07:10,536 --> 01:07:11,796
But isn't it normal?

1313
01:07:11,896 --> 01:07:13,496
You date because you have feelings.

1314
01:07:15,806 --> 01:07:17,435
- Yes.
- Since you get along well.

1315
01:07:17,436 --> 01:07:19,436
True. You're right.

1316
01:07:19,806 --> 01:07:20,806
- Right?
- Yes.

1317
01:07:28,246 --> 01:07:29,746
Now that I've heard this,

1318
01:07:31,256 --> 01:07:32,815
and I know it's natural,

1319
01:07:32,816 --> 01:07:35,626
- but when it comes to the exes, - Yes?

1320
01:07:36,826 --> 01:07:40,026
everyone on this show...

1321
01:07:41,126 --> 01:07:42,265
- Adored them?
- Yes.

1322
01:07:42,266 --> 01:07:43,766
Adored and liked them.

1323
01:07:43,966 --> 01:07:45,165
That's what I'm getting.

1324
01:07:45,166 --> 01:07:47,106
(Everyone adored and liked their exes.)

1325
01:07:48,866 --> 01:07:50,676
You're right. It was quite a surprise.

1326
01:07:51,436 --> 01:07:54,146
"Just how good a person were they..."

1327
01:07:54,376 --> 01:07:58,375
"to be adored so much?"

1328
01:07:58,376 --> 01:07:59,916
That crossed my mind multiple times.

1329
01:08:02,446 --> 01:08:04,486
"Everyone must be really nice people."

1330
01:08:05,316 --> 01:08:06,386
Are you crying?

1331
01:08:07,456 --> 01:08:09,455
(Teary)

1332
01:08:09,456 --> 01:08:10,656
No.

1333
01:08:11,096 --> 01:08:12,195
- How come?
- I'm not.

1334
01:08:12,196 --> 01:08:14,566
- Oh, no. What's wrong?
- No, I won't cry.

1335
01:08:16,126 --> 01:08:18,636
Are you a feeler? Aren't you a thinker?

1336
01:08:25,276 --> 01:08:26,776
I just thought that you were right.

1337
01:08:28,906 --> 01:08:31,446
- Oh, dear.
- No, I'm not crying.

1338
01:08:31,716 --> 01:08:33,345
- We had red wine earlier, right?
- Yes.

1339
01:08:33,346 --> 01:08:35,145
That's still making my nose weird.

1340
01:08:35,146 --> 01:08:37,656
(Embarrassed, he blames the wine.)

1341
01:08:47,826 --> 01:08:51,696
We talked about our exes.

1342
01:08:52,466 --> 01:08:53,805
It reminded me of how my ex must've felt...

1343
01:08:53,806 --> 01:08:55,536
while writing my introduction...

1344
01:08:55,966 --> 01:08:59,576
and the phrase that made me cry again.

1345
01:09:00,376 --> 01:09:04,275
How she wants me to meet someone more mature than her.

1346
01:09:04,276 --> 01:09:06,876
(I hope my ex meets someone even more mature than me.)

1347
01:09:07,186 --> 01:09:09,416
Honestly, she was much more mature than immature.

1348
01:09:10,886 --> 01:09:12,056
I regret...

1349
01:09:12,716 --> 01:09:15,086
not telling her that more often.

1350
01:09:16,256 --> 01:09:17,956
It got me to reflect on it,

1351
01:09:18,626 --> 01:09:20,056
which made me emotional.

1352
01:09:20,726 --> 01:09:26,366
Seeing Won Kyu get teary-eyed...

1353
01:09:26,636 --> 01:09:28,666
was quite surprising.

1354
01:09:29,336 --> 01:09:32,336
I felt it ever since he read the introduction from his ex.

1355
01:09:32,776 --> 01:09:34,846
He teared up since then,

1356
01:09:35,146 --> 01:09:38,416
and I got the feeling that...

1357
01:09:38,476 --> 01:09:41,815
he regretted not treating...

1358
01:09:41,816 --> 01:09:43,446
his ex better.

1359
01:09:45,456 --> 01:09:46,616
Then again,

1360
01:09:47,826 --> 01:09:50,496
if we think about the reasons we broke up,

1361
01:09:51,156 --> 01:09:54,296
only the bad parts get highlighted.

1362
01:09:54,766 --> 01:09:55,866
But...

1363
01:09:57,536 --> 01:10:01,406
it wasn't really that bad.

1364
01:10:04,236 --> 01:10:05,606
Why did you have to cry?

1365
01:10:06,176 --> 01:10:07,176
- You're tearing up, right?
- Yes.

1366
01:10:07,177 --> 01:10:09,905
I'm getting sad. Drinking during the day is risky.

1367
01:10:09,906 --> 01:10:12,945
I know, right? Drinking is...

1368
01:10:12,946 --> 01:10:14,016
How strong is it?

1369
01:10:15,946 --> 01:10:18,316
The alcohol makes you think deeply, right?

1370
01:10:19,556 --> 01:10:21,356
It's day drinking that does that.

1371
01:10:21,986 --> 01:10:23,226
That really is the case.

1372
01:10:23,556 --> 01:10:25,455
- Here.
- No crying, okay?

1373
01:10:25,456 --> 01:10:28,496
Of course. Do you think I'll cry?

1374
01:10:28,596 --> 01:10:30,125
- Me?
- Do you think I'll cry?

1375
01:10:30,126 --> 01:10:31,366
No, just in case.

1376
01:10:31,736 --> 01:10:33,766
You might not cry.

1377
01:10:34,606 --> 01:10:37,906
I won't cry. I'm very strong.

1378
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:41,806
I say that, but I might cry secretly every day.

1379
01:10:43,076 --> 01:10:45,345
- Secretly in a corner.
- Really?

1380
01:10:45,346 --> 01:10:48,316
The closet is huge, right? That's one of my options.

1381
01:10:49,516 --> 01:10:51,516
Like this in the closet.

1382
01:10:52,156 --> 01:10:54,126
I'll go to your room when I want to cry.

1383
01:10:55,486 --> 01:10:57,526
I'll give you a spot inside.

1384
01:10:57,756 --> 01:11:00,056
My closet is huge. We can share it.

1385
01:11:05,336 --> 01:11:08,166
There's a little bit of wine left.

1386
01:11:09,136 --> 01:11:11,675
- How about we go to the Han River?
- Are we going to the Han River?

1387
01:11:11,676 --> 01:11:12,676
Yes.

1388
01:11:12,706 --> 01:11:15,276
We can take this wine with us.

1389
01:11:15,546 --> 01:11:16,575
Sounds good.

1390
01:11:16,576 --> 01:11:20,416
(They agree to go to the Han River to change the mood.)

1391
01:11:20,516 --> 01:11:23,215
Won Kyu cries easily when it comes to his ex.

1392
01:11:23,216 --> 01:11:24,285
She's the tear-jerker.

1393
01:11:24,286 --> 01:11:27,015
He could have something to apologize for.

1394
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:29,255
But rather than him having lingering feelings...

1395
01:11:29,256 --> 01:11:30,355
- Guilt?
- Guilt?

1396
01:11:30,356 --> 01:11:32,225
- It's more like guilt, right?
- For real.

1397
01:11:32,226 --> 01:11:34,795
Ye Won and Yura.

1398
01:11:34,796 --> 01:11:38,095
What do you think about a guy who cries...

1399
01:11:38,096 --> 01:11:39,136
during a date?

1400
01:11:39,536 --> 01:11:42,366
I think it's understandable...

1401
01:11:42,466 --> 01:11:44,605
since he's in a situation where he has...

1402
01:11:44,606 --> 01:11:46,475
some feelings left for his ex.

1403
01:11:46,476 --> 01:11:48,605
So would it come across as a good point?

1404
01:11:48,606 --> 01:11:51,415
- Or...
- In the early stages,

1405
01:11:51,416 --> 01:11:53,175
- it could come across as a merit.
- Really?

1406
01:11:53,176 --> 01:11:54,645
It's an understandable part.

1407
01:11:54,646 --> 01:11:57,016
"That's how much he was sincere about her."

1408
01:11:57,116 --> 01:11:59,186
I think that's what I'll think.

1409
01:12:04,556 --> 01:12:05,726
It's so clear.

1410
01:12:06,056 --> 01:12:08,226
- It's perfect.
- Yes, for real.

1411
01:12:09,966 --> 01:12:12,036
I'm quite tall right now.

1412
01:12:13,196 --> 01:12:16,506
Earlier, you said you liked tall girls.

1413
01:12:16,606 --> 01:12:18,735
- I did.
- I'm wearing 6cm shoes right now.

1414
01:12:18,736 --> 01:12:19,776
You are?

1415
01:12:20,776 --> 01:12:22,606
- 165cm.
- You didn't seem short to me.

1416
01:12:22,706 --> 01:12:24,176
Right? I'm like the perfect height.

1417
01:12:32,556 --> 01:12:33,656
The sun is strong, right?

1418
01:12:34,186 --> 01:12:35,355
It's right on me.

1419
01:12:35,356 --> 01:12:37,126
(The sun is quite strong today.)

1420
01:12:37,456 --> 01:12:38,496
Do you want to switch seats?

1421
01:12:39,596 --> 01:12:40,696
Are you okay with the sun?

1422
01:12:41,896 --> 01:12:44,596
- Shall we switch?
- Really? Thank you.

1423
01:12:46,996 --> 01:12:50,976
You might not be able to see me...

1424
01:12:51,636 --> 01:12:53,676
with my eyes open at all. Please be understanding.

1425
01:12:53,776 --> 01:12:56,246
Okay. I can see you clearly.

1426
01:12:58,016 --> 01:12:59,316
Keeping your eyes open is tough, right?

1427
01:13:00,476 --> 01:13:01,586
The sun is all I can see.

1428
01:13:04,286 --> 01:13:06,016
- I can hardly see anything but you.
- Really?

1429
01:13:09,186 --> 01:13:10,186
Cheers.

1430
01:13:16,666 --> 01:13:18,565
- Do you like traveling?
- Do you?

1431
01:13:18,566 --> 01:13:20,066
- I do.
- Really?

1432
01:13:20,466 --> 01:13:23,206
- It...
- Where did you visit most recently?

1433
01:13:23,306 --> 01:13:25,976
The most recent place I traveled abroad was Kyoto.

1434
01:13:27,006 --> 01:13:29,005
You must really like quiet places.

1435
01:13:29,006 --> 01:13:31,045
Yes, Osaka was just a short stop.

1436
01:13:31,046 --> 01:13:33,516
I was in Kyoto for four days.

1437
01:13:34,486 --> 01:13:38,985
But if I were to pick a city...

1438
01:13:38,986 --> 01:13:40,216
I like in Japan,

1439
01:13:41,456 --> 01:13:43,355
- it'd be Fukuoka.
- Fukuoka?

1440
01:13:43,356 --> 01:13:46,326
It's a surprise, right? Fukuoka is also a quiet place.

1441
01:13:47,126 --> 01:13:48,166
There are many Koreans.

1442
01:13:49,596 --> 01:13:51,496
When I heard stories,

1443
01:13:54,336 --> 01:13:57,506
I thought how diverse the place is.

1444
01:13:59,076 --> 01:14:02,006
I've got more to see than the sun now.

1445
01:14:06,476 --> 01:14:09,286
There's more I can watch now.

1446
01:14:10,216 --> 01:14:12,315
(They're at the center of a dance performance.)

1447
01:14:12,316 --> 01:14:13,386
It's nice.

1448
01:14:19,226 --> 01:14:20,425
- Really.
- He's got more...

1449
01:14:20,426 --> 01:14:21,926
- to see than the sun now.
- To put it...

1450
01:14:22,026 --> 01:14:24,895
How can you keep the date going with that background?

1451
01:14:24,896 --> 01:14:26,736
At least it won't make Won Kyu cry.

1452
01:14:27,136 --> 01:14:30,535
I hope Min Kyung explains what kind of dance it is.

1453
01:14:30,536 --> 01:14:31,776
- Oh, no.
- Right?

1454
01:14:34,246 --> 01:14:37,646
In Kyoto...

1455
01:14:39,616 --> 01:14:42,785
(Keeping the conversation going isn't easy.)

1456
01:14:42,786 --> 01:14:45,116
How did things...

1457
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:50,056
(Their dance is becoming intense.)

1458
01:14:57,436 --> 01:14:58,466
Cheers, please.

1459
01:15:02,366 --> 01:15:03,806
This is hilarious.

1460
01:15:05,976 --> 01:15:08,476
Isn't Arashiyama in Kyoto?

1461
01:15:08,576 --> 01:15:10,206
- Yes, you're correct.
- Right?

1462
01:15:10,306 --> 01:15:12,815
- It's really pretty.
- I haven't been to that place.

1463
01:15:12,816 --> 01:15:13,845
- Really?
- No.

1464
01:15:13,846 --> 01:15:15,445
But weren't you in Kyoto for four days?

1465
01:15:15,446 --> 01:15:18,456
Is it a region in Kyoto?

1466
01:15:19,286 --> 01:15:20,286
Yes.

1467
01:15:21,526 --> 01:15:23,355
- I...
- Maybe not? Maybe I've been to it.

1468
01:15:23,356 --> 01:15:24,526
- Bamboos.
- I don't remember.

1469
01:15:24,826 --> 01:15:26,896
- I've been to that place.
- Right?

1470
01:15:27,526 --> 01:15:29,696
But it was peak season when I went.

1471
01:15:31,196 --> 01:15:32,866
The place was crowded.

1472
01:15:36,806 --> 01:15:38,736
(Gritting his teeth)

1473
01:15:38,836 --> 01:15:40,406
It's peak season here as well.

1474
01:15:47,616 --> 01:15:49,416
This is all just too funny.

1475
01:15:53,456 --> 01:15:55,356
Aren't you just drinking the whole time?

1476
01:15:55,456 --> 01:15:57,956
Well, the situation is making me drink.

1477
01:15:59,696 --> 01:16:01,666
Oh, dear. I'm losing it.

1478
01:16:01,966 --> 01:16:03,966
If you were in my seat,

1479
01:16:05,396 --> 01:16:08,005
you would be doing the same thing.

1480
01:16:08,006 --> 01:16:10,236
Thank goodness we switched seats.

1481
01:16:16,276 --> 01:16:17,746
You might finish the bottle.

1482
01:16:18,846 --> 01:16:21,386
(Closing his eyes)

1483
01:16:26,956 --> 01:16:27,956
- Well...
- Yes?

1484
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:32,096
Are you not in pain?

1485
01:16:33,396 --> 01:16:34,726
I'm just curious.

1486
01:16:36,326 --> 01:16:37,595
- I am...
- Are you?

1487
01:16:37,596 --> 01:16:38,936
- because I'm having fun.
- Is that so?

1488
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:40,535
That's great.

1489
01:16:40,536 --> 01:16:43,206
Then I... I'm very happy.

1490
01:16:43,306 --> 01:16:44,406
How about a glass?

1491
01:16:45,936 --> 01:16:48,376
There were about four middle-aged ladies.

1492
01:16:48,806 --> 01:16:51,876
They kept dancing from 45° away...

1493
01:16:52,346 --> 01:16:54,076
from Min Kyung,

1494
01:16:54,646 --> 01:16:56,186
who was in front of me.

1495
01:16:57,246 --> 01:16:59,416
Focusing was hard.

1496
01:17:00,216 --> 01:17:02,186
The sun was blazing from above.

1497
01:17:03,626 --> 01:17:05,396
But it lightened up the mood.

1498
01:17:05,856 --> 01:17:07,456
Min Kyung laughed a lot,

1499
01:17:08,626 --> 01:17:09,966
which was nice.

1500
01:17:12,766 --> 01:17:15,406
From what I heard earlier, others said that...

1501
01:17:15,806 --> 01:17:18,535
you liked women who make the first move.

1502
01:17:18,536 --> 01:17:20,436
- Was that the topic?
- When we all gathered.

1503
01:17:22,206 --> 01:17:25,876
- Is that so?
- It was interesting.

1504
01:17:25,976 --> 01:17:28,985
What are you like? Do you make the first move?

1505
01:17:28,986 --> 01:17:29,986
I...

1506
01:17:30,616 --> 01:17:33,456
Slowly.

1507
01:17:35,456 --> 01:17:39,326
Slowly.

1508
01:17:46,636 --> 01:17:49,236
- It got caught in his hair.
- Slowly.

1509
01:17:49,336 --> 01:17:53,476
- That's...
- What an excellent spot.

1510
01:17:53,576 --> 01:17:55,775
- For real.
- How could that happen?

1511
01:17:55,776 --> 01:17:57,476
I want to be there.

1512
01:17:57,746 --> 01:17:58,915
Seriously.

1513
01:17:58,916 --> 01:18:00,515
I'm feeling hot right now.

1514
01:18:00,516 --> 01:18:01,915
The timing is...

1515
01:18:01,916 --> 01:18:04,886
EXchange must really hide the cameras well.

1516
01:18:05,386 --> 01:18:06,586
I'm crying.

1517
01:18:07,856 --> 01:18:10,255
(Won Kyu got caught in a kite.)

1518
01:18:10,256 --> 01:18:11,256
Give me a second.

1519
01:18:11,826 --> 01:18:15,096
(Flying)

1520
01:18:15,226 --> 01:18:17,195
- Slowly.
- Oh, no.

1521
01:18:17,196 --> 01:18:19,166
- Stand still.
- Slowly.

1522
01:18:19,366 --> 01:18:20,695
- Wait.
- Slowly.

1523
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:22,706
- Just stand still.
- Slowly.

1524
01:18:23,936 --> 01:18:25,836
This is unbelievable.

1525
01:18:28,276 --> 01:18:31,075
(Won Kyu is lightening the mood of the nervous date.)

1526
01:18:31,076 --> 01:18:32,546
No, stop.

1527
01:18:33,246 --> 01:18:35,646
- Sorry.
- Let's go. Come here.

1528
01:18:40,756 --> 01:18:42,186
I'll bring it over to you.

1529
01:18:43,786 --> 01:18:44,825
(Thank you to the citizens.)

1530
01:18:44,826 --> 01:18:45,826
Oh, no.

1531
01:18:47,156 --> 01:18:48,196
Come here.

1532
01:18:53,096 --> 01:18:54,166
That was close.

1533
01:18:55,166 --> 01:18:57,136
We almost got carried away with the kite.

1534
01:19:02,076 --> 01:19:03,205
(Thinking)

1535
01:19:03,206 --> 01:19:05,316
What were we talking about again? I can't remember.

1536
01:19:07,816 --> 01:19:10,216
It felt like I messed up.

1537
01:19:12,016 --> 01:19:14,785
In the first restaurant we went to,

1538
01:19:14,786 --> 01:19:16,956
the atmosphere was quite heavy.

1539
01:19:17,456 --> 01:19:20,696
I thought that mood might carry on.

1540
01:19:20,996 --> 01:19:21,966
I did.

1541
01:19:22,496 --> 01:19:25,436
It did lighten up the mood, but it was also a little disappointing.

1542
01:19:26,296 --> 01:19:28,365
(Are you willing to go on another date with Min Kyung?)

1543
01:19:28,366 --> 01:19:30,306
Yes, I am.

1544
01:19:31,306 --> 01:19:33,476
But I'd like us to go on an indoor date.

1545
01:19:35,306 --> 01:19:37,476
My feelings for her grew stronger...

1546
01:19:38,746 --> 01:19:40,716
than my feelings for Ji Yeon.

1547
01:19:42,386 --> 01:19:43,986
Date-wise,

1548
01:19:45,116 --> 01:19:47,556
it wasn't a successful one.

1549
01:19:48,526 --> 01:19:52,526
But there were many funny moments, so it was fun.

1550
01:19:53,496 --> 01:19:55,666
While on the date with Won Kyu,

1551
01:19:55,766 --> 01:19:58,565
I kept thinking he's much funnier than I expected...

1552
01:19:58,566 --> 01:20:01,766
and has a great personality.

1553
01:20:02,206 --> 01:20:05,905
Dating someone like him would be a totally different experience...

1554
01:20:05,906 --> 01:20:07,536
was another thought I had.

1555
01:20:09,606 --> 01:20:11,006
This is fun.

1556
01:20:11,546 --> 01:20:14,846
To think there'd be such charm in outdoor dates.

1557
01:20:15,946 --> 01:20:17,816
It was...

1558
01:20:18,916 --> 01:20:20,716
I wanted to be perfect.

1559
01:20:21,986 --> 01:20:24,056
You're totally perfect.

1560
01:20:27,126 --> 01:20:30,766
(Min Kyung and Won Kyu had a perfect date.)

1561
01:20:30,926 --> 01:20:32,335
Personally, as a viewer,

1562
01:20:32,336 --> 01:20:33,665
- it was so funny.
- Yes.

1563
01:20:33,666 --> 01:20:35,535
But the appeal is questionable.

1564
01:20:35,536 --> 01:20:38,205
True, because the other things took the attention away.

1565
01:20:38,206 --> 01:20:39,675
- Exactly.
- They couldn't have a proper chat.

1566
01:20:39,676 --> 01:20:41,005
- Right?
- There weren't that many...

1567
01:20:41,006 --> 01:20:42,245
- heart-fluttering moments.
- No.

1568
01:20:42,246 --> 01:20:44,415
- No. Both of them simply had fun.
- Yes.

1569
01:20:44,416 --> 01:20:45,945
I think he'll come across as cute.

1570
01:20:45,946 --> 01:20:48,715
I agree. The situation helped them out.

1571
01:20:48,716 --> 01:20:52,085
The situation that made them burst into laughter...

1572
01:20:52,086 --> 01:20:55,855
made him even more interested in Min Kyung.

1573
01:20:55,856 --> 01:20:56,925
That's what I think.

1574
01:20:56,926 --> 01:20:57,955
They had good chemistry.

1575
01:20:57,956 --> 01:21:00,595
- It's a legendary date.
- Yes, a legendary date.

1576
01:21:00,596 --> 01:21:01,996
- How cute.
- A legendary date.

1577
01:21:02,696 --> 01:21:05,996
(Pyeongchang-dong House)

1578
01:21:06,766 --> 01:21:09,706
(The bowling party is ready to head out.)

1579
01:21:09,906 --> 01:21:11,336
What's this? Is everyone wearing black?

1580
01:21:11,636 --> 01:21:12,836
Is no one wearing white?

1581
01:21:14,506 --> 01:21:15,506
No, no one.

1582
01:21:15,507 --> 01:21:16,745
(Everyone, except Woo Jin, is wearing black.)

1583
01:21:16,746 --> 01:21:19,876
This makes me the only person in bright clothes.

1584
01:21:20,946 --> 01:21:22,116
Is no one hungry?

1585
01:21:22,416 --> 01:21:23,745
- You'll eat if I cook, right?
- I'm hungry.

1586
01:21:23,746 --> 01:21:24,785
- Aren't you?
- You'll eat it, right?

1587
01:21:24,786 --> 01:21:26,855
- Shall we eat something?
- Should we eat before we go out?

1588
01:21:26,856 --> 01:21:28,056
(Fueling up before bowling)

1589
01:21:28,426 --> 01:21:30,425
- Let's have fried rice.
- What?

1590
01:21:30,426 --> 01:21:32,225
- Fried rice?
- Yes, fried rice.

1591
01:21:32,226 --> 01:21:33,756
- Are you okay with fried rice?
- Yes.

1592
01:21:37,626 --> 01:21:45,136
(You have a date today. Get ready.)

1593
01:21:47,276 --> 01:21:48,605
- What?
- Only Yoo Sik?

1594
01:21:48,606 --> 01:21:50,045
The catfish.

1595
01:21:50,046 --> 01:21:51,415
- The catfish.
- What?

1596
01:21:51,416 --> 01:21:52,645
- The catfish?
- The catfish.

1597
01:21:52,646 --> 01:21:54,115
- It's the catfish.
- Will I see her before I leave?

1598
01:21:54,116 --> 01:21:56,246
You said "catfish" 30 times.

1599
01:21:57,046 --> 01:21:58,416
She scared me.

1600
01:21:58,786 --> 01:22:01,355
She kept saying "catfish."

1601
01:22:01,356 --> 01:22:02,886
Nonstop "catfish."

1602
01:22:03,256 --> 01:22:04,325
She was taking her sweet time.

1603
01:22:04,326 --> 01:22:06,995
- True.
- But the catfish watches in secret.

1604
01:22:06,996 --> 01:22:08,425
- That's right.
- The others have no idea.

1605
01:22:08,426 --> 01:22:10,125
The catfish picks who they're curious about.

1606
01:22:10,126 --> 01:22:11,235
I'm 100 percent certain.

1607
01:22:11,236 --> 01:22:12,565
- It's the catfish.
- Right now?

1608
01:22:12,566 --> 01:22:14,636
Unbelievable. She's here.

1609
01:22:14,736 --> 01:22:15,806
I can't wait.

1610
01:22:20,606 --> 01:22:22,606
I didn't make any promises to anyone,

1611
01:22:23,276 --> 01:22:26,216
but then, I have a date.

1612
01:22:27,916 --> 01:22:29,446
"Who could it be?"

1613
01:22:30,686 --> 01:22:34,155
"Could it be my ex?" With that thought,

1614
01:22:34,156 --> 01:22:37,356
I gradually started having trouble breathing.

1615
01:22:41,696 --> 01:22:45,436
I kept thinking and ran simulations.

1616
01:22:57,046 --> 01:22:58,446
- Are you boiling ramyeon?
- Yes.

1617
01:23:02,316 --> 01:23:03,316
By the way,

1618
01:23:04,216 --> 01:23:05,315
I can't join you guys.

1619
01:23:05,316 --> 01:23:06,416
- How come?
- Why not?

1620
01:23:06,516 --> 01:23:08,225
- The game...
- Really?

1621
01:23:08,226 --> 01:23:09,856
I need to step outside for a minute.

1622
01:23:10,756 --> 01:23:12,725
- How long will it take?
- I'm not sure.

1623
01:23:12,726 --> 01:23:13,826
- Do you have to go to know?
- Yes.

1624
01:23:14,156 --> 01:23:15,626
- What a bummer.
- For real.

1625
01:23:16,026 --> 01:23:17,066
Bowling...

1626
01:23:17,366 --> 01:23:18,435
Playing 2-on-2 would've been fun.

1627
01:23:18,436 --> 01:23:19,766
- Yes.
- I know, right?

1628
01:23:20,466 --> 01:23:22,366
Yoo Sik couldn't come with us.

1629
01:23:23,366 --> 01:23:25,336
It was a letdown right away.

1630
01:23:26,476 --> 01:23:28,046
Don't have too much fun.

1631
01:23:28,576 --> 01:23:29,906
I'll think about it.

1632
01:23:32,676 --> 01:23:36,416
(5:40pm: Yoo Sik leaves.)

1633
01:23:38,556 --> 01:23:42,086
(Just as the sun is about to disappear with the sunset,)

1634
01:23:42,726 --> 01:23:45,556
(night has fallen over the building forest of Cheongdam.)

1635
01:23:46,256 --> 01:23:48,196
(Bar House Cheongdam)

1636
01:23:50,266 --> 01:23:54,566
(Yoo Sik is heading to meet someone.)

1637
01:24:16,926 --> 01:24:19,956
I thought it could be my ex and I got very nervous.

1638
01:24:21,366 --> 01:24:25,296
I've never trembled that much in my life before.

1639
01:25:19,586 --> 01:25:22,686
(A new resident, Park Hyeon Ji)

1640
01:25:22,856 --> 01:25:23,886
Here comes a catfish.

1641
01:25:25,526 --> 01:25:26,955
How come she has such a great figure?

1642
01:25:26,956 --> 01:25:28,265
- She's so beautiful, isn't she?
- She is.

1643
01:25:28,266 --> 01:25:30,565
The cast's looks this season...

1644
01:25:30,566 --> 01:25:32,096
It's amazing this season.

1645
01:25:32,366 --> 01:25:35,605
This can make a difference.

1646
01:25:35,606 --> 01:25:37,306
Won Kyu said...

1647
01:25:37,606 --> 01:25:41,035
that he likes a tall woman.

1648
01:25:41,036 --> 01:25:42,776
Right. He said that.

1649
01:25:43,046 --> 01:25:44,945
With a tall girl joining them,

1650
01:25:44,946 --> 01:25:46,846
things can get interesting once again.

1651
01:25:47,246 --> 01:25:48,686
Wait. This can mean...

1652
01:25:49,146 --> 01:25:52,586
that she's Won Kyu's ex. I have a hunch.

1653
01:25:56,486 --> 01:25:57,556
Hello.

1654
01:26:02,096 --> 01:26:03,166
Hello.

1655
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:07,966
You're a new resident.

1656
01:26:08,266 --> 01:26:09,336
- Yes.
- Hello.

1657
01:26:09,906 --> 01:26:10,906
- Hello.
- It's nice to meet you.

1658
01:26:14,106 --> 01:26:16,906
I wished it were anyone except my ex,

1659
01:26:17,076 --> 01:26:19,175
and it turned out to be a new resident.

1660
01:26:19,176 --> 01:26:20,215
(A new resident appeared instead of his ex.)

1661
01:26:20,216 --> 01:26:21,716
I was a little surprised.

1662
01:26:23,286 --> 01:26:24,346
Then...

1663
01:26:25,816 --> 01:26:26,886
May I ask your name?

1664
01:26:27,316 --> 01:26:29,885
My name is Park Hyeon Ji.

1665
01:26:29,886 --> 01:26:30,986
- Hyeon Ji?
- Yes.

1666
01:26:31,286 --> 01:26:32,726
My name is Cho Yoo Sik.

1667
01:26:46,106 --> 01:26:48,035
(It's a date with someone...)

1668
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:50,146
(your ex thought was your ideal type.)

1669
01:26:52,346 --> 01:26:55,716
I thought my ex made the right choice.

1670
01:26:56,016 --> 01:26:59,256
I thought he knew me well.

1671
01:27:00,356 --> 01:27:03,126
He had asymmetrical eyes,

1672
01:27:03,426 --> 01:27:06,756
and I found it very attractive.

1673
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:11,166
He looked very nice.

1674
01:27:12,396 --> 01:27:15,536
He was close to my ideal type, so my heart fluttered even more.

1675
01:27:17,606 --> 01:27:19,005
I see.

1676
01:27:19,006 --> 01:27:20,605
- Is that true?
- Really?

1677
01:27:20,606 --> 01:27:22,075
It's not that she picked him.

1678
01:27:22,076 --> 01:27:23,946
- This feels...
- But...

1679
01:27:24,146 --> 01:27:26,175
- so attractive.
- she was happy.

1680
01:27:26,176 --> 01:27:27,515
- "He knew me well." - She said so.

1681
01:27:27,516 --> 01:27:29,085
- "As expected." She said that.
- "He knew me well."

1682
01:27:29,086 --> 01:27:30,515
That means she likes him.

1683
01:27:30,516 --> 01:27:32,456
- She said her ex got it.
- She liked him.

1684
01:27:33,986 --> 01:27:36,325
May I ask how tall you are?

1685
01:27:36,326 --> 01:27:39,326
I'm about 172 to 173cm tall.

1686
01:27:40,426 --> 01:27:41,596
You're really tall.

1687
01:27:43,126 --> 01:27:45,266
- You look tall.
- Me?

1688
01:27:46,436 --> 01:27:48,765
All men here are tall, though.

1689
01:27:48,766 --> 01:27:50,666
All men are similar in height.

1690
01:27:52,036 --> 01:27:53,106
Yes.

1691
01:27:55,246 --> 01:27:56,946
What's your favorite alcoholic drink?

1692
01:27:58,046 --> 01:28:01,415
I like whiskey and wine.

1693
01:28:01,416 --> 01:28:02,586
Are you much of a drinker?

1694
01:28:03,616 --> 01:28:06,286
I used to drink two bottles of soju.

1695
01:28:07,056 --> 01:28:09,626
- But now...
- Two bottles of soju?

1696
01:28:09,856 --> 01:28:11,085
Now, one bottle.

1697
01:28:11,086 --> 01:28:12,426
- One bottle?
- Yes.

1698
01:28:12,796 --> 01:28:14,325
Do you drink a lot?

1699
01:28:14,326 --> 01:28:17,166
Me? I rarely drink.

1700
01:28:18,236 --> 01:28:21,666
For soju, I can drink one and a half or two bottles.

1701
01:28:22,906 --> 01:28:24,035
You drink a lot.

1702
01:28:24,036 --> 01:28:25,976
I mean, it's when I drink.

1703
01:28:26,576 --> 01:28:28,246
I don't drink often.

1704
01:28:29,506 --> 01:28:31,715
I see. It's when you drink.

1705
01:28:31,716 --> 01:28:33,446
I drink about that much when I drink.

1706
01:28:35,986 --> 01:28:37,186
This is crazy.

1707
01:28:38,886 --> 01:28:40,015
I'm sorry. Now...

1708
01:28:40,016 --> 01:28:41,926
(Yoo Sik is especially awkward, unlike what he used to be.)

1709
01:28:42,626 --> 01:28:45,355
I need to say it after I organize it in my head.

1710
01:28:45,356 --> 01:28:46,356
It's fine.

1711
01:28:46,896 --> 01:28:47,996
I'm sorry.

1712
01:28:49,696 --> 01:28:51,096
It's the same with me now.

1713
01:28:52,136 --> 01:28:53,136
Excuse me.

1714
01:28:53,266 --> 01:28:54,735
Thank you.

1715
01:28:54,736 --> 01:28:56,536
(Food to cool Yoo Sik's head is being served.)

1716
01:29:04,046 --> 01:29:05,046
Shall we drink?

1717
01:29:07,146 --> 01:29:08,146
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

1718
01:29:20,456 --> 01:29:21,596
This is insane.

1719
01:29:22,266 --> 01:29:24,126
- Why?
- I'm sorry.

1720
01:29:24,626 --> 01:29:26,136
I tend to get nervous.

1721
01:29:27,096 --> 01:29:29,905
Is it because you don't know what to say?

1722
01:29:29,906 --> 01:29:30,936
Me?

1723
01:29:31,206 --> 01:29:33,106
I don't want to make it awkward, but...

1724
01:29:34,606 --> 01:29:37,006
What is your ideal type?

1725
01:29:37,046 --> 01:29:38,106
Me?

1726
01:29:40,916 --> 01:29:41,986
I...

1727
01:29:43,846 --> 01:29:45,586
need to talk to her in the first place, no matter what.

1728
01:29:46,886 --> 01:29:48,356
I need to talk to her, and...

1729
01:29:49,686 --> 01:29:52,956
You might have felt it already, but I...

1730
01:29:53,296 --> 01:29:57,226
can get very nervous. So...

1731
01:30:00,466 --> 01:30:01,965
Wait a minute. I...

1732
01:30:01,966 --> 01:30:03,066
(He can't remember his ideal type, which he often said.)

1733
01:30:07,776 --> 01:30:10,246
- That's cute.
- Why is he so nervous?

1734
01:30:10,746 --> 01:30:12,175
- His heart seems to flutter now.
- Yes.

1735
01:30:12,176 --> 01:30:13,545
- He's flustered.
- He's awkward.

1736
01:30:13,546 --> 01:30:14,645
He likes her now.

1737
01:30:14,646 --> 01:30:16,546
- How come he's that nervous?
- I know.

1738
01:30:19,116 --> 01:30:21,156
I like someone...

1739
01:30:22,356 --> 01:30:23,586
who expresses her feelings.

1740
01:30:25,096 --> 01:30:26,126
That's what I look for in a woman.

1741
01:30:28,326 --> 01:30:29,866
What's your ideal type?

1742
01:30:31,266 --> 01:30:33,396
I like someone with a nice smile.

1743
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:35,906
I like someone...

1744
01:30:37,106 --> 01:30:38,906
who looks kind.

1745
01:30:45,076 --> 01:30:46,646
You never avoid my eyes.

1746
01:30:47,316 --> 01:30:49,686
Sorry. I try...

1747
01:30:50,486 --> 01:30:51,856
not to avoid someone's eyes.

1748
01:30:52,956 --> 01:30:54,056
However,

1749
01:30:55,186 --> 01:30:57,185
there are times my brain doesn't want to avoid...

1750
01:30:57,186 --> 01:30:59,356
but my eyes are wandering...

1751
01:30:59,656 --> 01:31:01,026
because I am so nervous.

1752
01:31:01,726 --> 01:31:02,726
That's how it is.

1753
01:31:03,726 --> 01:31:04,765
That's how it feels like.

1754
01:31:04,766 --> 01:31:05,936
(He still cannot meet her eyes.)

1755
01:31:06,066 --> 01:31:08,036
I'm sorry. It's just like what I just did.

1756
01:31:14,236 --> 01:31:17,476
Actually, I don't remember what I said since I was nervous.

1757
01:31:17,846 --> 01:31:21,416
She had steady eyes,

1758
01:31:21,916 --> 01:31:25,516
and I could feel that she was a sincere person.

1759
01:31:27,956 --> 01:31:29,455
I'm so curious about how they'd respond.

1760
01:31:29,456 --> 01:31:30,786
I should pretend that I haven't met you, right?

1761
01:31:32,056 --> 01:31:33,156
Well...

1762
01:31:33,756 --> 01:31:35,626
I'll pretend that I don't know you.

1763
01:31:36,166 --> 01:31:38,295
My face shows everything.

1764
01:31:38,296 --> 01:31:40,335
- You can't maintain a poker face?
- No.

1765
01:31:40,336 --> 01:31:42,136
I'm terrible at controlling my facial expressions.

1766
01:31:42,336 --> 01:31:43,406
I can imagine.

1767
01:31:45,236 --> 01:31:47,576
You look like a very honest person.

1768
01:31:49,276 --> 01:31:50,346
You're right.

1769
01:31:51,676 --> 01:31:53,945
Do they know you're on a date?

1770
01:31:53,946 --> 01:31:55,616
- Don't they know?
- About me?

1771
01:31:56,186 --> 01:31:57,586
I guess no one knows.

1772
01:31:58,116 --> 01:31:59,186
What did you think?

1773
01:31:59,786 --> 01:32:01,015
When you were coming down?

1774
01:32:01,016 --> 01:32:02,386
(She got curious about what her first impression was.)

1775
01:32:05,126 --> 01:32:06,826
"Here comes a strong character."

1776
01:32:07,896 --> 01:32:09,096
- A strong character?
- Yes.

1777
01:32:11,666 --> 01:32:14,035
- "A strong character." - "A strong character?"

1778
01:32:14,036 --> 01:32:15,765
- What is he saying?
- What does he mean?

1779
01:32:15,766 --> 01:32:17,536
- What's a strong character?
- A strong character?

1780
01:32:19,176 --> 01:32:22,476
I thought everyone would get nervous.

1781
01:32:24,176 --> 01:32:27,746
Other four girls have very different images,

1782
01:32:27,846 --> 01:32:29,945
but you look even more different from them.

1783
01:32:29,946 --> 01:32:31,346
I'm not a strong character.

1784
01:32:32,456 --> 01:32:34,886
I didn't say "a strong character" in that way.

1785
01:32:35,626 --> 01:32:37,426
I meant that in a good way.

1786
01:32:39,696 --> 01:32:40,925
Are you good at keeping a poker face?

1787
01:32:40,926 --> 01:32:42,825
You said you are not. This is insane.

1788
01:32:42,826 --> 01:32:44,296
(He keeps saying this is insane.)

1789
01:32:44,396 --> 01:32:45,396
I'm sorry.

1790
01:32:46,666 --> 01:32:50,236
Actually, I might not remember anything I'm saying now.

1791
01:32:50,706 --> 01:32:53,536
I tend to get very nervous,

1792
01:32:54,706 --> 01:32:57,105
but maybe it's because you're talking a lot.

1793
01:32:57,106 --> 01:32:59,016
- I am?
- You made me feel comfortable.

1794
01:33:00,346 --> 01:33:01,676
I'm glad to hear that.

1795
01:33:03,316 --> 01:33:05,416
(Not feeling comfortable yet)

1796
01:33:05,656 --> 01:33:07,986
I do like a comfortable atmosphere.

1797
01:33:08,316 --> 01:33:10,386
I love a friendly vibe.

1798
01:33:10,626 --> 01:33:11,996
- Do you feel comfortable now?
- Yes.

1799
01:33:12,356 --> 01:33:13,426
- Much more.
- I'm glad.

1800
01:33:15,396 --> 01:33:18,266
I could feel she was being considerate.

1801
01:33:18,396 --> 01:33:21,336
I appreciated it a lot.

1802
01:33:22,266 --> 01:33:25,976
I also tried to be considerate while being nervous.

1803
01:33:26,336 --> 01:33:29,906
I think I put a lot of effort.

1804
01:33:32,116 --> 01:33:34,645
I mean it. If you are curious about anything in the House,

1805
01:33:34,646 --> 01:33:36,746
you can ask me questions.

1806
01:33:37,946 --> 01:33:40,556
I somehow feel relieved.

1807
01:33:40,786 --> 01:33:43,026
- Why?
- Before entering the House...

1808
01:33:43,226 --> 01:33:45,996
He looked so nervous.

1809
01:33:46,626 --> 01:33:49,226
He asked me the same question over and over.

1810
01:33:49,466 --> 01:33:53,036
Since I'm not talkative,

1811
01:33:53,766 --> 01:33:57,166
he tried to talk a lot, I think.

1812
01:33:58,006 --> 01:34:01,676
I'd like to talk with him again in a more comfortable atmosphere.

1813
01:34:03,746 --> 01:34:06,815
A strong character has joined them, as Yoo Sik said earlier.

1814
01:34:06,816 --> 01:34:08,245
- Right.
- I can see what he meant.

1815
01:34:08,246 --> 01:34:09,985
Hyeon Ji, as I see,

1816
01:34:09,986 --> 01:34:11,415
looks like someone...

1817
01:34:11,416 --> 01:34:12,815
who has a sexy and innocent charm.

1818
01:34:12,816 --> 01:34:13,816
That's right.

1819
01:34:13,817 --> 01:34:16,455
Do you think Hyeon Ji and Yoo Sik...

1820
01:34:16,456 --> 01:34:19,356
have feelings for each other? What do you think?

1821
01:34:19,596 --> 01:34:21,425
- They look very interested.
- Very interested?

1822
01:34:21,426 --> 01:34:24,825
However, she's so different from Min Kyung.

1823
01:34:24,826 --> 01:34:26,036
- I know.
- She's completely the opposite.

1824
01:34:26,136 --> 01:34:29,035
He might like her, but at the same time,

1825
01:34:29,036 --> 01:34:32,635
he might not know what to do when he's with her.

1826
01:34:32,636 --> 01:34:34,235
It's like he has no manual.

1827
01:34:34,236 --> 01:34:35,546
- He has no data.
- He doesn't know any solution.

1828
01:34:35,646 --> 01:34:37,405
I wondered if that was why he was awkward.

1829
01:34:37,406 --> 01:34:38,916
- That could be why.
- I know.

1830
01:34:40,216 --> 01:34:42,486
(Bowling alley)

1831
01:34:43,046 --> 01:34:44,646
- Do we have a driving range too?
- Oh, my!

1832
01:34:47,056 --> 01:34:48,586
- There are so many people.
- It's nice.

1833
01:34:49,086 --> 01:34:50,356
This is going to be fun.

1834
01:34:53,726 --> 01:34:55,865
- 29 and 30.
- 29 and 30?

1835
01:34:55,866 --> 01:34:56,926
(They came to a bowling alley, except for Yoo Sik.)

1836
01:34:57,396 --> 01:34:58,835
Ji Yeon said...

1837
01:34:58,836 --> 01:35:01,095
- Yes, I'm not good at this.
- she's not good at playing this.

1838
01:35:01,096 --> 01:35:03,965
But you should consider me as a first-timer too.

1839
01:35:03,966 --> 01:35:05,066
- A first-timer?
- Yes.

1840
01:35:05,836 --> 01:35:07,875
You need some time to get the hang of this.

1841
01:35:07,876 --> 01:35:09,275
Then I will team up with Ji Hyeon.

1842
01:35:09,276 --> 01:35:11,106
Three of you can team up, and we can play a game of 3 versus 2.

1843
01:35:11,846 --> 01:35:13,476
Really? Are you confident?

1844
01:35:14,046 --> 01:35:15,285
Let's bet on the bowling fees.

1845
01:35:15,286 --> 01:35:16,486
- A bet for bowling fees?
- Yes.

1846
01:35:16,516 --> 01:35:18,086
- Bowling fees and...
- And...

1847
01:35:18,446 --> 01:35:20,185
I wish we bet on something funny.

1848
01:35:20,186 --> 01:35:22,056
- Something funny?
- Come on.

1849
01:35:22,726 --> 01:35:24,025
Butt spelling.

1850
01:35:24,026 --> 01:35:25,086
(Squeezing his eyes shut)

1851
01:35:26,356 --> 01:35:27,896
I'm sure my team won't lose.

1852
01:35:28,156 --> 01:35:29,426
I'm sure we won't lose either.

1853
01:35:30,026 --> 01:35:31,996
How about doing something funny when we enter the House?

1854
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:35,336
How about imitating Rambo shooting a machine gun?

1855
01:35:37,006 --> 01:35:39,036
- I love that.
- You suddenly feel more confident.

1856
01:35:40,036 --> 01:35:42,806
Since we were not very close yet,

1857
01:35:43,146 --> 01:35:45,106
when we went back after the bowling game,

1858
01:35:45,316 --> 01:35:46,716
we decided to pretend shooting a machine gun...

1859
01:35:47,146 --> 01:35:49,116
saying, "I am Rambo."

1860
01:35:51,346 --> 01:35:52,386
I'm sorry.

1861
01:35:54,656 --> 01:35:55,786
- Oh, my.
- You go first.

1862
01:35:56,226 --> 01:35:57,355
Shall we play first?

1863
01:35:57,356 --> 01:35:58,385
Yes, please.

1864
01:35:58,386 --> 01:35:59,656
- Shall I play first?
- Yes.

1865
01:36:00,496 --> 01:36:01,626
This is so fun.

1866
01:36:13,706 --> 01:36:14,706
He's good.

1867
01:36:14,707 --> 01:36:16,275
(A strike!)

1868
01:36:16,276 --> 01:36:17,576
This is crazy.

1869
01:36:17,776 --> 01:36:19,176
How come you're so good?

1870
01:36:21,316 --> 01:36:22,586
Totally.

1871
01:36:24,416 --> 01:36:25,785
This is crazy.

1872
01:36:25,786 --> 01:36:28,655
- Clapping? We shouldn't do this.
- You're wrong.

1873
01:36:28,656 --> 01:36:29,885
You should play bowling with manners.

1874
01:36:29,886 --> 01:36:31,185
- Okay, with manners.
- We should give a hand.

1875
01:36:31,186 --> 01:36:32,925
I'm sure we won't lose.

1876
01:36:32,926 --> 01:36:35,725
You said you were not good at bowling.

1877
01:36:35,726 --> 01:36:37,426
Do we get 30 points?

1878
01:36:40,066 --> 01:36:41,395
Did you bring your credit card?

1879
01:36:41,396 --> 01:36:42,465
Oh, gosh.

1880
01:36:42,466 --> 01:36:43,565
(Shaking his mind)

1881
01:36:43,566 --> 01:36:46,306
You're thinking about how to pretend Rambo, right?

1882
01:36:49,846 --> 01:36:52,516
(Woo Jin's turn to play)

1883
01:36:54,876 --> 01:36:57,216
That was good.

1884
01:36:59,516 --> 01:37:00,686
That was good.

1885
01:37:02,686 --> 01:37:04,156
That was close. How can I pick it up?

1886
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:05,256
The one at the side?

1887
01:37:13,866 --> 01:37:15,236
- All right.
- That was amazing.

1888
01:37:15,536 --> 01:37:16,766
He's good.

1889
01:37:17,736 --> 01:37:19,705
- He's good.
- It was awesome.

1890
01:37:19,706 --> 01:37:20,775
- He gave it a spin.
- He's good.

1891
01:37:20,776 --> 01:37:23,075
That's the toughest one to pick up.

1892
01:37:23,076 --> 01:37:25,376
- The ball curved in like this.
- I know.

1893
01:37:26,146 --> 01:37:28,116
Gosh, I feel so much pressure.

1894
01:37:29,846 --> 01:37:31,046
- You can do it.
- Yes.

1895
01:37:31,546 --> 01:37:33,686
I can do this.

1896
01:37:33,856 --> 01:37:34,956
Really?

1897
01:37:42,926 --> 01:37:45,536
(Her posture is outstanding.)

1898
01:37:46,066 --> 01:37:48,096
- How come she's good?
- Why is she playing well?

1899
01:37:48,766 --> 01:37:50,136
That was nice.

1900
01:37:50,666 --> 01:37:53,076
- How come you're so good?
- You have a great posture.

1901
01:37:53,836 --> 01:37:55,336
I'm actually a bowling player.

1902
01:37:55,646 --> 01:37:56,876
How many jobs do you have?

1903
01:37:58,406 --> 01:37:59,446
You can do it!

1904
01:38:05,016 --> 01:38:06,016
(Making a perfect spare)

1905
01:38:06,017 --> 01:38:07,755
- How come she's so good?
- What was that?

1906
01:38:07,756 --> 01:38:10,186
Why am I doing this so suddenly?

1907
01:38:10,786 --> 01:38:12,325
I'm not this good, usually.

1908
01:38:12,326 --> 01:38:13,595
I envy you.

1909
01:38:13,596 --> 01:38:15,526
Our eyes are full of respect.

1910
01:38:16,766 --> 01:38:20,035
- No, I'm not like this.
- Really?

1911
01:38:20,036 --> 01:38:22,096
- Yun Nyeong, at the center here, - Yes.

1912
01:38:22,806 --> 01:38:25,105
you see a triangle, right?

1913
01:38:25,106 --> 01:38:26,505
You can send the ball that way.

1914
01:38:26,506 --> 01:38:28,475
As I see, slightly...

1915
01:38:28,476 --> 01:38:32,105
stand on the right side from the center.

1916
01:38:32,106 --> 01:38:33,575
And send the ball to the center.

1917
01:38:33,576 --> 01:38:34,646
Let's see how she does.

1918
01:38:36,616 --> 01:38:38,215
Goodness. I feel I'm going to be so bad.

1919
01:38:38,216 --> 01:38:39,855
- Walk slowly.
- Okay.

1920
01:38:39,856 --> 01:38:41,215
- Be careful with your wrist.
- Yes.

1921
01:38:41,216 --> 01:38:42,286
- Walk slowly and...
- Keep the pace.

1922
01:38:43,186 --> 01:38:44,626
Am I doing this right?

1923
01:38:47,626 --> 01:38:49,865
(Her posture looks clumsy.)

1924
01:38:49,866 --> 01:38:50,966
Really?

1925
01:38:51,496 --> 01:38:53,235
- She played it well, - That was so good.

1926
01:38:53,236 --> 01:38:54,265
Really?

1927
01:38:54,266 --> 01:38:55,865
- That was good.
- Are you sure it was good?

1928
01:38:55,866 --> 01:38:57,235
- It was good.
- Do you think so?

1929
01:38:57,236 --> 01:38:58,976
- Oh, my.
- I don't think so.

1930
01:38:59,236 --> 01:39:00,335
It was good.

1931
01:39:00,336 --> 01:39:03,175
But how can I make the posture? Tell me how to do it.

1932
01:39:03,176 --> 01:39:04,475
You're playing it well.

1933
01:39:04,476 --> 01:39:06,745
You don't have to care about the posture. You're doing it fine.

1934
01:39:06,746 --> 01:39:08,815
Are you okay with the ball's weight?

1935
01:39:08,816 --> 01:39:10,845
- Does it feel heavy?
- It's fine.

1936
01:39:10,846 --> 01:39:12,555
Start from the right side.

1937
01:39:12,556 --> 01:39:15,255
- I see.
- Send the ball to the number three.

1938
01:39:15,256 --> 01:39:16,425
Stand on the right side here.

1939
01:39:16,426 --> 01:39:18,226
- To the third one?
- Stand here.

1940
01:39:18,896 --> 01:39:20,825
- Send it to the number three there.
- I see.

1941
01:39:20,826 --> 01:39:21,826
(Baek Hyun's careful instruction for Yun Nyeong, the first-timer)

1942
01:39:23,096 --> 01:39:24,366
You can do it.

1943
01:39:28,266 --> 01:39:29,536
That was good.

1944
01:39:30,936 --> 01:39:32,336
That was good.

1945
01:39:34,006 --> 01:39:35,076
You made it.

1946
01:39:37,046 --> 01:39:38,076
That was great.

1947
01:39:38,916 --> 01:39:41,916
He kept cheering for me.

1948
01:39:42,586 --> 01:39:43,786
- You can do it.
- Yes.

1949
01:39:45,046 --> 01:39:47,385
He gave me a high-five.

1950
01:39:47,386 --> 01:39:51,325
I felt that he's someone...

1951
01:39:51,326 --> 01:39:52,596
who cares a lot about other people.

1952
01:39:53,726 --> 01:39:54,855
- It was great.
- Yun Nyeong.

1953
01:39:54,856 --> 01:39:56,266
- Yes.
- Our ace player.

1954
01:39:56,526 --> 01:39:59,096
You'll show them we have two ace players.

1955
01:40:00,436 --> 01:40:03,335
Don't make me laugh.

1956
01:40:03,336 --> 01:40:04,366
We have one weak link.

1957
01:40:08,136 --> 01:40:09,246
You made it.

1958
01:40:14,016 --> 01:40:15,985
(The first strike in her life)

1959
01:40:15,986 --> 01:40:17,046
- I told you.
- It feels great!

1960
01:40:17,286 --> 01:40:18,646
- It's amazing!
- It was good.

1961
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:19,955
- How come she's so good?
- No.

1962
01:40:19,956 --> 01:40:22,055
- I told you.
- It's not over until it's over.

1963
01:40:22,056 --> 01:40:23,056
This is unbelievable.

1964
01:40:25,486 --> 01:40:26,626
Go to the front.

1965
01:40:26,726 --> 01:40:28,026
Go to the front, here.

1966
01:40:28,196 --> 01:40:30,896
Walk slowly and look at the center.

1967
01:40:32,066 --> 01:40:33,566
You're almost like a coach.

1968
01:40:34,496 --> 01:40:35,736
We're national team members.

1969
01:40:40,636 --> 01:40:43,276
- Can you teach me?
- I will help you.

1970
01:40:44,046 --> 01:40:46,545
- Oh, my goodness.
- It's all right.

1971
01:40:46,546 --> 01:40:48,645
- It's all right.
- Go.

1972
01:40:48,646 --> 01:40:50,546
- Is it my turn?
- Carry it to the end.

1973
01:40:51,216 --> 01:40:53,185
- Baek Hyun.
- You have an amazing posture.

1974
01:40:53,186 --> 01:40:54,186
- It's good.
- Is it okay?

1975
01:40:54,187 --> 01:40:55,215
- Can I go now?
- You have an amazing posture.

1976
01:40:55,216 --> 01:40:58,285
(Baek Hyun didn't hear her as he was coaching Ji Yeon.)

1977
01:40:58,286 --> 01:40:59,296
Start from the center.

1978
01:41:02,796 --> 01:41:04,626
It's a strike. I'm sure.

1979
01:41:05,066 --> 01:41:06,166
It really is.

1980
01:41:07,066 --> 01:41:09,265
- Oh, my.
- Nice!

1981
01:41:09,266 --> 01:41:10,366
Thank you.

1982
01:41:10,436 --> 01:41:12,405
- What was that?
- Thank you.

1983
01:41:12,406 --> 01:41:13,406
- What was that?
- Thank you.

1984
01:41:13,406 --> 01:41:14,406
- Thank you.
- Come on.

1985
01:41:14,407 --> 01:41:15,606
- What was that?
- How come you're so good?

1986
01:41:16,376 --> 01:41:18,246
Don't be pressured. You can do it.

1987
01:41:18,546 --> 01:41:19,746
Put your fingers deep inside.

1988
01:41:26,916 --> 01:41:28,816
- That's nice.
- She did a good job.

1989
01:41:29,386 --> 01:41:30,486
It's a strike.

1990
01:41:32,026 --> 01:41:33,395
(Ji Yeon succeeds in playing bowling.)

1991
01:41:33,396 --> 01:41:34,426
What's happening?

1992
01:41:34,656 --> 01:41:35,626
That was so nice.

1993
01:41:39,136 --> 01:41:40,336
- You're good.
- It's nice.

1994
01:41:42,666 --> 01:41:44,466
You did it so well.

1995
01:41:47,406 --> 01:41:49,806
(Almost the end of the game)

1996
01:41:57,386 --> 01:41:59,886
- I recognize your skill.
- That was amazing.

1997
01:42:04,056 --> 01:42:06,095
I guess he dated at the bowling alley all the time.

1998
01:42:06,096 --> 01:42:08,155
I'm sure Baek Hyun is a sports player.

1999
01:42:08,156 --> 01:42:10,265
- I guess he does sports.
- Is he?

2000
01:42:10,266 --> 01:42:12,666
- He plays it so easily.
- Isn't he a bowling player?

2001
01:42:13,466 --> 01:42:14,466
He's so good.

2002
01:42:27,176 --> 01:42:28,276
That's amazing.

2003
01:42:29,146 --> 01:42:31,645
- You were so good.
- It was a nice game.

2004
01:42:31,646 --> 01:42:33,015
- It was a nice game.
- It was a nice game.

2005
01:42:33,016 --> 01:42:35,555
- You did it so well.
- It was a nice game.

2006
01:42:35,556 --> 01:42:37,156
- It was a nice game.
- It was a nice game.

2007
01:42:37,626 --> 01:42:39,196
Oh, my. This is so fun.

2008
01:42:40,096 --> 01:42:42,396
- Don't you feel hungry?
- I'm hungry.

2009
01:42:43,566 --> 01:42:44,566
I'm hungry.

2010
01:42:45,126 --> 01:42:48,266
- Now that we played bowling, - Yes.

2011
01:42:48,636 --> 01:42:49,836
we feel much closer.

2012
01:42:49,906 --> 01:42:52,235
Playing sports is a good way to get close quickly.

2013
01:42:52,236 --> 01:42:53,506
Really?

2014
01:42:53,576 --> 01:42:54,736
I found it so fun.

2015
01:42:56,106 --> 01:42:57,346
Have you ever been here, Hyehwa?

2016
01:42:57,976 --> 01:42:59,546
Of course.

2017
01:43:00,346 --> 01:43:01,645
I love this area.

2018
01:43:01,646 --> 01:43:02,786
- Really?
- Yes.

2019
01:43:03,446 --> 01:43:04,915
Do you like to go to a play?

2020
01:43:04,916 --> 01:43:06,616
- Yes.
- Really?

2021
01:43:06,786 --> 01:43:08,155
I guess you like musicals.

2022
01:43:08,156 --> 01:43:11,156
Musicals...

2023
01:43:11,326 --> 01:43:13,555
I don't go to see them often.

2024
01:43:13,556 --> 01:43:14,826
- Really?
- No.

2025
01:43:15,526 --> 01:43:18,626
I'd rather go to exhibitions than go to musicals.

2026
01:43:18,896 --> 01:43:20,436
I've found a partner to go to exhibitions.

2027
01:43:21,236 --> 01:43:24,665
I loved the Basquiat exhibition.

2028
01:43:24,666 --> 01:43:26,575
- Jean Basquiat?
- I'm sure you love Basquiat.

2029
01:43:26,576 --> 01:43:27,706
I like Jean Basquiat.

2030
01:43:28,836 --> 01:43:30,106
Jean-Michel Basquiat.

2031
01:43:31,606 --> 01:43:35,146
- The exhibition was at the L Tower.
- Right. That's the one I went to.

2032
01:43:35,746 --> 01:43:38,445
- Do you know Giacometti?
- Yes.

2033
01:43:38,446 --> 01:43:40,486
- He's my favorite.
- Really?

2034
01:43:40,786 --> 01:43:42,356
- Do you like exhibitions?
- Totally.

2035
01:43:43,256 --> 01:43:44,785
Did you go to the Banksy exhibition too?

2036
01:43:44,786 --> 01:43:47,095
Banksy? I didn't see that exhibition.

2037
01:43:47,096 --> 01:43:48,926
I love Banksy, though.

2038
01:43:49,096 --> 01:43:50,395
I'm following his account.

2039
01:43:50,396 --> 01:43:51,466
Same here.

2040
01:43:53,636 --> 01:43:54,796
I love going to exhibitions.

2041
01:43:56,066 --> 01:43:57,166
I usually go alone.

2042
01:43:57,436 --> 01:44:00,505
Me too. I go alone...

2043
01:44:00,506 --> 01:44:02,106
and like to watch it with earphones on.

2044
01:44:04,346 --> 01:44:05,916
We had so much in common.

2045
01:44:07,246 --> 01:44:09,315
Baek Hyun also likes him.

2046
01:44:09,316 --> 01:44:12,985
I love artists like Basquiat.

2047
01:44:12,986 --> 01:44:17,055
She said she loves Basquiat, the artist.

2048
01:44:17,056 --> 01:44:19,756
I went to see that exhibition too.

2049
01:44:20,796 --> 01:44:23,265
We went, "Do you like to go to exhibitions? Who's your favorite?"

2050
01:44:23,266 --> 01:44:24,366
"Do you know Giacometti?"

2051
01:44:24,496 --> 01:44:26,266
There's an artist called...

2052
01:44:28,466 --> 01:44:29,566
Alberto Giacometti,

2053
01:44:29,706 --> 01:44:30,766
and she said she knew him.

2054
01:44:32,236 --> 01:44:33,406
It was amazing.

2055
01:44:33,436 --> 01:44:35,476
We had a lot in common.

2056
01:44:36,906 --> 01:44:39,445
We had so much in common, and it was amazing.

2057
01:44:39,446 --> 01:44:42,515
So I thought it would be so nice...

2058
01:44:42,516 --> 01:44:45,886
if we could have a date going to an exhibition later.

2059
01:44:46,716 --> 01:44:47,955
My feelings grew stronger...

2060
01:44:47,956 --> 01:44:51,326
since he seemed to like things I like.

2061
01:44:52,186 --> 01:44:53,496
My feelings grew a lot.

2062
01:44:54,196 --> 01:44:56,796
In the car, actually,

2063
01:44:57,266 --> 01:44:58,595
only the two of us talked mostly.

2064
01:44:58,596 --> 01:45:01,335
It was like there were blinds pulled down in the backseat.

2065
01:45:01,336 --> 01:45:04,035
On our way back driving in the car,

2066
01:45:04,036 --> 01:45:05,766
we had a small talk.

2067
01:45:07,606 --> 01:45:09,406
I thought, "I'm having a moment like this."

2068
01:45:13,116 --> 01:45:14,676
There's a connecting link made.

2069
01:45:14,746 --> 01:45:17,685
You grow fond of someone with similar hobbies and interests.

2070
01:45:17,686 --> 01:45:19,655
That's right. However,

2071
01:45:19,656 --> 01:45:21,555
having the same taste...

2072
01:45:21,556 --> 01:45:23,085
doesn't make you fall in love quickly.

2073
01:45:23,086 --> 01:45:25,155
I think you can.

2074
01:45:25,156 --> 01:45:27,855
When someone you have feelings for has the same taste with me,

2075
01:45:27,856 --> 01:45:29,395
it makes an opportunity to fall in love.

2076
01:45:29,396 --> 01:45:30,925
You get to see that person more closely.

2077
01:45:30,926 --> 01:45:32,965
When it's painting, that means they're compatible.

2078
01:45:32,966 --> 01:45:34,765
- There are so many artists.
- Right.

2079
01:45:34,766 --> 01:45:36,605
Among so many artists all over the world,

2080
01:45:36,606 --> 01:45:38,305
three artists were mentioned,

2081
01:45:38,306 --> 01:45:39,575
- I know.
- and they both like them.

2082
01:45:39,576 --> 01:45:40,975
- That's not easy.
- Their feelings increase.

2083
01:45:40,976 --> 01:45:43,745
Yun Nyeong and Baek Hyun showed..

2084
01:45:43,746 --> 01:45:46,616
- chemistry for the first time.
- Right.

2085
01:45:47,116 --> 01:45:48,476
I didn't expect it.

2086
01:45:49,686 --> 01:45:51,185
Can we eat now?

2087
01:45:51,186 --> 01:45:52,245
(Dinner together after spending a day)

2088
01:45:52,246 --> 01:45:53,256
- Shall we?
- Okay.

2089
01:45:54,216 --> 01:45:55,716
Does anyone care for some wine?

2090
01:45:56,756 --> 01:45:57,856
Wine?

2091
01:45:58,126 --> 01:45:59,626
Do you prefer beer with fried chicken?

2092
01:46:00,456 --> 01:46:03,396
You're Professor Fried Chicken.

2093
01:46:03,826 --> 01:46:04,996
- Wine?
- Yes?

2094
01:46:05,166 --> 01:46:06,266
Shall we give it a try?

2095
01:46:06,766 --> 01:46:08,395
I lack knowledge.

2096
01:46:08,396 --> 01:46:10,106
- I'm not sure.
- Professor Fried Chiken, decide.

2097
01:46:10,766 --> 01:46:14,075
- Do as written in your thesis.
- I'll have beer.

2098
01:46:14,076 --> 01:46:15,076
I see.

2099
01:46:15,176 --> 01:46:16,375
Thank you for the food.

2100
01:46:16,376 --> 01:46:18,746
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

2101
01:46:20,716 --> 01:46:21,846
It's good.

2102
01:46:24,416 --> 01:46:25,616
(Pleasant)

2103
01:46:27,516 --> 01:46:28,516
What was that?

2104
01:46:28,517 --> 01:46:30,156
I heard a sound coming from your lower abdomen.

2105
01:46:30,426 --> 01:46:32,056
It's been a long time to have the original taste.

2106
01:46:32,556 --> 01:46:33,656
Do you like it?

2107
01:46:34,126 --> 01:46:36,225
Fried chicken here looks much better.

2108
01:46:36,226 --> 01:46:37,325
Fried chicken here?

2109
01:46:37,326 --> 01:46:39,025
- Do you want to come here?
- You can sit on this side.

2110
01:46:39,026 --> 01:46:40,096
Shall I?

2111
01:46:40,536 --> 01:46:42,166
- You can go.
- Come here.

2112
01:46:42,236 --> 01:46:43,935
Do you want to leave, Professor Fried Chicken?

2113
01:46:43,936 --> 01:46:45,736
What's the reason you're going over there?

2114
01:46:45,866 --> 01:46:48,535
The plating looks very nice.

2115
01:46:48,536 --> 01:46:49,775
But I'll stay here.

2116
01:46:49,776 --> 01:46:51,745
- No, you can eat it. You can go.
- No, I won't.

2117
01:46:51,746 --> 01:46:53,376
Yoo Sik can sit here.

2118
01:46:57,516 --> 01:46:59,486
- Really?
- Many people actually don't.

2119
01:46:59,586 --> 01:47:01,855
That's nonsense. It's my favorite fried chicken.

2120
01:47:01,856 --> 01:47:02,986
What is it?

2121
01:47:03,526 --> 01:47:05,186
- How was it?
- Come join us.

2122
01:47:05,386 --> 01:47:06,526
Me?

2123
01:47:07,756 --> 01:47:10,066
- Come and have dinner.
- Okay.

2124
01:47:10,766 --> 01:47:12,836
I guess you're not hungry at all.

2125
01:47:13,166 --> 01:47:15,235
- Me?
- Yes. We were starving.

2126
01:47:15,236 --> 01:47:17,366
I'm starving to death now.

2127
01:47:18,036 --> 01:47:19,165
I want to drink water.

2128
01:47:19,166 --> 01:47:20,475
Come and have this quickly

2129
01:47:20,476 --> 01:47:21,635
(Yoo Sik is good at talking nonsense.)

2130
01:47:21,636 --> 01:47:23,946
- Goodness. This is insane.
- Do you like this taste?

2131
01:47:24,106 --> 01:47:25,705
I haven't had a bite yet.

2132
01:47:25,706 --> 01:47:26,746
(Eating)

2133
01:47:27,876 --> 01:47:29,715
- Are you feeding him?
- What?

2134
01:47:29,716 --> 01:47:30,786
You're feeding him?

2135
01:47:33,616 --> 01:47:34,616
It tastes good.

2136
01:47:36,986 --> 01:47:38,185
Did everything go well with the work?

2137
01:47:38,186 --> 01:47:39,596
(Nodding)

2138
01:47:41,296 --> 01:47:43,166
- Is this everything we ordered?
- Yes.

2139
01:47:43,466 --> 01:47:45,365
Why does it feel like it's not enough, so suddenly?

2140
01:47:45,366 --> 01:47:47,566
Maybe because we're sitting apart. Shall we sit closer?

2141
01:47:47,696 --> 01:47:49,466
Yes, let's sit closer. We're sitting too far apart.

2142
01:47:50,236 --> 01:47:52,365
- Shall I sit there?
- Do you want to change seats?

2143
01:47:52,366 --> 01:47:53,506
Are you still here?

2144
01:47:57,706 --> 01:47:58,945
Why did you hurt here?

2145
01:47:58,946 --> 01:48:00,015
- Where?
- Here.

2146
01:48:00,016 --> 01:48:01,376
I got a scratch earlier.

2147
01:48:01,576 --> 01:48:03,185
- Where? Let's see.
- Who is it?

2148
01:48:03,186 --> 01:48:04,285
It's nothing, I guess.

2149
01:48:04,286 --> 01:48:05,485
- You're bleeding.
- Am I?

2150
01:48:05,486 --> 01:48:06,515
What?

2151
01:48:06,516 --> 01:48:07,715
What have you been doing?

2152
01:48:07,716 --> 01:48:09,015
Did he get a scratch from the kite?

2153
01:48:09,016 --> 01:48:11,555
- From the kite?
- Didn't he?

2154
01:48:11,556 --> 01:48:12,756
The kite went over his head earlier.

2155
01:48:13,296 --> 01:48:14,956
I thought he got a scratch from the kite string.

2156
01:48:15,356 --> 01:48:16,465
I don't know. I got a scratch.

2157
01:48:16,466 --> 01:48:17,666
- Who is it?
- From what?

2158
01:48:18,096 --> 01:48:19,166
I got it from a box.

2159
01:48:19,496 --> 01:48:20,965
- Did it just happen?
- Yes, a while ago.

2160
01:48:20,966 --> 01:48:23,335
How can a box scratch you?

2161
01:48:23,336 --> 01:48:24,665
I was holding it.

2162
01:48:24,666 --> 01:48:25,766
Which box was it?

2163
01:48:26,106 --> 01:48:28,035
- Shall we throw it down?
- We'll burn it up.

2164
01:48:28,036 --> 01:48:29,235
- We'll burn it.
- Okay.

2165
01:48:29,236 --> 01:48:30,776
I put it in the laundry room.

2166
01:48:31,146 --> 01:48:32,706
Won Kyu, don't get hurt.

2167
01:48:37,616 --> 01:48:38,916
We shouldn't throw this away, I guess.

2168
01:48:39,456 --> 01:48:41,515
- We can't finish this.
- We can eat it tomorrow.

2169
01:48:41,516 --> 01:48:42,615
Shall I close the boxes?

2170
01:48:42,616 --> 01:48:44,256
Does this place have a bad vibe?

2171
01:48:44,486 --> 01:48:46,026
How come we're not eating well?

2172
01:48:46,396 --> 01:48:49,226
I guess our throats feel blocked sitting here.

2173
01:48:49,496 --> 01:48:52,596
Do you want to talk casually?

2174
01:48:56,836 --> 01:48:58,305
Do you want to talk casually?

2175
01:48:58,306 --> 01:49:00,076
- You can go ahead.
- No.

2176
01:49:00,306 --> 01:49:02,006
You kept talking casually.

2177
01:49:02,536 --> 01:49:03,545
- Did I?
- Yes.

2178
01:49:03,546 --> 01:49:06,376
- I didn't.
- You did, and after recognizing it,

2179
01:49:06,616 --> 01:49:08,176
you keep adding honorifics.

2180
01:49:11,386 --> 01:49:14,756
(Who seems to be Baek Hyun's ex?)

2181
01:49:15,116 --> 01:49:16,256
Ji Hyeon.

2182
01:49:17,526 --> 01:49:20,126
I'm bothered a bit. I can't help it.

2183
01:49:21,326 --> 01:49:22,425
I guess we need to throw this away.

2184
01:49:22,426 --> 01:49:24,125
- It got old.
- It's good, though.

2185
01:49:24,126 --> 01:49:25,226
(Won Kyu and Ji Yeon will do the dishes today.)

2186
01:49:25,626 --> 01:49:26,765
I'll throw it away.

2187
01:49:26,766 --> 01:49:30,465
(Yun Nyeong throws away the leftover broth.)

2188
01:49:30,466 --> 01:49:32,705
You threw it over the dishes I washed.

2189
01:49:32,706 --> 01:49:34,906
I'm sorry. What shall I do?

2190
01:49:35,976 --> 01:49:37,176
It's fine.

2191
01:49:42,446 --> 01:49:43,945
Did you hurt here too, by the way?

2192
01:49:43,946 --> 01:49:45,915
It happened before I came here.

2193
01:49:45,916 --> 01:49:46,985
- Really?
- Yes.

2194
01:49:46,986 --> 01:49:48,256
I guess we have an ointment.

2195
01:49:48,856 --> 01:49:50,426
- The ointment.
- It's...

2196
01:49:53,126 --> 01:49:56,466
(Only two of them are left in the kitchen.)

2197
01:49:57,766 --> 01:49:59,325
I learned to bowl today.

2198
01:49:59,326 --> 01:50:01,235
- What?
- I learned how to play bowling.

2199
01:50:01,236 --> 01:50:03,566
- Was it fun?
- Yes.

2200
01:50:04,106 --> 01:50:05,166
It was very...

2201
01:50:08,606 --> 01:50:09,676
amazing.

2202
01:50:10,146 --> 01:50:11,176
- It was fun.
- I see.

2203
01:50:12,376 --> 01:50:13,915
Was it actually your first time?

2204
01:50:13,916 --> 01:50:15,445
I've been to an alley once before,

2205
01:50:15,446 --> 01:50:16,945
but it was my first time...

2206
01:50:16,946 --> 01:50:18,146
- To actually play it?
- to actually play it.

2207
01:50:31,766 --> 01:50:34,036
Gosh, I need to wash my face.

2208
01:50:40,606 --> 01:50:43,745
You can apply this ointment on your neck later.

2209
01:50:43,746 --> 01:50:46,006
- Yes, I will.
- Gosh.

2210
01:50:46,276 --> 01:50:47,815
- Gosh.
- Thank you.

2211
01:50:47,816 --> 01:50:48,976
Thank you.

2212
01:50:49,016 --> 01:50:50,915
- "Yes, I will." - "Yes, I will."

2213
01:50:50,916 --> 01:50:52,515
- "Yes, I will." - Here we go.

2214
01:50:52,516 --> 01:50:53,756
"Yes, I will."

2215
01:50:54,316 --> 01:50:55,885
Now we can see it.

2216
01:50:55,886 --> 01:50:57,925
Even before her hand reached.

2217
01:50:57,926 --> 01:51:00,195
Two of them were never together.

2218
01:51:00,196 --> 01:51:01,326
They had nothing in common.

2219
01:51:02,196 --> 01:51:03,296
It feels so.

2220
01:51:10,406 --> 01:51:11,936
Is there anything I can help with?

2221
01:51:12,366 --> 01:51:14,806
No. You helped all right earlier.

2222
01:51:17,806 --> 01:51:19,175
You can take a rest today, Woo Jin.

2223
01:51:19,176 --> 01:51:21,646
- But we...
- You cooked tteokbokki today.

2224
01:51:25,646 --> 01:51:26,786
You should apply it here too.

2225
01:51:27,456 --> 01:51:28,616
It's not open yet.

2226
01:51:30,626 --> 01:51:31,626
You mean here?

2227
01:51:31,627 --> 01:51:32,726
Here?

2228
01:51:33,626 --> 01:51:34,756
You should apply it carefully.

2229
01:51:35,596 --> 01:51:37,895
- You got it all over your shirt.
- I can apply it roughly.

2230
01:51:37,896 --> 01:51:39,065
Gosh, really.

2231
01:51:39,066 --> 01:51:40,066
(He's high maintenance.)

2232
01:51:40,166 --> 01:51:42,196
- You're grabbing me by the collar.
- It's not like that.

2233
01:51:43,906 --> 01:51:46,205
- Isn't it too big for his wound?
- It is, right?

2234
01:51:46,206 --> 01:51:47,736
He needs to show it off.

2235
01:51:47,876 --> 01:51:50,005
- It's too big.
- It's almost a stab wound.

2236
01:51:50,006 --> 01:51:53,346
I need to put this on even though I don't want to.

2237
01:51:55,176 --> 01:51:57,685
- You don't want to?
- I want, but...

2238
01:51:57,686 --> 01:51:58,716
(Yoo Sik's overtreatment is finished.)

2239
01:52:06,696 --> 01:52:08,325
Aren't you going to drink today?

2240
01:52:08,326 --> 01:52:09,356
Will you?

2241
01:52:10,396 --> 01:52:11,426
Will everyone go in and sleep?

2242
01:52:12,626 --> 01:52:14,295
- Did they say they'll sleep?
- I don't know.

2243
01:52:14,296 --> 01:52:16,565
I think the women are going to sleep.

2244
01:52:16,566 --> 01:52:17,566
Now?

2245
01:52:19,836 --> 01:52:21,105
The cup I used...

2246
01:52:21,106 --> 01:52:22,836
- What are you going to drink?
- It's still...

2247
01:52:23,106 --> 01:52:24,476
- Beer?
- Yes.

2248
01:52:25,446 --> 01:52:26,476
Wine glass...

2249
01:52:26,746 --> 01:52:28,415
I'll drink a can of beer.

2250
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:29,646
- Wine glass?
- Wine glass.

2251
01:52:31,586 --> 01:52:33,186
- This is also a wine glass.
- What are you doing tomorrow?

2252
01:52:34,116 --> 01:52:36,326
- Nothing much.
- Let's hang out.

2253
01:52:36,926 --> 01:52:38,226
- Shall we?
- Let's hang out. Yes.

2254
01:52:41,556 --> 01:52:43,996
It was a bit unexpected.

2255
01:52:44,796 --> 01:52:46,735
Ji Yeon also went and played bowling.

2256
01:52:46,736 --> 01:52:49,636
I think she really had fun there.

2257
01:52:50,436 --> 01:52:53,375
Of course, bowling was fun.

2258
01:52:53,376 --> 01:52:56,976
Still, I have the most fun hanging out with Won Kyu.

2259
01:52:57,646 --> 01:53:02,276
It felt like I was getting in the way...

2260
01:53:02,776 --> 01:53:05,016
of him getting to know other people.

2261
01:53:05,116 --> 01:53:06,416
So I tried to stop myself,

2262
01:53:07,556 --> 01:53:09,486
but I really wanted to hang out with him.

2263
01:53:09,826 --> 01:53:11,356
That's why I asked him out.

2264
01:53:11,786 --> 01:53:14,095
Ji Yeon is someone who never reverses.

2265
01:53:14,096 --> 01:53:15,455
- That's right.
- She's honest.

2266
01:53:15,456 --> 01:53:17,895
I think Ji Yeon thinks...

2267
01:53:17,896 --> 01:53:20,095
Yun Nyeong is his ex.

2268
01:53:20,096 --> 01:53:21,465
- I think she sensed something.
- Yes.

2269
01:53:21,466 --> 01:53:23,735
She ran there and asked him.

2270
01:53:23,736 --> 01:53:26,036
There could have been a better time for that.

2271
01:53:26,236 --> 01:53:27,475
- But she rushed there.
- She rushed.

2272
01:53:27,476 --> 01:53:28,476
In a rush.

2273
01:53:28,477 --> 01:53:30,345
She quickly came when they were together...

2274
01:53:30,346 --> 01:53:32,846
- and tried to be with him.
- "Let's hang out."

2275
01:53:33,246 --> 01:53:34,246
Cheers.

2276
01:53:34,247 --> 01:53:35,545
(The 2nd round of drinking began.)

2277
01:53:35,546 --> 01:53:37,015
- DFO.
- Aren't you going to drink?

2278
01:53:37,016 --> 01:53:39,246
- Not even water or soft drinks?
- DFO.

2279
01:53:39,446 --> 01:53:41,385
- Cheers.
- Well done.

2280
01:53:41,386 --> 01:53:43,125
- What about Won Kyu?
- I borrowed this.

2281
01:53:43,126 --> 01:53:44,886
Right. Cheers.

2282
01:53:47,196 --> 01:53:49,626
Bowling was really fun.

2283
01:53:49,726 --> 01:53:53,066
We would be able to get closer faster if we play sports together.

2284
01:53:53,396 --> 01:53:55,396
What could we do together?

2285
01:53:56,436 --> 01:53:58,506
Should we think about things we could do?

2286
01:53:59,106 --> 01:54:00,106
Shall we play the Son Byeong Ho game?

2287
01:54:00,107 --> 01:54:01,435
- Shall we play that?
- Yes.

2288
01:54:01,436 --> 01:54:02,506
Who starts?

2289
01:54:07,076 --> 01:54:09,146
I'm the only one wearing glasses. I'll take them off now.

2290
01:54:14,586 --> 01:54:16,685
- Yes!
- Here!

2291
01:54:16,686 --> 01:54:18,285
- It rang.
- I sent the signal.

2292
01:54:18,286 --> 01:54:19,326
- Yes!
- Yes.

2293
01:54:20,296 --> 01:54:21,296
- I'll go.
- I'll go.

2294
01:54:21,296 --> 01:54:22,296
I'll go.

2295
01:54:22,696 --> 01:54:23,696
This is amazing.

2296
01:54:24,296 --> 01:54:26,026
- It's really midnight.
- It's been a while.

2297
01:54:26,326 --> 01:54:29,066
- This is...
- It's really amazing.

2298
01:54:30,866 --> 01:54:35,036
(One person is waiting outside the door.)

2299
01:55:01,236 --> 01:55:03,666
(He came to the wrong place.)

2300
01:55:03,866 --> 01:55:04,936
Isn't this the one?

2301
01:55:07,406 --> 01:55:08,476
I wonder what it is.

2302
01:55:08,976 --> 01:55:10,076
Did he not find it?

2303
01:55:11,776 --> 01:55:12,975
I'll go.

2304
01:55:12,976 --> 01:55:15,016
- Do we all have to go?
- Is someone here?

2305
01:55:17,186 --> 01:55:19,686
- No way. My heart is beating.
- Me too.

2306
01:55:19,886 --> 01:55:21,486
Shall we go and see?

2307
01:55:23,056 --> 01:55:24,586
- Is it not there?
- There's nothing.

2308
01:55:24,786 --> 01:55:25,986
Is it outside, then?

2309
01:55:26,556 --> 01:55:27,856
- No way.
- Why?

2310
01:55:28,326 --> 01:55:29,796
- New?
- Really?

2311
01:55:29,896 --> 01:55:32,096
- I think someone came.
- There's nothing here.

2312
01:55:32,196 --> 01:55:34,035
- Maybe someone is outside.
- Quickly open the door.

2313
01:55:34,036 --> 01:55:35,896
- Really?
- Outside?

2314
01:55:37,166 --> 01:55:38,866
Hold on. I'm so curious.

2315
01:55:39,876 --> 01:55:41,576
I guess it was the sound of the doorbell.

2316
01:55:44,376 --> 01:55:46,046
- Someone is here.
- Hello.

2317
01:55:51,486 --> 01:55:52,546
Someone is here.

2318
01:55:53,386 --> 01:55:54,386
Goodness.

2319
01:55:56,626 --> 01:55:57,655
- Hello.
- Hello.

2320
01:55:57,656 --> 01:56:00,296
- Hello.
- Hello.

2321
01:56:02,156 --> 01:56:03,265
Hello.

2322
01:56:03,266 --> 01:56:04,896
(Everyone came to welcome the new resident.)

2323
01:56:05,996 --> 01:56:07,535
- Someone came.
- It was true.

2324
01:56:07,536 --> 01:56:09,165
- Come upstairs.
- This way.

2325
01:56:09,166 --> 01:56:10,206
(The new resident, Park Hyun Ji)

2326
01:56:11,236 --> 01:56:12,666
- Hello.
- Hello.

2327
01:56:12,966 --> 01:56:14,135
Come upstairs.

2328
01:56:14,136 --> 01:56:17,046
The stairs are steep, so you have to climb up a bit.

2329
01:56:19,246 --> 01:56:20,576
She looked like an angel.

2330
01:56:22,546 --> 01:56:24,546
She was very stylish and pure.

2331
01:56:25,286 --> 01:56:26,816
I wonder whose ex she is.

2332
01:56:29,786 --> 01:56:33,296
Something huge came.

2333
01:56:37,666 --> 01:56:41,236
(Another ex moved in.)

2334
01:56:41,796 --> 01:56:42,996
Slippers.

2335
01:56:43,906 --> 01:56:45,166
There are no slippers.

2336
01:56:47,006 --> 01:56:48,476
You can wear these.

2337
01:56:49,076 --> 01:56:51,246
(Yun Nyeong gave her the slippers she wore.)

2338
01:56:51,546 --> 01:56:52,706
You must be cold.

2339
01:56:52,806 --> 01:56:54,546
I'm all right.

2340
01:56:56,276 --> 01:56:57,346
Did you have dinner?

2341
01:56:58,186 --> 01:57:02,686
I find it really hard to be at the center of attention.

2342
01:57:03,486 --> 01:57:05,286
I thought my heart was going to explode.

2343
01:57:07,256 --> 01:57:10,326
Everyone welcomed me.

2344
01:57:10,896 --> 01:57:14,796
I thought it was very bright.

2345
01:57:16,736 --> 01:57:18,266
It must have been quite a travel.

2346
01:57:22,306 --> 01:57:24,976
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

2347
01:57:30,386 --> 01:57:31,946
She was tall and fair-skinned.

2348
01:57:32,516 --> 01:57:35,656
She had to be Won Kyu's ex.

2349
01:57:42,296 --> 01:57:43,296
I think...

2350
01:57:45,096 --> 01:57:46,426
I was a bit concerned.

2351
01:57:47,896 --> 01:57:49,296
She had a cat-like face...

2352
01:57:49,836 --> 01:57:53,536
and seemed like she'd be popular with both women and men.

2353
01:57:58,746 --> 01:58:00,046
What did you have for dinner?

2354
01:58:00,376 --> 01:58:01,845
I just had...

2355
01:58:01,846 --> 01:58:03,176
- some fruit.
- Really?

2356
01:58:03,276 --> 01:58:05,785
There are a few chefs here,

2357
01:58:05,786 --> 01:58:07,416
so they can make you something if you want.

2358
01:58:08,156 --> 01:58:11,026
She had a nice figure and a pure look.

2359
01:58:11,426 --> 01:58:12,586
I thought even my ex...

2360
01:58:14,326 --> 01:58:16,156
could like her too.

2361
01:58:21,466 --> 01:58:23,136
What's your name?

2362
01:58:23,236 --> 01:58:25,435
I'm Park Hyeon Ji.

2363
01:58:25,436 --> 01:58:27,276
- Park Hyeon Ji.
- Yes.

2364
01:58:28,636 --> 01:58:29,976
- If you reverse that...
- Right.

2365
01:58:30,076 --> 01:58:31,106
Goodness.

2366
01:58:31,306 --> 01:58:32,805
What characters do you use?

2367
01:58:32,806 --> 01:58:34,545
Virtuous Hyeon and wise Ji.

2368
01:58:34,546 --> 01:58:36,015
They're the same as mine!

2369
01:58:36,016 --> 01:58:37,046
- Really?
- Amazing.

2370
01:58:37,146 --> 01:58:40,655
- Are you a Milyang Park?
- Yes. Are you a Park?

2371
01:58:40,656 --> 01:58:41,716
What generation are you in the family line?

2372
01:58:42,586 --> 01:58:45,326
- How far...
- What generation are you?

2373
01:58:46,356 --> 01:58:47,425
This is interesting.

2374
01:58:47,426 --> 01:58:49,726
- Amazing.
- Nice to meet you, Hyeon Ji.

2375
01:58:50,526 --> 01:58:52,396
- Amazing.
- It's so interesting.

2376
01:58:53,466 --> 01:58:55,165
- You're the first Hyeon Ji.
- Really?

2377
01:58:55,166 --> 01:58:56,366
Yes. Park Hyeon Ji.

2378
01:58:56,966 --> 01:58:58,366
Wise Ji and virtuous Hyeon.

2379
01:58:59,436 --> 01:59:01,536
- It's interesting.
- Amazing.

2380
01:59:02,206 --> 01:59:04,076
I wanted to talk,

2381
01:59:04,706 --> 01:59:07,146
but it felt nice knowing it alone.

2382
01:59:09,176 --> 01:59:11,585
- What were you doing?
- The Son Byeong Ho game.

2383
01:59:11,586 --> 01:59:13,785
We put up our fingers to play the Son Byeong Ho game,

2384
01:59:13,786 --> 01:59:15,786
- The bell rang.
- and the bell rang.

2385
01:59:16,256 --> 01:59:18,356
You're the tallest among the women.

2386
01:59:18,456 --> 01:59:19,626
How tall are you?

2387
01:59:19,726 --> 01:59:22,256
I'm about 172cm to 173cm.

2388
01:59:28,236 --> 01:59:32,206
All the men look tall.

2389
01:59:32,606 --> 01:59:34,236
How tall are you, Ji Yeon?

2390
01:59:35,536 --> 01:59:37,706
- A bit less than 2m.
- A bit less than 2m.

2391
01:59:38,606 --> 01:59:39,676
I think we're about the same height.

2392
01:59:41,016 --> 01:59:42,016
What?

2393
01:59:43,716 --> 01:59:45,385
- I'm...
- How tall are you?

2394
01:59:45,386 --> 01:59:46,956
I think we're about the same height.

2395
01:59:47,586 --> 01:59:48,956
I'm not so sure.

2396
01:59:50,086 --> 01:59:52,656
- How tall are you?
- Tell us.

2397
01:59:52,756 --> 01:59:55,096
Min Kyung is 164cm when she wears her sneakers.

2398
01:59:56,256 --> 01:59:57,325
I remember that clearly.

2399
01:59:57,326 --> 01:59:58,396
- When she's in good condition.
- That's right.

2400
01:59:59,166 --> 02:00:01,696
When I wear shoes, I'm about 168cm tall.

2401
02:00:02,766 --> 02:00:04,505
They became downstairs residents as soon as she came.

2402
02:00:04,506 --> 02:00:05,665
We're Downstairs residents.

2403
02:00:05,666 --> 02:00:06,835
(The women became downstairs residents as soon as Hyeon Ji came.)

2404
02:00:06,836 --> 02:00:08,376
What's your MBTI?

2405
02:00:08,476 --> 02:00:10,406
It's INFP.

2406
02:00:11,176 --> 02:00:12,976
- Really?
- Do we have anyone with the same?

2407
02:00:13,376 --> 02:00:14,376
No.

2408
02:00:14,377 --> 02:00:16,115
I think you're all extroverts.

2409
02:00:16,116 --> 02:00:18,615
- That's right.
- I'm the only introvert.

2410
02:00:18,616 --> 02:00:19,946
I'm an introvert.

2411
02:00:21,316 --> 02:00:22,586
Mine is ISTP.

2412
02:00:26,626 --> 02:00:27,726
I'm an introvert as well.

2413
02:00:31,666 --> 02:00:33,066
It's INTJ.

2414
02:00:45,246 --> 02:00:46,845
Can I go wash my hands?

2415
02:00:46,846 --> 02:00:49,645
Let's go to the washroom together.

2416
02:00:49,646 --> 02:00:52,716
There's a washroom in our room.

2417
02:00:55,756 --> 02:00:57,926
People keep coming one by one.

2418
02:01:00,156 --> 02:01:01,496
I never imagined this.

2419
02:01:02,196 --> 02:01:05,095
It's interesting. There was someone without an ex here,

2420
02:01:05,096 --> 02:01:06,936
but now the person may have.

2421
02:01:07,636 --> 02:01:09,696
There would be one person who got flustered now.

2422
02:01:14,476 --> 02:01:16,636
Right.

2423
02:01:26,646 --> 02:01:28,585
Won Kyu's eyes are shaking.

2424
02:01:28,586 --> 02:01:30,016
My eyes normally shake.

2425
02:01:31,926 --> 02:01:33,326
- That's right.
- That's funny.

2426
02:01:38,426 --> 02:01:40,025
"My eyes normally shake."

2427
02:01:40,026 --> 02:01:41,596
He's a funny character.

2428
02:01:43,636 --> 02:01:44,766
Are you all right, Honey?

2429
02:01:53,816 --> 02:01:56,246
I thought she was Yoo Sik's ex.

2430
02:01:56,846 --> 02:01:58,346
When I went to the chat room,

2431
02:01:58,816 --> 02:02:02,686
the person didn't seem like any of the residents.

2432
02:02:03,786 --> 02:02:07,596
After the new resident came and we talked,

2433
02:02:07,796 --> 02:02:12,366
I thought she might be the person I talked to.

2434
02:02:13,896 --> 02:02:15,466
I was a little...

2435
02:02:17,106 --> 02:02:18,336
concerned.

2436
02:02:22,176 --> 02:02:23,476
My heart is beating.

2437
02:02:24,576 --> 02:02:25,646
Really?

2438
02:02:28,416 --> 02:02:33,316
(Someone's ex that concerned people in many ways arrived.)

2439
02:02:33,416 --> 02:02:36,385
She didn't think it was Min Kyung at all.

2440
02:02:36,386 --> 02:02:37,455
- Right.
- She didn't.

2441
02:02:37,456 --> 02:02:38,755
If she noticed anything at all,

2442
02:02:38,756 --> 02:02:40,525
she wouldn't have talked...

2443
02:02:40,526 --> 02:02:41,526
- so comfortably.
- Right.

2444
02:02:41,526 --> 02:02:42,526
You can't talk like that in bed.

2445
02:02:42,527 --> 02:02:44,065
- Right.
- Right.

2446
02:02:44,066 --> 02:02:45,665
- It's suffocating.
- Things are unraveling.

2447
02:02:45,666 --> 02:02:47,166
It's suffocating to watch.

2448
02:02:47,996 --> 02:02:49,995
- The first day...
- We didn't do that.

2449
02:02:49,996 --> 02:02:51,536
- What?
- Looking around the house.

2450
02:02:51,806 --> 02:02:53,706
We'll show you our room.

2451
02:02:53,806 --> 02:02:57,205
- This is the living room we use.
- Isn't it pretty?

2452
02:02:57,206 --> 02:02:59,775
It's a bit hard coming down here,

2453
02:02:59,776 --> 02:03:02,476
- It's great.
- but it has its merits.

2454
02:03:03,576 --> 02:03:04,616
You must be nervous.

2455
02:03:05,616 --> 02:03:07,815
I feel like my face is going to twitch.

2456
02:03:07,816 --> 02:03:09,615
Really? Why?

2457
02:03:09,616 --> 02:03:12,055
- It's so...
- It would feel different...

2458
02:03:12,056 --> 02:03:14,356
- when you come alone.
- This is our room.

2459
02:03:14,726 --> 02:03:15,926
That startled me.

2460
02:03:16,926 --> 02:03:17,926
This is funny.

2461
02:03:17,927 --> 02:03:20,166
- You can use the one there or here.
- Yes.

2462
02:03:20,496 --> 02:03:21,496
You can use whichever.

2463
02:03:22,496 --> 02:03:24,136
It would be fun staying with us.

2464
02:03:24,766 --> 02:03:26,636
I'm fine with anything.

2465
02:03:26,836 --> 02:03:28,505
(Hyeon Ji became roommates with the upstairs residents,)

2466
02:03:28,506 --> 02:03:30,206
(Min Kyung and Ji Hyeon.)

2467
02:03:33,346 --> 02:03:35,846
(Hyeon Ji's luggage arrived in front of the door.)

2468
02:03:42,116 --> 02:03:43,316
Did her luggage come?

2469
02:03:43,686 --> 02:03:44,856
Tomorrow...

2470
02:03:50,496 --> 02:03:52,866
- Did something come?
- Her suitcase?

2471
02:03:56,136 --> 02:03:57,406
I'm in charge of the suitcases.

2472
02:03:59,936 --> 02:04:01,176
It's me.

2473
02:04:06,776 --> 02:04:08,315
- I'm in charge of the suitcases.
- They're all going.

2474
02:04:08,316 --> 02:04:10,845
- She has the "look at them" look.
- The men are all going out...

2475
02:04:10,846 --> 02:04:13,185
one by one. So Ji Hyeon's expression...

2476
02:04:13,186 --> 02:04:15,756
Ji Hyeon thinks...

2477
02:04:15,856 --> 02:04:18,055
she's Yoo Sik's ex.

2478
02:04:18,056 --> 02:04:19,625
I think she's observing...

2479
02:04:19,626 --> 02:04:20,796
- Right.
- what's between them.

2480
02:04:21,596 --> 02:04:23,525
She would be bothered.

2481
02:04:23,526 --> 02:04:26,695
I think Ji Hyeon is a little interested in Baek Hyun.

2482
02:04:26,696 --> 02:04:27,766
A little.

2483
02:04:30,236 --> 02:04:31,436
I'll help you.

2484
02:04:32,566 --> 02:04:34,005
I'll just do it.

2485
02:04:34,006 --> 02:04:35,405
No. It's really heavy.

2486
02:04:35,406 --> 02:04:36,906
You can put that on top of the suitcase.

2487
02:04:37,306 --> 02:04:38,545
I'll do it.

2488
02:04:38,546 --> 02:04:39,945
No. Hold on.

2489
02:04:39,946 --> 02:04:41,346
Don't lift it.

2490
02:04:55,656 --> 02:04:57,796
- Don't lift this.
- Why?

2491
02:04:57,896 --> 02:05:00,796
- Shall we drag it?
- There are steps.

2492
02:05:01,696 --> 02:05:03,265
You want me to drag it?

2493
02:05:03,266 --> 02:05:05,865
- No.
- Should I not lift it?

2494
02:05:05,866 --> 02:05:08,206
- I'll lift it.
- I'm in charge of the suitcases.

2495
02:05:09,336 --> 02:05:10,476
Hold on.

2496
02:05:18,386 --> 02:05:19,816
You're going to get tired.

2497
02:05:20,716 --> 02:05:22,485
I'm in charge of the suitcases.

2498
02:05:22,486 --> 02:05:24,256
We were in charge.

2499
02:05:24,456 --> 02:05:25,526
Right.

2500
02:05:27,056 --> 02:05:28,726
I guess she really likes pink.

2501
02:05:31,526 --> 02:05:34,096
My things are really heavy. Hold on.

2502
02:05:34,966 --> 02:05:37,366
They're really heavy. Thank you.

2503
02:05:37,466 --> 02:05:39,606
- You're welcome.
- That was our job.

2504
02:05:39,966 --> 02:05:41,676
- Really?
- Yes.

2505
02:05:42,036 --> 02:05:43,705
After Hyeon Ji came,

2506
02:05:43,706 --> 02:05:45,575
- the air in the house changed.
- Yes.

2507
02:05:45,576 --> 02:05:48,875
The women weren't exactly being competitive,

2508
02:05:48,876 --> 02:05:50,816
but they were a bit conscious of each other.

2509
02:05:50,916 --> 02:05:53,185
Right, since they started...

2510
02:05:53,186 --> 02:05:55,955
- to become interested in someone.
- Right.

2511
02:05:55,956 --> 02:05:58,686
Of course, they'd be nervous thinking...

2512
02:05:58,786 --> 02:06:00,525
she could be the ex of the person they're interested in.

2513
02:06:00,526 --> 02:06:02,155
Their ex could also like her.

2514
02:06:02,156 --> 02:06:03,355
That could also happen.

2515
02:06:03,356 --> 02:06:04,695
She's also pretty.

2516
02:06:04,696 --> 02:06:07,136
- Right.
- Her style is very different,

2517
02:06:07,436 --> 02:06:08,565
so I think they would be conscious of her.

2518
02:06:08,566 --> 02:06:10,235
If I were a resident,

2519
02:06:10,236 --> 02:06:14,176
I think I would walk around wearing sunglasses.

2520
02:06:17,476 --> 02:06:19,006
- Are you going to drink wine?
- Yes.

2521
02:06:20,376 --> 02:06:22,275
Shall we play Would You Rather? It's fun.

2522
02:06:22,276 --> 02:06:23,416
- Right?
- Let's play Would You Rather.

2523
02:06:28,386 --> 02:06:29,585
What do we do with this?

2524
02:06:29,586 --> 02:06:31,285
- Do I answer it?
- Yes.

2525
02:06:31,286 --> 02:06:32,286
(He has never played this game.)

2526
02:06:32,287 --> 02:06:35,096
- I mean...
- Don't you ask someone?

2527
02:06:35,856 --> 02:06:37,466
Or else, he would keep picking the questions alone...

2528
02:06:37,666 --> 02:06:39,496
- until it's over.
- Right.

2529
02:06:39,726 --> 02:06:40,936
I almost told you everything about myself.

2530
02:06:43,766 --> 02:06:46,506
(Hyeon Ji begins again.)

2531
02:06:47,606 --> 02:06:49,906
(Exclaiming)

2532
02:06:53,606 --> 02:06:57,246
(They're curious about Hyeon Ji.)

2533
02:07:02,616 --> 02:07:03,616
I'll...

2534
02:07:04,386 --> 02:07:05,986
(She chose Yoo Sik.)

2535
02:07:16,896 --> 02:07:18,836
Would you rather have a lover with many secrets...

2536
02:07:19,166 --> 02:07:21,536
or a lover who tells you everything by the second.

2537
02:07:22,136 --> 02:07:24,046
I would rather have a lover who tells me everything, including TMIs.

2538
02:07:27,646 --> 02:07:30,176
(It's Yoo Sik's turn to ask.)

2539
02:07:31,416 --> 02:07:34,286
(He returns it to Hyeon Ji.)

2540
02:07:41,396 --> 02:07:43,125
Would you rather a person you get drawn to at once...

2541
02:07:43,126 --> 02:07:44,566
or a person you slowly warm up to?

2542
02:07:45,796 --> 02:07:48,466
Someone I get drawn to at once.

2543
02:08:02,176 --> 02:08:05,146
(She gives it to Won Kyu this time.)

2544
02:08:07,116 --> 02:08:08,755
Would you rather have a lover who is popular with the opposite sex...

2545
02:08:08,756 --> 02:08:10,116
or a lover who isn't popular with the opposite sex?

2546
02:08:11,186 --> 02:08:12,586
A lover who isn't popular with the opposite sex.

2547
02:08:16,596 --> 02:08:18,066
You're very strict.

2548
02:08:18,266 --> 02:08:19,325
Do you have a reason?

2549
02:08:19,326 --> 02:08:21,165
Put it down after thinking about it at least a little.

2550
02:08:21,166 --> 02:08:22,535
I have a clear opinion on this.

2551
02:08:22,536 --> 02:08:24,005
- I see.
- Why?

2552
02:08:24,006 --> 02:08:25,835
You don't want your lover to be popular?

2553
02:08:25,836 --> 02:08:27,435
I'm very jealous.

2554
02:08:27,436 --> 02:08:28,976
Really?

2555
02:08:29,706 --> 02:08:32,606
If your lover is popular, doesn't that mean she's charming?

2556
02:08:32,776 --> 02:08:34,146
Even if she isn't,

2557
02:08:34,316 --> 02:08:36,316
I would think she's charming.

2558
02:08:36,676 --> 02:08:37,946
I see.

2559
02:08:45,126 --> 02:08:46,256
That's a twist.

2560
02:09:01,576 --> 02:09:03,735
(How was your 3rd day since moving in?)

2561
02:09:03,736 --> 02:09:06,276
(Who made your heart flutter today?)

2562
02:09:08,146 --> 02:09:11,115
(The person...)

2563
02:09:11,116 --> 02:09:14,416
(who made my heart flutter today)

2564
02:09:15,886 --> 02:09:18,655
(They write their honest feelings...)

2565
02:09:18,656 --> 02:09:23,526
(after much thought.)

2566
02:09:31,536 --> 02:09:35,806
(Where did everyone's hearts go?)

2567
02:09:35,936 --> 02:09:38,175
Did Yoo Sik pick Ji Hyeon or Hyeon Ji?

2568
02:09:38,176 --> 02:09:39,805
- I think Hyeon Ji.
- Hyeon Ji?

2569
02:09:39,806 --> 02:09:42,246
- The new face?
- Hyeon Ji's impression was strong.

2570
02:09:42,316 --> 02:09:44,386
Won Kyu might pick Min Kyung.

2571
02:09:44,516 --> 02:09:45,516
I'm not sure about that.

2572
02:09:45,517 --> 02:09:48,816
It's hard because she took care of his scar on the neck.

2573
02:09:48,956 --> 02:09:50,885
- Would that make a huge impact?
- That as well,

2574
02:09:50,886 --> 02:09:53,555
but Ji Yeon also said, "Let's hang out tomorrow."

2575
02:09:53,556 --> 02:09:55,395
- Me too.
- That was strong.

2576
02:09:55,396 --> 02:09:58,096
So Won Kyu will be hanging out with her tomorrow.

2577
02:09:58,126 --> 02:10:00,425
- They have to hang out tomorrow.
- They had a date today.

2578
02:10:00,426 --> 02:10:02,895
There are those who make your heart flutter and those you appreciate.

2579
02:10:02,896 --> 02:10:04,335
They're divided.

2580
02:10:04,336 --> 02:10:06,365
This asks, "Who made your heart flutter today?"

2581
02:10:06,366 --> 02:10:08,706
I think Ji Yeon made his heart flutter.

2582
02:10:08,776 --> 02:10:12,675
Would his heart change because Yun Nyeong...

2583
02:10:12,676 --> 02:10:14,575
- He was always around her.
- took care of his scar?

2584
02:10:14,576 --> 02:10:15,815
Maybe, if she applied the ointment herself,

2585
02:10:15,816 --> 02:10:17,545
but Yoo Sik was the one who applied it.

2586
02:10:17,546 --> 02:10:18,585
Right.

2587
02:10:18,586 --> 02:10:21,915
- Right.
- I think he had a change of heart,

2588
02:10:21,916 --> 02:10:23,285
but it wasn't to the point...

2589
02:10:23,286 --> 02:10:24,425
- of making him send the text.
- Right.

2590
02:10:24,426 --> 02:10:25,925
- Right.
- There would have been...

2591
02:10:25,926 --> 02:10:27,156
an earthquake here.

2592
02:10:28,496 --> 02:10:30,126
- Shall we clink our glasses?
- Yes.

2593
02:10:30,526 --> 02:10:31,526
When I say,

2594
02:10:32,326 --> 02:10:35,996
"Drink your fill without overdoing it,"

2595
02:10:36,366 --> 02:10:39,336
you can say, "DFO" and clink your glasses.

2596
02:10:41,506 --> 02:10:43,475
Okay. You all raised your glasses, right?

2597
02:10:43,476 --> 02:10:44,505
- Yes.
- Yes.

2598
02:10:44,506 --> 02:10:47,645
Drink your fill without overdoing it.

2599
02:10:47,646 --> 02:10:49,576
- DFO!
- DFO!

2600
02:11:02,596 --> 02:11:04,566
I'm curious about her introduction from her ex.

2601
02:11:05,296 --> 02:11:06,525
Did you all do it?

2602
02:11:06,526 --> 02:11:07,795
- On the first day.
- On the first day.

2603
02:11:07,796 --> 02:11:09,036
I see.

2604
02:11:09,296 --> 02:11:10,805
Did you cry after seeing it?

2605
02:11:10,806 --> 02:11:12,265
Did anyone cry?

2606
02:11:12,266 --> 02:11:14,136
I think everyone cried except one person.

2607
02:11:14,536 --> 02:11:15,806
- Really?
- Yes.

2608
02:11:16,736 --> 02:11:17,976
Who is that person?

2609
02:11:18,446 --> 02:11:19,676
No comment.

2610
02:11:23,316 --> 02:11:24,486
No comment.

2611
02:11:30,456 --> 02:11:33,426
I could guess who it was.

2612
02:11:35,096 --> 02:11:36,396
I think it was my ex.

2613
02:11:45,606 --> 02:11:48,735
I can't memorize your names yet.

2614
02:11:48,736 --> 02:11:49,876
I'm Won Kyu.

2615
02:11:50,136 --> 02:11:51,806
- Won Kyu.
- Yes.

2616
02:11:51,946 --> 02:11:54,575
I know the names of all the women.

2617
02:11:54,576 --> 02:11:56,275
- Really?
- Yes.

2618
02:11:56,276 --> 02:11:58,185
(He received a text from Hyeon Ji, his date today.)

2619
02:11:58,186 --> 02:12:00,385
- Yun.
- Yun Nyeong.

2620
02:12:00,386 --> 02:12:01,786
Yes. It's hard, right?

2621
02:12:02,116 --> 02:12:06,126
I thought I was randomly matched with her.

2622
02:12:07,426 --> 02:12:10,126
She may have not sent it out of interest.

2623
02:12:11,696 --> 02:12:13,226
But it still felt good.

2624
02:12:18,266 --> 02:12:20,506
(Won Kyu)

2625
02:12:22,276 --> 02:12:24,376
(Don't cry.)

2626
02:12:28,346 --> 02:12:31,616
(He received texts from two people.)

2627
02:12:32,286 --> 02:12:33,546
(Blinking)

2628
02:12:37,856 --> 02:12:41,555
I sent him a text saying, "Don't cry..."

2629
02:12:41,556 --> 02:12:43,226
to comfort him.

2630
02:12:43,796 --> 02:12:46,996
I thought I really shouldn't cry.

2631
02:12:47,836 --> 02:12:50,266
I think my heart is fluttering a bit.

2632
02:12:54,876 --> 02:12:57,076
(Woo Jin)

2633
02:12:57,846 --> 02:13:00,846
(Your ex did not pick you.)

2634
02:13:01,746 --> 02:13:04,146
(Ji Yeon)

2635
02:13:04,946 --> 02:13:07,716
(Your ex did not pick you.)

2636
02:13:13,386 --> 02:13:17,096
(Ji Hyeon)

2637
02:13:19,126 --> 02:13:22,866
(A single text makes her think a lot.)

2638
02:13:25,206 --> 02:13:28,276
(Ji Hyeon)

2639
02:13:28,706 --> 02:13:31,176
(Let's play bowling next time.)

2640
02:13:32,846 --> 02:13:34,676
Yoo Sik sent me a text.

2641
02:13:36,376 --> 02:13:39,246
(She received a text from Yoo Sik two days in a row.)

2642
02:13:39,816 --> 02:13:41,086
My heart really fluttered.

2643
02:13:45,186 --> 02:13:46,426
DFO.

2644
02:13:55,266 --> 02:13:56,735
This is so nice.

2645
02:13:56,736 --> 02:13:58,505
- The expression.
- The DFO that breaks the silence.

2646
02:13:58,506 --> 02:14:00,035
She had an upset look, and she immediately...

2647
02:14:00,036 --> 02:14:01,705
It's so obvious she's in a good mood.

2648
02:14:01,706 --> 02:14:04,446
This DFO meant, "It's fine now."

2649
02:14:08,246 --> 02:14:11,786
(She's feeling great.)

2650
02:14:18,626 --> 02:14:21,526
(Your ex did not pick you.)

2651
02:14:22,026 --> 02:14:25,026
No one here drinks that well.

2652
02:14:29,396 --> 02:14:31,206
Even yesterday...

2653
02:14:31,606 --> 02:14:33,736
We're drinking every day.

2654
02:14:35,706 --> 02:14:37,005
(Min Kyung)

2655
02:14:37,006 --> 02:14:38,206
Do you drink well?

2656
02:14:39,246 --> 02:14:40,306
One bottle.

2657
02:14:40,406 --> 02:14:43,476
(Your ex did not pick you.)

2658
02:14:45,446 --> 02:14:49,016
(Their hearts are still mismatched.)

2659
02:14:50,216 --> 02:14:56,026
(Hyeon Ji)

2660
02:14:56,456 --> 02:14:59,496
(Your ex did not pick you.)

2661
02:15:08,176 --> 02:15:09,976
My ex...

2662
02:15:15,416 --> 02:15:19,286
I don't know what feeling this is.

2663
02:15:19,546 --> 02:15:23,316
I thought, "This isn't nice."

2664
02:15:23,856 --> 02:15:25,656
"It's my first day here."

2665
02:15:28,926 --> 02:15:32,225
(She feels troubled...)

2666
02:15:32,226 --> 02:15:35,236
(because she didn't get a text from her ex.)

2667
02:15:37,096 --> 02:15:40,565
I think Hyeon Ji is more upset about not getting a text...

2668
02:15:40,566 --> 02:15:43,175
from her ex more than Yoo Sik who she dated with today.

2669
02:15:43,176 --> 02:15:44,905
- It's not lingering feelings.
- A disappointed feeling.

2670
02:15:44,906 --> 02:15:46,575
- She's disappointed.
- She's disappointed.

2671
02:15:46,576 --> 02:15:47,605
He could have sent her...

2672
02:15:47,606 --> 02:15:48,815
- a text welcoming her.
- Right.

2673
02:15:48,816 --> 02:15:50,715
- "Let's get along." - "Let's get along."

2674
02:15:50,716 --> 02:15:52,616
- "Let's do our best." - "Good luck."

2675
02:15:53,446 --> 02:15:56,086
Would you rather date a person who dated ten times in a year...

2676
02:15:56,586 --> 02:15:57,926
or a person who had one long-term relationship?

2677
02:15:58,326 --> 02:15:59,526
I'd rather date a person who had one long-term relationship.

2678
02:16:05,626 --> 02:16:06,826
Ten relationships in a year?

2679
02:16:07,426 --> 02:16:08,636
You're changing them every month.

2680
02:16:08,936 --> 02:16:10,296
With two months of holiday.

2681
02:16:10,866 --> 02:16:11,866
Two months.

2682
02:16:11,867 --> 02:16:14,036
Including the time when they get to know each other.

2683
02:16:14,336 --> 02:16:15,876
How many days do they spend to get to know each other?

2684
02:16:17,176 --> 02:16:18,276
It's funny.

2685
02:16:19,076 --> 02:16:20,176
Is there more?

2686
02:16:20,346 --> 02:16:22,745
- You're a little red.
- I think you're a little red.

2687
02:16:22,746 --> 02:16:23,816
(Yun Nyeong)

2688
02:16:24,546 --> 02:16:27,956
(Jean-Michel Basquiat)

2689
02:16:30,416 --> 02:16:37,326
(Baek Hyun's heart headed to Yun Nyeong today.)

2690
02:16:39,526 --> 02:16:45,136
(Baek Hyun)

2691
02:16:45,606 --> 02:16:47,405
(I had so much fun playing bowling today.)

2692
02:16:47,406 --> 02:16:49,606
(I laughed the whole day thanks to you. Sleep well tonight!)

2693
02:16:50,176 --> 02:16:53,046
She smiled very brightly when we played bowling.

2694
02:16:53,546 --> 02:16:55,276
I think she felt thankful.

2695
02:16:56,676 --> 02:16:57,916
Today?

2696
02:16:58,016 --> 02:16:59,545
Right.

2697
02:16:59,546 --> 02:17:00,985
(The person who played bowling with Baek Hyun today.)

2698
02:17:00,986 --> 02:17:02,286
It's so funny.

2699
02:17:02,986 --> 02:17:05,685
- The two...
- The people who played bowling.

2700
02:17:05,686 --> 02:17:06,955
- They became best friends.
- Really?

2701
02:17:06,956 --> 02:17:08,656
- Like this?
- We became best friends.

2702
02:17:09,996 --> 02:17:12,766
I'll also break a rule.

2703
02:17:14,296 --> 02:17:19,966
(The person who sent the text to Baek Hyun was...)

2704
02:17:21,576 --> 02:17:25,106
"I laughed the whole day thanks to you. Thank you."

2705
02:17:26,176 --> 02:17:30,476
(Ji Hyeon sent him the text.)

2706
02:17:31,286 --> 02:17:33,745
I thought Yoo Sik's ex...

2707
02:17:33,746 --> 02:17:35,786
was the new resident.

2708
02:17:36,456 --> 02:17:39,586
It looked like his heart was shaking as soon as she came.

2709
02:17:39,856 --> 02:17:41,396
I felt bad because of that.

2710
02:17:43,956 --> 02:17:47,366
I think my heart swayed.

2711
02:17:49,436 --> 02:17:51,165
(Ji Hyeon's heart...)

2712
02:17:51,166 --> 02:17:54,736
(headed to Baek Hyun today.)

2713
02:17:56,706 --> 02:17:57,806
I'll go.

2714
02:17:59,676 --> 02:18:02,716
(Your ex did not pick you.)

2715
02:18:02,816 --> 02:18:04,786
There are some bananas too. Would you like some?

2716
02:18:04,886 --> 02:18:06,086
Right. We bought bananas.

2717
02:18:07,016 --> 02:18:08,485
It's here. The chopped ones.

2718
02:18:08,486 --> 02:18:10,816
Are you going to eat it?

2719
02:18:10,856 --> 02:18:12,586
- No. I'm fine.
- So...

2720
02:18:12,856 --> 02:18:14,926
We bought it on the first day, and that's still here.

2721
02:18:15,726 --> 02:18:16,825
Did you buy more?

2722
02:18:16,826 --> 02:18:18,326
- I didn't.
- Cheese?

2723
02:18:18,466 --> 02:18:19,795
- Cheese?
- Cheese.

2724
02:18:19,796 --> 02:18:20,966
This is good.

2725
02:18:39,386 --> 02:18:43,856
(EXchange 4)

2726
02:18:44,286 --> 02:18:47,386
My ex was very calm,

2727
02:18:47,486 --> 02:18:49,056
and he was good at pretending he didn't know me.

2728
02:18:49,326 --> 02:18:52,026
It didn't feel so nice.

2729
02:18:52,466 --> 02:18:54,226
I'll go inside.

2730
02:18:54,796 --> 02:18:55,896
See you upstairs.

2731
02:18:56,436 --> 02:18:58,635
(It's a troubled night for someone.)

2732
02:18:58,636 --> 02:19:00,606
(It's an exciting night for someone.)

2733
02:19:02,276 --> 02:19:04,376
I'm sure you have the most fun when you hang out with me.

2734
02:19:05,946 --> 02:19:07,006
Look at your confidence.

2735
02:19:07,306 --> 02:19:08,345
That's what's going to happen.

2736
02:19:08,346 --> 02:19:11,045
If you see your ex...

2737
02:19:11,046 --> 02:19:13,246
doing well with someone right in front of your eyes.

2738
02:19:13,516 --> 02:19:15,416
- I'll support them.
- Really?

2739
02:19:15,716 --> 02:19:17,016
But she should support me too.

2740
02:19:18,286 --> 02:19:19,526
I'll go my way.

2741
02:19:20,586 --> 02:19:22,895
Before coming back,

2742
02:19:22,896 --> 02:19:25,796
I had a date with Yoo Sik.

2743
02:19:25,926 --> 02:19:27,096
How did that happen?

2744
02:19:27,696 --> 02:19:31,236
(She faces the date of her ex.)

2745
02:19:31,766 --> 02:19:34,235
I think he's doing the best here.

2746
02:19:34,236 --> 02:19:37,876
Can we talk for a bit downstairs?

2747
02:19:38,176 --> 02:19:40,706
I think the strongest emotion I had was anger.

2748
02:19:40,906 --> 02:19:43,776
You're acting like you're really fine.

2749
02:19:44,146 --> 02:19:47,046
That didn't make me feel so great.
